By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Netflix, which financial analysts have crowned the undisputed subscription-streaming leader, kicks off the media and entertainment sector’s Q1 earnings this week. Wall Street anticipates that Netflix will report strong results for the period — the first quarter it will no longer disclose subscriber counts — and that the company is relatively well positioned to withstand economic headwinds. Netflix is scheduled to report Q1 2025 results Thursday, April 17, after market close. Wall Street consensus estimates are for quarterly revenue to come in at $10.51 billion (up 12% year over year) with earnings per share of $5.66 (up 7%), according to LSEG Data & Analytics. That’s slightly above the company’s previous guidance for revenue of $10.42 billion and EPS of $5.58. Related Stories VIP+ Sports Rights: Streamers vs. TV Networks – A Special Report South Korean Animation 'The Square' to Close Far East Film Festival - Global Bulletin “Given macro volatility, we view Netflix as arguably the most defensive stock in our coverage universe amid any broader slowdown,” TD Cowen analysts led by John Blackledge said in an April 8 research note. Popular on Variety For starters, Netflix will not face any significant direct impact from the Trump administration’s tariffs. The TD Cowen analysts also cited “robust underlying biz demand from increasingly global content slate,” Netflix’s strong value proposition especially relative to out-of-home entertainment options, and continued “secular adoption of streaming video.” TD Cowen has a “buy” rating on Netflix with a 12-month price target of $1,150/share. So far in 2025, Netflix shares have outperformed the broader market: The stock is up more than 7% year to date, compared with a decline of more than 10% for the S&P 500 index amid President Trump’s tariff announcements and escalating trade war with China. Seaport Research Partners equity analyst David Joyce similarly noted that Netflix is “one of the cheapest forms of entertainment on a per-hour engagement basis. “Generally speaking, what makes NFLX (and other streamers, of course) a defensive stay-cation alternative if we enter a recession is that it is likely to be one of the last expenditures cut from a consumer’s budget,” Joyce wrote in an April 14 note. The monthly price of Netflix premium service in the U.S. costs as much as “a single Imax ticket in major markets for 2 hours, or one-fifth of the average price of a single Live Nation ticket for a 2-hour event — not to mention comparing to pro sports events or theme parks,” he added. Joyce rates Netflix a “buy” with a $1,025/share 12-month price target. As Netflix announced last year, beginning with the first quarter of 2025 it will stop reporting paid subscriber numbers and average revenue per member (ARM) on a regular quarterly basis, saying those aren’t as meaningful as user engagement or financial metrics like revenue and operating margin. (Netflix says it “will continue to announce paid memberships as we cross key milestones.”) For Q4 of 2024, Netflix reported 18.9 million net new global subscribers — around twice analyst expectations — to reach 301.6 million at year-end. With the decision to no longer report subscriber figures, “Netflix is now free to focus solely on revenue growth,” Wedbush Securities analyst Alicia Reese wrote in an April 11 note. The company in January implemented price hikes across all tiers in the U.S. and other countries; even if that results in subscriber cancellations Netflix can “obscure subscriber churn and trade-downs while showing meaningful revenue growth.” In the absence of subscriber figures, TD Cowen’s Blackledge expects investors to look for updates around Netflix’s “burgeoning ad tier.” Netflix plans to launch first-party advertising tech stack in the U.S. in April after rolling it out in Canada, and “we’ll look for color around potential timing of the remaining 10 ad markets later in 2025,” Blackledge wrote. Netflix earlier this year raised its 2025 outlook for revenue to be between $43.5 billion and $44.5 billion (up $500 million from its prior forecast) and for operating margin to be 29%, up one percentage point from its previous guidance. With $18 billion in content spending forecast for 2025, “there is meaningful upside potential to Netflix’s 2025 guidance,” Wedbush’s Reese wrote. VIP+ Analysis: Should Netflix Rivals Imitate Its Choice to Hold Back Subscriber Numbers? For 2025, the company has touted the return of three of its biggest TV shows — “Squid Game,” “Wednesday” and “Stranger Things” — and said it plans to “grow into new areas like live programming and games.” Of note, Netflix began streaming WWE “Monday Night Raw” exclusively in the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and Latin America on a weekly basis in January 2025. It also will reprise its NFL double-header on Christmas Day 2025. “Netflix is positioned to accelerate ad-tier revenue contribution for the next several years by adding more live events, improving its advertising solutions and targeting, and broadening its content strategy,” Reese wrote. The analyst maintains an “outperform” rating on Netflix with a $1,150/share 12-month price target, reflecting a P/E multiple of 34X on Wedbush’s 2027 EPS estimate. Meanwhile, according to TD Cowen’s monthly survey of 2,500 U.S. consumers, Netflix continues to be the most popular way to watch video content in the living room. Asked which platform consumers use most often to view video content on their TV, Netflix retained the top spot in February 2025 with 25% of respondents, followed by YouTube (15%) and basic cable (10%). “We think Netflix’s broad catalog across multiple genres creates a durable advantage over time,” Blackledge wrote.

Title: Bieber Crisis of Faith?

Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter A bitter management shake-up. Angry public outbursts. A “narcissistic” pastor whose word is gospel. What in God’s name is happening to the once-mighty pop icon? “Whatever he’s going through, I pray for him” a longtime collaborator says. By Shirley Halperin For the millions around the world wondering what Justin Bieber has been up to these past few years — since music seemingly took a back seat to his life as a full-time husband (he married Hailey Baldwin in 2018) and father (son Jack Blues was born in August) — it may be surprising to learn that the pop sensation did release something new this month. On April 3, the 31-year-old revealed his fashion brand, Skylrk, with a video directed by 3D artist Gal Yosef that shows an animated Bieber riding an electric scooter to a house that he then promptly burns. Strewn about inside are relics of his past life, including the smiley face logo of the Drew House clothing line he started in 2019 with former friend Ryan Good (Drew is Bieber’s middle name); outside, waiting while the residence goes up in flames, is his wife with a stroller. The two kiss and walk toward the setting sun holding hands, never turning back. Related Stories News Hailee Steinfeld Reveals Why She Took a "Bit of a Break From Music" News Fyre Festival 2 Postponed and No New Date Announced That Bieber chose a scooter running out of power as a visual element was presumably no coincidence. Scott “Scooter” Braun, the manager who discovered the Canadian talent through a YouTube video in 2008, has been a constant presence in Bieber’s life from age 13 through adulthood. During their 15 years together, Bieber launched into the pop stratosphere, becoming one of the most popular artists on the planet, today boasting more than 78 million monthly listeners on Spotify, where 17 of his songs — or songs he’s been featured on — have each amassed over a billion streams. Bieber’s rise was the stuff of fairy tales. Reality, as it turns out, is a much more complicated story that’s rooted in questions of loyalty, wealth and health.Indeed, Bieber has been torching his past in ways that aren’t just metaphorical. Professionally, he separated from his longtime team last summer, joining a number of uber-successful musicians who self-manage, like Taylor Swift, Bruno Mars and Morgan Wallen. In taking the lead on his business affairs, the singer has enlisted a tight-knit crew of compatriots who share his resolve to chart a new direction. Many in his inner circle also share his faith, ascribing to the beliefs of Churchome, a nondenominational Christian community with an outpost in Beverly Hills that is run by 44-year-old pastor Judah Smith, who also serves as a spiritual adviser to Bieber. In recent months, Bieber has been giving glimpses into his new life on social media, but whereas usually what someone presents on Instagram is the best version of themselves — the most flattering angle, an idyllic backdrop, just the right filter and, of course, the caption conveying a life lived to its fullest — some of Bieber’s posts have been more cryptic. “I think I hate myself sometimes when I feel myself start to become inauthentic. Then I remember we’re all being made to think we’re not enough but I still hate when I change myself to please people,” Bieber shared with his 294 million Instagram followers on March 22. That same day, he wrote, “I got anger issues, too,” adding that he wanted to “grow and not react so much.” In other posts, Bieber shared feeling “unworthy,” like he’s “drowning and unsafe.” Further down the scroll are visuals of a hollow-eyed Bieber brazenly smoking a blunt and rapping about getting high. Recent photos of Bieber out and about show him looking gaunt and disappearing into his clothes. Off social media, he’s also displayed some questionable behavior. At the Super Bowl, Bieber was seen dancing atop a VIP suite sofa shirtless and barefoot, bewildering nearby spectators. And just last week, Bieber had a testy exchange outside a Palm Springs coffee shop, chastising a group of paparazzi: “All you care about is money, not human beings.” For an artist whose music has lived under such hopeful banners as Purpose (the name of his fourth album) and Never Say Never (the title of his Jon Chu-directed 2011 documentary), the contrast was noticeably jarring for fans and casual observers alike (YouTube houses dozens of user-generated “What’s Going on With Justin Bieber?” commentary videos). The prevailing sentiment is that he is struggling. (Bieber’s reps refute this characterization.) Concern for Bieber’s well-being turned into a full-on public discourse when, in January, he unfollowed a number of his former friends and associates — including Braun and deputy Allison Kaye (who, after running point on all things Bieber for the better part of two decades, resigned in January), Good (who was the best man at his wedding) and longtime security chief Kenny Hamilton (who shielded him from music industry vultures, bad actors and others, like accused sex trafficker Diddy, according to multiple people present at the time), among others.Now, former friends and ex-associates excised from his world, along with musical collaborators, his record company and, of course, his fans, are coming to terms with a new chapter in the book of Bieber. And some are questioning the choices he’s making. “Whatever he’s going through, I pray for him and hope he’s OK,” says former Bieber collaborator Poo Bear, who co-wrote some of his biggest hits, including Billboard No. 1s “Despacito,” “I’m the One,” “Where Are Ü Now” and “What Do You Mean?” “Seeing him disintegrate like this … it’s watching the embodiment of someone not living their purpose,” says one ex team member. “He’s lost. There’s no one protecting him because there’s no one there willing to say no to him. You say no, you get blown out.” Mario Lavandeira, better known as Perez Hilton, who has been obsessively following Bieber’s every post, posits to The Hollywood Reporter, “Justin Bieber is like a male Britney Spears: He’s trolling, partly because he wants attention, and also because he thinks he’s so funny.” (In an April 10 Instagram story, Bieber joked of Stevie Wonder, “This fool never sees my FaceTimes.”) To that end, a source close to the singer offers that Bieber is just doing as media-savvy pop stars do. “Artists are artists — they don’t look at the world the way you and I do,” says the insider, who laughs off the notion that Bieber is in distress. “He’s healthier than all of us — physically and mentally.” “He’s managing himself through his own family office now, and there’s skepticism on if he can do it alone,” says Chris Anokute, a veteran music executive who’s worked extensively with Katy Perry. “He’s leaving home for the first time. He’s building a business without the team that took him here. I’m sure he’s feeling that pressure. But he can [do it]. At the end of the day, Justin Bieber is a star, and consumers still want Justin Bieber. … He’s showing a lot of courage and foresight on what the industry is going to look like in the future.” *** Although Bieber long ago shed his teen heartthrob image, trading his staple swoop hair for a buzz cut and covering his body in tattoos, his carefully curated ascent has always given a sense of wholesomeness. Despite his ink, which includes a cross on his chest, an image of Christ on his leg, scriptures on his arm and the name Jesus in Hebrew on his rib cage, he was never a purity ring guy, à la the Jonas Brothers. But starting out at age 15, when legions of very young fans anointed him a role model, Bieber has been leaning into this good-guy ethos, carefully guided by his former management team, led by Braun (who declined to speak for this story), which heavily promoted Bieber’s philanthropy as part of his image (via Make-A-Wish, where he’s been among the most requested celebrities for many years running, and by donating a dollar of each concert ticket sold to a charity). After all, what kid plucked from obscurity and handed fame and fortune wouldn’t feel grateful to those who cheered him on? Still, there’s a feeling that his former managers may have “protected him too much,” to the detriment of his personal growth as a kid learning from his mistakes, several ex team members share. There had been instances of questionable behavior in the past; in his younger days, Bieber had a number of police altercations, including a 2014 arrest for DUI in Miami and a vandalism charge in Calabasas that same year. But Braun’s team was always there to smooth the young star’s path, in ways big and small, swooping in to delete embarrassing tweets and videos when necessary.“He never felt the consequence of his actions because we were so worried about the illusion of Justin Bieber being ruined,” offers an insider. “It wouldn’t have ended his career. He would have felt the sting, though.” In their efforts to keep the artist happy, there was finger-pointing when things didn’t go Bieber’s way, sources reveal, especially concerning matters like budgets. Discussions about complicated music matters like song splits or creative decisions on ancillary projects could get tense, and Bieber, says a confidant, “doesn’t like conflict or drama.” At the same time, Bieber wants to give of himself. “Justin is an exceptionally generous person,” adds the insider. “He doesn’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings or get into arguments.” In fact, Bieber long ago instituted a team-wide directive: No talk of business after 6 p.m. Running the show as of fall 2022 is Will Bracey, a former tour manager for Fifth Harmony whose title is Chief Operating Officer at “The Office of Mr. Justin Bieber,” according to his email signature. The press-averse Bracey, who declined to speak for this article, is described as a sort of consigliere to Bieber by several people who’ve interacted with him. “He’s running the logistics and operations in service of the family,” says one source, who distinguishes Bracey as “operating at a very high level” but also describes him as not a typical music biz bro. Adds the insider: “He’s diligent and hardworking. He cares about Justin as a person.” Another describes Bracey, who is engaged to Fifth Harmony alum Ally Brooke, as “obsessive” about Bieber. “He’s protective of people knowing about his closeness with Justin, but then he’s always talking about Justin and about ‘being at his service,’ ” adds the source. Bracey worked under Braun on Bieber’s ill-fated Justice world tour in 2022, which was plagued from the get-go. The pandemic delayed its start by nearly two years, and four months after it finally kicked off in February, Bieber was diagnosed with a rare facial paralysis disease called Type 2 Ramsay Hunt syndrome and had to take several weeks off. By September, after completing around 45 concert dates, he pulled the plug on the rest of the Justice outing — a year’s worth of shows in the Far East, South America, Australasia, the Middle East and Europe. Sources say that his management — Braun and Kaye at the time — advised against canceling, noting that the tour’s routing, which was designed to include off days and buffers like weeklong breaks (during which the Biebers could work in luxe vacations), was the lightest lift possible. But Bieber wanted to get off the road to be with Hailey, according to people privy to his decision-making at the time. That meant forgoing the estimated $90 million he would have netted from the tour and laying off more than 100 crewmembers (many still recovering from the work stoppage of COVID). God’s got his back, Bieber intimated of his decision, say multiple people involved with the tour. “Can’t argue with God,” his handlers conceded. In September 2022, Bieber announced: “This past weekend, I … gave everything I have to the people in Brazil. After getting off the stage, the exhaustion overtook me and I realized that I need to make my health the priority right now. So I’m going to take a break from touring for the time being. I’m going to be OK, but I need time to rest and get better.” The decision to “pull down” the remaining Justice dates brought Bieber’s mental health to the forefront. Though his struggles with substance abuse (from which he recovered) were well documented — revealed in painful detail via Bieber’s 2020 10-part YouTube Originals docuseries, Seasons — the public pronouncement of exhaustion had fans expressing worry and the industry wondering whether he’s fit for the grueling demands of touring. The Justice cancellation also triggered a series of financial consequences that are still plaguing the artist today. In not fulfilling his contractual obligation to AEG (the tour’s promoter) and completing the concert dates, for which he received a $40 million advance, he was left owing a large debt to AEG (insiders claim more than $20 million). According to sources, then-manager Braun, through his company, covered what was owed in the form of a loan at a highly favorable (to Bieber) rate. To date, Bieber has only returned a portion of what he borrowed. While one might think that Bieber, who sat at the top of the pop heap for the better part of the 2010s, would be flush with cash, multiple insiders, who until recently were familiar with his finances, suggest he’s overstretched — real estate purchases and renovations (he owns six homes, including a $26 million estate in Beverly Hills’ exclusive Beverly Park neighborhood, a $16 million home in La Quinta, and a property in the tony Gozzer Ranch Golf and Lake Club in Idaho, where the Kardashian-Jenners are known to holiday) and destination vacations with friends are particularly taxing — even on the heels of a $200 million deal for the publishing rights to his catalog, executed in January 2023. (Bieber’s reps vigorously deny the assertion, telling THR, “Any source that is trying to sell you a story about alleged financial distress … either doesn’t understand the entertainment industry or, more likely, is trying to paint an unflattering portrait of Justin, which bears no resemblance to reality.”) The sale of some 290 songs, his entire pre-2021 catalog, to Hipgnosis Songs — among them Bieber’s portion of writing credits on “Sorry,” “Holy” and “Ghost” — was seen as a major win for an artist who was only 29 at the time. That is especially true given that Bieber has relied on collaborators for his biggest hits, splitting rights with as many as 11 people on 2021’s “Peaches” (which also holds the distinction of setting a Grammy record for the most songwriters on a song of the year nomination). Though his publishing share was enough to draw a steady stream of “mailbox money,” as royalties are known colloquially — to the tune of millions in annual earnings — sources say Bieber was keen on selling, trading those regular payments for a lump sum. The publishing assets were appraised at a value of $140 million at the time, but Bieber’s team, which then included Braun, attorney Michael Rhodes and business manager Lou Taylor, was able to get the price up by $60 million. The deal was geared toward putting Bieber in a position of financial security that would last him for quite some time — one person describes it as “the largest nest egg in music history” for what is ostensibly fractions of a song — and it may be one of the last catalog sales to command a price north of $200 million. Late rapper Biggie Smalls’ songs, which include some of the most sampled beats and melodies in hip-hop, went for half that amount when Primary Wave purchased his publishing and publicity rights in March. Before the catalog gold rush, which opened the door to monster deals like Bruce Springsteen’s $500 million sale of his recordings and publishing to Sony Music in 2021, “these asset sales were normally distressed sellers — people that had tax problems, divorces, or got to a point in their age where their health was failing them and limiting other income streams such as live [shows],” explains Hipgnosis founder Merck Mercuriadis, who helped propel the “song management” market and worked on the Bieber deal. “Making millions of dollars a year versus somewhere around 15 times that amount up front is not the same freedom. With the money up front, you’re free to plan in a way where you don’t have to be beholden to anyone else. You don’t necessarily have to go on tour or make another record, if that’s not how you want to spend the next few years. You can then afford to take some risks on yourself. … For Justin, I think that was the motivation: He had ill health and was at a time in his life where he was married and very in love and contemplating family. Making the deal gave him the freedom to focus on that and not have to be on the treadmill he’d been on for almost 15 years.” “I think it was smart,” says Anokute of the sale, which valued Bieber’s share of each song at around $600,000. “With AI, I don’t know what the value of a catalog will be in the future. Anyone frowning at making a quarter-billion dollars on music that you made before the age of 30 is a fool. He sold that music, and he has another 10 to 20 years ahead of him where he could own everything.” (It’s worth noting that Hailey Bieber is herself a successful model and entrepreneur who launched her own skin-care line, Rhode — her middle name — in 2022, and is reportedly exploring a sale.) Smart or not, the deal also opened a rift between Bieber and Braun, with the former said to be resentful of the latter’s ballooning wealth. In fact, the tension had been building for some time. Although widely credited with launching Bieber’s career as a teen phenom (with the backing of Usher), Braun’s Svengali-like guidance drew some ire from the general public, and even more so in recent years as struggles unique to child stars have been exposed in the media. Bieber himself made reference to the pressures on young performers in a teary interview with Apple Music’s Zane Lowe in 2020. Speaking of Billie Eilish, who was then 18, Bieber said, “I just want to protect her,” adding, “It was hard for me being that young and being in the industry and not knowing where to turn, and everyone telling me they loved me, and turning their back on you in a second.” There’s little doubt that Braun is a savvy mogul. He was an early investor in Spotify, Uber and Waze, all the while guiding the careers of artists across the musical spectrum, from Ariana Grande to J Balvin to Demi Lovato. But with Bieber, Braun accomplished something truly rare in the music industry: growing a pop career into adulthood with a string of hit singles, two documentaries and 23 Grammy nominations (and two wins). Today, Bieber ranks among the five most-followed celebrities in social media (alongside Swift, Grande and ex-girlfriend Selena Gomez). But as Braun’s own stature in the entertainment industry was rising, with TV and film projects added to his portfolio (as an executive producer on the hit series Dave and the Balvin documentary The Boy From Medellín, and a partner with Marvel founding chairman David Maisel in Mythos Studios), he’s also stumbled into some PR snafus of his own, like his feud with Swift over the ownership of her catalog, which Braun’s Ithaca Holdings purchased in 2019 in a deal for Swift’s Nashville-based label, Big Machine, for a reported $300 million. In the minds of millions of Swifties, Braun was the greedy bad guy who had “bullied” the singer out of the chance of owning her own music. (Both parties ultimately came out ahead. A year and change after purchasing the Swift catalog, Braun sold those rights to a private equity firm for a reported $405 million, a profit of over $250 million. For her part, Swift resolved — and delivered— to rerecord and re-release her earlier albums with the amended title “Taylor’s Version.” Her reenergized base prompted monster streaming numbers on the rerecords, which fed appetite for new material and launched the record-shattering Eras tour.) The succession of prescient and profitable moves brought Braun to the attention of South Korean entertainment giant Hybe, which in 2021 acquired Ithaca Holdings in a deal reportedly valued at $1 billion. As part of the sale, longtime staffers were given a total of $50 million in stock from Braun’s personal stake. Bieber and Grande were each gifted $10 million, per public filings. Bieber’s contract with Braun would now move over to Hybe America, for which Braun serves as CEO. In June 2024, Braun announced that he was leaving artist management, writing of Bieber and Grande: “To see them both come up to be the legends they are today will forever be one of my greatest honors. As we change our working relationships now, I will continue to root for them with the same passion that I did at each of their humble beginnings.” But Braun is still bearing the brunt of criticism for participating in contracts that the public perceives as taking advantage of young artists — specifically in the realm of rights and ownership. “It’s easy to villainize Scooter,” says one high-ranking music executive familiar with all the parties, reasoning that Braun was already viewed negatively due to the dust-up with Swift. “He’s not Lou Pearlman; he’s the modern-day David Geffen. No trickery or shenanigans. You could make a plan and get things done with Scooter. And you could always make money with him.” Another longtime Braun associate echoes that view: “Actions speak louder than words, and Scooter put his money where his mouth is. He built a profitable business and made [Justin] a billion dollars.” *** One figure who has seemingly benefited from an association with Bieber, and remained in the star’s inner orbit, is his longtime pastor Judah Smith. He’s seen his Churchome community grow steadily in the past decade, now reportedly drawing more than 10,000 parishioners weekly, among its five locations. Its Beverly Hills visitors have included Kourtney Kardashian, Ciara and Russell Wilson. Bieber regularly attends Churchome sermons on Zoom, in addition to appearing in person with Hailey. In 2019, he helped lead a service, noting in a clip leaked to TMZ that he hadn’t done so before because “I didn’t want people to think this was a show.” “He’s got the biggest heart in the whole world, he forgives very easily, [and] he believes the best very readily,” the pastor once told The Daily Beast of his star disciple. “[We] talk all the time and pray a lot and think a lot together.” (The pair also have gotten matching tattoos together while on tour.) “Judah and his wife are great people,” says one congregant of Churchome, which is relatively permissive in its social ethos along the evangelical continuum, preferring hopeful messaging about scripture to Jim Bakker-like fearmongering. This accepting ideology is attractive to parishioners in its big, coastal cities with more liberal social views and values. Smith has pursued his own Hollywood projects. In 2017, Amazon reportedly shot an unaired talk show pilot, produced by Management 360’s production arm, which would have seen him in conversation with famous figures about life’s biggest questions. He incorporated a new entity, Pitiful Palace, in March 2024, which according to public records intends to focus on faith-based multimedia entertainment. Both Bieber and Smith, who sits on the board of one of the singer’s companies, were longtime clients at Lou Taylor’s business management firm Tri Star. They both appear to have left in spring 2024, shortly after Tri Star — which had already been embroiled in Britney Spears’ conservatorship dispute — began to publicly figure into Diddy’s legal saga. Taylor, herself the wife of a pastor, also exited the Churchome board. (She declined to comment.) As an adviser on records or tours, Smith obviously has none of Braun’s chops, but the two men do share some common traits. Both are deeply committed to their respective faiths (Braun, the grandson of Holocaust survivors, is Jewish and helped bring the Nova Music Festival exhibit, honoring the hundreds killed by terrorists in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, to the U.S.); charismatic in private meetings and public speaking engagements; and each has an intuition for popular culture. But where one is fluent in the language of entertainment, the other now seated at the table is a novice in an industry that’s fraught with shady practices and constant change. “You have a narcissistic pastor egging on a narcissistic artist, both fueled by Jesus, running around trying to do business,” says someone familiar with Smith and Bieber. Another affirms the tremendous sway and influence Smith has over Bieber when it comes to major career and life decisions. *** And when the business is music, things get even more complicated. The industry is built on supporting album cycles — it may take a year to record and produce an hour’s worth of songs, during which time the team is planning a tour, branding deals, merchandise and all manner of creative related to the project. That means working at least two years out on a global plan and committing the artist for two years post-release. In Bieber’s case, the absence of an album cycle makes tapping large sums of money more challenging. And since Bieber sold off his publishing, smart financial planning is key to this new phase, when automatically generated income is diminished. Bieber’s first record deal with Raymond Braun Music Group (RBMG), signed in 2008 and likely renegotiated, entitled the company then jointly owned by Braun and Usher (the latter sold his interest in RBMG in 2022 for an estimated $40 million) to share in the profits of Bieber’s album and song streams and additional revenue sources related to the recordings. In 2020, Bieber’s RBMG contract came to an end and he signed a new recording deal, where he and Braun partnered on a label (of which Bieber is a majority shareholder) that calls for four more albums via label partner Def Jam Records (a subsidiary of Universal Music Group), but since 2021’s Justice, Bieber has only released guest appearances on tracks by Don Toliver and SZA. Insiders assert that Tunji Balogun, who joined Def Jam as CEO in 2022 after a decade at RCA Records working with the likes of Bryson Tiller, Childish Gambino, Khalid and Wizkid, doesn’t have a relationship with Bieber, and his efforts go only so far. (Universal Music Group did not respond to requests for comment.) “He’ll release music when he feels comfortable,” says a confidant of Bieber. Meanwhile, Bieber has been hosting “jam sessions” at his house where attendees have included his longtime DJ Tay James, musical director HARV, SZA collaborator Carter Lang and Australian artist Eddie Benjamin (whose song “Maniac” soundtracks the Skylrk visual). Staffers at Universal Music universally agree: They would love to have a new Bieber album, as the demand for Bieber’s return remains strong. But things may be complicated for the label “until Justin and Scooter sort out their issues,” says one company insider. Often, when a manager and a longtime client break, there’s a “sunset” period in which commissions are still being collected on deals negotiated prior to the split. Such extrication from a years-long relationship can be awkward, and in the case of Bieber and Braun, it most certainly is. According to multiple players, Bieber is pushing to renegotiate his recording contract in order to lessen Braun’s share in his future music. So far, they remain at an impasse. “There’s a hole right now,” says Anokute. “A lot of the leading artists are female … and the male artists aren’t your traditional pop stars: It’s Benson Boone, Teddy Swims, Shaboozey. The marketplace is in desperate need of the music Justin Bieber has given us over the years. We’re welcoming him in with open arms.” Indeed, a music agent familiar with the numbers says Bieber is “still demanding seven to eight figures” but doesn’t see him touring anytime soon. “An occasional pop-up show, maybe,” the agent hints. So where does this leave Justin Bieber? Is he satisfied with the life-work balance he’s chosen? What will it take to come back, and will the fans, now also in their 30s, show up? “He’s meant to be onstage,” says a former adviser. “Like his brain needs that dopamine release and he’s not getting it. But at what point does it become Timberlake? No one wants to see a bunch of 30-year-olds out there dancing. It becomes nostalgic.” His current team is of another mind, and while no one from the “Bieber Family Office” would speak on the record, the sentiment seems to be, hasn’t he given enough? Anokute concurs: ”He’s been a winner for 16 years. Everyone goes through stuff; people have struggles financially, relationship problems. Do you know what it’s like to be a man at 30? To be a father? He’s living his life. Let him evolve. Let him grow. He’s gone through the fire and this is a phoenix moment for him. He’s going to rise.” Ethan Millman and Gary Baum contributed to this report.

Title: Here’s One Crypto Sector Quietly Going Parabolic Despite ‘Frustrating’ Bear Market, According to Bitwise

Crypto giant Bitwise says that parts of the digital asset ecosystem are experiencing “raging bull markets” despite underwhelming sentiment in the asset class at large. In a new Q1 report, Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan says that “frustrating” would be the best word to describe the first quarter of 2025, but that it was still “historically positive.” Hougan notes that on top of surging stablecoin adoption and Bitcoin futures trading volume, the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) went parabolic in Q1. “What caught my eye is that, despite the pullback in prices, parts of the crypto market are experiencing raging bull markets. For instance: Stablecoins AUM (assets under management) surged to an all-time high of over $218 billion, up 13.50% quarter-over-quarter. Transaction volume also surged 30.14%. Tokenized real-world assets went parabolic in Q1, growing 37.07% quarter-over-quarter to a new all-time high. Regulated bitcoin futures trading volume and open interest also hit all-time highs, suggesting institutional interest in crypto as a macro trading asset is growing. As we move into Q2, I would expect these and related areas to lead the market higher.” Bitwise’s data shows an explosive uptrend for RWAs over the last several years, one that has accelerated in 2025 so far, largely driven by the tokenization of private credit and US Treasuries. According to Bitwise, Ondo Finance (ONDO) rivals BlackRock for the tokenization of US Treasuries, and eclipses other traditional finance (TradFi) firms like Franklin Templeton and WisdomTree. Bitwise also says that after years of tightening, central banks across the globe are signalling a pivot towards looser monetary conditions and an expansion of M2 money supply, which, historically, has been “been favorable for risk assets, particularly for digital assets.” Read the full report here.

Title: Nvidia investors can't catch a break this year

Time Published: 2025-04-16T16:14:12Z
Full Content:
Nvidia investors can't catch a break this year. One thing after another seems to be knocking shares lower. If the pressure isn't coming from competing Chinese AI models, it's being applied by President Trump as he announces more tariffs on Nvidia-adjacent industries. And that's not to mention the stock's status as one of the most valuable companies in the world, and a headlining member of the vaunted Magnificent 7. Its rapid increase over the past few years has only been rivaled by the major declines it experiences during times of market turbulence. Nvidia's rocky year continued on Wednesday as shares fell as much as 7% after the company said that it expects to take a $5.5 billion earnings hit because of Chinese tariffs levied by Trump. The stock is now down 20% year-to-date and off about 30% from its January peak. Those losses far outpace the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, which is down 12% in 2025. Investors in Nvidia — formerly the market's foremost darling — are being forced to come to grips with the stock's position at the epicenter of multiple headwinds. "Nvidia has found itself in the middle of many crosscurrents this year," Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, told BI on Wednesday. Detailed below are three major forces holding Nvidia back in 2025: This ultimately boils down to Nvidia's sheer size and weighting in major indexes, which has resulted from the stock's eye-watering climb in recent years. Now that it's one of the most valuable companies in the world, and the clear leader of the AI-chip revolution, expectations have been ratcheted up. After all, Nvidia has grown its annual revenue by 383% since the release of ChatGPT in November 2022. "The stock has become a victim of its own success where the exponential growth following the release of ChatGPT became unsustainable given how large sales had become," Hickey said. The first warning of a potential slowdown in Nvidia's growth rate was the release of a large-language model from China, named DeepSeek. DeepSeek was significant in that it utilized nuanced efficiency gains that helped boost performance on par with mainstream GPTs, all while using significantly less computing power. The swift decline in Nvidia stock was almost fully recovered in mid-February, as tech CEOs spun DeepSeek's efficiency gains as a reason why AI should evolve even quicker. But that recovery was severely dented after Nvidia reported its earnings results in late February, which included guidance that failed to meet Wall Street's most lofty projections. After earnings, tariff worries weighed on Nvidia stock, as it sources most of its chips from overseas factories, mainly Taiwan Semiconductor. And now investors have to worry about the US government levying export restrictions on Nvidia's H20 chip, which was specifically designed for the Chinese market as a watered down AI GPU. All together, this weighs on Nvidia's ability to continue to post eye-popping growth rates in its upcoming earnings release. "We acknowledge that this news could impact NVDA Jul-Q guide's ability to beat street estimates comfortably," analysts at Citi said in a note on Wednesday. These issues only compounded investor worries about the stock. "The stock's problems started way before DeepSeek and tariffs, but these issues haven't helped as they only create more doubt as to the sustainability of its torrid growth rate," Hickey said. Jump to

Title: Ethereum Is What Bitcoin Was Meant to Be
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/coindesk-indices/2025/04/16/ethereum-is-what-bitcoin-was-meant-to-be
Time Published: 2025-04-16T15:44:47Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin was born as a response to institutional failure, a decentralized escape hatch from corruptible centralized finance and a north star of self sovereignty. Bitcoin’s true vision was a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. That phrase is right there in the Bitcoin white paper’s title from Satoshi himself. You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Today, Bitcoin is many things: But Bitcoin is not electronic cash. It is too volatile for daily use, too slow to scale and too rigid to adapt as a cash equivalent. Somewhere along the way, Bitcoin gave up on being the system, and instead became the signal. Ethereum, by contrast, might be the one actually delivering on Bitcoin’s original promise. Thanks to Ethereum’s programmability, we now have stablecoins, arguably the most successful crypto use case to date. Dollar-backed tokens like USDC and USDT settle trillions in peer-to-peer value across borders 24/7 with no bank intermediaries. Stablecoins are Bitcoin’s white paper come to life, minus the volatility. Ethereum’s scale can be shown through on-chain data. Stablecoins on Ethereum and its Layer 2s now rival the transaction volume of major credit and debit card networks. In markets where local currencies are unstable or financial access is limited, stablecoins have become lifelines. They are used for remittances, payroll, savings and even commerce. The irony is that Bitcoin wanted to replace fiat, but it’s Ethereum that has quietly made fiat better. It gave the dollar superpowers like composability, programmability and global mobility. And it’s doing it without centralized permission. Here’s the kicker: Ethereum’s evolution doesn’t stop at payments. Once you understand the technology, you realize ETH does everything BTC can do, and so much more. Where Bitcoin remains focused on scarcity, Ethereum is building infrastructure. The rise of real-world asset tokenization (RWAs) is a perfect example. Treasury bills, private credit and fund shares are now being issued on Ethereum, bringing regulated assets into composable finance. BlackRock, Franklin Templeton and other legacy giants aren’t launching on Bitcoin; they’re building on Ethereum. Additionally, unlike Bitcoin’s inert capital, Ethereum enables native yield through staking, allowing participants to secure the network while earning predictable returns — an increasingly attractive feature for institutions seeking on-chain cash flow. This isn’t to say Bitcoin has failed. It serves a different role: a monetary anchor in the digital world. But its utility is limited. Ethereum, on the other hand, is becoming the global settlement layer for on-chain assets. While Bitcoin adoption has captured mainstream headlines, Ethereum’s fundamentals quietly continue to grow as the platform gains institutional market share. Some metrics to back up Ethereum’s growing influence and usage include: Ethereum isn’t replacing Bitcoin. But it’s fulfilling what Bitcoin started: a decentralized, global financial system with open access and programmable trust — in short, digital cash. Bitcoin sparked the movement. But Ethereum is scaling it. For further information, please click here to view Advantage Blockchain’s last quarterly report.

Title: The Silent Invasion of Panama? Trump Said that the US Would Reclaim the Panama Canal
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/silent-invasion-panama-trump-said-us-reclaim-panama-canal/5884509
Time Published: 2025-04-16T15:14:19Z
Full Content:
In early April, Defense News reported that the Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was going to Panama to speak to its leadership and discuss the situation with the Panama Canal concerning China, “Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth will travel to Panama next week, the second senior U.S. official to visit the country in as many months, as President Donald Trump says America is “reclaiming” the country’s eponymous canal.” US aggression in Panama is following a blueprint to reclaim its “backyard” since China is wining influence and trade among Latin American nations. This is an insult to Panama, in fact, it’s an imperialist move that signifies that the Trump regime does not respect the sovereignty of the Panamanian people. This brings back the horrible memories of the US invasion of Panama on December 20, 1989 that resulted in hundreds, some estimates say, thousands of people dead. “While there, Hegseth will meet with the country’s president, Jose Raul Mulino, and attend a meeting of regional chiefs of defense. He will also visit military sites and the Panama Canal itself.” This is alarming not only to Panama, but to other Latin American nations on Washington’s list for regime change including Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela. The report said that “In a statement Friday, Pentagon Press Secretary Sean Parnell wrote the meetings “will drive ongoing efforts to strengthen our partnerships with Panama and other Central American nations toward our shared vision for a peaceful and secure Western Hemisphere.” The mainstream media including Trump’s cheerleaders, Fox news and Newsmax, has been rather silent about these developments, according to Defense News, “The U.S. has a small military presence in Panama, though the Pentagon has reportedly been planning options to increase that number, in line with the president’s goal to take control of the canal. America is currently participating in a military exercise inside the country“ continued, “To further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we’ve already started doing it,” Trump said in a March address to Congress.” Panama’s President Jose Raul Mulino originally rejected Trump’s claims, but it seems that somehow he was intimidated, “In a post on the social app X after Trump’s speech, Mulino said ownership of the canal wasn’t being transferred and that he and Rubio didn’t discuss the topic” Mulino said, “I reject, on behalf of Panama and all Panamanians, this new affront to the truth and to our dignity as a nation.” The US Department of Defense highlighted what Hegseth had said at the press conference, “The era of capitulating to coercion by the communist Chinese is over,” he continued, “[China’s] growing and adversarial control of strategic land and critical infrastructure in this hemisphere cannot and will not stand.” Hegseth had announced the “expanded partnership” with Panamanian Public Security Minister Frank Abrego. Hegseth said that “The Panama Canal is key terrain that must be secured by Panama, with America, and not China.” In other words, the US is now in control of the Panama Canal because there was never a “partnership.” The US treats Panama as a puppet state under the banner of democracy. Now it seems that President Mulino has reversed his stance. Le Monde ‘Panama deal allows US to deploy troops to canal, but no permanent bases’ reported that US troops would be occupying, not building new bases: US troops will be able to deploy a string of bases along the Panama Canal under a joint deal seen by AFP on Thursday, April 10, a major concession to President Donald Trump as he seeks to reestablish influence over the vital waterway. The agreement, signed by top security officials from both countries, allows US military personnel to deploy to Panama-controlled facilities for training, exercises and “other activities” “Other activities” means that the CIA will be using those occupied bases in Panama to conduct regime change operations in Latin America. Mulino did warn that Trump’s idea to have US-owned bases in Panama would ignite mass protests: Mulino was on Thursday in Peru, where he revealed that the United States had asked to have its own bases. Mulino said he had told visiting Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth that US bases, allowed under an earlier draft, would be “unacceptable.” He warned Hegseth: “Do you want to create a mess, what we’ve put in place here would set the country on fire” In a Memorandum of Understanding, Hegseth and Abrego supposedly acknowledged that Panama “won” concessions, but who in their right mind would trust the US President and his neocon regime? In the watered-down “Memorandum of Understanding,” signed by Hegseth and Panama’s security chief Frank Abrego on Wednesday, Panama won its own concessions. The United States recognized Panama’s sovereignty – not a given following Trump’s refusal to rule out an invasion – and Panama will retain control over any installations. Panama will also have to agree to any deployments. But given Trump’s willingness to rip up or rewrite trade deals, treaties and agreements, that might offer little succor to worried Panamanians In an important note, Le Monde mentioned how Trump allowed BlackRock, a deep state corporate entity to buy two ports for $19 billion which angered Beijing: The ports’ parent company CK Hutchison announced last month a deal to offload 43 ports in 23 countries – including its two on the Panama Canal – to a consortium led by US asset manager BlackRock for $19 billion in cash. A furious Beijing has since announced an antitrust review of the deal However, Panama’s opposition describes what is happening as a ‘Camouflaged Invasion’ as reported by The Guardian: Panamanian opposition politicians have accused the US of launching a “camouflaged invasion” of the country, amid simmering discontent over the government’s handling of the diplomatic crisis. After a three-day visit by the US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump appeared to confirm that US military personnel had been deployed to the Central American country on Thursday, telling reporters: “We’ve moved a lot of troops to Panama” Washington is clearly trying to reoccupy Panama under the radar which will not sit well with most Panamanians, “Hegseth said that the US would increase its military presence at three former US bases in the country to “secure the Panama canal from Chinese influence.” Since 1999, the US military exited Panama under the 1977 Torrijos-Carter Treaty that handed over the canal to Panamanian authorities, “Under the canal’s neutrality treaty, no foreign power can “maintain military forces, defense sites and military installations within its national territory”, and the US comments have prompted outrage in Panama.” Ricardo Lombana, the leader of the opposition Other Way Movement said that “This is a camouflaged invasion” and that its “an invasion without firing a shot, but with a cudgel and threats.” This is the case: the US has invaded Panama without media attention. The Trump regime is following in the footsteps of the former US President, William McKinley the imperialist who led the effort to get the US into a war with Spain in what is known as the Spanish–American War. McKinley expanded US territories with the annexation of Hawaii and led to the forced colonization of Puerto Rico, Guam, the Philippines and American Samoa. The Panamanian people will reject this imperialist move by the Trump Whitehouse. I also agree with Panama’s President, Jose Raul Mulino, in what he originally said about the US having their own bases would “set the country on fire.” But having US military personal in already existing military bases can also set Panama on fire. Either way, it’s a bad situation for Panama, protests are guaranteed, and the world is watching closely. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, April 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against AppLovin Corporation (“AppLovin” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: APP) and reminds investors of the May 5, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inglate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding AppLovin’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Title: Netflix Set To Kick Off Earnings Season Well Positioned As Wall Street Weighs Recession Risk

By Jill Goldsmith Co-Business Editor Netflix unveils its first-quarter results Thursday afternoon. The report will kick off a rather momentous earnings season for media amid churning stock markets and recession jitters prompted by the Trump administration’s global tariffs. Traditionally the company that fires the starting gun for entertainment and tech numbers every three months, Netflix may be a calming place to start this time. As tariffs cast a pall across business sectors including media, the streaming giant may be Wall Street‘s top stock pick to weather the macroeconomic storm. Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein calls it the “cleanest story” in media in the case of a U.S. or global recession. The company has little tariff exposure, sustainable 2025 growth, strong engagement data and has gotten to the other side of a round of price increases, which bug customers but enthuse profit-hungry investors. This will be the first quarter when Netflix doesn’t report subscriber numbers, but it has a number of other metrics to trumpet and has been solidly profitable for years, a claim most other streaming players can’t yet make. Watch on Deadline Netflix is only minimally exposed to advertising, which right now is ideal, after introducing a cheaper ad tier less than three years ago. A nascent business is less exposed as low consumer confidence, anticipated inflation and economic uncertainty have Wall Streeters warning of an advertising pullback. Advertising makes up a big chunk of revenue and profit at companies like Fox Corp., Paramount Global and Warner Bros Discovery to Meta and Snap. The ad business was hit hard during the past two recessions and slow to recover, which left leaving the media landscape transformed. “Given the ongoing secular headwinds facing the linear TV ecosystem, we worry that television could mirror the fate of radio and newspapers during past recessions,” research firm MoffettNathanson wrote in a recent client note. “Should budgets shift away from linear TV at an accelerated pace, we see risk of a more permanent reallocation towards connected TV and broader digital channels.” He see $45 billion in lost U.S. advertising spend versus current forecasts if GDP growth slows in 2025. To limit downside risk, the firm’s Michael Nathanson pinpoints Netflix and Alphabet as “offering compelling entry points.” The firm has “buy” recommendations on both, as well as on Disney, WBD and Meta. It has “hold” ratings on Fox, Paramount, Roku and Snap. But it also said it’s waiting to revise forecasts ahead of “further clarity during earnings calls.” It’s an understatement to say that CEO commentary over the next few weeks is highly anticipated. Beyond advertising, analysts fret about parks, which generate key revenue at Disney and Comcast, with the latter’s NBCUniversal division set to open Epic Universe in May. Nathanson notes that historical recessions (in 2001-2002 and 2008-2009) squeezed domestic parks. In the event of a recession, he predicted, Disney’s U.S. revenue would be several billion dollars below his estimates for both this year and next. Trump’s tariffs have angered U.S. allies. Airlines are sounding a cautionary note and analysts in that sector note dips in foreign travel to the U.S. in March from the year before. Jessica Reif Ehrlich of BofA Securities think Epic Universe could provide a nice boost to the sector in trying times, along with new Disney cruise ships and a rise in per capital spending at Disney parks. That said, BofA has had to rethink its outlook. “Entering the year, we were bullish on the Media & Entertainment industry in part driven by a potential cycle of M&A, but this thesis has clearly not played out (and appears unlikely) given the current Administration’s unfavorable view of some companies in our coverage,” Reif Ehrlich wrote in a note to clients. Media and entertainment, in a state of seemingly never-ending tumult, navigating Covid and then Hollywood talent strikes over the past few years, “now faces the economic uncertainty and market volatility created by the risk of tariffs.” BofA economists are not forecasting a recession but see a drag on growth that could bring the economy to the precipice. “While typical recession risk mainly impacts revenue, tariffs could lead to higher costs,” the analyst noted, in areas like raw materials for sets, or a loss of foreign tax incentives for production. She sees Netflix and Spotify as best-positioned in the field and preferred buys as both have nascent ad businesses and strong subscription models with “critical entertainment which historically performs well in a recession.” Oppenheimer’s Helfstein says that Netflix could be confronted with higher churn, weaker gross subscriber additions or subscribers trading down to cheaper plans given the deteriorating economic picture. Still, he says the firm sees “limited risk overall.” Citing a 2011 Stanford survey, he said consumers spend more time at home during economic hardship, and time spent watching TV increased during the last U.S. recession. (And we all remember the explosion of viewing and sign-ups in 2020.) Netflix is offering both secular growth, as it embarks on a new advertising revenue strategy among selective price increases, says David Joyce of Seaport Research, calling it “the best of both worlds as the low price points globally offer a great deal of value for the engagement levels – which is exhibited in good times and bad.” Generally, what makes Netflix and other streamers a “defensive stay-cation alternative if we enter a recession is that it’s likely to be one of the last expenditures cut from a consumer’s budget.” A monthly premium subscription is cheaper than a sporting event, a concert and even an Imax ticket. Although exhibitors also tend to benefit in economic downturns. He has a buy on the stock. The first quarter brought one of the company’s biggest hits ever, Adolescence, showing continued momentum after it blew past estimates to top 303 million subscribers as of the end of 2024. Loop Capital’s Alan Gould said the Ted Sarandos- and Greg Peters-led streamer should be among the most economically resilient companies in the current climate and least impacted by tariffs. For the first three months of 2025, Gould is forecasting $10.54 billion in revenue; operating income of $3 billion; net income of $2.456 billion; and diluted earnings per share of $5.63. Wall Street consensus is close at $10.51 billion of revenue; just under $3 billion in operating income; $2.473 million net profit; and EPS of $5.67, he noted, as per investment researcher VisibleAlpha. “Both we and the Street and us are expecting a small revenue, operating income and EPS beat. The quarter will benefit from about a half quarter of the price increase in the UCAN region and a month in the UK. As discussed in our March 24 report, here, engagement appears to have been up 5% for the quarter based on NFLX’s weekly Top 10 global titles in English, non-English, film and series,” Gould said in a report yesterday. “Engagement was down for the 4 weeks from late February to mid-March, coinciding with 1 month after the US price increase was fully in effect, but engagement has since bounced back the past 3 weeks.” Any and all financial metrics will be taking on increased significance when company reports after market close Thursday because – and this is big – it will be the first quarter ever Netflix won’t be revealing monthly subscriber numbers. That prospect freaked out analysts when it was floated last year although some say it has the benefit of tamping down some of the volatility around the stock, which can get buffeted subscriber numbers from quarter to quarter. Netflix has said that it will still provide that data in certain situations, like when it hits milestones. It also will likely continue characterizing growth in its ad-supported tier, using montly active users (MAUs) as the key metric, which is different from subscribers. Upbeat sentiment on the streamer accelerated this week after a WSJ report that the company’s top brass shared some ambitious goals at an annual business review with senior staff – namely, plans to achieve a $1 trillion market cap and double its revenue by 2030. The outlook included growth targets for ad sales – of $9 billion globally by 2030, and tripling operating income from $10 billion in 2024. The saga of tariffs – imposed under a Trump declared “national emergency” in foreign trade – has been fast-moving, hard to follow and value-destroying. On April 2, the administration announced sweeping tariffs targeting 60 countries with a baseline 10% tariff on nearly all remaining imports that had not been taxed already, calling it Liberation Day. Trump then announced hefty, additional reciprocal tariffs on most countries, tanking markets. He later walked those back to allow for negotiations. When China publicly chastised the administration, Trump raised tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%. China quickly confirmed will cut back imports of Hollywood films, which could impact media company revenue. Last Friday, Trump suspended tariffs on electronics like iPhone and laptops from China – where most are made. But the administration also said it’s probing the “whole” tech supply chain, meaning products like chips and semiconductors may not be excluded from tariffs. He also has hinted yesterday that he might give tariff relief to certain automakers to give them more time to move production the U.S. Relief also might also extend to car components. Tariffs on a major trading partner, the European Union, will likely stay in place as negotiations appear to have stalled, according to a number of developments on Tuesday. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who has been putting out sometimes twice-daily updates on the tariff situation in recent weeks, said Tuesday that “the price impacts from this head-scratching tariff slate could result in demand destruction of 15%-20%” for new car purchases in the U.S. this year. That would add $100 million to automakers’ costs and raise the price of new cars by up to $15K. Automakers are a key advertising category. Trump’s goal is to move production back to the U.S., but that would take years after decades of globalization. “We reiterate the concept of a U.S. made car with all U.S. parts is a fairy tale fictional narrative” and not even possible now, Ives wrote. Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson has also been among those pointing out that a shift by Apple from China-based iPhone production to American manufacturing for the device, which accounts for half of the tech giant’s revenue, would take decades. Given the uncertainty, companies are unlikely to commit capital based on protectionist policies that may not last beyond 2028, Nathanson said. Entertainment, unlike auto parts or lumber or liquor or shoes, is a service, not a good, so not subject to tariffs. Of the more than 300 CEOs surveyed in April by an industry group called Chief Executive that conducts monthly polls, 62% saw a recession or other economic downturn in the next six months – up from 48% who had that forecast in March. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said during a recent interview that the U.S. may already be in a recession or getting close to one due to Trump’s tariffs. The tariff debate escalated as banks were out with quarterly numbers, the first sector to report each earnings season. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said Monday the prospect of a recession has increased amid the uncertainties of a trade war alongside growing indications that economic global economic activity is slowing. Influential JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon also said tariffs could spur inflation, weaker economic growth and, potentially, a recession. “Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth,” he said in his annual letter to shareholders Monday.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, April 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB) and reminds investors of the April 28, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class.

While the founder of one-click checkout company Bolt re-assumed its helm as CEO in March, Breslow is unveiling Wednesday a new “superapp” that he hopes will formally mark his return as the fintech’s leader. He describes the new product as “one-click crypto and everyday payments” in a single platform, in an exclusive interview with TechCrunch. The controversial entrepreneur famously stepped down in January 2022 from the San Francisco-based company he started in 2014 after dropping out of Stanford. In recent years, Breslow has been the target of more than one investor lawsuit and faced allegations that he misled investors and violated security laws by inflating metrics while fundraising the last time he ran the company. Breslow acknowledges that Bolt’s revenue has not been robust in recent years. But he hopes to change that with this new consumer app, which he ambitiously hopes will serve as “a centralized and personalized hub for financial services.” The app at once competes with a number of other companies such as crypto exchange Coinbase, payments platform Zelle, and PayPal. Its advantage, Breslow claims, is the ability to do what all these others do from one place via mobile. For example, the app will allow users to buy, sell, send, and receive major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDC, Solana, and Polygon directly within the app. Users are provisioned an on-chain balance powered by Zero Hash and will be able to see their balance in real time, Breslow says. “I founded Bolt 11 years ago to build the easiest app to buy, sell, and send crypto. I believe this still hasn’t been done well in the marketplace. Today marks a significant day: the return of that original vision,” said Breslow. “We call it ‘Coinbase for the 99%’ who may not be the most technical, but still want to participate in the buying and selling of crypto.” (Bolt in 2022 paid $1.5 billion for cryptocurrency payments company Wyre. It started out as an “easy way to buy, sell, and send crypto” before pivoting to build one-click checkout first.) Breslow is also hoping to pick up where Zelle left off with the shutdown of its standalone app. With Bolt’s new offering, users can process peer payments “with just a single click” within its app. With Zelle, users can only send payments to peers through banking apps. On top of that, Bolt has partnered with Midland States Bank to now also offer a debit card that features a rewards program, including up to 3% direct cash back on eligible purchases and up to 7% in Love.com store credits. (Love.com is another startup founded by Breslow in 2023 that is focused on health and wellness. He remains its CEO.) As Bolt doesn’t offer banking services, users will have to transfer money from another bank account into this one to fund purchases with the debit card. And lastly, the new app also provides real-time order tracking for users — something other companies such as Klarna offer in their app, as well. The app is available today in iOS and will soon be available in the Google Play store. Once downloaded, users will be added to a waitlist with iOS users being the first to get off the waitlist. The new “superapp” was built within just six months, Breslow claims. Justin Grooms (Bolt’s president and former interim CEO) and Kartik Ramachandran (Bolt’s chief product officer) began work on the app before Breslow was reinstated. Breslow helped advise them during the months prior to his reinstatement. “Our team has been working nights and weekends to get this ready in time,” Breslow said. Presently, Bolt has about 140 employees. Despite lackluster revenue growth, Breslow claims that Bolt has managed to still grow in terms of users — with a two-sided network of tens of millions of U.S. shoppers and “hundreds” of merchants such as Revolve and Kendra Scott. Bolt’s ARR stood at about $28 million with $7 million in gross profit as of the end of March 2024, tech publication Newcomer reported last year. “Prior to my return, our revenue did not grow much and we haven’t closed as much business as we’d like. We don’t think the company was run as well as it could have been. And that’s something I’m going to change very quickly,” Breslow told TechCrunch. “However, our platform kept on enrolling shoppers and attracting network growth. When I left, it was at 10 million. Now our total shopper network is 80 million in the U.S. and even larger globally.” He’s hoping to turn that network into revenue for Bolt by earning money from interchange fees for every debit card transaction and charging fees for the purchase and sale of crypto. “We already have a large trove of data users have provided that has been verified and charged successfully,” he said. The fintech company last year was reportedly trying to raise $450 million in an unusually structured deal that would have valued it at $14 billion. That deal raised questions over its unusual use of $250 million in “marketing credits” and lack of confirmation from an investor mistakenly identified as its lead. Some of Bolt’s investors, including BlackRock and Hedosophia, sued to block the round, Forbes reported, but that was voluntarily dismissed by all parties, Bolt announced in March. Today, Bolt is in “early conversations” on a new round that Breslow projects could close “in the mid to near future.” Breslow was also previously sued by former investor Activant Capital over a $30 million loan that the founder had taken out. Activant claimed Breslow saddled the startup with $30 million in debt by borrowing that amount and then defaulting, with company funds used to pay it back. The case was eventually settled, with Bolt agreeing to repurchase Activant’s shares for $37 million last year. Speaking at Fintech Meetup in Las Vegas in March, Breslow defended the loan, framing it as an act of loyalty to Bolt rather than the self-dealing the Activant lawsuit alleged it was. “I’ve had a tremendous amount of decline over the last three years and have been winning back the trust of judges, investigators, and our team, so it’s been incredibly challenging, but it’s been a remarkable learning experience,” he told TechCrunch. “I’ve learned more in these last three years than in the 10 years prior to that.” He added: “And even though it’s been challenging, I couldn’t be more excited about the opportunity in front of us. I feel so grateful that our company has weathered the storm.” Bolt, which provides software to retailers to speed up checkout, raised around $1 billion in total venture-backed funding and at one time was valued at $11 billion. Investors include funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, Schonfeld, Invus Opportunities, CreditEase, H.I.G. Growth, and Moore Strategic Ventures, among others.

Title: Nvidia stock slumps 6% as a U.S. ban on China AI exports means a $5.5 billion hit

The U.S.-China tech war just claimed another high-profile casualty. Nvidia (NVDA), America’s third-largest company by market cap, said Wednesday it will take a $5.5 billion charge after the U.S. government moved to block exports of its H20 AI chips to China — citing national security risks tied to their potential use. The H20 had been engineered to comply with earlier Biden-era restrictions and had become a key product for Nvidia in China, one that was quickly gaining traction. But the sudden reversal by the Trump administration, after months of policy limbo and back-channel talks, signals another hard turn in trade policy — and lays bare the high-stakes game playing out among Silicon Valley, Washington, and Beijing. Let’s rewind: On April 9, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang attended a $1-million-a-plate Mar-a-Lago dinner with President Trump, where AI exports were reportedly a topic of conversation. Proceeds from the dinner went to MAGA Inc., a Trump-aligned super PAC that can raise unlimited funds but isn’t allowed to coordinate directly with the campaign. Five days later, on April 14, the U.S. informed Nvidia it would need a license to export H20 chips abroad. On April 16, Nvidia announced the multibillion-dollar charge — and markets flinched. Meanwhile, ASML (ASML), the Dutch semiconductor equipment powerhouse, reported first-quarter sales of €7.7 billion — slightly below forecasts — and flagged “greater uncertainty” due to trade tensions. ASML makes the machines essential for cutting-edge chip production, giving it enormous influence over global chip supply. The company warned that new tariffs and tech restrictions could weigh on its outlook for 2025 and 2026. Investors didn’t like what they saw. Nvidia stock slid 6% at the market open Wednesday and retreated further in the afternoon before closing down about 7%, with AMD (AMD) and other chipmakers falling in tandem. The broader Nasdaq dropped over 3%, as Wall Street reassessed what a prolonged, escalating tech standoff could mean for supply chains, AI development, and the semiconductor industry. In a Wednesday note, Jefferies (JEF) analysts said the H20 ban was expected — but the size of Nvidia’s write-down was not. It signals outsized demand from Chinese buyers, who had reportedly placed $16 billion in H20 orders this year. Still, Jefferies says China has likely stockpiled enough GPUs for ongoing AI training and will increasingly lean on local chips for inferencing tasks. Markets may have priced in some pain, but they haven’t seen the last punch. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Want to Save Democracy? Organize a Union in Your Workplace.

Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access Authoritarian regimes make crushing unions a top priority for a reason: Strong, independent unions are the best safeguard against tyranny. Dozens of Starbucks employees and union supporters protested alleged anti-union tactics by the company outside a Kansas City Starbucks on March 3, 2022. It’s easy to feel powerless. The US government is enabling Israel’s genocide in Palestine and deporting immigrants to concentration camps in El Salvador. Elon Musk is gutting public services. And corporations, emboldened by the new regime, are urging it to go even further and roll back workers’ rights and public accountability. These forces can feel “too big to fail,” which raises the question: How can we meaningfully fight these powerful actors? If you want to fight the rise of fascism, organize a union in your workplace—or get a job and help your coworkers organize. There’s a reason that authoritarian regimes often make crushing unions their top priority: Free and independent unions are the best safeguard of democracy. Unionizing provides workers with the means of building power outside of capital and the state. A strong labor movement could launch a general strike in protest of a repressive regime that would shut down the economy and force concessions—or at least galvanize resistance and turn popular opinion against the state, as the 1943 strike at the Fiat factory in Mirafiori, Italy, which helped bring down Benito Mussolini’s dictatorship, demonstrated. The threat of a general strike has not lost its power: In 2019, during the first Trump administration, Sara Nelson, the president of the Association of Flight Attendants union, helped end a government shutdown by calling for one. After flights were grounded in New York City, politicians reached a deal to reopen the government within hours. Unionizing also allows workers to leverage their power to resist state and corporate demands, while protecting workers from retaliation when they speak out against injustice—both within and outside the workplace. In a heroic example of unionized workers refusing work to protect human rights, workers at a Scottish Rolls Royce plant in 1973 refused to repair engines used by the Chilean dictatorship. Their union had already issued statements condemning the junta and its torture and murder of their fellow trade unionists; this was a means of putting their beliefs into action and helping to save lives. As the US government persecutes marginalized groups and as corporations respond by dropping their pretext of caring about social justice and ending their diversity, inclusion, and equity programs, US unions must likewise become or remain a means of collective advocacy. Rank-and-file organizing within Starbucks Workers United, the union campaign I helped launch in 2021, has meant that the union has spoken out on a range of issues—from LGBTQ rights to racial justice to solidarity with Palestine. Through actions like “Strike with Pride”—a national strike over the company’s cuts to coverage of gender-affirming care, retaliation against queer organizers, and removal of pride decorations from cafes—the Starbucks union is mobilizing within the labor movement to make these demands over human rights mainstream. Even where workers do not already have left-wing sympathies, a strong and independent labor movement can change its members’ beliefs and make authoritarianism less appealing. Right-wing populism recognizes that workers are angry, but instead of channeling that anger upward, toward the corporate bosses and their collaborators, its survival relies on directing resentment downward, toward immigrants, LGBTQ people, and other marginalized groups. Union-busting often follows this same template, as corporations try to prevent workers from building solidarity with each other and instead stoke divisions within the workforce. Union organizing unites people around class, helping to build genuine community and solidarity between groups the ruling class seeks to pit against each other. Through shared struggle, workers who might otherwise have been attracted to right-wing populism often develop a deeper understanding of the ways their own interest is entwined with their coworkers’—including the coworkers who belong to groups that might be painted as “the enemy.” A 2019 study indicated that even where white working-class voters had “psychological tendencies” toward authoritarianism, involvement in unions frequently “inoculated” them against voting for Trump. But the impact of unionization on members’ outlook goes far beyond the ballot box: Authoritarian regimes rely on the public looking the other way from injustice (or cheering it on), while the labor movement emphasizes that an injury to one is an injury to all and urges collective action to confront abuse. If unions are our best hope to reverse course, what should the labor movement prepare for as authoritarians take power in the United States? The playbook for undermining or outlawing independent unions has several components, including attempting to co-opt unions, restricting or eliminating existing unions, and creating loyal or company unions to create a semblance of worker voice without giving workers real power. Co-opting existing unions is one of the most straightforward strategies, targeting existing fault lines within the labor movement, but its scale is limited since it relies largely on the consent of the co-opted. In India, for example, unions are typically linked to political parties; thus, the RSS, a far-right nationalist paramilitary organization, has both a political wing—Narendra Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party—and a labor wing. In other countries, unions that were initially independent have since aligned with right-wing political groups: Poland’s Solidarność evolved from an independent union formed during an illegal wildcat strike against authoritarian state socialism into a supporter of the reactionary Law and Justice party. Right-wing tendencies have always existed within the US labor movement. Most early unions, even tho se that organized Black and white workers into interracial locals, supported the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. As government repression targeted leftist and anti-war unions in the beginning of the 20th century, many unions adopted increasingly conservative platforms, culminating in purges of Communist organizers from the labor movement at the height of the red scare. The Teamsters endorsed Nixon in 1972 and Reagan in 1980. Is their president’s current coziness with Trump—Sean O’Brien spoke at the Republican National Convention last year; while the union declined to endorse a candidate, it released polling data indicating that members largely supported Trump—a true departure from their past? Not necessarily, but it is a concerning sign—especially when workers at companies ranging from Chipotle to Amazon are seeking to join the Teamsters as part of a commitment to joining the labor movement and building a better world. O’Brien’s right-wing turn also included tweeting his approval of Senator Josh Hawley’s anti-DEI and anti-trans op-ed, “The Promise of Pro-Labor Conservatism.” Unions must resist the temptation to accept a “pro-labor conservatism” rooted in macho, white-supremacist nationalism. The United Auto Workers has recently pivoted from declaring “Trump is a scab” during the election season to writing “We’re ready to work with Trump” in the pages of The Washington Post. Even if the UAW thinks its members will benefit from Trump’s erratic tariffs—which has put the UAW at odds with the Canadian autoworkers’ union and has already resulted in layoffs of UAW members at some domestic auto plants—making a bargain with this administration is a fundamentally unwise decision. Any wins gained through such compromises would come at the cost of the UAW’s moral compass and labor movement solidarity: the very things that make a union a powerful force for justice. Where authoritarians are unable to co-opt unions, they frequently restrict their ability to operate, criminalizing many actions, targeting union leaders, and changing labor law to make organizing much harder. In Turkey, for example, Erdoğan’s regime has made an already-challenging climate for organizing even more repressive. The state has suppressed strikes, arrested union leaders, and used the state of emergency it declared in 2016 after a failed coup attempt to fire about 130,000 public-sector workers, claiming they were disloyal to the government. Emma Jackson Saree Makdisi Alfred McCoy Janai Nelson Sound familiar? Trump’s recent attacks on federal workers’ unions—including his executive order stripping most federal workers of their right to organize—follow the same playbook. This attempt to ban unions within a wide range of government agencies on “national security” pretexts doesn’t even try to hide its retaliatory intent of preventing “hostile unions” (as the administration’s lawsuit refers to many federal unions) from acting as a countervailing force through collective bargaining. The Trump administration has further targeted union organizers and members across sectors based on their immigration status, including sheet-metal worker Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a member of SMART, who was abducted and taken to El Salvador’s notorious maximum security prison due to a so-called “administrative error” that the Trump administration has refused to reverse, in defiance of judicial orders. ICE is also known to have kidnapped a United Farm Workers leader, Alfredo “Lelo” Juarez; revoked the work authorizations of 200 unionized manufacturing workers in Kentucky who are members of the IUE-CWA; abducted unionized graduate students, including Rumeysa Ozturk and Mahmoud Khalil; seized SEIU member Lewelyn Dixon, a University of Washington lab tech; and raided a roofing company where workers had protested safety conditions, disappearing 37 workers whose families do not know their whereabouts. Finally, the Trump administration has signaled its intention to repeal Section 8(a)2 of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), which bans company unions—organizations that are dominated or controlled by the boss, often with the intention of preventing free and independent unions from gaining traction instead. In between assertions about the “Judeo-Christian tradition, stretching back to Genesis, recogniz[ing] fruitful work as integral to human dignity [and] as service to God” and policy proposals to ban critical race theory trainings, encourage “Sabbath rest,” and reduce overtime pay thresholds, the labor section of Project 2025 lays out a plan to facilitate the creation of works councils and other forms of what it calls “non-union worker voice and representation.” Before the passage of the NLRA in 1935, many businesses created company unions. After using the National Guard to massacre striking coal miners in an encampment in Ludlow, Colorado, in 1914 (burning 11 children alive), John D. Rockefeller Jr., embarked on an effort to restore his reputation through a public relations campaign that included an “employee representation plan” under his control. Company unions ran rampant in industries ranging from steel to textiles to railways to photography. The NLRA’s prohibition was designed to put an end to this practice to help remove barriers to workers organizing freely. Today, advocates of “associational” or “alternative” unionization, like labor scholar Tom Kochan (who remains a staunch supporter of collective bargaining, as well), argue that because union density is so low, “labor law needs to open up to support a range of voice options.” For very different reasons, some of the Project 2025 authors, including Oren Cass, share this view: Cass has maintained that the Republican Party should be more open to unions (within a narrower definition of what “protected concerted activity” entails) and has advocated for workers’ councils and placing workers on corporate boards. While these alternatives may give workers more voice—i.e., a forum to express opinions—they don’t provide workers real power—the ability to bargain about issues and build an independent organization. Moreover, rather than helping open the door to forming a real union, they often make it more difficult to organize. If workers are likely to face an intense union-busting campaign and retaliation for forming an independent union, but the company is encouraging participation in an alternative model, many workers would settle for the safer but powerless option. Even during the best of times, organizing a union is not easy; labor law in the United States is extremely weak, and, as labor professor John Logan writes, corporations “are prepared to do whatever is necessary, lawful or unlawful, to crush their organizing campaigns.” But in our current moment, it is critical that workers continue to organize in order to build power independent from corporations and the state, and to insist on their unions maintaining principled positions rather than negotiating with authoritarians. Growing democracy in the workplace is our best line of defense for democracy outside of it, too. The chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week. Trump’s catastrophic “Liberation Day” has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called “enemy aliens” are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire. At a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump’s intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account. In just the last month, we’ve published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration’s appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities. We also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections—like Wisconsin’s recent state Supreme Court race—that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can’t buy our democracy.

Title: The FTC Discredited Its Case Against Meta In Its Opening Statement

ByJohn Tamny ByJohn Tamny, Contributor. WASHINGTON, DC - APRIL 14: The Dome of the U.S. Capitol Building is visible as FTC attorney Daniel ... More Matheson departs E. Barrett Prettyman United States Court House on April 14, 2025 in Washington, DC. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has begun an antitrust trial against Meta over the company's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp and allegations that the company holds a monopoly over the social networking market. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) “They decided that competition was too hard and it would be easier to buy out their rivals than to compete with them.” Those were the words of FTC lawyer Daniel Matheson in the opening statement of the FTC’s antitrust case against Meta. Matheson unwittingly exposed his own argument as meritless. To understand why, it’s important to remember that when Facebook purchased Instagram in April of 2012, it could claim just 30 million users at a time when Facebook’s users were already in the billion category. Which is a comment that FTC and Matheson are rewriting history in an attempt to make their case. If readers are confused, consider yet again that Instagram could claim all of 30 million users when its acquisition was announced. So, while it should be said that antitrust is always and everywhere an unfortunate look backwards by government lawyers constrained by the known, it’s no wonder that the Barack Obama DOJ and FTC didn’t raise an objection to Facebook’s acquisition of Instagram. The simple truth is that Instagram was largely unknown in 2012, and as an unknown, not at all a Facebook rival or peer. Evidence supporting the above claim can be found in the price Facebook paid for Instagram: $1 billion in cash and stock. Sorry, but such a purchase wasn’t evidence of a social media giant in Facebook buying its way out of competitive pressures, rather it was Mark Zuckerberg speculating on a future of social media that brought new meaning to opaque. In other words, if Instagram had even somewhat appeared as a future threat to Facebook or Facebook’s competition, there would have been a ferocious bidding war for Instagram that would have pushed its purchase price far, far above $1 billion. From there, consider Meta’s U.S. sales in 2025. Instagram presently accounts for 50 percent. Looking back to 2012, if Instagram had at all been seen as such a substantial future source of Facebook or Meta revenues, then the 2012 buyout price for it would once again have been far, far above $1 billion. Yet Matheson is basing his case on Facebook spending what was even then a somewhat piddling sum to ward off its oncoming status as a has-been victim of Schumpeterian “creative destruction”? Such a view isn’t serious. What is serious and dangerous at the same time is that Meta and Zuckerberg are being forced to spend precious time in court for having seen the future of social media much more clearly than their rivals. In other words, rather than rest on his wildly successful Facebook laurels, the future-seeing Zuckerberg worked feverishly to discover ways to continue to meet, and much more important, lead the needs of a social media user base that had alternate options then, and still does now. It all raises a question: since when is vastly improving the user experience with free services the stuff of antitrust violations? Tick tock, tick tock. All of which brings us back to how Matheson framed his opening statement, and most notably the case-neutering line about Facebook buying out its rivals rather than competing with them. Which means Matheson is basing his gossamer thin argument on the easy-to-discredit notion that 2012 resembled 2025 in a commercial sense. Except that it didn’t, and Meta still has its $1 billion receipt from its Instagram purchase to prove that it didn’t.

If Muse isn't creating games, then what is it creating - and how should we respond? Earlier this month, Microsoft set loose upon the world a new, publicly-available demo of its video game-focused generative AI model, Muse. As far as demos go, it was a significant one: a playable, browser-based "AI rendition" of legendary first-person shooter Quake 2. But rather than landing as, say, an impressive demonstration of Microsoft's bounding progress in artificial intelligence, the Quake 2 "Copilot gaming experience" was widely slammed by the gaming public as, amongst many other things, "shit". The criticism has been more or less universal, ranging from members of the public describing it as "absolutely fucking disgusting" and "like horrible Nyquil-induced sleep paralysis", to a Forbes "review" of the game that called it "an abomination". Members of the games press condemned reporting in The Verge, which ran the headline "Microsoft has created an AI-generated version of Quake", as overly credulous, labelling any similar coverage as "unpaid PR work". Will Smith, a tech blogger, offered a more measured response but still concluded that it is ultimately "a gimmick. It's interactive video, and yeah, I guess that's impressive, but it doesn't capture the magic of interlocking systems that still makes playing Quake 2 fun in 2025, despite the fact that it's almost 30 years old and dates to the earliest days of 3D graphics." All of this comes just a couple of weeks after Microsoft's initial reveal of Muse itself, which that time featured non-interactive but similarly murky footage based on Ninja Theory's Bleeding Edge - and which received a similarly heated response. That first unveiling also came with further issues of its own. Reactions zeroed in on the notion of Muse being used for "gameplay ideation" in particular, as well as Xbox chief Phil Spencer's seemingly outlandish claim, in an accompanying video, that Muse could "radically change how we preserve and experience classic games in the future," making older games compatible with "any device". It was a messy reveal. At the time, we clarified - with the help of AI expert Dr Michael Cook - that Muse very much was not "creating games". As Cook laid out in his blog, the research paper Microsoft had published in Nature alongside the reveal of this model "is not really about 'generating gameplay' or 'ideas'," but is instead, "about these researchers thinking about the implications of how people will work with these tools." But that didn't mean there weren't plenty of limitations and concerns. On Spencer's comments on preservation, for instance, Cook noted: "I could ask my friend's five-year-old son to draw a crayon picture of what he thinks the ending cutscene of Final Fantasy 8 looks like and that would still count as game preservation of a certain sort." All in all, it leads to what is on the surface an utterly bizarre situation. Microsoft, one of the world's wealthiest businesses, is committing presumably vast sums of money towards the work of its Muse AI research team. The research team features a number of experts, such as Dr Sam Devlin and research lead Dr Katja Hofmann, that are well-known and widely cited in their field. And the early results of this research are something that almost everyone in the industry seems to totally despise. There is intense scepticism towards what Muse AI does, what it could do, and whether it could ever be useful for anything. But what is actually going on? Can the research team behind it offer more credible answers? And how, exactly, ought we react to all of it? To help understand, I spoke to two of the people who have been at the heart of the conversation around Muse since its reveal: Drs Mike Cook and Katja Hofmann. Cook is a senior lecturer in computer science at King's College London and specialises in artificial intelligence, specifically computational creativity, automated game design, and design and analysis of generative software. We've covered his work on Eurogamer a few times over the years, including an AI program he built, ANGELINA, which was capable of creating video games of its own back in 2013, and his quest to see if it could win a game jam the following year. He talks with the soft directness of a fast-moving lecturer who doesn't mind if you really can't keep up with the source material, as long as you're at least willing to keep trying. Speaking to me after the first Muse reveal, but before the second featuring Quake 2, I asked Cook to explain what was going on in the Bleeding Edge examples we were first given. "I suppose you could think of it as: if you showed ChatGPT a screenshot of a video game, and then you said, "Could you show me a video of what would happen if there was an enemy here", and it generates a video showing you the player playing from that screenshot, but with an enemy on the screen," he says. That's a "very clumsy" summary, he adds, "but basically that's what they're trying to do." A key point to emphasise here is, as Cook says, that "it's generating images. It's not generating code or anything like that." It's a series of images forming a video, and that video is what's known as being "conditioned", in AI research terms. "It's conditioned on inputs," Cook explains, in the same way that an image generation tool such as Midjourney "is image generation conditioned by text." If you tell an AI image generator you want an image of a cat, for instance, "it generates an image and then it looks at the text and it's like, this can't be any image; it has to be an image of a cat." With Muse, that conditioning is "on not just the video of people playing the game, but actually the buttons they were pressing." This means that when we talk about the 'playable' models, such as this latest version of Muse, and Google's similarly controversial Genie, "it is doing video generation, but you can also say "Generate the next frame of the video if the jump button was being pressed," and it will take that into account when it generates the next frame." The key point here is that this all remains fundamentally predictive, in the same way that large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are ultimately predicting sequences of words based on your text prompts. I put the same explain-this-to-me-like-the-layperson-I-am question to Hofmann, who is senior principal researcher and the lead of Microsoft's game intelligence research team. Softly spoken, with a slight German accent, Hofmann is a precise talker, measuring words in her combination of seasoned public spokesperson familiar with the conference trail, and excitable research grad who still believes in the work. "In simple terms," she says, the first model "shows we can train an AI simulation of an existing video game. So that means if we train a model on the game visuals and the control actions, we learn a model that is then able to simulate this." So, she continues, "you create a small, playable scene, that's only backed then at inference time by the model," inference time being the duration it takes for the model to process new, unseen data and make predictions on it. In the "real time" version of this model, then, this actually "allows players to connect the controller and play within the imagination - or play within the model." In even more simple terms, think of it like this: Muse is a model that generates simulated video footage of the video game it's been trained on, and simulates interactivity with that footage by predicting what your button presses would cause that video footage to do, and then replicating those. So if, for example, all of the Bleeding Edge footage used as training data shows that when players push the right analogue stick upwards in Bleeding Edge, the camera looks upwards, then when "playing the model", pushing the analogue stick upwards likewise causes the simulated video feed to tilt upwards towards the sky. All this notion of "playing" Muse raises one particularly important question: is Muse generating video games? The emphatic answer from both Hofmann and Cook is, essentially: no. For Cook, there's a question about whether it's even accurate to describe Muse, and similar models such as Genie or Oasis, as "playable" at all. "On YouTube you can watch panoramic video and turn your head around, but that's not "playable" video. That's just a video that has some interaction with it." At the same time, he says, "if you think about those streaming services where you were playing at home and your keyboard inputs were being sent to a server," such as say, Xbox Cloud Gaming, Nvidia GeForce Now, Amazon Luna or the doomed Google Stadia, "your computer was just showing you video. And the video was kind of conditioned on keyboard inputs." It's best to think of it instead as "video of a 3D world, but the 3D world doesn't really exist." Whether that does or doesn't disqualify it from actually being a game is up for debate. As Cook himself says, "it gets a bit philosophical at some point." (An example of a natural follow-on question that's either fascinating or incredibly boring to you, depending on your persuasion: does a video game world defined by fixed code "exist"? Does it exist on your hardware more than a streamed one from a server? Or, as in Muse's case, a very murky, inconsistent one conjured on the spot from no code at all?) During our initial conversation, Hofmann extended an invitation to visit the Microsoft AI research team's offices in Cambridge in order to try out a demo of Muse in person. There, she elaborated further on this notion of playing the model, rather than its attempt at recreating a game. "We're trying not to refer to it as a game, because it is not a game," Hofmann tells me during the in-person demo, which this time takes place after the reveal of the Quake 2 simulation. "We're thinking of "playing the model", so that exploratory kind of interaction of figuring out: What are the limitations? Where does it break? What doesn't work, what works?" To Hofmann, it's a process she feels is "fascinating," albeit joking that said fascination might be reserved for a very specific subset of researchers who share her enthusiasm. In fact to Hofmann, testing the boundaries of where the model breaks is in many ways part of the point of publishing the Quake 2 demo, and indeed creating it in the first place. She compares it to other, non-interactive generative AI favourably in that sense, in that with attempting to replicate video games you can simply find the flaws much faster. "If you interact with a chatbot, you never get that immediate experience of: I can essentially see where data is missing, or where it's making mistakes. Here, because we're so wired for 3D interaction and visual interaction, we get that immediate experience of: you can literally debug the model by going in and playing within this environment," she says. "And to me, that is the key fascinating aspect of what we're able to show here." Having "played the model" myself both via the online, browser-based Quake 2 Copilot demo and again in person, via an Xbox controller connected to Hofmann's laptop, this notion does have an element of truth to it. I played an updated version of the Bleeding Edge-based simulation alongside the Quake 2 one - both based on WHAMM (note the second M), which is the more recent version that makes the Quake 2 demo possible - and also tested out the drag-and-drop functionality of adding interactable items, jump pads, and enemies in real time. It's worth making very clear up front that both of them are, as video games, utterly terrible, for all the many reasons already detailed at length and with far more satisfying bite elsewhere than I could ever conjure: they're fuzzy, laggy, nightmarish non-places, chugging along at nine frames per second, crucially without much in the way of consistent internal logic, let alone meaning or intent. They are, by every measure of playability, unplayable. However, treated as a kind of meta-game, where the challenge isn't within the game but in just attempting to successfully play it at all, there is something at least novel and interesting here. In one moment of quasi-Quake 2, for instance, I found myself stuck in a dark, underwater secret area with no apparent way out, not helped by the vagueness and inconsistency of the visuals and controls. Then I realised I could "play the model" to escape, effectively gaming its 0.9 second memory by looking at a dark wall for a moment, then turning back around to discover the world had totally changed and a route was now clear. These are, in their own ways, the kinds of consistent rules we need to make something a game, learned in the same way we learn any other mechanic or moment of internal game logic: if I do X, Y happens. That, technically, is a video game. And arguably an interesting one, if only given its novelty and context, much the same way as an out-there art gallery installation can be when you're only interacting with it once or twice. But also still not a particularly good one. That also ties into the natural follow-on question here, which asks what the actual point of this model is, and what its uses might or might not eventually be. If the question of whether or not Muse's synthetic creations are video games seems a tad murky, this next one's about as clear as mud. Who, or what, is Muse actually for? Again, this question rapidly takes on a philosophical form as soon as you begin to prod at it, but before we get to the real chin-stroking it makes sense to run through the proposed uses that've already been suggested so far. One of the prominent, and most easy to dismiss, is this notion of preservation touted by Phil Spencer. Hofmann, it's worth noting, was on that slightly odd, video call-style reveal video with Spencer when he raised this as a possibility. I asked her whether she felt that was a genuinely feasible use for Muse, now or at any point in the future. "What I see at this point in time is that we're having so many conversations on what could be the potential branch-out points into real applications," she said, "and game preservation has been one of them that multiple people have brought up. And one that Phil, for example, was particularly excited about." However, she continued, "I see this as one of the capabilities of not something that is, in any full form, feasible today. I like to ground it in: what's feasible today is I can create a simulation of a level in a game, that gives you a sense of playing a version of that game, that is not exactly like the real game." "My sense is that over the next decade, this technology will mature," she added, noting that she felt it "perfectly feasible" to believe it could eventually be "a very general way" of preserving a video game in some form. "I'm certain it won't be the only one. But I see that. I do see it as something that could be exciting to explore along with other application areas." Cook is unequivocal here, meanwhile. "Think about your favourite game, and think about the footage of it that's on YouTube," he said. "If we were going to learn the game based on that footage, what stuff isn't seen very often? What stuff is maybe not seen at all? Maybe there's secrets no one's ever found. Bugs, glitches. "And also on maybe a stupider kind of level - but still important to think about - is things like when dataminers find cut content from Elden Ring. Or how if you look in very old games, you can find comments in the codebase from developers who are working at 4:00am and writing messages in the code. That stuff obviously can't be locked, can't be recovered, because the computer can't see it." An analogy he offers here: "The Globe Theatre that I walk past is not the real Globe Theatre. It's still useful that we built it. But it would be great if we also had the original." Hypothetically, he adds, even if this method got "99 percent of the way there, ultimately it isn't the same as actually recording the code base, for a million and one reasons." The next suggestion here feels like less a piece of executive ad-libbing, and more a central to Microsoft's core pitch for Muse: "gameplay ideation" - a rather corporate term for, essentially, thinking up stuff you can do in a game. Muse is explicitly being touted as a potential tool for helping with this, but crucially, and as we've already clarified, it's not coming up with ideas or inventing gameplay itself in any way. "There are philosophical questions around: can models be creative?" Hofmann said, when I asked her to clarify. "And I'm quite firmly on the side that they are not. I've seen a lot of confusion around that in the literature. But by framing Muse as: it is a simulation of an existing video game, I think that quite firmly emphasises that the model in itself is not creative." What the research team was instead aiming to achieve, after conversations with developers internally at Microsoft, "was exactly to tease out the model capabilities that could unlock human creativity." In other words, the team is attempting to figure out how models like this, if they were to become faster, more efficient, more accurate and so on, might be useful to human developers in the future. In this case, it comes back to the initial demonstration of Muse with Bleeding Edge, where you could drag and drop something into the game - a jump pad, an explosive barrel, an enemy - and then quickly see how that plays out. Is that actually feasible as a method of seriously prototyping game ideas, and even if it was, would it actually be helpful? With the first question, Hofmann describes the output of the current version of the model as "not-fully-working" and for now only an example of "signs of life", but despite plenty of scepticism from the watching public, her confidence in its ability to improve seems ironclad. That confidence is based on what Hofmann believes to be genuine discoveries in how these models can operate, she explains, such as gaining an understanding of "how we can curate data to craft - or to train - models that capture those structural relationships in the data." By "structural relationships", she adds, what she specifically means is "the understanding of how this model is able to translate an image into numbers, and then learn how those numbers relate to each other." In the simplest possible terms, Hofmann feels the team has learned how being specific with training data in certain ways can give you much more reliable outputs, and with less data required. That newfound understanding has "opened up this really big space around how specifically curated data sets and multi-modal models interact with each other, and the kinds of structures they're able to learn." When does that potential become actual, usable reality for some kind of developer-friendly jump pad-testing tool? There's "a lot of runway", she says, though "I can't give you a timeline. I can't tell you specifically which innovation is going to come after the other, but it's basically opened up this huge, huge space… I cannot see the end of how far we're going to be able to get with that." Whether or not this might actually be useful to developers is another issue, however. Cook, for his part, is sceptical again, suggesting more immediately helpful (and efficient) avenues for this kind of tool might be found in quickly adding a splash of a game's visuals and other details to standard whiteboxing, or adding new forms of immediate, quickfire automatic playtesting that don't currently exist. "Human playtesters exist," he says, "but there are some techniques that require you to have an automatic playtester." Nevertheless, Cook is keen to praise Microsoft for having actually sought input from real game developers, something that Hofmann also repeatedly points to. "One of my favourite things about the paper is that they actually sat down with developers and talked to them," Cook says, "and often they talked of developers that were already very positive about the technology - but they still actually said to them: What would a workflow that looks useful for you be? I thought that was really important and we need more of that stuff." One other, important question comes up here, when it comes to the practical implementation of this kind of hypothetical tool. How could a developer use Muse to simulate adding a new mechanic to an in-development game, when doing so currently requires training Muse on, as in Bleeding Edge's case, about 7000 hours of the already-finished game's footage? Hofmann argues the team has indeed thought of this, and it came up in the conversations the research team had with developers. "We look at: assume a scenario where let's say someone has built out a first level of a new game that they're working on - how little data might they need to train a model like this?" The team is "nowhere near the full version of making that real," she said, "but we now know that we can get away with as little as about 50 hours of gameplay from a given game level to create a really nice, consistent representation in that." The very fact that there is so much uncertainty over possible uses for Muse, however, leads on to yet another, regularly posed query. Isn't this all being done back to front? "A solution looking for a problem" is a criticism regularly levied at all kinds of AI ventures, particularly generative AI ones. In many cases it feels entirely justified. AI-generated video and images, such as those produced by Midjourney and Sora, have thus far failed to find any real purpose beyond generating low-effort memes, objectionable propaganda and disinformation, or unanimous criticism whenever used in relation to a video game. Generative text, such as ChatGPT, has fared better in terms of gaining weekly users, which have landed in the hundreds of millions, but poorly in terms of actually making any money from that (the vast majority of those users use it for free, and using it costs OpenAI a huge amount of money). Text-based gen-AI's main uses seem to remain helping Instagram influencers and spammers to rapidly fill out inessential image captions to game the algorithm, meanwhile, or disrupting more trustworthy Google search results with such valuable advice as eating rocks for good health. Naturally, that same criticism was levied again at Muse after its reveal of the Quake 2 demo. Sos Sosowski, an indie developer, issued one of the most widely-shared putdowns on BlueSky with exactly this. "That's very on-track with [the] AI trend," he wrote. "A solution looking for a problem. It's yet another in a series of "reveals" that is bug-ridden and broken." In talking to Cook and Hofmann, who both work in very different areas of AI-based academic research, I was particularly curious about this. How does the actual timeline of research unfold here? Whose idea was Muse? How did it begin, or change over time? And is it normal to do things this way round, in the academic world, in researching technology first and worry about finding a use for it later? "What used to happen at Microsoft Research Cambridge - I used to know someone who worked there," Cook says, "and they used to joke that they felt like Microsoft didn't know they existed, and in a good way. Because they didn't ask what they were doing with their money, and so the researchers there would just do whatever they were interested in and had a great time doing it." The one exception to that? "The Xbox team that was there - and I think over time, there's been more scrutiny on what the AI teams are doing." He has a few suggestions as to how this initial research might have come to be. Sometimes, he explains, "ideas like this are born out of a single researcher or a hackathon day, or a conversation over coffee." Likewise, "it might have been born out of something more specific," like say, if there's a large data source that's already available. "So it's like: listen, we've got 400,000 hours of people playing this game, there must be something we can do with it." I put the same question to Hoffman, who for her part offered a detailed explanation which seems to quite closely echo some of Cook's best guesses. "Microsoft Research is quite unique, I would say, in that it's a very bottom-up research organisation," she explains. "Our remit is to drive innovation, to drive the start of the art in our respective areas." In practical terms that means combining their research into machine learning with, for instance, "leveraging the rich data that we can in many cases responsibly obtain in video games, where we might be able to get to a scale or a variety that might be very, very difficult to collect in any other application area." That'll be the readily-available data theory, then, and in this case that's down to the End User License Agreement (EULA) that all players agree to when playing games on Xbox. Under that often-ignored agreement, Xbox was able to gather the video data of, for instance, Bleeding Edge gameplay that it used to train its model. This combination of the research area and the available data then melds with the "luxury" of Microsoft being a large, multidisciplinary company. That grants the research team the "opportunity of engaging with the rest of the company and seeing what's on people's minds," as Hofmann puts it, "and so we have those regular conversations with people in the gaming space to understand what limitations, what challenges they're facing. Where do they see things going?" The research team itself then decides, "within the team", how to direct its research. In this case, Hofmann says the notion of something to help with "ideation" was one that came more or less directly from conversations with developers. "Many of them felt that because game development is so expensive, and prototyping is expensive, everyone who mentioned it felt like they did not have the luxury of doing enough ideation and prototyping - which they felt limited the creativity of what ultimately got built," she explained. As for the specific timeline, Hofmann says the research team started discussions with Ninja Theory as far back as 2018, when Microsoft first purchased the developer, in part because the two are simply both based in Cambridge. The team looked at various options, "very much with an open-ended, exploration point of view - so there was never an expectation that any of the things that we do would actually be put into the games." Ninja Theory then offered the gameplay data the studio had collected under the Bleeding Edge EULA to the research team in 2020, the data was anonymised and imported, and the research carried on from there. The specifics of what the team actually chose to do with this data, meanwhile, wasn't fully settled on until the autumn of 2022, when Hofmann returned from maternity leave to a world where LLMs such as ChatGPT had begun to grow in use and public awareness. "The world had changed in AI," she says, "in the sense of, suddenly, the broad population knew what language models were and what they could do… and so we within the team took that step back and said, well, how does that impact our work? What are the next frontiers that we can explore?" Ultimately, they decided, "Well, we know what works for language, wouldn't it be amazing to figure out what happens when we train on a large amount of actual human gameplay data?" Notably, Muse is actually one of two research projects being worked on in parallel by the team. The group, of around 10 to 15 researchers, can usually accommodate around "one to three" projects at a time, Hofmann said, with Muse a "sustained effort over the better part of two years," and more than half the team involved for much of that time. There were in fact "multiple points" during the project where the team almost stopped work on it, with any further progress "in the balance" until the "huge public response" to the paper that was published in Nature back in late February allowed the team to continue. To come back to that core question of whether it's standard practice to work this way round, Hofmann's answer was clear: first that, yes, it is indeed normal. And second, in her view, that her research team actually placed more emphasis on practical uses than most research of this nature normally would. "In terms of the research process, it's very common to be purely curiosity driven," she said. "And in many ways, I see our project as an example of not doing it this way - which is ironic, because a lot of people don't see that. We started from technical curiosity, but as soon as we saw signs of life - of this is what it's able to do - we put together that interdisciplinary team. We did the user research to understand what the capabilities would be, how this ultimately enabled specific use cases, and then we were especially focusing on ideation and early prototyping. While Hofmann is clear about the order in which the research has unfolded, and the level to which developers have been consulted along the way, the elephant in the room is Microsoft itself. Microsoft is one of the world's largest publicly-traded companies, and one which happens to be in an arms race with other, AI-focused tech competitors, as each attempts to justify - and find a way to ultimately profit - from their investments. OpenAI notably lost $5bn last year and is projected to lose double that in 2025, and triple in 2026. In late February it was revealed that Microsoft had backed out of new datacentre leases with a power capacity equivalent to the entire operational IT load of London, potentially signalling a lack of demand to meet its previously planned generative-AI supply. There is, obviously, an incentive for Microsoft to reveal new, exciting things that can be done with generative AI as early as possible. As Cook puts it, while Muse "has some really interesting qualities to it" and there are "things in there that could be useful for developers," those things aren't really the focus of how the research was presented by Microsoft in the first place. "A lot of the positioning does seem to be: positioning yourself as a company that uses AI and that invests in AI and that is on top of AI advances. It does seem to be a shareholders thing." To Cook, the way Muse has been presented in general is a concern. To him, "there's a difference between what the researchers were trying to achieve, and how Microsoft presented it - and in this case, I thought it was very stark. I really felt like they were kind of hung out to dry in some ways." I put this to Hofmann - both the question of why this was being revealed to the public so early, given its "not-fully-working" nature, as Hofmann herself put it, and of whether she felt the team had struggled to communicate what their research actually was. "I think there's as many opinions and drivers of this as we have people in the team, and potentially a lot more," Hofmann laughed, on the topic of going public early. "Part of it comes from the academic research community. Within academic research, there is a drive and incentive and realisation that it's important to be as open as possible," she explains. "A lot of research does not get into the hands of people where they can try something this quickly… we said, 'Okay: there is something here that even has that possibility; a lot of research is not very accessible by definition; so here is something that could be accessible. Let's put it out.'" At the same time, Hofmann agrees it would be "largely accurate" to say there's been some difficulty in properly communicating what Muse is all about. "Our learnings are very much around: how do we explain what's happening here, what the technical capability is? How do we make that very clear? And with anything we explain, we'll never be able to reach everyone, but I'm certainly looking at the social media activity and I'm taking notes of, okay, here's where the confusion is." Hofmann maintains, however, that even though there's still "a lot of confusion around what it actually is and what is the purpose, and a lot of debate around that," there has been positive feedback for the team. "Interestingly, everyone who commented on the technical achievement called it impressive, or [were] even more hyperbolic. So on the technical level I'm really satisfied, because people appreciate the achievement, which is fantastic." That said, Hofmann concedes that the downside of going this early is the impact on the conversation. "It's not something that happens that commonly, even in an age where AI research does move quickly and people do push out an archive white paper or a video demonstration," she says. Typically, when researchers publish something usable, such as an app, members of the public "expect a certain level of product polish, and we're between those. The technology is not ready. We're very explicit - trying to be very explicit - that this is a technical demo where we intend to show what is becoming possible, and how the field is moving." The goal for that, she says, is to at least "give people that background" to be able to then compare progress down the line. "I'm hoping that ultimately, all those steps will lead to both us understanding how to communicate this more clearly, and then also to the public having built up some of that understanding that helps them interpret what's going on there." For all the big questions and elephants-in-the-room we've worked through so far, there is one more cluster to go that is without doubt the biggest: the many questions of ethics. As anyone loosely familiar with AI, particularly generative AI, will already know, there are a number of ethical issues that very justifiably arise with each discussion. The first of those is the matter of plagiarism - or intellectual property rights - which in the case of Muse is slightly easier to put aside. Microsoft owns Bleeding Edge developer Ninja Theory and also Quake 2, via Zenimax, and under the EULA therefore has rights to the gameplay footage used as training data here. (That said, there are of course ethical questions about whether it's right for Microsoft, or any entity, to impose EULAs which collect user data at will on anyone wanting to play their games. And indeed about whether it's right for Microsoft to own such a large share of the games industry today - but these are questions for another time.) More applicable here is the second essential question with generative AI ethics, which is the environmental impact from the sheer amount of energy used to both train the model, and then to use it in practice. "The energy cost is, I would say, more than you would want for an actual player-facing experience," Hofmann said regarding the Quake 2 demo, when I asked her about this. That public demo uses Nvidia H100 GPUs for the inference, which Hofmann describes as "very similar to an LLM, or a chat bot," in terms of energy cost, and similarly for the training process as well. "What's making me optimistic about where we can push this is, one, the insights from those last two months around how little data, how little training, and how small a model we could get away with," she adds, which she claims is "nowhere near the end" right now. "We haven't really optimised this for inference cost, for example, or for more efficient training." "I can't tell you when, but I'm confident this will run on a consumer GPU, or an NPU [neural processing unit] on a mobile phone," she says, giving a rough estimate of "less than two years" until that's possible in terms of inference cost. As for training cost, "the more we learn about how to do this data efficiently, the more we pave the way to something that is truly democratising access to this." I asked Hofmann if she knew the specific numbers involved in terms of current energy cost, either to train or to "play" the model, to which she directed me to Microsoft PR. Microsoft PR told us they did not have anything additional to share beyond what had been published via the company's blog. As far as broader ethical concerns go, this is far from the last of it. Cook, for instance, suggests one less-cited worry with 3D video game gen-AI more broadly: "It feels like it's sort of a long play for moving toward robotics," he says. "Obviously a lot of these researchers are interested in this stuff for their own sake," he notes, but large tech companies - including those beyond Microsoft, such as Alphabet and Meta - are at least partially looking into AI as it corresponds to video games specifically, he says, because "these projects have two features: they work on video data; and they need to have some model of the world when an action is taken. And these two things are also really important for robots." He qualifies this, adding, "I know the Muse team, they're interested in games, they're really excited by this stuff. But I think one of the reasons why we're seeing big tech companies invest more in this kind of game-modelling stuff, and why they often talk about it as "worlds" and things like that, is because games have always been a research platform for other purposes." Less speculatively, there's the more immediate fact that, as Cook puts it, "for lots of the proposals for tools that are powered by AI, their use case seems to be that they would reduce employment. There doesn't seem to be a way around this." Coupled with a growing concern that video game bosses may be implementing AI in their workplaces with a mixture of ignorance and artlessness - one recent report based on a handful of accounts quoted anonymous developers, with one describing it as "an overwhelmingly negative and demoralising force" - there is plenty of reason for those concerns. All combined, it makes for an almighty mixture of ethical, philosophical, scientific and financial questions - which perhaps is to be expected, given the broader state of AI and the public's natural response to it right now. All those issues are only heightened and complicated by this practice of essentially performing scientific research in front of a live audience, be that out of the pure idealism of accessibility or, I can't help but suspect, the business incentive to do so. For Hofmann, it remains a project that, at least to her, is as personally worthwhile as it is anything else. Her hope is that regardless of the ultimate use case, the research may "add to the wealth and breadth of interactive experiences that are available to us," be that through adding these dream-like (or maybe more accurately for the foreseeable: somewhat nightmarish) elements of an AI-generated game simulation directly, as some kind of additional medium for artistic expression, or in just helping developers think up something else entirely. "I love video games; I recently got back into Quake 2," she laughs, "I played Cocoon recently… I don't even define myself as a gamer, but there aren't enough games to satisfy the time I would like to spend playing." For her, she concludes, "if people are able to use this to create something that is meaningful to them, and there are people who enjoy it - if I could play a role in that, I'd be happy." A fellow researcher, I get the sense that Cook remains sympathetic to Hofmann and her team, even if the goals and natures of their research are notably different. I ask him somewhat bluntly, towards the end of our conversation, if he feels people are right in reacting so viscerally to what Microsoft revealed, even with all the communication mishaps, the well-meaning intentions, and the public learning-on-the-fly in mind. "I think it's justified for a number of reasons," he says. "One of the reasons is just simply that people are so burned out and hurt by all of the things that are happening in the space, that I think there's just a general sense of anger and despair. And I think that's completely understandable." The industry has, of course, been going through a prolonged period of unprecedented layoffs and general uncertainty. The people staying in the industry after all this, as Cook puts it, "they're doing it because they truly love it and they want to do it, and so seeing this creative practice that they love treated in a sort of disrespectful way, it hurts them as well. It's not just about the morals or the ethics or anything like that. This is a thing they care about." When it comes to this practice of doing science in public, and how these findings are presented, he adds, "I see that there's a responsibility. The public are not stupid, but they can only work with the information they're given, and often they're given really bad information." "And so we have to think that going with these gut reactions makes sense right now; it's all we've got to work with. And then hopefully over time, in the future, we can slightly start to build trust again and figure out the bits of AI that we want to keep and that we like." A final, forgotten question for Cook is also the most important. "Not even: does it make games better; but do people want it? And they don't have to want it - technology is rejected all the time, for all sorts of reasons," he says. "So with generative AI, the question should just be: do we want this? We don't have to do anything. We don't even have to make games if we don't want to. Sometimes we forget that we do have this power; we can just not have something if we don't want to. And so players should think more about: what do they really want from the future of games? Because they can want anything. They don't just have to want the things that they see in tech demos, at E3. They can build whatever future industry they want."

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. TOPSHOT - A trader makes a bubble with a chewing gum ahead of the closing bell on the floor of the ... More New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on January 29, 2019 in New York City. (Photo by Johannes EISELE / AFP) (Photo credit should read JOHANNES EISELE/AFP via Getty Images) A simple options trade turned pennies into dollars - and the next move might already be brewing. Let’s rewind the clock to March 31st, 2025. SPY - the S&P 500 ETF - closed just above $559. Markets weren’t exactly calm as they had been falling for the past month. But the real trigger was yet to come. Trump was about to announce his tariff policy. Separately, tariff talk has been hurting tech stocks. See Meta Stock To $400? It wasn’t some backroom rumor - it was publicly known, and this created the perfect setup to go “long on volatility” - something not a lot of investors think about. When a shake-up like this happens, volatility spikes. It simply means making money when the volatility goes up. How could you have done that? Here is the trade: You could have bought put options on 31st Mar 2025, or if you were unsure of potential direction, hedged it by buying a call too and made it a straddle. And then squared off the trade a week later, bagging a massive sum. Missed SPY Opportunity If you had tossed in $1,000 on those puts, you’d be walking away with $30,000. Sure, you might not want to risk that much on options, but even a $100 risk could have made you $3,000 in a week. Not a bad trade, right? True. Nobody has a crystal ball. But that’s the wrong question. The better question is: Was it reasonable to expect something to happen? And the answer is: Absolutely! The market had priced in some tension, but it wasn’t bracing for a real shock. And if you’ve traded through enough macro events - tariff talk, Fed surprises, geopolitical curveballs - you know that buying options during uncertain times can pay off big. Not always. But often enough to make it worth a shot. Buying puts wasn’t a crazy gamble - it was a calculated hedge against known risk. And if you were more balanced, even buying a straddle (put + call) would’ve given you upside either way. SPY closed at just under $538 yesterday, 15th Apr 2025. The markets are still twitchy, the volatility has crept higher over the last three months, and option prices are reflecting that. Here’s what’s interesting: If you look at at-the-money straddles (call and put premiums combined for $538 strike - current SPY levels) expiring Tuesday next week, they’re priced around $14.70 or a little under 3% of the current SPY price. This implies the market expects a move of a little under 3% in either direction. Is that realistic? Maybe. Maybe not. But here’s the thing: Short-term volatilities in the market are not uncommon and are often challenging to navigate. However, long-term outperformance is hopefully what matters to you. If so, consider investing in Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics

Good morning. Bill Gates says AI is coming for a slew of jobs, including two that once seemed tech-proof: teachers and doctors. What will be left for us humans to do? "Retire early," Gates said. In today's big story, Wall Street dealmakers thought Trump was the answer. Now, they're not so sure. What's on deck Markets: Why I want to work on Wall Street: College students explain. Tech: OpenAI is on a hiring spree, and one area of investment stands out. Business: Realtors and Zillow are going to war, but homebuyers will pay the price. But first, Wall Street is having doubts. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. "I don't know how you couldn't be embarrassed," a managing director at a middle market-focused investment bank told BI. They were talking about the many soothsayers in Wall Street's C-suites who had bet that the new administration would revive a comatose dealmaking market. Things haven't quite worked out that way. Goldman Sachs said that the paralyzed deal market dragged revenue from deal work down 22% in the first quarter, compared with the same period last year. On every bank's Q1 earnings calls in recent days, one person loomed large: President Donald Trump. No CEOs mentioned him by name. Instead, they talked about uncertainty, worried clients, and a concerning economic outlook, BI's Reed Alexander writes. "While our corporate and consumer clients are resilient and in good financial health, the world is in a wait-and-see mode and is facing a more negative macro outlook than anyone had anticipated at the beginning of the year," Jane Fraser, the CEO of Citigroup, said. Behind the scenes, bankers told BI that they were feeling less diplomatic about the Trump administration and its tariff policies: "If you're an executive in finance and you talk to clients frequently and you understand how the world works, there's no way you can't be upset." A fuller picture of how Trump is impacting Wall Street may not emerge until the next earnings season later this summer. Many of the worst days of recent volatility happened in April — the second quarter. Whether the White House will care is another matter. 1. Netflix: Sell-off, who? Netflix's shares have climbed more than 10% in 2025, outperforming its mega-cap tech peers and a struggling broader market. Some analysts consider the stock to be recession-resistant. 2. Bring it on, Wall Street. A career path in finance can be notoriously brutal, but young people are embracing it anyway. More than 150 Wall Street-bound college students told BI their hopes, fears, and reservations about launching careers in the industry. 3. Should investors go risk-on again or stay defensive? President Trump recently hinted at a potential exemption for the auto industry. It's not the first time he's walked back on tariffs, and some investors are questioning if they should stop taking his remaining tariff threats seriously. 1. OpenAI's hiring spree. The AI startup's looking for new talent as it ramps up its infrastructure ambitions. Dozens of open roles related to AI infrastructure are listed on its website. 2. Zuck still seems salty about a failed deal from 12 years ago. Mark Zuckerberg's failed Snapchat bid from 2013 resurfaced at Meta's antitrust trial, and it doesn't sound like he's over it. He told the court Meta would've accelerated Snap's growth if the deal went through, FWIW. 3. Alphabet's supply-chain project is going solo. Chorus, Alphabet's bet on optimizing the global supply chain, is becoming an independent company, its CEO told BI. After several years under Alphabet's X incubator, the companies believe spinning it off will help Chorus move faster. 1. Realtors and Zillow are going to war. Last week, Zillow unveiled a new rule that would ban home listings that are initially selectively marketed to the public. The move takes direct aim at giant real estate brokerages — and it's bound to start an ugly fight. 2. This app wants to pay you to shop. No, it's not a scam. Claim gives users money to redeem at partner businesses each week. Its CEO told BI he wants it to disrupt the advertising sector and help combat the youth loneliness epidemic. Here's how it works. 3. Fewer planes in the skies. United Airlines announced it's cutting domestic flights by 4% starting in July, citing less travel demand. The company said it was "impossible to predict this year with any degree of confidence." The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York (on parental leave).

ByTom Aspray ByTom Aspray, Contributor. Stock market data growth chart graph investment finance analysis fintech financial district The roller-coaster ride in the stock market has continued as Friday’s seemingly positive reduction in the tariffs on electric goods was deemed temporary on Sunday before the markets opened on Monday. China’s new policy on not accepting the delivery of Boeing jets was announced early Tuesday which is a further sign that the trade war is heating up not cooling down. The new rhetoric on pharma tariffs once again does not exhibit any real understanding of what new tariffs might mean. In a Tuesday CNBC interview, former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb revealed that “just about 70% of the key ingredients, key chemicals substances that are used” to make widely used generic drugs all originate in China. The former FDA commissioner is concerned that additional tariffs on some of these life-saving drugs, which have a small profit margin, will not continue to be produced because of new tariffs. After the market closed a regulatory filing by NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) reported that the U.S. “required required licenses for exports to China of the company's H20 artificial intelligence chip. The chip giant said the move would result in $5.5 billion in charges to the company.” In early trading Wednesday, NVDA was down 6.7%, trading at $104.71, which is down $7.50 from Tuesday’s close. There had been some signs over the past few days that the rebound was losing upside momentum. QQQ Many stocks opened very strong on Monday as there were hopes the Friday announcement of lower tariffs might be a sign of progress. The Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) had closed on Friday at $454.40 but opened Monday at $464.46 which was 2.2% higher. QQQ closed Monday at $457.48 which was well below the day’s high of $465.05. On Tuesday the QQQ again traded above the 20-day EMA at $461.32 but closed at $457.99. There is chart support to watch at Friday’s low of $441.33 with the monthly S1 pivot support at $446.74. The Nasdaq 100 A/D line has just rebounded back to its EMA as it closed just above it on Tuesday. If the QQQ A/D numbers are negative on Wednesday it will be consistent with a failing rally. There is support at the recent lows and then the uptrend, line c. The AD line needs to move above the downtrend, line b, to signal that the correction in QQQ is over. The relative performance (RS) is above its EMA but it needs to overcome the recent highs to indicate that QQQ is now leading the SPY. A move above the major RS resistance at line d is needed to confirm that QQQ is leading the SPY. NYSE Composite The loss of upside momentum was also evident on the more broadly-based NYSE Composite as it closed Tuesday on the day’s lows as it failed to reach the 20-day EMA at 18,663. There is further chart resistance, line a, in the 18,818 area. The NYSE McClellan Oscillator rallied from the April 8 low to close Tuesday just above zero at +10.59. The downtrend at line b needs to be overcome to signal a further rally. The NYSE All Advance/Decline line has rallied from the recent lows but is still below the declining EMA and resistance at line d. The downtrend in the A/D line (line c) needs to be overcome to turn it positive. The S&P futures are down 41 points at 8:30 a.m. ET, which is an hour before the open. Of course, it is the close that will be more important. If the stock market declines sharply for a few days it will hopefully encourage a return to sanity before there are new ill-informed tariffs on the pharma industry.

U.S. stock futures moved lower Wednesday as investors braced for another wave of geopolitical and earnings headlines. S&P 500 futures were down 0.5%, the Dow hovered near flat, and Nasdaq futures dropped more than 1%. These are the stocks most likely to shape the news. Wednesday’s most closely watched story centers on Nvidia (NVDA), which disclosed a $5.5 billion charge tied to new U.S. government restrictions on exporting its H20 AI chips to China. The Biden administration initially crafted the export controls to limit China’s access to advanced semiconductors — but under Trump, the policy has sharpened. Nvidia’s stock is down nearly 7% premarket. Given its rank as the third-largest U.S. company by market value, the fallout could be wide. Chipmaker AMD (AMD) also dropped 6% premarket. In Europe, semiconductor equipment giant ASML (ASML) reported first-quarter sales of €7.7 billion — just below analyst forecasts — and warned of “greater uncertainty” ahead due to U.S.-China tariff tensions. ASML, which makes the machines used in cutting-edge chip manufacturing, has seen its shares fall 28% over the past year despite the AI boom. Also before the bell, Abbott Labs (ABT) — best known for developing medical devices and consumer health staples like Pedialyte and Ensure — topped earnings expectations, reporting adjusted EPS of $1.09 on 4% reported sales growth. Its medical devices segment surged nearly 13% on an organic basis, driven by a 20% jump in diabetes care. Shares were flat to modestly higher ahead of the open. Prologis (PLD), the world’s largest industrial REIT, posted first-quarter core FFO of $1.27 per share, meeting estimates. The company, which operates logistics hubs crucial to global supply chains, highlighted solid rent growth and occupancy, even as leasing cooled. “Policy uncertainty is making customers more cautious,” said CEO Hamid Moghadam. “But over the long term, limited new supply and high construction costs support continued rent growth.” Kinder Morgan (KMI), CSX (CSX), and U.S. Bancorp (USB) are also set to report Wednesday, offering insight into the state of energy infrastructure, transportation, and regional banking. Later in the day, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak on the economic outlook, while March retail sales data is due, offering a window into consumer behavior before the latest tariff escalation. The CNN (WBD) Fear & Greed Index remains stuck in “extreme fear” territory, a mood that’s proven hard to shake since President Trump’s early April tariff blitz. And for good reason: Even amid the hard numbers of earnings season, markets are now being driven less by fundamentals and more by policy whiplash. Mixed signals, selective leaks, and sudden reversals — often delivered via social media or offhand remarks — are proving just as influential as official actions. It’s not just the policy that’s unpredictable. The choreography is, too. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

U.S. markets fell sharply Wednesday, with chip stocks leading the retreat as U.S.-China trade tensions spooked investors. The tech-heavy Nasdaq closed down 3.1%, the S&P 500 lost 2.2%, and the Dow Jones Industrial average fell 700 points, or 1.7%. Losses rippled across sectors, dragging the Russell 2000 down 1.4%. Nvidia stock plunged 6.9% after the company disclosed a $5.5 billion charge linked to fresh U.S. export restrictions on its H20 AI chips — once seen as a workaround for earlier bans. AMD (AMD) stock fell 7.4%, while chip equipment giant ASML dropped 7% after it missed first-quarter revenue estimates and warned that escalating tariffs could cloud the global outlook through 2026. Markets retreated further as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that President Donald Trump’s tariffs were “highly likely” to fuel inflation, and suggested the central bank will wait to gauge their effect before lowering interest rates. “Tariffs are highly likely to generate at least a temporary rise in inflation,” Powell said during a speech at the Economic Club of Chicago. “The inflationary effects could also be more persistent. Avoiding that outcome will depend on the size of the effects, on how long it takes for them to pass through fully to prices, and, ultimately, on keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.” “For the time being,” Powell said, “we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity before considering any adjustments to our policy stance.” Still, there were bright spots. Abbott Labs (ABT) beat earnings expectations with adjusted EPS of $1.09 and double-digit organic growth in its medical device division, including a 20% jump in diabetes-related products. Prologis (PLD), the world’s largest industrial REIT, met forecasts with $1.27 in core FFO and reaffirmed guidance — but noted rising customer caution. Meanwhile, U.S. retail sales surged 1.4% in March, the biggest monthly gain since January 2023. Analysts said shoppers likely pulled purchases forward to avoid tariff-driven price hikes: Think customers loading up on TVs and T-shirts at Costco (COST) ahead of potential price pain. The CNN (WBD) Fear & Greed Index remains in “extreme fear” territory — a mood that’s proven hard to shake since Trump’s tariff barrage earlier this month. It should come as no surprise: This is a market increasingly driven by policy whiplash, cheerleading soundbites, and dropped hints of trade negotiations. Mixed signals, selective leaks, and sudden reversals — often via social media or offhand remarks — are proving as influential as official announcements. And it’s not just the policy that’s unpredictable. The choreography is, too. The most closely watched story Wednesday centered on Nvidia (NVDA), the third-largest U.S. company by market capitalization, and its disclosure of the $5.5 billion charge tied to new U.S. government restrictions on exporting its AI chips to China. The Biden administration originally designed export controls to curtail China’s access to advanced AI chips — but under Trump, the policy has sharpened. Also in chips news, semiconductor equipment giant ASML (ASML) reported first-quarter sales of €7.7 billion, or about $8.7 billion— below analyst expectations — and flagged “greater uncertainty” ahead due to tariffs. ASML, which makes the machines essential to high-end chip manufacturing, has seen its stock fall by 28% over the last year despite the AI boom. Elsewhere, China posted 5.4% GDP growth for the first quarter, matching the prior quarter. Export activity surged as companies rushed to ship goods ahead of expected new U.S. tariffs. Beijing also named a new top trade negotiator. Still, market watchers seemed to see little clarity ahead. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

With shares down over 40% from their 2024 peak, Adobe may appear to be struggling. But this type of weakness often attracts savvy investors. Still, investing in any single stock comes with risk. You can reduce that risk and still participate in the upside with our High-Quality portfolio, which has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, delivering returns of over 91% since launch. Adobe remains strong. Consider the following metrics: All of this comes with a P/E ratio below 25. That’s right, a sub-25 P/E for Adobe – one of the most reliable SaaS businesses out there. It’s a rare blend of quality and value that long-term investors seek. Here are the main reasons for the recent decline: But none of these factors undermine Adobe’s core strengths and long-term prospects. Beyond the compelling valuation, Adobe currently sits at a key technical support level that previously fueled rallies in 2020 and 2023. In 2023 alone, it surged nearly 80% from this price range. This isn’t just a number – it’s a historically proven base where market sentiment turns bullish. Adobe stands out as a timely opportunity. That said, timing individual stocks is difficult – it’s hard to consistently buy at lows or sell at highs. A more consistent approach is to use a periodic, trigger-based rebalancing strategy like we implement in our High Quality Portfolio. With 30 curated stocks, it has regularly outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four years. Why? The HQ Portfolio delivers better returns with lower volatility than the index, as shown by the HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Invest with Trefis Market Beating Portfolios | Rules-Based Wealth

Title: Engaging Women Investors To Reshape VC Funding For Female Founders

ByGeri Stengel ByGeri Stengel, Contributor. Investing in female-founded ventures offers women investors a powerful dual advantage: compelling ... More financial returns and the ability to foster meaningful societal impact. Leveraging her unique background in media, Catherine Gray is tackling the stark venture capital funding gap—where solely female-founded companies received just 2.1% of US VC in 2024. She sees it as a structural failure and a missed investment opportunity. Through her influential film, Show Her the Money, and the subsequent launch of the Silicon Valley Women Founders Fund, she's demonstrating how, using storytelling and direct investment, women investors can work together to unlock the proven potential of women entrepreneurs and reshape the investment landscape for both profit and purpose. Catherine Gray wasn’t always immersed in the world of venture capital. For 15 years, she was a leading account executive in cable television advertising. She then left that role to become vice president of advertising at the first gay cable network. That move marked a turning point in her career. She would dedicate her work to projects that make a meaningful difference. Gray produced a film supporting same-sex marriage and saw how powerful storytelling can help drive real change. That experience now drives her work in venture investing, where she’s tackling the deep gender gap in venture capital. The numbers paint a stark picture: In 2024, companies founded solely by women received a mere 2.1% of all venture capital dollars in the U.S., according to Pitchbook. Teams with male and female founders secured 20.9%, while male-only teams received the vast majority at 77%. Gray saw not just a discrepancy but a missed opportunity. The persistent under investment in female-founded startups is a challenge and a significant lost opportunity for investors seeking strong returns. She believes investing in women-led businesses is not just a way to make a social impact but also a huge investment opportunity. Recognizing the need to educate and engage a wider audience, Gray returned to film making. She created Show Her the Money, raising $1 million for its production. The movie's goal wasn’t just to recognize the problem but to make investing in venture capital feel impactful and within reach of women investors by telling an engaging story. The film struck a chord. It became a catalyst, sparking a global movement. Due to high demand, what started as a planned 50-city tour ballooned to over 150 screenings worldwide, proving Gray’s thesis: Storytelling could ignite understanding and enthusiasm for changing the venture landscape. This momentum also led directly to her co-founding the Silicon Valley Women Founders Fund, turning awareness into action. Understanding how women invest reveals why they are particularly well-suited for venture capital, an asset class poised for growth and impact. Research highlighted in the How Women (and Men) Invest in Startups* shows women are risk-astute investors. They recognize the importance of having a diversified portfolio by investing in different asset classes, such as private companies, and diversifying within the asset class. A long-term investment strategy can lead to more stable returns and lower costs, according to BlackRock. It takes time for an investment in a startup to reach its potential. This strategy aligns with women's tendency to invest for the long term. VC funds address practical considerations. Women often value investment guidance from financial advisors or the experienced partners managing a VC fund. When time is tight, like for most women, having professionals advising you on your investments can be a smart move. VCs do this for the investments they make. Many emerging manager funds also have lower minimums to encourage women to invest in this asset class. This makes the investing venture more accessible. Beyond delivering a return on their investment, women frequently prioritize investing in ways that make a positive social impact, according to How Women Invest’s research report. Catherine Gray echoes this, emphasizing that “venture capital uniquely allows investors to ‘vote with [their] money’ to support innovation that matters.” She notes the excitement of VC comes from meeting founders, gaining early access to groundbreaking ideas, and participating in building the future—blending wealth creation with tangible impact. Gray contrasts this with angel investing, suggesting VC funds offer built-in expertise, deal vetting, and inherent diversification, making the asset class feel less daunting and more aligned with the strategic, impact-oriented approach many women favor. Born directly from the momentum generated by the Show Her the Money film, the Silicon Valley Women Founders Fund represents Catherine Gray's commitment turned into tangible action. With a target of $100 million, the fund focuses on investing in pre-seed and seed-stage women-led technology companies across various sectors like FinTech and Climate Tech, ideally seeking innovations incorporating an AI component for efficiency. However, the fund aims to provide far more than just capital. Leveraging the corporate venture expertise of Gray’s partner, John Majeski (formerly with Dell, HP, and Lenovo), it offers portfolio companies a strategic advantage, helping them understand what large tech firms look for in acquisitions or partnerships. Majeski’s background is rooted in identifying and facilitating acquisitions for major technology companies, providing valuable insights into navigating the complexities of tech industry deal-making. This experience is crucial for startups looking to scale and achieve successful exits. He is also a producer of the movie.** The fund’s operational framework and investment strategy are also shaped by Joy Fairbanks, a partner with a strong background in institutional investing and launching accelerators. Fairbanks’s experience includes working with impact venture incubators and developing the structures for fund operations, including investor reporting, sourcing, and screening mechanisms. Her role involves not only vetting companies and conducting due diligence but also providing hands-on support through the fund’s venture studio, ensuring that portfolio companies receive comprehensive guidance. She is also an associate producer of the movie.** Their venture studio offers hands-on support in key areas like marketing, legal, and accounting—helping founders navigate the challenges that often stall early-stage startups. Just as important, the fund backs founders who share its values, placing as much weight on character as on innovative tech. True to its mission, 1% of the fund’s profits go to nonprofits that empower women and girls. This initiative reflects Gray’s hopeful outlook on today’s investment landscape. Where others see roadblocks, she sees openings to create meaningful change. She highlights the “great wealth transfer” as a pivotal moment—one where women are gaining unprecedented control over wealth and, with it, greater influence in venture capital and family office investments. It’s a moment ripe for funds like hers to thrive. Gray also sees her growing platform as a way to bring together women innovators from around the world. Her fund is just one part of the broader Show Her the Money movement, which includes an upcoming book, educational programs, and a potential docu-series—all focused on building a more inclusive and forward-thinking future. Investing in female-founded ventures offers a powerful dual advantage: compelling financial returns backed by data, and the ability to foster meaningful societal impact. Women investors and their allies can wield their investment power and shape an innovative economy that is more representative of society and their needs. * The author of this article company, Ventureneer, co-produced How Women (and Men) Invest in Women. ** The article was updated to provide more details about John Majeski’s involvement and to add Joy Fairbanks.

Title: Property prices up for the 18th month in a row, putting the squeeze on buyers

More new homes are needed to satisfy demand from first-time buyers. Photo: AP Property prices are likely to have risen for the 18th month in a row, piling pressure on buyers trying to secure their first home. Prices were up by 8pc in the 12 months to February. This is down from 8.2pc in the year to January, according to Central Statistics Office (CSO) data for February. More new homes are needed to satisfy demand from first-time buyers. Photo: AP Today's News in 90 seconds - 16th April 2025 Property prices in Dublin rose by 7.1pc, and prices outside Dublin were up by 8.7pc compared with February last year. The median price of a dwelling purchased in the 12 months to February was €360,000. The highest median price for a dwelling in February was €670,000 in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, while the lowest median price was €185,000 in Leitrim. The most expensive eircode area was A94, which is Blackrock, Co Dublin, with a median price of €747,750 Castlerea, Co Roscommon, where the eircode is F45, had the least expensive price of €148,000. Independent economist Austin Hughes said there are signs of slightly calmer conditions in the CSO data. “The February increase of 8pc is still strong and the pull-back is limited, but Irish house price inflation has eased now for six months in a row, having accelerated for the previous twelve months,” he said. “There is also a slight increase in transactions in the first two months of the year." Mr Hughes said a threatening global outlook, increased uncertainty about jobs and earnings in the multinational sector and broader affordability strains mean house price inflation should continue to soften through 2025. “However, further cuts in interest rates and a continuing shortfall in supply mean that we are likely to see a slowdown but not a slump in Irish property price inflation,” he said. In February, 3,245 dwelling purchases by households were filed with the Revenue Commissioners at a total value of €1.4bn. These purchases were made up of 2,645 existing dwellings and 600 new dwellings. Revenue data shows there were 1,195 first-time buyer purchases in February, an increase of 2.8pc on the 1,162 recorded in February last year. These purchases were made up of 366 new dwellings and 829 existing dwellings. The national index has now reached the value of 191.9, which is 17.3pc above its highest level at the peak of the property boom in April 2007. Dublin residential property prices are 4.4pc higher than their February 2007 peak. Prices in the rest of Ireland are 18.8pc higher than their May 2007 peak. Property prices nationally have increased by 161.6pc from their trough in early 2013. Dublin residential property prices have risen by 158.5pc from their February 2012 low. Prices in the rest of Ireland are 173.3pc higher than at the trough, which was in May 2013. The surge in prices is making it increasingly difficult for first-time buyers who are struggling to secure a property with a very limited supply for sale. A survey this month found that surging house prices have prompted large numbers of younger people to ditch their plans to buy a private home and instead apply for social housing. The dream of their own place is fading for people in their 20s and 30s as they are struggling to save for a deposit, despite large numbers getting help from parents. Most people surveyed are worried that property prices will continue to rise, squeezing more and more younger buyers out of the market, according to the latest PTSB “Reflecting Ireland” research. Almost half of people who are in the market to buy a home are now considering applying for social housing, according to a survey carried out by Core Research for PTSB. When it comes to those between the ages of 18 and 24, a total of 61pc say they will apply for social housing instead of trying to buy a home. Surging prices caused by a chronic deficit of new homes under construction are causing younger people to abandon their home ownership plans.

Title: The Death of ESG

Some have proclaimed ESG investing dead and buried. But if so, who killed it and why? Over the past few years, ESG investing has moved from a mainstream strategy promoted by the biggest asset managers in the world to a polarizing topic. Financial firms have scrubbed the acronym from their websites, dropped out of net-zero initiatives, and stopped advertising their climate efforts. Some have proclaimed ESG dead and buried. But if so, who killed it and why? The pushback to ESG gained steam in 2021, when Texas passed Senate Bill 13, an anti-ESG law. It prohibits any government entity in the state from doing business with financial firms found to be boycotting — as defined by Texas — the oil and gas industry. The resulting “blacklist” of companies deemed to be discriminating against oil and gas included financial firm BlackRock — which, ironically, invests billions of dollars in energy companies in Texas. Since then, legislators across the country have introduced more than 470 anti-ESG bills — some modeled after the 2021 Texas law — in 40 states, according to a legislative tracker maintained by climate research firm Pleiades Strategy. It’s not just politicians going after ESG. Behind this flurry of legislation lies a tangled web of different interests that have supported the plot to kill ESG: think tanks, state treasurers, oil and gas trade associations, culture warriors, and oil tycoons. In this episode – our ESG whodunit – we take out our magnifying glasses to take a closer look at the legislation that would spark dozens of other bills across the country. We’ll question a line-up of suspects at the center of the anti-ESG plot and dive into their motivations for protecting the fossil fuel industry.

Transcripts are generated using a combination of automated software and human transcribers, and may contain errors. Please check the corresponding audio before quoting it. Amy Scott: So how would you describe the smell? Elizabeth Trovall: It is, we haven't even gotten to the worst of it. Amy Scott: I'm on the bow of the Sam Houston, an elegant 95 foot boat with the breeze in my hair and the state flag of Texas flapping overhead. It's got the vibe of a pleasure cruise, if it weren't for the smell. Elizabeth Trovall: Oh yeah, now it's really pungent. Amy Scott: My colleague, Elizabeth Trovall, who covers energy for Marketplace, invited me on this boat tour, a ride along the Houston Ship Channel, the industrial waterway that connects the Port of Houston to the Gulf of Mexico. Voice 1: As we leave the Turning Basin, off to the left you will see public grain elevator number one... Amy Scott: Chugging along, we see big metal grain elevators and giant cargo ships from far away countries, which Elizabeth looks up on her phone. Elizabeth Trovall: Her length overall is 179.98 meters, and her width is 32 meters. She's a hefty lass. Amy Scott: Until we reach the source of that smell, the oil refineries. Elizabeth Trovall: There's a bunch of white cylinders jutting up in the ground, and then, like hundreds of much smaller tubes. Amy Scott: I can see flames or flaring coming out of some of those tubes and what looks like steam churning out of smoke stacks. Whenever you see pictures on the news of climate change, they always show this, yeah. Some serious climate change B roll right here. Refineries like the one we're floating by process hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil every day, barrels that help make the state of Texas the biggest exporter of petroleum products in the US, and are also fueling a planetary crisis. Elizabeth Trovall: Oil and gas has been so important for the Texas economy, the US economy, the global economy, but also, like what climate are we leaving our children and our children's children? Amy Scott: That tension between the power of oil and gas and the urgency of the climate crisis, that's at the heart of a mystery that we're here in Texas trying to unfold. We're floating on the Houston Ship Channel looking for some clues like Agatha Christie's famous detective Hercule Poirot interrogating suspects on the Nile. We're hoping to untangle a complicated plot, a plot to kill ESG. This is How We Survive. I'm Amy Scott. ESG, that's the investing framework that looks at environmental, social and governance factors. In the last episode, we traced how it evolved from a niche concept embraced by faith based and other socially conscious investors to a mainstream strategy promoted by the biggest asset managers in the world. Cue the backlash. Over the past few years, financial firms have scrubbed the acronym from their websites, dropped out of net zero initiatives and stopped advertising their climate efforts. Some have proclaimed ESG dead and buried. But if so, who killed it and why? In this episode, we take out our magnifying glasses to peer a little more closely at a piece of legislation in Texas that would spark dozens of other anti-ESG bills across the country, the weapon that made the first of a thousand cuts, all in service of protecting the fossil fuel industry. This episode, the death of ESG and the dark money behind its demise. ___ Okay? A little vertigo here. Oh, my God. We are in the, I guess this is the capitol rotunda, right? There's a star at the top of the dome that says, T, E, X, A, S, Texas. We're going to start our investigation where this all started, the state capitol building in Austin, Texas. And this is the heart of the Texas Legislature. We're here to meet with our first suspect in the plot to kill ESG. 06, Isaac. This is representative Carrie Isaac's office. Jason Isaac: Good to see you. Thanks for meeting me here. I appreciate it. Hey, how are you? I'm Jason. Amy Scott: But she's not who we're looking for. There's a rose. Jason Isaac: Yes, this is my wife's office, and apparently one of her colleagues gave her some sort of a rose for something. Amy Scott: Nice. We're here to meet this guy, her husband. That's our suspect. A proud one, I should say. You know what we're up to? We're looking at the rise of ESG investing as a concept, and then the backlash against it, sort of telling the story, and I understand you have a big role in the backlash part of that story. Jason Isaac: Yes, yeah. Amy Scott: Can you start by just introducing yourself? Jason Isaac: Sure. I'm Jason Isaac. I'm the founder and CEO of the American Energy Institute. We're a non profit trade organization and research organization that represents American energy producers that support free markets, primarily oil, gas, coal and nuclear. Amy Scott: Jason Isaac has a bit of a reputation. Jason Isaac: It was Congressman Raskin who called me the Carbon King when I was testifying in front of Congress, because I said, I'm Jason Isaac, and I live a high carbon lifestyle, and I think the rest of the world should too. Amy Scott: So Jamie Raskin came up with that nickname? Jason Isaac: Jamie Raskin. It was, it was not a kind nickname. Amy Scott: But you've embraced it. Jason Isaac: I have. I love it. It's my license plate. I've got it on my business cards and my wallet. And I remind myself, and yes, absolutely. And I wish everybody else could be the Carbon King, too. Amy Scott: At the outset, you should know two things about Jason. Not only that he works on behalf of the oil and gas industry, but also he does not accept the overwhelming scientific consensus that human activity is causing catastrophic climate change. Jason Isaac: I mean, if we're living in a catastrophic climate crisis, I want more of it, because people are prospering like never before because of energy. Amy Scott: Before he became known as the Carbon King, Jason was working at a conservative think tank, the Texas Public Policy Foundation. He led an energy initiative there called Life Powered. He says it was around 2019 when he started to hear something that bothered him. Jason Isaac: I had specific drilling companies, I had services companies that were telling me that their banks were denying them access to financial services because they were in the oil and gas industry. Amy Scott: These energy companies suspected they were being denied because of the banks' ESG policies. Jason Isaac: And I didn't know what ESG was at first, I just said they're discriminating against politically unfavored industries like oil and gas and forestry and guns and ammunition manufacturers. Amy Scott: And so what did you decide to do about it? Jason Isaac: Well, it was interesting, because one of them kind of challenged me. It's like, Jason, you've got to fix this. And so I thought, oh gosh. Amy Scott: Jason says a light went off. He recalled a bill he'd worked on a few years earlier when he was serving in the Texas House of Representatives. It was aimed at preventing companies from boycotting Israel. So he thought, hey, why not just replace Israel with oil and gas? Jason Isaac: I essentially just said, If you boycott fossil fuels, you can't do business with the state of Texas. Amy Scott: The bill would prohibit any government entity in Texas, so pension funds or school districts, from doing business with financial firms found to be boycotting oil and gas, a sort of boycott uno reverse card. So you boycotted companies that you saw as boycotting other companies? Jason Isaac: Yeah, I just didn't want them using our tax dollars, our pension dollars from teachers, firefighters, other first responders that are entrusted with companies. I didn't want those dollars, and in some cases, our tax dollars, being weaponized against the best interest of Texas. Amy Scott: So the sort of confusing thing here is that these companies that Jason sees as boycotting fossil fuels in Texas, these are financial firms and banks that, in some cases, invest billions of dollars in oil and gas in Texas, which seems like the opposite of a boycott. The problem, Jason says, is the way that some of these financial firms invest. Jason Isaac: They're investing in them, forcing them to transition, forcing them to adopt political agendas which are contrary to popular opinion here in the legislature in Texas, and so I really felt like they were weaponizing their capital, trying to, using Larry Fink's terms, force behaviors. Amy Scott: Remember Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, whose now infamous 2020 letter to CEOs declared that climate risk is investment risk? Jason says, while it's true, BlackRock invests more than $100 billion in Texas oil and gas, the company has also used its shareholder power to push companies to address climate change. To Jason and his conservative allies in the legislature, that kind of activism had no place in Texas. Voice 2: Senator Birdwell, you recognized committee substitute for Senate Bill 13 to suspend the regular order of business. Voice 3: Thank you, Mr... Amy Scott: In the spring of 2021, on the green carpet of the baroque Senate chambers, a Republican state senator brought Jason's anti-ESG bill, now known as Senate Bill 13, to a vote. Voice 3: On behalf of lucky number 13, Mr. President, I move final passage. Amy Scott: It passed the first chamber, the Senate, with almost no opposition. Voice 2: There being 26 ayes and four nays, the bill is finally passed. Voice 3: Thank you, Mr. President for all your work on this. Amy Scott: But one person in the room felt something was not quite right. Do you feel like you have a lonely position here? Nathan Johnson: I think there's a matter of record of I have a lonely position here. Amy Scott: This is state senator Nathan Johnson. He was one of the four nays on Senate Bill 13. He's a Democrat, a lawyer and a composer. Millennials may recognize his music from the TV anime show Dragon Ball Z. Nathan Johnson: I did the music for 67 episodes and five of their movies. Amy Scott: Do you still get royalties for that? Nathan Johnson: I don't get any royalties at all for that. I got into the business at the wrong time. Amy Scott: In our murder mystery scenario, Senator Johnson is like the witness watching in horror as the scene unfolded. Nathan Johnson: I think the whole notion of passing laws that interfere with the private flow of capital is anathema to the whole Texas ethos of being a business friendly state, and it smacked of big government interference with markets. Amy Scott: Battling some of the biggest financial firms in the US, limiting market options, telling companies what they can and can't do, seemed like just a different form of the market interference the bill's supporters claim to oppose. Nathan Johnson: The job of a financial services institution is to make money. They want to take capital and invest it and get it a return. And if they think they can do it with a wind farm or a pump jack, they're going to pick the one that gives a good return. Amy Scott: Increasingly, it's the wind or solar farm investors are betting on. Texas is actually leading the country in renewable energy production, and Johnson says this anti-ESG legislation looks to him like a campaign to slow down the transition. Nathan Johnson: Which I think is silly. The fossil fuel industry is well integrated with the renewable energy generation industry. Wind farms and solar farms are powering oil and gas operations. So it's unfortunate that we're having this silly conversation right now, because it's helping no one. Amy Scott: After SB 13 passed, again saying Texas would boycott any financial firms that boycott oil and gas, the state had to figure out who was in compliance, so officials created a black list. It named 10 firms at first, including BlackRock, which again, invested more than $100 billion in Texas energy companies at the time. It also included nearly 350 individual funds. The firms on the black list were banned from any financial activity that used state money. That meant everything from managing public pensions to underwriting municipal bonds, and that might have been the end of it, the infliction of this first cut to ESG, but for this man, our second suspect. ___ Would you mind just introducing yourself? Tell us who you are and what you do and where we are. Brian Hughes: Thanks. I'm Brian Hughes, and so glad to be with you in the Texas capitol today. Amy Scott: Senator Brian Hughes of district one in East Texas. Senator Hughes co-authored Senate Bill 13. But that bill, that first wound to ESG, wasn't enough for the Senator. He really wanted to twist the knife. Brian Hughes: Good morning, everyone. For many of you, I'll say, Welcome to Marshall, and for Marshall folks I'll say, Thank you for letting us be here and enjoy this... Amy Scott: He wanted to throw a harsher spotlight on what financial firms were up to with this ESG stuff, and make sure they knew Texas was serious about cracking down. So a couple months after the blacklist came out, in late 2022, Senator Hughes and the state affairs committee he chaired summoned a bunch of Wall Street firms to a remote corner of East Texas for questioning. Representatives from BlackRock, State Street, Global Advisors and institutional shareholder services, an advisory firm, made the trek out to the small city of Marshall, and were greeted with a show. Brian Hughes: We had the hearing in December and so the Christmas lights are up. There's an ice skating rink set up on the town square. It's a beautiful Norman Rockwell feel. What we were looking for was to be in this environment of a Hallmark movie. Except for the firms we subpoenaed. We wanted a John Grisham movie for them. Amy Scott: He gave them a six hour grilling, challenging them on all the ways they were trying to take down the fossil fuel industry, like offering ESG funds that screen out some energy companies, joining net zero initiatives aimed at drawing down emissions, voting to support some environmental and social shareholder resolutions like the board shake up at Exxon Mobil we talked about last episode. Brian Hughes: When it comes to ESG investing, which interest is BlackRock trying to serve? The general welfare of your clients, the general welfare of humanity, or the sole financial interest of those clients. Amy Scott: Again and again, Senators accused the companies of putting ideology ahead of their fiduciary duty to act in their clients' best interests, while company reps insisted that duty required them to consider ESG factors that could affect their investments. But Senator Hughes wasn't persuaded. BlackRock stayed on the black list. Brian Hughes: And our response to them has been very, very simple. If you don't want to be on the list, then don't attack the Texas energy industry. Amy Scott: Since then, the list has grown to a total of 16 companies and includes big global firms like BNP Paribas, HSBC and UBS. And the senator isn't done. He's now trying to pass other bills to prevent financial firms from considering non-financial factors in investing and lending decisions. In some ways, his tactics have worked. Before the hearing, Vanguard, another big asset manager, appeased Texas lawmakers by dropping out of a net zero initiative, and in the years since, BlackRock and others have followed suit and dialed back at least their public support for ESG initiatives. But if Hughes's aim was to hurt the companies on the black list, he doesn't appear to have been successful. Most of these firms have grown even bigger. Critics of the effort say the people who have been hurt by all of this are Texans. Chris Hollins: So how has your trip to Houston slash Texas been? Amy Scott: It's been good. Yeah, very friendly. __ This is Chris Hollins, the city controller of Houston, Texas. He's an elected official responsible for Houston's $7 billion budget. We met him in his corner office on the eighth floor of City Hall. He's got a Hakeem Olajuwon college jersey on the wall from when the legendary basketball player was at the University of Houston. Chris Hollins: The jersey is Hakeem Olajuwon, but it's signed by the whole team. Amy Scott: Wow. How'd you get that? Chris Hollins: You know, I have my ways. Amy Scott: That's cool. That is cool. But we're here to talk about Senate Bill 13. Has it had an impact on the economy of Texas? Chris Hollins: I believe that it has. Amy Scott: One of the most important things that financial companies like BlackRock do is help towns and cities like Houston borrow money to fix roads or upgrade schools using the bond market. The firms bid for that business, so when a bunch of them get blacklisted for their ESG policies, there's less competition, and that can mean the cities and school districts end up paying more. Chris Hollins: You take economics 101, and you understand that if I'm the only, if I if I'm the only bidder, and I know that, then I can go in with a little bit higher of a price, and you're probably going to say, Yes, right? It lessens our negotiating power, which we know ultimately has that negative impact on on our bottom line. Amy Scott: Economists from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and the Wharton School studied the impact of anti-ESG legislation in Texas, including Jason Isaac's bill. They estimated that in the first eight months they were in effect, these laws cost the state between $300 and $500 million in higher borrowing costs. Chris Hollins: A huge chunk of what we spend money on is debt service, right? It's paying interest on money that we borrowed and and so all the money that, the millions and millions of dollars that we're paying in interest, that's money that we're not spending on hiring more police officers. It's money that we're not spending on fixing potholes or beautifying our parks to make this a better city to live in and enjoy with your family. So there are real victims here. Amy Scott: Controller Hollins, who's a Democrat, says it's disappointing to see politicians sitting in Austin, hours away, making policies that he feels are harmful to his city. Chris Hollins: And it's even worse when you when you can put like a nice southern drawl on it and sound all, you know, I don't know hokey and kind and whatever, but all you're doing is is just really waking up and going to hurt people every day. Amy Scott: Who have those policies hurt? Can you give some examples? Chris Hollins: The the millions who are being impacted by changes in climate when there are disaster after disaster pummeling our state, especially in the coastal areas. We're the energy capital of the world and just you know, in recent past, we can't keep the lights on during certain natural disasters. Last year, climate related disasters cost Texas between $20 and $50 billion. Amy Scott: When we visited Houston, the city had just been through a deep freeze. Chris Hollins: And the recovery is is getting more and more costly. That little chicken scratch that y'all saw on the table when you came in, it was it was around our disaster recovery costs, which are estimated to be upwards of $200 million just for what happened this past year. Amy Scott: To controller Hollins, the ESG backlash is just another form of climate denial that's delaying action to address the crisis and will cost Texas not just money, but lives in the future. But to conservative lawmakers, it's another front in the broader culture war, another acronym like DEI and CRT, to distort and demonize. After it passed in Texas, Senate Bill 13 became a blueprint for Republican legislators across the country. Dozens of bills in states like Oklahoma, Kentucky and West Virginia have used Jason Isaac's language as a template. It was a targeted coordinated attack that delivered a thousand cuts to the concept of ESG and left it bleeding out in the stairwell. But the lawmakers that wielded the knives weren't operating alone. Turns out, they were hired killers funded by a river of dark money. Kelly Mitchell: We've seen a lot of alignment between the oil and gas industry and sort of the broader, sort of hard right movement. Amy Scott: After the break, the tangled web of right wing think tanks and fossil fuel interest groups that funded the plot to kill ESG. [BREAK] Amy Scott: What are some of your favorite slurs that the right has given ESG? Kelly Mitchell: Oh, that's a fun question. Amy Scott: Like woke capital is one, woke capitalism. Kelly Mitchell: Woke capitalism might be my favorite, just because it's so kind of absurd on the face. Like nothing BlackRock is doing is woke. Amy Scott: This is Kelly Mitchell. We heard from her in episode one. She's executive director of the investigative watchdog group Fieldnotes, and she's been following the anti-ESG backlash since the very beginning. If Kelly was the lead investigator in our ESG murder mystery, she'd have an evidence board in her office with red yarn connecting pictures with suspects that would take up the entire wall, maybe even several rooms. But what Kelly's tracking isn't just the people and the organizations who delivered a thousand cuts to ESG, it's the money and power behind them. And there are really two main sources of money, the business folks and the culture warriors. Kelly Mitchell: We've seen a lot of alignment between the oil and gas industry and sort of the broader, sort of hard right movement. Amy Scott: These are the people and the groups in the shadows that paid for the knives that policy makers wielded against ESG. Kelly Mitchell: Texas Public Policy Foundation has been a long time recipient of oil money, most notably from the Koch brothers and Koch Industries. Amy Scott: The Texas Public Policy Foundation is the conservative think tank where Jason Isaac worked when he wrote Senate Bill 13. According to climate research firm Pleiades Strategy, over the last 10 years, the think tank has received about $13 million from foundations linked to Koch, Inc., the big conglomerate that's deeply involved in oil and gas. Another funder is oil and gas tycoon Bud Brigham. Bud Brigham: I found the Texas Public Policy Foundation to be a very effective think tank for the principles that I believe in. So I have invested over the years with them quite a bit. Amy Scott: We reached out to Bud because he's been gunning for ESG for years. Back in 2021 he published a white paper with the Texas Public Policy Foundation called "Energy discrimination: a threat to capitalism, prosperity and flourishing." In his paper, he questions accepted climate science and calls ESG a cancerous threat to our way of life. Bud Brigham: The ESG movement, it became apparent that it was like DEI, a Trojan horse for these political movements, in this case, to co-opt companies away from oil and natural gas by those that view it as detrimental, and so I felt like I needed to stand up for capitalism. Amy Scott: Bud Brigham's ideas influenced Jason Isaac, who wrote Senate Bill 13. Ideas that through that white paper and Jason's legislation began to spread across the country. Since 2021, legislators have introduced more than 470 anti-ESG bills in 40 states. That's again, according to Pleiades Strategy. 48 of those bills, so a little over 10%, became law, some modeled after Jason Isaac's bill. Others taking a different approach, but each one sliced away at ESG with the help of the people in the shadows. Kelly Mitchell: As this fight has grown, there have been a number of other groups, other major dark money players, that have stepped in to take advantage of the momentum. Amy Scott: Dark money is, by its nature, hard to track, but some familiar names are tacked up on Kelly's evidence board. Kelly Mitchell: Some of those include groups that are backed by Leonard Leo, most famous for basically shaping Trump's Supreme Court. Through his various affiliates, he's poured millions of dollars into this anti-ESG movement with the goal of crushing liberal dominance and really taking on the quote woke left and woke capitalism. Amy Scott: Groups backed by Leo, a conservative lawyer, include the nonprofit Consumers Research, which funds the State Financial Officers Foundation, an organization of Republican State Treasurers and auditors. Another big player in the backlash is the Heritage Foundation, whose fellow Andy Puzder, former fast food CEO, had this to say about ESG. Andy Puzder: ESG investing is socialism in sheep's clothing, and this is, this is the challenge of your generation. My father's generation's challenge was the Nazis. Amy Scott: Puzder was speaking at a workshop about ESG. The investigative watchdog Documented, where Kelly used to work, got hold of this recording, which was first verified and aired by the program Here and Now. Andy Puzder: The challenge of your generation is ESG investing, and it's more insidious than communism or the Nazis. Kelly Mitchell: I don't even know how to respond to that, but I think it does speak to the hyperbolic nature and the fear mongering that's come along with something as simple as like evaluating risk. Amy Scott: This is just a fraction of the suspects on Kelly's board, which is actually a PDF put together by her and her colleagues. It's a tangled web of think tanks, advocacy groups, corporations and oil and gas trade associations, including the Heartland Institute, Heritage Action for America, American Petroleum, Independent Women's Forum, Capital Research Center, American Legislative Exchange Council, America First Policy Institute. And many, many more. ___ Yes, it kind of makes your head spin, doesn't it? Kelly Mitchell: It does make my head spin. Amy Scott: We've got oil billionaires and Republican treasurers, anti-woke pundits and climate deniers. And what's even more baffling about all this is that the thing they're so afraid of, this so-called woke capitalist threat to fossil fuels, doesn't seem to be doing what its critics think it's doing. In fact, last year, the United States produced more oil and gas than any country ever has. Kelly says part of the problem with ESG is that it's so poorly defined. To critics on the right, it's part of an activist plot to bring down the fossil fuel industry, but to critics on the left, it's not doing nearly enough to actually address the climate crisis. Kelly Mitchell: In part because we don't really have the tools to distinguish green washing and empty promises from real, long term commitments. Amy Scott: And in some ways, that vagueness has left ESG open to attack. Kelly Mitchell: The death of ESG, if we're going to call it that, is really complicated. It's morphed into this buzzword that can now mean anything to anybody, and so identifying a single culprit is quite difficult here. Amy Scott: But the backlash has had a chilling effect. Big firms are leaving net zero initiatives in droves. Investment in ESG funds has fallen in each of the past three years. CEOs have scrubbed the letters ESG from their websites and public speeches, and maybe the final nail in the coffin, the SEC just dropped efforts to require companies to disclose climate related risks. So is ESG dead? Kelly Mitchell: The buzz word ESG may be dead. The movement has succeeded in, unfortunately, turning it into something quite politically charged and toxic. But the underlying principles are incredibly durable because they're based in reality. The truth is the world will decarbonize. The truth is that climate disasters are increasing in their frequency and their severity. Smart investors will continue to look at those risks. They will evaluate those risks, and they will price it into their investment decisions. They're probably just not going to do it under the banner of ESG. Amy Scott: Okay, so maybe the body of ESG is buried six feet under but that doesn't mean its spirit doesn't live on. Jason Isaac: These financial institutions are essentially now kind of like reverse virtue signaling. So they're virtue signaling to us, but in their statements, they're saying we're going to continue the policies that align with the energy transition. I wasn't using that term green hushing, but I may have to add that to my vocabulary. Amy Scott: Next episode, the evolution, or maybe reincarnation, of ESG.

Some have proclaimed ESG investing dead and buried. But if so, who killed it and why? Over the past few years, ESG investing has moved from a mainstream strategy promoted by the biggest asset managers in the world to a polarizing topic. Financial firms have scrubbed the acronym from their websites, dropped out of net-zero initiatives, and stopped advertising their climate efforts. Some have proclaimed ESG dead and buried. But if so, who killed it and why? The pushback to ESG gained steam in 2021, when Texas passed Senate Bill 13, an anti-ESG law. It prohibits any government entity in the state from doing business with financial firms found to be boycotting — as defined by Texas — the oil and gas industry. The resulting “blacklist” of companies deemed to be discriminating against oil and gas included financial firm BlackRock — which, ironically, invests billions of dollars in energy companies in Texas. Since then, legislators across the country have introduced more than 470 anti-ESG bills — some modeled after the 2021 Texas law — in 40 states, according to a legislative tracker maintained by climate research firm Pleiades Strategy. It’s not just politicians going after ESG. Behind this flurry of legislation lies a tangled web of different interests that have supported the plot to kill ESG: think tanks, state treasurers, oil and gas trade associations, culture warriors, and oil tycoons. In this episode – our ESG whodunit – we take out our magnifying glasses to take a closer look at the legislation that would spark dozens of other bills across the country. We’ll question a line-up of suspects at the center of the anti-ESG plot and dive into their motivations for protecting the fossil fuel industry.

Amy Scott: So how would you describe the smell? Elizabeth Trovall: It is, we haven't even gotten to the worst of it. Amy Scott: I'm on the bow of the Sam Houston, an elegant 95 foot boat with the breeze in my hair and the state flag of Texas flapping overhead. It's got the vibe of a pleasure cruise, if it weren't for the smell. Elizabeth Trovall: Oh yeah, now it's really pungent. Amy Scott: My colleague, Elizabeth Trovall, who covers energy for Marketplace, invited me on this boat tour, a ride along the Houston Ship Channel, the industrial waterway that connects the Port of Houston to the Gulf of Mexico. Voice 1: As we leave the Turning Basin, off to the left you will see public grain elevator number one... Amy Scott: Chugging along, we see big metal grain elevators and giant cargo ships from far away countries, which Elizabeth looks up on her phone. Elizabeth Trovall: Her length overall is 179.98 meters, and her width is 32 meters. She's a hefty lass. Amy Scott: Until we reach the source of that smell, the oil refineries. Elizabeth Trovall: There's a bunch of white cylinders jutting up in the ground, and then, like hundreds of much smaller tubes. Amy Scott: I can see flames or flaring coming out of some of those tubes and what looks like steam churning out of smoke stacks. Whenever you see pictures on the news of climate change, they always show this, yeah. Some serious climate change B roll right here. Refineries like the one we're floating by process hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil every day, barrels that help make the state of Texas the biggest exporter of petroleum products in the US, and are also fueling a planetary crisis. Elizabeth Trovall: Oil and gas has been so important for the Texas economy, the US economy, the global economy, but also, like what climate are we leaving our children and our children's children? Amy Scott: That tension between the power of oil and gas and the urgency of the climate crisis, that's at the heart of a mystery that we're here in Texas trying to unfold. We're floating on the Houston Ship Channel looking for some clues like Agatha Christie's famous detective Hercule Poirot interrogating suspects on the Nile. We're hoping to untangle a complicated plot, a plot to kill ESG. This is How We Survive. I'm Amy Scott. ESG, that's the investing framework that looks at environmental, social and governance factors. In the last episode, we traced how it evolved from a niche concept embraced by faith based and other socially conscious investors to a mainstream strategy promoted by the biggest asset managers in the world. Cue the backlash. Over the past few years, financial firms have scrubbed the acronym from their websites, dropped out of net zero initiatives and stopped advertising their climate efforts. Some have proclaimed ESG dead and buried. But if so, who killed it and why? In this episode, we take out our magnifying glasses to peer a little more closely at a piece of legislation in Texas that would spark dozens of other anti-ESG bills across the country, the weapon that made the first of a thousand cuts, all in service of protecting the fossil fuel industry. This episode, the death of ESG and the dark money behind its demise. ___ Okay? A little vertigo here. Oh, my God. We are in the, I guess this is the capitol rotunda, right? There's a star at the top of the dome that says, T, E, X, A, S, Texas. We're going to start our investigation where this all started, the state capitol building in Austin, Texas. And this is the heart of the Texas Legislature. We're here to meet with our first suspect in the plot to kill ESG. 06, Isaac. This is representative Carrie Isaac's office. Jason Isaac: Good to see you. Thanks for meeting me here. I appreciate it. Hey, how are you? I'm Jason. Amy Scott: But she's not who we're looking for. There's a rose. Jason Isaac: Yes, this is my wife's office, and apparently one of her colleagues gave her some sort of a rose for something. Amy Scott: Nice. We're here to meet this guy, her husband. That's our suspect. A proud one, I should say. You know what we're up to? We're looking at the rise of ESG investing as a concept, and then the backlash against it, sort of telling the story, and I understand you have a big role in the backlash part of that story. Jason Isaac: Yes, yeah. Amy Scott: Can you start by just introducing yourself? Jason Isaac: Sure. I'm Jason Isaac. I'm the founder and CEO of the American Energy Institute. We're a non profit trade organization and research organization that represents American energy producers that support free markets, primarily oil, gas, coal and nuclear. Amy Scott: Jason Isaac has a bit of a reputation. Jason Isaac: It was Congressman Raskin who called me the Carbon King when I was testifying in front of Congress, because I said, I'm Jason Isaac, and I live a high carbon lifestyle, and I think the rest of the world should too. Amy Scott: So Jamie Raskin came up with that nickname? Jason Isaac: Jamie Raskin. It was, it was not a kind nickname. Amy Scott: But you've embraced it. Jason Isaac: I have. I love it. It's my license plate. I've got it on my business cards and my wallet. And I remind myself, and yes, absolutely. And I wish everybody else could be the Carbon King, too. Amy Scott: At the outset, you should know two things about Jason. Not only that he works on behalf of the oil and gas industry, but also he does not accept the overwhelming scientific consensus that human activity is causing catastrophic climate change. Jason Isaac: I mean, if we're living in a catastrophic climate crisis, I want more of it, because people are prospering like never before because of energy. Amy Scott: Before he became known as the Carbon King, Jason was working at a conservative think tank, the Texas Public Policy Foundation. He led an energy initiative there called Life Powered. He says it was around 2019 when he started to hear something that bothered him. Jason Isaac: I had specific drilling companies, I had services companies that were telling me that their banks were denying them access to financial services because they were in the oil and gas industry. Amy Scott: These energy companies suspected they were being denied because of the banks' ESG policies. Jason Isaac: And I didn't know what ESG was at first, I just said they're discriminating against politically unfavored industries like oil and gas and forestry and guns and ammunition manufacturers. Amy Scott: And so what did you decide to do about it? Jason Isaac: Well, it was interesting, because one of them kind of challenged me. It's like, Jason, you've got to fix this. And so I thought, oh gosh. Amy Scott: Jason says a light went off. He recalled a bill he'd worked on a few years earlier when he was serving in the Texas House of Representatives. It was aimed at preventing companies from boycotting Israel. So he thought, hey, why not just replace Israel with oil and gas? Jason Isaac: I essentially just said, If you boycott fossil fuels, you can't do business with the state of Texas. Amy Scott: The bill would prohibit any government entity in Texas, so pension funds or school districts, from doing business with financial firms found to be boycotting oil and gas, a sort of boycott uno reverse card. So you boycotted companies that you saw as boycotting other companies? Jason Isaac: Yeah, I just didn't want them using our tax dollars, our pension dollars from teachers, firefighters, other first responders that are entrusted with companies. I didn't want those dollars, and in some cases, our tax dollars, being weaponized against the best interest of Texas. Amy Scott: So the sort of confusing thing here is that these companies that Jason sees as boycotting fossil fuels in Texas, these are financial firms and banks that, in some cases, invest billions of dollars in oil and gas in Texas, which seems like the opposite of a boycott. The problem, Jason says, is the way that some of these financial firms invest. Jason Isaac: They're investing in them, forcing them to transition, forcing them to adopt political agendas which are contrary to popular opinion here in the legislature in Texas, and so I really felt like they were weaponizing their capital, trying to, using Larry Fink's terms, force behaviors. Amy Scott: Remember Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, whose now infamous 2020 letter to CEOs declared that climate risk is investment risk? Jason says, while it's true, BlackRock invests more than $100 billion in Texas oil and gas, the company has also used its shareholder power to push companies to address climate change. To Jason and his conservative allies in the legislature, that kind of activism had no place in Texas. Voice 2: Senator Birdwell, you recognized committee substitute for Senate Bill 13 to suspend the regular order of business. Voice 3: Thank you, Mr... Amy Scott: In the spring of 2021, on the green carpet of the baroque Senate chambers, a Republican state senator brought Jason's anti-ESG bill, now known as Senate Bill 13, to a vote. Voice 3: On behalf of lucky number 13, Mr. President, I move final passage. Amy Scott: It passed the first chamber, the Senate, with almost no opposition. Voice 2: There being 26 ayes and four nays, the bill is finally passed. Voice 3: Thank you, Mr. President for all your work on this. Amy Scott: But one person in the room felt something was not quite right. Do you feel like you have a lonely position here? Nathan Johnson: I think there's a matter of record of I have a lonely position here. Amy Scott: This is state senator Nathan Johnson. He was one of the four nays on Senate Bill 13. He's a Democrat, a lawyer and a composer. Millennials may recognize his music from the TV anime show Dragon Ball Z. Nathan Johnson: I did the music for 67 episodes and five of their movies. Amy Scott: Do you still get royalties for that? Nathan Johnson: I don't get any royalties at all for that. I got into the business at the wrong time. Amy Scott: In our murder mystery scenario, Senator Johnson is like the witness watching in horror as the scene unfolded. Nathan Johnson: I think the whole notion of passing laws that interfere with the private flow of capital is anathema to the whole Texas ethos of being a business friendly state, and it smacked of big government interference with markets. Amy Scott: Battling some of the biggest financial firms in the US, limiting market options, telling companies what they can and can't do, seemed like just a different form of the market interference the bill's supporters claim to oppose. Nathan Johnson: The job of a financial services institution is to make money. They want to take capital and invest it and get it a return. And if they think they can do it with a wind farm or a pump jack, they're going to pick the one that gives a good return. Amy Scott: Increasingly, it's the wind or solar farm investors are betting on. Texas is actually leading the country in renewable energy production, and Johnson says this anti-ESG legislation looks to him like a campaign to slow down the transition. Nathan Johnson: Which I think is silly. The fossil fuel industry is well integrated with the renewable energy generation industry. Wind farms and solar farms are powering oil and gas operations. So it's unfortunate that we're having this silly conversation right now, because it's helping no one. Amy Scott: After SB 13 passed, again saying Texas would boycott any financial firms that boycott oil and gas, the state had to figure out who was in compliance, so officials created a black list. It named 10 firms at first, including BlackRock, which again, invested more than $100 billion in Texas energy companies at the time. It also included nearly 350 individual funds. The firms on the black list were banned from any financial activity that used state money. That meant everything from managing public pensions to underwriting municipal bonds, and that might have been the end of it, the infliction of this first cut to ESG, but for this man, our second suspect. ___ Would you mind just introducing yourself? Tell us who you are and what you do and where we are. Brian Hughes: Thanks. I'm Brian Hughes, and so glad to be with you in the Texas capitol today. Amy Scott: Senator Brian Hughes of district one in East Texas. Senator Hughes co-authored Senate Bill 13. But that bill, that first wound to ESG, wasn't enough for the Senator. He really wanted to twist the knife. Brian Hughes: Good morning, everyone. For many of you, I'll say, Welcome to Marshall, and for Marshall folks I'll say, Thank you for letting us be here and enjoy this... Amy Scott: He wanted to throw a harsher spotlight on what financial firms were up to with this ESG stuff, and make sure they knew Texas was serious about cracking down. So a couple months after the blacklist came out, in late 2022, Senator Hughes and the state affairs committee he chaired summoned a bunch of Wall Street firms to a remote corner of East Texas for questioning. Representatives from BlackRock, State Street, Global Advisors and institutional shareholder services, an advisory firm, made the trek out to the small city of Marshall, and were greeted with a show. Brian Hughes: We had the hearing in December and so the Christmas lights are up. There's an ice skating rink set up on the town square. It's a beautiful Norman Rockwell feel. What we were looking for was to be in this environment of a Hallmark movie. Except for the firms we subpoenaed. We wanted a John Grisham movie for them. Amy Scott: He gave them a six hour grilling, challenging them on all the ways they were trying to take down the fossil fuel industry, like offering ESG funds that screen out some energy companies, joining net zero initiatives aimed at drawing down emissions, voting to support some environmental and social shareholder resolutions like the board shake up at Exxon Mobil we talked about last episode. Brian Hughes: When it comes to ESG investing, which interest is BlackRock trying to serve? The general welfare of your clients, the general welfare of humanity, or the sole financial interest of those clients. Amy Scott: Again and again, Senators accused the companies of putting ideology ahead of their fiduciary duty to act in their clients' best interests, while company reps insisted that duty required them to consider ESG factors that could affect their investments. But Senator Hughes wasn't persuaded. BlackRock stayed on the black list. Brian Hughes: And our response to them has been very, very simple. If you don't want to be on the list, then don't attack the Texas energy industry. Amy Scott: Since then, the list has grown to a total of 16 companies and includes big global firms like BNP Paribas, HSBC and UBS. And the senator isn't done. He's now trying to pass other bills to prevent financial firms from considering non-financial factors in investing and lending decisions. In some ways, his tactics have worked. Before the hearing, Vanguard, another big asset manager, appeased Texas lawmakers by dropping out of a net zero initiative, and in the years since, BlackRock and others have followed suit and dialed back at least their public support for ESG initiatives. But if Hughes's aim was to hurt the companies on the black list, he doesn't appear to have been successful. Most of these firms have grown even bigger. Critics of the effort say the people who have been hurt by all of this are Texans. Chris Hollins: So how has your trip to Houston slash Texas been? Amy Scott: It's been good. Yeah, very friendly. __ This is Chris Hollins, the city controller of Houston, Texas. He's an elected official responsible for Houston's $7 billion budget. We met him in his corner office on the eighth floor of City Hall. He's got a Hakeem Olajuwon college jersey on the wall from when the legendary basketball player was at the University of Houston. Chris Hollins: The jersey is Hakeem Olajuwon, but it's signed by the whole team. Amy Scott: Wow. How'd you get that? Chris Hollins: You know, I have my ways. Amy Scott: That's cool. That is cool. But we're here to talk about Senate Bill 13. Has it had an impact on the economy of Texas? Chris Hollins: I believe that it has. Amy Scott: One of the most important things that financial companies like BlackRock do is help towns and cities like Houston borrow money to fix roads or upgrade schools using the bond market. The firms bid for that business, so when a bunch of them get blacklisted for their ESG policies, there's less competition, and that can mean the cities and school districts end up paying more. Chris Hollins: You take economics 101, and you understand that if I'm the only, if I if I'm the only bidder, and I know that, then I can go in with a little bit higher of a price, and you're probably going to say, Yes, right? It lessens our negotiating power, which we know ultimately has that negative impact on on our bottom line. Amy Scott: Economists from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and the Wharton School studied the impact of anti-ESG legislation in Texas, including Jason Isaac's bill. They estimated that in the first eight months they were in effect, these laws cost the state between $300 and $500 million in higher borrowing costs. Chris Hollins: A huge chunk of what we spend money on is debt service, right? It's paying interest on money that we borrowed and and so all the money that, the millions and millions of dollars that we're paying in interest, that's money that we're not spending on hiring more police officers. It's money that we're not spending on fixing potholes or beautifying our parks to make this a better city to live in and enjoy with your family. So there are real victims here. Amy Scott: Controller Hollins, who's a Democrat, says it's disappointing to see politicians sitting in Austin, hours away, making policies that he feels are harmful to his city. Chris Hollins: And it's even worse when you when you can put like a nice southern drawl on it and sound all, you know, I don't know hokey and kind and whatever, but all you're doing is is just really waking up and going to hurt people every day. Amy Scott: Who have those policies hurt? Can you give some examples? Chris Hollins: The the millions who are being impacted by changes in climate when there are disaster after disaster pummeling our state, especially in the coastal areas. We're the energy capital of the world and just you know, in recent past, we can't keep the lights on during certain natural disasters. Last year, climate related disasters cost Texas between $20 and $50 billion. Amy Scott: When we visited Houston, the city had just been through a deep freeze. Chris Hollins: And the recovery is is getting more and more costly. That little chicken scratch that y'all saw on the table when you came in, it was it was around our disaster recovery costs, which are estimated to be upwards of $200 million just for what happened this past year. Amy Scott: To controller Hollins, the ESG backlash is just another form of climate denial that's delaying action to address the crisis and will cost Texas not just money, but lives in the future. But to conservative lawmakers, it's another front in the broader culture war, another acronym like DEI and CRT, to distort and demonize. After it passed in Texas, Senate Bill 13 became a blueprint for Republican legislators across the country. Dozens of bills in states like Oklahoma, Kentucky and West Virginia have used Jason Isaac's language as a template. It was a targeted coordinated attack that delivered a thousand cuts to the concept of ESG and left it bleeding out in the stairwell. But the lawmakers that wielded the knives weren't operating alone. Turns out, they were hired killers funded by a river of dark money. Kelly Mitchell: We've seen a lot of alignment between the oil and gas industry and sort of the broader, sort of hard right movement. Amy Scott: After the break, the tangled web of right wing think tanks and fossil fuel interest groups that funded the plot to kill ESG. [BREAK] Amy Scott: What are some of your favorite slurs that the right has given ESG? Kelly Mitchell: Oh, that's a fun question. Amy Scott: Like woke capital is one, woke capitalism. Kelly Mitchell: Woke capitalism might be my favorite, just because it's so kind of absurd on the face. Like nothing BlackRock is doing is woke. Amy Scott: This is Kelly Mitchell. We heard from her in episode one. She's executive director of the investigative watchdog group Fieldnotes, and she's been following the anti-ESG backlash since the very beginning. If Kelly was the lead investigator in our ESG murder mystery, she'd have an evidence board in her office with red yarn connecting pictures with suspects that would take up the entire wall, maybe even several rooms. But what Kelly's tracking isn't just the people and the organizations who delivered a thousand cuts to ESG, it's the money and power behind them. And there are really two main sources of money, the business folks and the culture warriors. Kelly Mitchell: We've seen a lot of alignment between the oil and gas industry and sort of the broader, sort of hard right movement. Amy Scott: These are the people and the groups in the shadows that paid for the knives that policy makers wielded against ESG. Kelly Mitchell: Texas Public Policy Foundation has been a long time recipient of oil money, most notably from the Koch brothers and Koch Industries. Amy Scott: The Texas Public Policy Foundation is the conservative think tank where Jason Isaac worked when he wrote Senate Bill 13. According to climate research firm Pleiades Strategy, over the last 10 years, the think tank has received about $13 million from foundations linked to Koch, Inc., the big conglomerate that's deeply involved in oil and gas. Another funder is oil and gas tycoon Bud Brigham. Bud Brigham: I found the Texas Public Policy Foundation to be a very effective think tank for the principles that I believe in. So I have invested over the years with them quite a bit. Amy Scott: We reached out to Bud because he's been gunning for ESG for years. Back in 2021 he published a white paper with the Texas Public Policy Foundation called "Energy discrimination: a threat to capitalism, prosperity and flourishing." In his paper, he questions accepted climate science and calls ESG a cancerous threat to our way of life. Bud Brigham: The ESG movement, it became apparent that it was like DEI, a Trojan horse for these political movements, in this case, to co-opt companies away from oil and natural gas by those that view it as detrimental, and so I felt like I needed to stand up for capitalism. Amy Scott: Bud Brigham's ideas influenced Jason Isaac, who wrote Senate Bill 13. Ideas that through that white paper and Jason's legislation began to spread across the country. Since 2021, legislators have introduced more than 470 anti-ESG bills in 40 states. That's again, according to Pleiades Strategy. 48 of those bills, so a little over 10%, became law, some modeled after Jason Isaac's bill. Others taking a different approach, but each one sliced away at ESG with the help of the people in the shadows. Kelly Mitchell: As this fight has grown, there have been a number of other groups, other major dark money players, that have stepped in to take advantage of the momentum. Amy Scott: Dark money is, by its nature, hard to track, but some familiar names are tacked up on Kelly's evidence board. Kelly Mitchell: Some of those include groups that are backed by Leonard Leo, most famous for basically shaping Trump's Supreme Court. Through his various affiliates, he's poured millions of dollars into this anti-ESG movement with the goal of crushing liberal dominance and really taking on the quote woke left and woke capitalism. Amy Scott: Groups backed by Leo, a conservative lawyer, include the nonprofit Consumers Research, which funds the State Financial Officers Foundation, an organization of Republican State Treasurers and auditors. Another big player in the backlash is the Heritage Foundation, whose fellow Andy Puzder, former fast food CEO, had this to say about ESG. Andy Puzder: ESG investing is socialism in sheep's clothing, and this is, this is the challenge of your generation. My father's generation's challenge was the Nazis. Amy Scott: Puzder was speaking at a workshop about ESG. The investigative watchdog Documented, where Kelly used to work, got hold of this recording, which was first verified and aired by the program Here and Now. Andy Puzder: The challenge of your generation is ESG investing, and it's more insidious than communism or the Nazis. Kelly Mitchell: I don't even know how to respond to that, but I think it does speak to the hyperbolic nature and the fear mongering that's come along with something as simple as like evaluating risk. Amy Scott: This is just a fraction of the suspects on Kelly's board, which is actually a PDF put together by her and her colleagues. It's a tangled web of think tanks, advocacy groups, corporations and oil and gas trade associations, including the Heartland Institute, Heritage Action for America, American Petroleum, Independent Women's Forum, Capital Research Center, American Legislative Exchange Council, America First Policy Institute. And many, many more. ___ Yes, it kind of makes your head spin, doesn't it? Kelly Mitchell: It does make my head spin. Amy Scott: We've got oil billionaires and Republican treasurers, anti-woke pundits and climate deniers. And what's even more baffling about all this is that the thing they're so afraid of, this so-called woke capitalist threat to fossil fuels, doesn't seem to be doing what its critics think it's doing. In fact, last year, the United States produced more oil and gas than any country ever has. Kelly says part of the problem with ESG is that it's so poorly defined. To critics on the right, it's part of an activist plot to bring down the fossil fuel industry, but to critics on the left, it's not doing nearly enough to actually address the climate crisis. Kelly Mitchell: In part because we don't really have the tools to distinguish green washing and empty promises from real, long term commitments. Amy Scott: And in some ways, that vagueness has left ESG open to attack. Kelly Mitchell: The death of ESG, if we're going to call it that, is really complicated. It's morphed into this buzzword that can now mean anything to anybody, and so identifying a single culprit is quite difficult here. Amy Scott: But the backlash has had a chilling effect. Big firms are leaving net zero initiatives in droves. Investment in ESG funds has fallen in each of the past three years. CEOs have scrubbed the letters ESG from their websites and public speeches, and maybe the final nail in the coffin, the SEC just dropped efforts to require companies to disclose climate related risks. So is ESG dead? Kelly Mitchell: The buzz word ESG may be dead. The movement has succeeded in, unfortunately, turning it into something quite politically charged and toxic. But the underlying principles are incredibly durable because they're based in reality. The truth is the world will decarbonize. The truth is that climate disasters are increasing in their frequency and their severity. Smart investors will continue to look at those risks. They will evaluate those risks, and they will price it into their investment decisions. They're probably just not going to do it under the banner of ESG. Amy Scott: Okay, so maybe the body of ESG is buried six feet under but that doesn't mean its spirit doesn't live on. Jason Isaac: These financial institutions are essentially now kind of like reverse virtue signaling. So they're virtue signaling to us, but in their statements, they're saying we're going to continue the policies that align with the energy transition. I wasn't using that term green hushing, but I may have to add that to my vocabulary. Amy Scott: Next episode, the evolution, or maybe reincarnation, of ESG.

Title: Nvidia takes $5.5 billion hit as US clamps down on its China chips | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Nvidia is caught in the middle of an escalating trade war between the world’s two largest economies. Nvidia on Tuesday said it will take a $5.5 billion financial hit after Washington placed fresh restrictions on the export of its H20 artificial intelligence chips to China, in the latest escalation of a growing battle for AI dominance. Nvidia (NVDA) slumped 6.87% Wednesday after tumbling during premarket trading. The export restrictions on Nvidia come as President Donald Trump’s tariffs are roiling global markets and raising concerns about the prospects for global economic growth. The World Trade Organization on Wednesday said its expectations for global trade this year have “deteriorated sharply” owing to the battery of new tariffs on goods and uncertainty around future trade policy. The H20 chip, released just last year, was purposefully made to accommodate stringent US export controls to China and allowed Nvidia to continue selling to the country. The model has less computing power than the more powerful H100 AI chip, which has already been banned for sale to China. “Nvidia specifically designed the H20 to comply with US exports restrictions…now the rules change and they lost $5 billion,” said Jay Hatfield, chief executive at Infrastructure Capital Advisors. “So this inconsistent trade policy is costing companies a lot of money.” The H20 is believed to have contributed to DeepSeek’s successful development of its ChatGPT-like reasoning AI model, R1, which was said to be trained at a fraction of the cost of American equivalents. The development stunned the tech industry and sparked an AI revolution in China. Nvidia said in a Tuesday regulatory filing that it was informed by the US government last week the H20 chips would now require a special license to be exported to China, which accounted for 13% of sales last year. The chipmaker said it will report approximately $5.5 billion worth of charges in its first quarter’s earnings on May 28, associated with H20 products for “inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves.” Analysts led by Dan Ives, global head of technology research at financial services firm Wedbush Securities, said the financial impact is small relatively, but the restrictions mark a “strategic blow” for Nvidia’s efforts to continue engaging its Chinese customers. “This disclosure is a clear sign that Nvidia now has massive restrictions and hurdles in selling to China as the Trump Administration knows there is one chip and company fueling the AI Revolution and it’s Nvidia,” they said in a Tuesday research note. The industry-leading AI chip designer has been caught in the crossfire in recent years as the US seeks to block China’s use of American technology to advance its military and AI systems. The US Commerce Department confirmed on Tuesday it was issuing new export licensing requirements on China-related exports of Nvidia’s H20 and another American AI chipmaker AMD’s MI308 chips, as well as their equivalents, according to Reuters. “The Commerce Department is committed to acting on the President’s directive to safeguard our national and economic security,” a Commerce Department spokesperson was quoted as saying. Nvidia was told the license requirement would be in place indefinitely, the company said in the filing. It is unclear how the US government would grant the licenses. The company declined to comment beyond its filing. While the Trump administration’s imposition of curbs on the H20 chips was widely expected, the restriction was more abrupt than anticipated, analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a Wednesday note. Since DeepSeek’s R1 model shook global markets earlier this year, American lawmakers on both sides of the aisle jointly called for tighter export controls on AI chips. In the months since, China has seen an AI boom, with DeepSeek’s reveal galvanizing investment and pressure on Chinese companies to advance its AI sector. Investor confidence in the country’s tech sector has surged, driving rallies in China and Hong Kong stocks. DeepSeek, along with many of China’s established tech giants, have been major consumers of Nvidia’s H20 graphic processing units. While Chinese tech heavy weight Huawei and AI chipmaker Cambroon have developed alternatives to H20s, those China-made chips generally lag in performance, particularly in software maturity, according to Brady Wang, associate director of Counterpoint Research, a market analysis firm. The performance gap between Chinese chips and Nvidia’s is expected to widen, Wang said, because of “Nvidia’s superior ecosystem and manufacturing advantages,” even as DeepSeek’s rise demonstrates that high-performing AI models can be trained with lower-spec hardware. The prospects for the global economy have taken a knock because of Trump’s trade war, according to a new report by the WTO. The WTO projects global economies will grow more slowly than they would without tariffs — especially in North America, a region dominated by the United States, which will see a greater slowdown than other areas. The WTO said it expects global gross domestic product to expand by 2.2% this year. That growth would be 0.6 percentage points lower than the rate it would expect in a scenario with no additional tariffs. In North America, the impact will be more severe still, with GDP growth expected to be 1.6 percentage points below what it would be otherwise. With the escalation of an aggressive trade war between the US and China, Ives said further restrictions may be coming. “While the Nvidia news is concerning, it’s not a shock as we are in the middle of a trade war between the US and China and expect more punches thrown by both sides,” he said. In 2022, President Joe Biden began curbing the sale of advanced semiconductors from chipmakers like Nvidia to China over concerns that they could power its military. The controls have subsequently expanded to include restrictions on sales of chipmaking equipment, high-bandwidth memory chips and products manufactured outside the US using American technology in order to limit China’s technological progress. Related article Biden unveils last round of AI chip curbs aimed at China, Russia Before Biden stepped down, his administration also broadened the geographic scope of those restrictions, unveiling a global export framework that subjects countries to different restrictions in a bid to prevent advanced AI technology from getting into the hands of adversaries like China through third countries. The new rules are expected to take effect next month. The series of restrictions have come under repeated criticism from US tech giants, particularly Nvidia, which says they will undercut US competitiveness. Ned Finkle, Nvidia’s vice president of government affairs, wrote in a company blog post that the adoption of AI around the world fuels growth and opportunity for industries at home and abroad. But the restrictions put that global progress “in jeopardy” and threatened to “derail innovation and economic growth worldwide,” he said. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

More Lucas via AFP) (Photo by RICCARDO MILANI/Hans Lucas/AFP via Getty Images) Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO) stock has risen 12% over the past five days due to two key developments: a broader market rebound after President Trump suspended reciprocal tariffs for 90 days, and the company’s announcement of a $10 billion share buyback program. Despite the recent gains, AVGO is still down over 20% this year. Such fluctuations are not unusual for the stock—AVGO fell 36% during the 2022 inflation-driven downturn and dropped 48% during the COVID-19-related market selloff in 2020. However, for investors seeking a potentially more stable and high-performing alternative, consider the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, which includes 30 stocks with a strong record of consistently outperforming the S&P 500 over the past four years. Broadcom’s key financial indicators highlight its strong foundation: For long-term investors, the recent decline in AVGO stock could offer a compelling entry point, considering the company’s solid fundamentals and AI leadership. Those sensitive to volatility should consider hedging, consulting a financial advisor, or diversification, such as the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark to produce strong returns for investors.

Title: Naomi Campbell, Larry Fink And The Pressing Need For Digital Identity

ByDavid G.W. Birch ByDavid G.W. Birch, Contributor. Naomi Campbell on May 13, 2018 during the Fashion For Relief Cannes event (Photo by YANN ... More COATSALIOU/AFP via Getty Images) The Financial Times magazine has one of the most interesting stories about money and digital identity that I have read for a long time. It is a story about supermodels and billionaires and lawyers and fraud, so I cannot resist drawing attention to it and noting the connection between Naomi Campbell and Larry Fink. The essence of the story is that the famous supermodel Naomi Campbell was introduced to a woman who she thought was a lawyer, but the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) said that the woman in question had never been a solicitor in England and Wales, so I assume that Ms. Campbell (just like the rest of us) had never thought to check whether the woman really was a lawyer or not. Ms. Campbell is quoted as saying “I trusted her, as she was presented to me as a lawyer”. (Rather interestingly, the SRA also noted that “the term lawyer is not a protected term”, something that had not occurred to me, so that unregulated individuals working in the law can refer to themselves as such.) The “lawyer” became a trustee of Ms. Campbell’s Fashion for Relief charity and managed the charity’s day-to-day operations. She went on to conduct a variety of transactions, which eventually included engaging expensive actual lawyers to act on Ms. Campbell’s behalf. Or, at least, that is what the actual lawyers thought. They had verified Ms. Campbell’s identity by requesting a copy of her passport (which was sent to them) and confirmation of the engagement. This confirmation came in the form of an email, and from then on the lawyers communicated with “Ms. Campbell” via this email address, not noticing that the address that purported to be Ms. Campbell’s personal email address was in fact different from her actual address by a single character. This fascinating story illustrates rather well two different problems that need to fixed if we are to benefit from an efficient online economy. The first is that of fraudulent identity (is this Naomi Campbell?) and the second is that of fraudulent credentials (is this a lawyer?). We (society) need both of these problems to be solved, and we need them to be solved soon. (And please note, even if you do not care that much about supermodels being ripped off by bogus lawyers, that this is not only money, it is also about lives. Here in the UK we have just had the example of a man accused of signing off fire safety certificates for flats in high-rise blocks using the credentials and signature of qualified engineer.) At the same time that I was reflecting on Ms. Campbell’s experiences, I noticed that Larry Fink, the billionaire CEO of Blackrock (which has some $10 trillion in assets under management) wrote in his 2025 letter to investors that "One day, I expect tokenized funds will become as familiar to investors as ETFs—provided we crack one critical problem: identity verification… If we're serious about building an efficient and accessible financial system, championing tokenization alone won't suffice. We must solve digital verification, too”. I interpret Mr. Fink’s plea as a demand to tackle both problems, fraudulent identification and fraudulent credentials, and I could not agree more with his prioritisation of the issue. I’ve been saying the same thing for years, arguing that that there is no way forward in fintech (or, in fact, pretty much any other sector) without the development of digital identity infrastructure, but now that supermodels and billionaires are saying it, hopefully something will get done. The good news is that the technologies we need to address those challenges are well-known and well-understood. Highway patrol. At the recent Secure Technology Alliance summit in San Diego, Mobile driver’s licenses (mDLs) and verifiable credentials (VCs) took centre stage—and for good reason. With millions of mDLs already out there in the US (and soon in the UK too) we are perhaps close to tackling the identification problem. Simon Curry, VP of EMV at Visa, said at that summit that “mDLs offer the best option we have today in the arms race we’re in to combat the ever-evolving world of threat and fraud from bad actors and AI -- and it’s a significant leap forward”. Take California as an example. They held a hackathon last fall, where companies including Fime1, Mitek, MATTR, Ping Identity, Incode and others showed some of the possibilities. Just to illustrate a few of these possibilities: A team from Cisco won “Most Promising” for an application of mDLs as a root digital identity for passwordless authentication; Developers from Block won “Best Privacy and Security Design” for an in-person age check application for merchants using Square; And a team from U.S. Bank won “Most Scalable” for an in-person identity verification implementation for bank branches to carry out high-risk transactions. The building blocks of the next generation financial market infrastructure are here, but we need some kind of verification framework to make them work. Going back to the issue of the lawyer who was not a lawyer. While mDLs might help with identity, the DMV does not know whether you are a lawyer or not, but bar associations, including those in California, do. They have been exploring the idea of digital or verifiable credentials for legal professionals. Such credentials could streamline identity verification, improve security, and facilitate interstate practice by providing a standardised way to verify a lawyer’s qualifications and standing. Once you have you driving licence in a digital wallet, it does not test the boundaries of human imagination to forsee the California bar association having a a service whereby lawyers can go online, identify themselves using their mDL and then obtain their licence to practice as a verifiable credential to be stored in the same wallet. (After all, the American Bar Association already allows lawyers to download their membership cards into those digital wallets.) Since the consumer’s digital wallet would be able to check the digital signature on the credential presented by the lawyer and know for sure that it was valid, issued by the relevant bar association to the person in possession of the mobile phone, we should be able to take out a fraud vector and in doing so reduce the overall cost of intermediation. Of course, as Jan Vereecken, the CPO over at meeco, points out in an interesting piece about trust in digital identity infrastructures, digital signatures are evidence of origin and not evidence of trust (in itself a complex topic). It might be time consuming and inconvenient for Ms. Campbell to find out whether someone is a lawyer or not, but digital identity should mean that her iPhone could do it in a couple of seconds. Whether she should trust the lawyer or not… well, that’s another story.

Title: Trump’s Tariff Shock and the China Supply Chain

Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access We are now in a trade war with China, and the only question is: How long before Trump (and America) blink? A month after my last piece in The Nation, its essentials—on DOGE, the tax cuts, Pentagon spending, falling oil prices, and, above all, the tariffs, look pretty good. I judged that Mexico and Canada would get off fairly easy, that China would return blow for blow. At first it seemed I’d guessed wrong about Vietnam and other Asian countries’ escaping the heavy hit. But then Trump backed away from his absurd “reciprocal tariff” scheme. That retreat was prompted by a wobble in the bond market and the dollar. In past crises, even when US policies were at fault—as was the case during the subprime mortgage debacle—investors rushed into US Treasury bonds and bills as the safe haven. This time they moved out. Japanese insurance companies may have led that move, in an act of self-defense that hit the money men where it hurts—and showed the limits of Trump’s power. The “pause” is provisional until July 8. By then, the economic picture and the politics of tariffs may be entirely different than they are today. Trump still claimed success, reporting that more than 75 countries had come around to “kiss [his] ass,” including offers to cut their tariffs on US goods to zero. Since for many countries those tariffs were already low, while others cannot afford much of what America still exports, this costs them little and promises few gains to American firms. But along with, say, a few arms contracts or soybean shipments, it may be enough to keep the tariff wolf from their door. China does not bend. It does not bow or kneel. This has been a bedrock principle of Chinese policy since the revolution. No one inclined to grovel before any foreign power can become a leader in China, and any Chinese government that wavered on the point would be swept away by popular anger—yes, even in China. China also has a living history of hardship far greater than anything Americans can remember. The Chinese can and will take what comes. So, we are in a trade war and the only question is: How long before Trump (and America) blink? The first pressure points for political pain are the stock and bond markets; the second is upcoming elections. The broad scenario is familiar since 2008—falling prices leading to financial crisis, followed by bailout, deep recession, and ultimately emergency measures to get the economy moving again. However, that was then. The Bush and Obama regimes had enough self-preserving instinct to resort to Keynesianism under stress—as did Trump himself, when faced with Covid in 2020. But in the new libertarian order, and with Trump (presumably) barred from reelection, extreme Musk-and-Mellon-ism may instead prevail this time—even if the Democrats score gains next year. A third potential pressure point could hurt even more. Consider America’s supply chain: Amazon, Walmart, Target, Costco, etc. These firms have built the most brutally efficient funnel for the distribution of goods ever seen. Many of those goods—by no means all, but many—come from China. Many are produced in the US and in other countries. But all merge into the same chain, to which, for many millions of Americans, there are now few if any alternatives. To apply an argument from my new book, Entropy Economics, efficiency is achieved by large fixed investments, which then permit unit costs to fall as volume increases and quality improves. This was Henry Ford’s famous formula for the Model T, replicated over more than a century in every sector and domain. It is the American System. America’s distribution system—for all its aesthetic and moral defects—is merely the latest and one of the greatest applications of Ford’s principle. But highly efficient, high-fixed-cost business structures are fragile. When their variable costs go up, their volume shrinks and their profits can fall sharply, since they must still cover their fixed costs. Profits quickly turn into losses. Firms with high fixed costs can run losses only until their reserves are exhausted—at which point breakdown and bankruptcy follow. Adjustment does not occur by magic as textbooks claim; it is a slow, painful process—if it occurs at all. Trump’s tariffs on China, leaving aside those on the rest of the world, raise variable costs. If the tariffs wipe out the profits of Chinese suppliers—very likely in many cases, since Asian profit rates are low—they will cease to ship to the United States. A drop in volume will hit the profits of the distribution network. As profits fall, parts of that network may begin to fail. If the large stores and on-line warehouses start to shut, there will be no channel left with sufficient capacity to deliver non-Chinese goods, including those made in the United States, to the vast consumption market that is the American working and middle class. Without access to their own customers, American producers will also begin to fail. Emma Jackson Saree Makdisi Elie Mystal Janai Nelson The last great crisis, Covid-19, broke the supply chain—but only temporarily. It could be repaired, rerouted, and restored. Beyond that, Covid hit services hardest. Services have relatively low fixed costs. They shrink, and then, eventually, they (mostly) recover. The Great Financial Crisis in 2008 hit housing: It destroyed values, displaced millions through foreclosure, and depressed construction. But homeowners who were not displaced—the vast majority—suffered mainly paper losses and life went on. Home-building is also an industry with a high proportion of variable costs, and ultimately the housing sector began to recover. Distribution is different—and all Americans need to eat every day. They rely on the high-fixed-cost supply chain for daily purchases, including food and many other items produced in the US and around the world. If the distribution network starts to fail, Americans could be deprived not only of Chinese goods but of all goods. The pain gauge will go up and up. A Soviet-style shortage economy might emerge—and this can happen quite quickly, as the pandemic briefly showed. With serious shortages, the “stimulus” reflex is counterproductive: More money will bring longer lines and higher prices. One might run the distribution system at a loss, via bailouts and subsidies for the “critical infrastructure” that is provided by the operating firms. But it is hard to imagine how either happens, at scale, consistent with a stable dollar. If the value of the dollar continues to fall, the price of everything (imported and home-made) will rise even more. The Federal Reserve will then face a choice between supporting the infrastructure subsidies or jacking up interest rates to protect the dollar (and “fight inflation,” as they will call it). That dynamic, once started, works against recovery. It is also possible, as the free-market evangelists surrounding Trump seem to hope, that the problem will be solved by massive waves of new business investment, reviving domestic industry, reshoring supply chains and decentralizing distribution, all very quickly in the teeth of inflation, recession, unemployment, high interest rates, and business bankruptcies. When pigs fly. It is naturally also possible that our leader will again reverse course, declare victory, and try to restore the status quo ante, with the usual flattery directed at Xi Jinping. On smartphones and computers, the two largest imports from China, he already did just that, late on a Friday night, evidently to save Apple. By the time he gets around to blinking on the rest, our onetime Chinese partners may have reassessed the value to themselves of their relationship with us and moved on. Good luck getting them back. The chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week. Trump’s catastrophic “Liberation Day” has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called “enemy aliens” are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire. At a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump’s intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account. In just the last month, we’ve published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration’s appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities. We also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections—like Wisconsin’s recent state Supreme Court race—that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can’t buy our democracy.

(Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Question: Why pay 34x earnings for Amazon stock when you can buy Google stock for just 19x? That’s a tough sell—especially when you consider three straightforward reasons: However, if you seek upside with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. While Google may not fit the mold of a traditional “safe haven,” its track record during market disruptions is worth considering. The stock declined 45% during the 2022 inflation shock and 31% amid the Covid-19 downturn, showing that it is still prone to volatility. However, the stock has already seen a significant correction, dropping from over $205 to under $160 now. This decline implies that much of the downside could already be factored in. With widespread belief that Artificial Intelligence represents a transformative, long-term growth theme, Google may offer a compelling case at its current valuation. Although both Amazon and Google provide AI infrastructure, Google’s real strength lies in its groundbreaking AI research and the seamless integration of that technology into products like Search and YouTube. This unique combination of innovation and massive reach positions Google favorably for continued AI-led growth. Naturally, investing in Google isn’t risk-free. There’s always a chance earnings might miss estimates or that growth could decelerate. Additionally, unpredictable events could adversely affect the stock. Investors should be prepared for potential volatility—including the possibility of a 30% decline from current levels. That said, for long-term investors with a 3-to-5-year horizon and a “buy-and-hold” strategy, Google’s current valuation might present a worthwhile entry point. For those with lower risk tolerance, a hedged approach within a diversified portfolio, such as the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark, might offer a smoother ride while still capturing potential upside. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid- and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Global markets are again under pressure following an escalation in U.S.–China trade tensions, with investors fleeing to havens and tech stocks taking a beating. Gold surged over 2% on Wednesday to top $3,300 per ounce and set a new record high. The dollar weakened further, and Nasdaq futures pointed to a rough day ahead for Wall Street. On Tuesday, the White House announced tariffs of up to 245% on Chinese imports in response to China’s retaliatory measures and bans on exports of key strategic materials, including rare earth elements, gallium and germanium that are used the production of high-speed computer chips. The move follows an Executive Order launching an investigation into national security risks tied to U.S. dependence on foreign critical minerals. Markets reacted swiftly. The Dollar Index (DXY) fell back below 100, signaling reduced investor confidence in the U.S. currency. Meanwhile, the euro strengthened to $1.13 and the yen to 142 per dollar. Equities struggled. Nasdaq futures dropped more than 2%, with tech stocks particularly hard hit. Nvidia (NVDA) shares fell 7% pre-market after the company disclosed that new U.S. export controls on AI chips to China would cost it $5.5 billion in lost revenue. The announcement raised concerns of broader earnings hits across the semiconductor industry , which relies heavily on Chinese demand. Bitcoin (BTC) dropped slightly to $83,000 following the news, reflecting its stronger correlation with U.S. tech stocks rather than acting as a safe-haven asset like gold.

Title: Institutional support for tokenization grows

Increasing numbers of institutional investors and wealth managers are predicting growth in tokenization as more become aware of the benefits, according to new global research by London-based Nickel Digital Asset Management (Nickel), Europe’s leading digital assets hedge fund manager founded by alumni of Bankers Trust, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan. 0 16 April 2025 Be the first to comment This content is provided by an external author without editing by Finextra. It expresses the views and opinions of the author. The study with organisations invested in the sector found 87% believe fund managers will increasingly look at the potential to tokenize investment funds and asset classes over the next three years. That compares to 75% who predicted more fund managers would explore tokenization when the study was last conducted just over six months ago.Nickel believes growing support for the expansion of tokenization is being driven by rising awareness of the benefits it potentially offers. Its research with institutional investors and wealth managers in the US, UK, Germany, Switzerland, Singapore, Brazil and the United Arab Emirates who collectively manage around $1.1 trillion in assets shows the role of tokenization in facilitating liquidity and offering secondary marketing trading options are being recognised as the most attractive benefits. They were rated the top two benefits by professional investors ahead of greater transparency and their role in enabling fractional ownership of assets while reduced settlement times and enhanced risk management were rated as the fifth and sixth most attractive benefits. Reduced cost was ranked seventh.The study however shows there are still challenges to be addressed before tokenization is more widely adopted - around 74% point to distribution issues while 73% are concerned about regulation.Around 61% say widespread adoption of tokenization will run up against investors’ reluctance to change while 59% identified the maturity of service providers as a challenge and 55% the current lack of tokenized assets. Less than half (49%) are concerned about the security risk of tokenization and only 45% say lack of demand is a challenge.Anatoly Crachilov, CEO and Founding Partner at Nickel Digital, said: ““Tokenization is rapidly moving from concept to cornerstone with global heavyweights like BlackRock publicly endorsing tokenization as the future of financial markets.”“It is great to see the increasing numbers of investors from our first survey to the current one agreeing with this paradigm shift — one where improved liquidity, enhanced transparency, and instant settlement will become the new standard.”

Title: The changes in embassies, the squabbling over taxis, the blue knives, the unpaid (of the proud Left, of course) and President Salmas

Time Published: 2025-04-16T07:22:35Z
Full Content:
Hello, I don’t know how many of you are at work today or have already started your Easter holidays, but a good parliamentary source told me that “if you see an MP not elected in Attica wandering around here in the afternoon, you can poke a hole in my nose…” Look, let’s not kid ourselves, being a member of parliament is not exactly the most… intense job in the world. Anyway, today there’s a KYSEA meeting, they’ll discuss Dendias’ armament issues, they won’t discuss the cable (it’s Easter after all), and there’s also an issue with Chrysochoidis, the extension of the fence, which everyone wants – including the minister of course – but, from what I understand, there’s no money. And after Easter Tuesday… Changes in ambassadors Significant changes in the country’s diplomatic representation abroad are marked by this year’s decisions on ambassador-level transfers. What stands out, of course, is the transfer of E. Sekeris, who is Greece’s Permanent Representative to the UN, at a time when the Greek presidency will last until 2026. His replacement will struggle to find rhythm in the particularly complex role of representing Greece at the UN Security Council. Also notable is the transfer of Aik. Nasika from the Embassy in Washington, as she hasn’t even completed two years since her appointment, and at a time when it’s extremely critical for the Greek embassy to reestablish ties with the “Trump system.” Ambassador N. Garilidis is also being transferred from the Embassy in Tripoli, at a time when relations with Libya require particular attention. New ambassadors will also be appointed to Riyadh and Abu Dhabi — particularly important posts, as our foreign policy is focused on both the Arab world and the Gulf countries. At the Metropolis (God bless us) Mitsotakis These are holy days, and churches are in the spotlight. I’ve heard that on Holy Thursday, Mitsotakis will go to the Metropolis of Athens to hear Archbishop Ieronymos officiate the Passion Service, and afterward he’ll take the ferry to Tinos, where he’ll spend the holy days (returning on Easter Monday). The attempt to reconnect with the Church is more than obvious, after all, ND’s losses to its right flank are not negligible. Just the other day, Mitsotakis was with the Archbishop at the Student Dormitory of the Apostolic Ministry in Agia Varvara, and last year as well he had attended the Metropolis on Holy Thursday. Back then it was a big deal, since the aftershocks of the same-sex marriage law hadn’t yet subsided. “Squabbling” over taxis Yesterday’s SATA strike over the right of taxis to enter bus lanes while loaded has political “tails” as well. It’s no coincidence that SATA generally had a good relationship with former Deputy Transport Minister Vasilis Oikonomou, whom President Lymberopoulos referred to as the “father of taxis.” Oikonomou, who was handling the new Highway Code — which is currently out of Public Consultation and in the General Secretariat of the government — had found a formula by including a provision that loaded taxis could enter bus lanes, but only after a traffic study was conducted and a ministerial decision was issued. Then came the cabinet reshuffle, Oikonomou left, the Highway Code stalled, and taxi drivers were left in limbo. Meanwhile, the new Deputy Minister Konstantinos Kyranakis is “running” with the trains and doesn’t appear immediately inclined to satisfy the taxi drivers’ request, while his relationship with Lymberopoulos has been stormy since the “battle” over the operations of Uber and Taxibeat. A few days ago, Kyranakis said that the new Highway Code would come to Parliament, but it remains to be seen what will happen with the controversial provision and whether it will remain as Oikonomou drafted it or be modified. Oikonomou, for his part, tells his associates that he’s done the work and it would be pointless to “rip it out.” Sharpening the “blue” knives You got a sense of what’s coming when the provisions for surrogate motherhood are introduced in Parliament from the informal yet intense dialogue between “blue” MPs and the Maximos Mansion that began in our dark column. The parliamentarians who had opposed the same-sex marriage bill now argue that developments fully vindicate their earlier observations. A government source responded that the provisions don’t close any “back doors” opened by the marriage equality law, but by an earlier law from 2014 under Samaras. The MPs return today, refute the government source, and refer to the new Floridis provision. The regulation, they say, stipulates that gender does not constitute an incapacity to gestate. In other words, a male couple — whose rights were equalized by the marriage equality law — cannot invoke medical incapacity in order to have a child via surrogate. Whether this new regulation will withstand legal challenges remains to be seen. Salmas like Tsitouridis? I told you last week that independent MP Marios Salmas wants to start a party — he’s thinking it through and working on it. His presence at Argyris Dinopoulos’ book event a few days ago might signal the kind of audience he’s targeting, and he might “play ball” with former allies of his, like the titan of politics Nikos Nikolopoulos, who’s currently politically homeless. Salmas isn’t talking with Latinopoulou (who’s rushing to organize her own party), but wouldn’t it be something if he also reached out — just in case — to another “former,” Savvas Tsitouridis, who launched the (unforgettable) party “Radicals” and scored 0.16% in the 2019 European elections? The tender, the Parliament restaurant, and gourmet dishes courtesy of… Mitsotakis Remember when Kostas Tasoulas was moved from Parliament to the Presidential Mansion and many started saying that Metsovo cheeses would also disappear from Parliament? I’m here to tell you that this moment is near, as a tender for a new contractor for the Parliament’s restaurant and main cafés will be launched soon. These spots usually go to whoever offers the lowest prices on a specific list of products, but — almost always — the contractor turns out to be from the President’s hometown. Let me also tell you that among the key obligations of the new leaseholder is to retain the existing staff. Random detail: the chef who has curated the restaurant’s gourmet dishes in recent years (and has dramatically upgraded the menu) is named Mitsotakis and is a very distant relative of the Prime Minister. Kasselakis, Famelos — same difference for the workers of Avgi and Kokkino The ordeal…and the mockery for the workers of Avgi and Kokkino continues, as not only are they still unpaid, but as time passes, they’re starting to realize that Socrates Famelos is turning out to be an even worse employer than Kasselakis. Let me explain: on Holy Monday, another three-way meeting took place involving the representative of the workers in the party’s media outlets, the SYRIZA president, and a representative from the journalists’ union ESIEA. The main topic was the timeline for the repayment of two unpaid salaries and the party leadership’s plans for the future of these “shops.” However, instead of offering even new promises, Famelos told the unpaid workers that they’ve received enough already, while their peers in other outlets have been unpaid for months (?). He added that he will proceed with taking out a loan to pay a quarter of the money owed and made it clear that “for the next two months, there’s not a single euro.” Why we got 16 Exocet (and not 24 or 32) The visit last Monday of Defense Minister Sébastien Lecornu to Athens brought new developments in Greek-French relations, which had seen some fluctuations recently, mainly due to the Meteor missiles and Turkey’s attempt to acquire them. The French minister – and almost prime minister – finalized the procurement of 16 modern guided missiles MM40 Exocet Block 3C. Now, if someone wonders why 16 and not 24 or 32, the answer is simple. The procurement of these specific missiles was approved last December at a cost of 33 million euros and is intended for the two latest missile boats (Roussen-class) “Karathanasis” and “Vlachakos” that the Hellenic Navy received from the Elefsis Shipyards. These specific warships have 8 “cells” from which the Exocet missiles are launched. Essentially, the Navy acquired the “payload,” as it is called, for each ship. After all, other ships of the same class also carry Exocet missiles, with the difference being that they have older versions. Beyond that, in any case, one cannot underestimate the fact that the French “released” the most modern version with a range of 200 km and clearly greater capabilities, at a critical time with ongoing tensions in the broader region. Moreover, as we mentioned above, it has been announced that the KYSEA will convene today, where the 12-year armament program will be discussed, as well as Nikos Dendias’ proposal for the acquisition of a 4th Belharra frigate. It is certain that the issue of armaments will have much continuity and many interesting “episodes” in the near future. GEK TERNA’s post-Easter gifts The GEK TERNA stock is once again heading full speed toward a capitalization of 2 billion euros, with trading intensifying even during “light” “pre-holiday” sessions like yesterday’s. The reason for the investment interest may be revealed at the end of the month, on April 28, when GEK TERNA will publish its 2024 results and investors will learn the final benefit from the transaction with Masdar, which acquired TERNA ENERGY. If market information proves accurate, the profit from the sale is significant, which means the benefit (dividend) for shareholders will also be significant… Eurobank bets on Prosperty to sell 2,000 properties Having raised 7 million euros in funding since its founding in 2020 from investment funds such as Velocity Partners, Metavallon, BigPi, as well as family offices, the Greek real estate tech platform Prosperty is entering its next phase following Eurobank’s entry into its share capital. The bank, which is acquiring a 25% stake in the PropTech company, aims with this move to manage and promote its properties more effectively, but the move is also linked to the “My Home II” program. Overall, by the end of the year, it is estimated that the total number of Eurobank-owned properties on the Prosperty platform will increase to at least 2,000. What is interesting, however, is why Prosperty was chosen, and one of the reasons has to do with the technology developed by the company, which has created a comprehensive ecosystem of services and tools that simplify property management and commercialization, while it has also developed a B2B SaaS solution, ProspertyOS, for institutional investors, asset managers, and banks, offering complete property portfolio management and monetization. Athens is more optimistic than other markets Futures contracts on the Derivatives Market will close this week on Thursday, not on Good Friday. On the other hand, Standard & Poor’s doesn’t acknowledge Easter holidays and will issue its rating on the Greek economy on Good Friday; a favorable score is expected to be followed by an upgrade for Greek banks. With that in mind, a few bold investors showed up yesterday, ready to place the “Good Friday bet,” ignoring the fact that our market will remain closed for four days amid ongoing geopolitical turbulence. The signal came early from National Bank (+6.43%) at €9.274, with trades worth €35 million—clearly not from retail investors. Piraeus (+3.45%) at €4.80, Eurobank (+2.58%) at €2.39, and Alpha (+2.22%) at €2.161 followed. The truth is that trading volume intensified in the final hour of the session, but total transactions did not exceed €150 million, with €18 million in block trades. For the fourth consecutive session, the General Index closed in positive territory, yesterday at the day’s high of 1,656.48 points, up +1.89%. Overall, in four sessions, the General Index has gained over +8.3%. The Stassinopoulos Group was once again in the spotlight, with VIOHALCO (+5.07%) at €5.39, Cenergy (+2.54%), and ELVALHALCOR (+2.61%). OTE (+2.53%) reached a market cap of €6.5 billion, but was surpassed by OPAP, which with a smaller rise (+0.69%) is now approaching a market cap of €7 billion and a stock price of €19. The turmoil strengthens the balance sheet of HELEX Over the last seven sessions, regardless of market fluctuations, HELEX’s stock has recorded gains of about +11.5%. These ups and downs—high market volatility—generate increased revenue for Hellenic Exchanges. HELEX is a company with a market value of €316.2 million and cash reserves of approximately €70 million. As of yesterday, the average daily transaction value on the Stock Exchange appears to be up +40% compared to the same period last year. All these transactions generate commissions for HELEX, which also benefits from an 18% increase in market capitalization. HELEX’s management announced that—for the 2024 fiscal year—it will distribute a dividend of €0.29/share, up 21% from last year. The stock’s dividend yield exceeds 5%. ONYX seeks transfer to the main market of the ASE On May 10, the management of ONYX Tourism will submit an application to transfer to the Main Market of the Athens Stock Exchange. This will follow its application for participation in the Recovery Fund and the Strategic Investments Plan (ESCHASE), in collaboration with Deloitte, for its ambitious €180 million investment next to Sani in Halkidiki. After the approvals, a major and equally ambitious capital increase is planned for the fall, led by Vigor AΧΕΠΕΥ (of Nikos Kontaroudis) and Pantelakis Securities. The market value of the former MED, now ONYX Tourism, has surpassed €84 million, with institutional portfolios currently holding a 6% stake in the company. 100,000 contracts passed…through the AI scanner A quiet revolution is taking place behind the scenes at the Hellenic Cadastre. In order to manage the ever-increasing volume of transactions and the hundreds of thousands of contracts it “inherited” from the now-defunct mortgage offices, the agency had, until recently, relied primarily on the assistance of external lawyers, at a cost of 15 euros per file. Since September 2024, Artificial Intelligence has entered the scene forcefully, and—as we hear—official announcements are expected next week: More than 100,000 contracts have been legally reviewed at lightning speed and at a cost of less than 0.13 euros each. The savings for the public sector already exceed 1.5 million euros, while transaction processing is now much faster, given that in Athens it used to take up to 2 years to process a single contract. Delphi goes…to Iraq The agreement was finalized over the weekend, following a meeting between the Deputy Prime Minister of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, Qubad Talabani, the Greek Minister of National Defense, Nikos Dendias, and the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs responsible for Economic Diplomacy and Extroversion, Tasos Hatzivasileiou. During these meetings, it was decided—and Symeon Tsomokos immediately agreed—that one month from now, on May 16 and 17, a Delphi Economic Forum will be organized in Iraqi Kurdistan. Under intense time pressure, the technical details are being handled by the Secretary General for International Economic Relations and Extroversion, Dimitris Skalkos, who will lead the Greek business delegation. D. Trump seeks Jerome Powell’s replacement U.S. Treasury Secretary Bessent is making it clear: the administration is already considering who will succeed Fed Chair Jerome Powell, and interviews with candidates will begin in the fall. The American central banker warns that tariff policies will lead to price increases, inflation, and recession. The dollar interest rate cuts that President Trump so strongly desires in order to boost investment appeal in the U.S. might not be the right remedy. Markets are watching the clash and are selling off bonds—not only in the U.S. but also in Japan. The yield on Japan’s 30-year government bonds has surged since the fateful day of April 2nd, rising by 33 basis points—to its highest level in the last 19 years—while the U.S. 30-year yield rose by 29 basis points over the same period. The U.S. 10-year bond is yielding 4.37%, the German 2.54%, the French 3.29%, and the Greek 3.43%. At the same time, in the stock markets, hedge funds are clearing stocks from their portfolios. Goldman Sachs recorded that in March, hedge funds executed the most aggressive stock sell-off (not just U.S. equities) since 2013. Not even during the pandemic crisis of 2020 was such a sharp reduction in equity positions by hedge funds recorded. When short-term professional market speculators sell in a hurry, temporary upticks—especially in the lead-up to the Easter holidays—might not matter all that much. Explore related questions

Title: Investors pull $795M from crypto funds amid tariff, Fed fears – Details

XRP and multi-asset funds outperformed most crypto investments products last week. Investors pulled $795 million from crypto funds last week, marking the third week of sell-offs. In fact, according to CoinShares’ weekly asset flows report, Bitcoin [BTC] led the outflows with $751 million, while Ethereum bled $37.6 million. The report linked the extended decline to tariff uncertainty. “Digital asset investment products saw a 3rd consecutive week of outflows last week, totalling US$795m, as recent tariff activity continues to weigh on sentiment towards the asset class.” Source: CoinShares BlackRock’s iShares ETF products recorded the highest investor withdrawals (sell-off). As per the report, iShares’ BTC ETFs and ETH ETFs, collectively, saw $342 million outflows last week. From a month-to-date (MTD) perspective, BlackRock bled $412 million, nearly half a billion over the past two weeks alone. Source: CoinShares Grayscale products followed closely with $187 million outflows, nearly half of BlackRock’s dump. On the altcoins front, Solana-based products ranked third after ETH in outflows. The products saw a $5.1 million sell-off. Surprisingly, XRP-based and multi-asset funds were the only outliers during last week’s decline. The report noted that XRP saw $3.4 million inflows last week, and the overall MTD flows stood at $1.5 million. Simply put, investors preferred XRP and multi-asset (crypto index ETFs) to individual assets like BTC or ETH in the first half of April. Additionally, the aforementioned idea was further supported by record inflows into the new 2x Tecrium XRP ETF. Worth noting, however, that some macro analysts projected that the decline could continue. Quinn Thompson, founder of macro-focused hedge fund Lekker Capital, stated that a recent speech by Fed chair Jerome Powell will be bad for risk assets in May, including crypto. “Barring a collapse in economic data before then, they (Powell and Governor Waller) prefer patience amidst the elevated uncertainty. This is good for bonds but bad for risk assets.” Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Title: Amid Trump’s tariff war, Germany’s next leader keeps faith in free trade
URL: https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-tariff-war-germany-next-leader-friedrich-merz-faith-free-trade/
Time Published: 2025-04-16T04:00:00Z

Despite Donald Trump’s lurch into protectionism and coercion, Friedrich Merz believes a transatlantic trade deal can still be done. BERLIN — Stop us if you’ve heard this one before: A German political leader on the eve of taking power promises that free trade is the answer to the country’s economic challenges. The approach worked for decades after World War II, as the export-driven Wirtschaftswunder propelled the then-West Germany to unparalleled prosperity. Now, even as President Donald Trump launches the biggest trade war in a century, Germany’s next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, is betting that Europe can still do a free-trade deal with the United States. One which it can negotiate, moreover, from a position of strength. “The best thing we can do is all work together to achieve zero tariffs on transatlantic trade. Then the problem will be solved,” Merz said in an interview on TV channel RTL after his Christian Democratic Union (CDU) agreed last week to form a coalition government with the Social Democrats (SPD). For Merz, the trade headwinds blasting across the Atlantic couldn’t come at a worse time, with Europe’s largest economy facing a third year of recession. On top of that, as the EU’s leading exporter, Germany and its auto industry are most exposed to Trump’s universal tariffs — 10 percent on most goods, along with 25 percent levies on steel, aluminum and cars. (Trump last week paused a higher, discretionary tariff of 20 percent against the EU for 90 days to open the way for trade talks.) Merz, 69, has made long careers in both business and politics as a champion of the $1.6 trillion transatlantic trading relationship and the NATO alliance — which was conceived to keep America engaged in Europe while keeping Germany “down” and allowing it to grow into an export powerhouse. The trained lawyer headed the Atlantic Bridge, a German nonprofit, for a decade, and among other roles chaired the German arm of U.S. investment giant Blackrock.A transatlantic free-trade deal was a central economic policy pitch that Merz made on the election campaign trail. His incoming government’s policy pact strives for an FTA with the U.S. “in the medium term,” while in the near term seeking to avoid a trade conflict and to secure the reduction of import duties. At the same time, Merz has sought to project an image of strength and resolve toward Washington. “The key message to Donald Trump is: Germany is back on track,” he said in English as he unveiled the coalition deal. The mixed signals are impossible to miss. “Merz seems to be wavering in recent weeks,” U.S. expert Laura von Daniels, from the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, told POLITICO. The incoming chancellor, she said, alternates between advocating closer U.S. ties and warning Brussels to brace for the end of Trump’s NATO protection, while vowing European independence. Merz is finally ascending the summit of German power after decades in the political wilderness. He made a name for himself in the 1990s as a fiscal hawk, only to be sidelined by the centrist Angela Merkel, who went on to rule for 16 years. He finally claimed the top job in the CDU on his third attempt at the end of 2021, going on to lead the party to a weak victory in the Feb. 23 general election with less than 30 percent of the vote. Despite their long years in opposition, Merz and his advisers appear to have few ideas on how to address the vulnerabilities of Germany’s export-oriented economy in a world where China is already a systemic rival and the United States is turning hostile. Yes, in throwing more than €1 trillion at upgrading Germany’s decaying infrastructure and rearming, Merz is trying to create a domestic driver for growth. But when it comes to dealing with the rest of the world, his thinking on trade resembles Germany’s postwar golden age. “I actually had the feeling with the U.S. chapter [of the coalition pact] that it wasn’t a description of reality at all,” Claudia Major, a foreign and defense analyst with the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, told POLITICO’s Berlin Playbook Podcast. “It’s more of a prayer. It’s almost like an invocation of the past that we all know isn’t coming back.” A free-trade deal “is wishful thinking in the current global situation,” Sandra Detzer, a lawmaker from the opposition Green party, told POLITICO. So far, Trade Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič — who negotiates on behalf of the 27 member countries that form the EU’s single market — has not managed to de-escalate tensions in three rounds of talks with Trump administration officials. A Commission statement on Šefčovič’s latest talks in Washington on Monday called on the U.S. to take the bloc’s offer to negotiate on tariffs seriously. “As with every negotiation, this must be a two-way street / two-way engagement, with both sides bringing something to the table,” said Commission trade spokesperson Olof Gill. Trade experts say that a deal recalling the ambition of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), where talks foundered nearly a decade ago, is today out of reach. “We no longer live in a world in which trade experts spend years negotiating the details of individual chapters in conference rooms in Brussels and Washington,” von Daniels said. “These days, it’s more about sectoral deals — narrow agreements, not mega-deals,” added Julian Hinz, an economics professor at the University of Bielefeld who also leads research on trade at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. Merz seems to have gotten the memo, in recent days dialing back his calls for a broad FTA and instead backing a proposal by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen for a narrower deal with the U.S. to cut tariffs on industrial goods to zero. To even have a chance of achieving that, he would need to foster ties with other EU members — and to sell France’s protectionist elite on the idea of freer trade with the rest of the world. “The number of countries contacting us and saying: 'We want to conclude free trade agreements with you very quickly,' has never been as high as it is now. So let’s do it!” Merz told TV interviewer Caren Miosga on Sunday. Merz will also need to exert his influence to prevent Trump from picking off other European leaders with offers of sweetheart deals. The American president “is trying to divide the Europeans,” said Sebastian Roloff, a lawmaker who negotiated the economic parts of the coalition agreement on behalf of the Social Democrats. Subject to both the CDU and the SPD approving the coalition agreement, Merz hopes to be elected chancellor May 6. He is due to fly to Paris the next day for talks with French President Emmanuel Macron, according to sources familiar with the matter. Trade — whether free or not — will be on the agenda. Koen Verhelst and Clea Caulcutt contributed reporting. Graphic by Giovanna Coi. Berlin wants more robust military spending following a bombshell move by the Trump administration to negotiate a peace deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin. U.S. president faces outrage from Arab countries and key European capitals over his “dangerous” proposal that Palestinians should be removed from the coastal enclave. Billionaire’s animosity toward German mainstream politicians and his affection for the AfD could bode poorly for Germany’s next government. The release marks the 10th time the two combatant nations have exchanged captives this year.

Subscribe Today's print edition Home Delivery Japanese financial services firm Keyaki Capital has launched the country’s first online private asset investment platform for high-net-worth investors, according to a statement. At launch, the platform features an open-ended private credit fund currently distributed by Keyaki Capital, the statement said. The Tokyo-based firm plans to introduce additional private capital funds, including private equity, private credit, real estate and venture capital funds in the future. The firm’s move comes as digital investment platforms have expanded rapidly globally in recent years, enabling investors to benefit from greater transparency and easier access to opportunities in different areas. There have also been efforts to make the burgeoning private markets more accessible, including BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink’s pledge last month to open them up to millions of everyday investors. Just last week, Singapore-based digital wealth management platform Endowus launched two alternative asset class portfolios that provided investors access to multiple, semiliquid private market funds. The funds comprise a diversified private credit portfolio of strategies from firms like Apollo Global Management, Ares Management, and Blackstone, and a new private equity portfolio that offers access to names such as Carlyle Group and EQT.

Amidst global economic uncertainties and potential trade disruptions, fixed income is gaining traction as a haven for investors. Saurav Ghosh suggests a 33-33-33 allocation strategy across short-term corporate bonds, longer-tenure G-Secs, and high-rated corporate bonds. With India's stable economy and anticipated rate cuts, locking in rates now offers a promising avenue for portfolio stability and consistent returns.

April 15, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, April 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Quantum Computing, Inc. (NASDAQ: QUBT), Atkore Inc. (NYSE: ATKR), Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS), and Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ: RKLB). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Quantum Computing, Inc. (NASDAQ: QUBT) Class Period: March 30, 2020 - January 15, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 28, 2025 The lawsuit alleges that, during the Class Period, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Defendants overstated the capabilities of QCI’s quantum computing technologies, products, and/or services; (ii) Defendants overstated the scope and nature of QCI’s relationship with NASA, as well as the scope and nature of QCI’s NASA-related contracts and/or subcontracts; (iii) Defendants overstated QCI’s progress in developing a TFLN foundry, the scale of the purported TFLN foundry, and orders for the Company’s TFLN chips; (iv) QCI’s business dealings with Quad M and millionways both qualified as related party transactions; (v) accordingly, QCI’s revenues relied, at least in part, on undisclosed related party transactions; (vi) all the foregoing, once revealed, was likely to have a significant negative impact on QCI’s business and reputation; and (vii) as a result, Defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. For more information on the QCI class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/QUBT Atkore Inc. (NYSE: ATKR) Class Period: August 2, 2022 - February 3, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 23, 2025 The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants failed to disclose that: (1) Atkore engaged in an anticompetitive price-fixing scheme that artificially inflated the price of PVC Pipes; (2) Atkore reaped significant, unsustainable financial benefits from its anticompetitive conduct; (3) as Atkore's price-fixing scheme was exposed, the Company and its price-fixing co-conspirators were no longer able to artificially inflate the price of PVC Pipes, resulting in a substantial decrease in the price of PVC Pipes; (4) Atkore's business and operations were negatively impacted; and (5) as a result, Defendants' positive statements Company's business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. For more information on the Atkore class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ATKR Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) Class Period: July 30, 2024 - February 5, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Skyworks’ expected revenue for the fiscal year 2025. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Skyworks’ ability to expand its mobile business and capitalize on its growth potential by investing in new technologies to diversify its portfolio of offerings. On February 5, 2025, after market close, Skyworks announced its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 and provided lower-than anticipated revenue guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed its results and low guidance to a “competitive landscape” that had “intensified” in recent years. Following this news, the price of Skyworks’ common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $87.08 per share on February 5, 2025, Skyworks’ stock price fell to $65.60 per share on February 6, 2025, a decline of over 24% in the span of just a single day. For more information on the Skyworks class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/SWKS Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ: RKLB) Class Period: November 12, 2024 - February 25, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 28, 2025 On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

(NASDAQ: MRVI), e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE: ELF), and Manhattan Associates, Inc. (NASDAQ:MANH). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP) Class Period: May 10, 2023 - February 25, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 The AppLovin class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period created the false impression that AppLovin’s enhanced AXON 2.0 digital ad platform, in addition to its “cutting-edge AI technologies,” would more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. In truth, AppLovin was exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms and using manipulative practices that forced unwanted apps on customers via a “backdoor installation scheme” which inaccurately inflated installation numbers, and, in turn, its profit figures, the complaint alleges. The AppLovin class action lawsuit further alleges that on February 26, 2025, analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures, the complaint alleges. On this news, the price of AppLovin shares fell by more than 12%, the AppLovin class action lawsuit alleges. For more information on the AppLovin class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/APP Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: MRVI) Class Period: August 7, 2024 - February 24, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 On February 25, 2025, before the market opened, Maravai announced it was postponing its fiscal 2024 earnings release and would delay filing its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024. The Company had identified an error in revenue recognition that “resulted in approximately $3.9 million in revenue being recorded in the final week of the second quarter of 2024 upon shipment when it should have been recorded in the first week of the third quarter of 2024 upon receipt by the customer.” The Company had identified “a material weakness in its internal controls over revenue recognition.” Maravai also required additional time to “complete its assessment of a potential non-cash impairment charge related to goodwill associated with its previous acquisition of Alphazyme LLC.” On this news, the Company’s share price fell $0.87, or 21.70%, to close at $3.14 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Maravai lacked adequate internal controls over financial reporting related to revenue recognition; (2) as a result, the Company inaccurately recognized revenue on certain transactions during fiscal 2024; (3) its goodwill was overstated; and (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. For more information on the Maravai class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/MRVI e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE: ELF) Class Period: November 1, 2023 - November 19, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. To maintain investor confidence, e.l.f. Beauty inflated revenue and other financial measures over multiple quarters. The Company suffered from rising inventory levels. The Company falsely attributed its rising inventory to changes in sourcing. Based on these facts, the Company’s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period. When the market learned the truth about e.l.f. Beauty, investors suffered damages. For more information on the e.l.f. Beauty class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ELF Manhattan Associates, Inc. (NASDAQ:MANH) Class Period: October 22, 2024 - January 28, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 28, 2025 The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants provided investors with material information concerning Manhattan Associates' expected revenue for the fiscal year 2025. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that Defendants' statements included, among other things, confidence in the Company's ability to forecast guidance despite macroeconomic fluctuations, the growth potential of their professional services offerings, and the ability for their cloud revenue to drive revenue for its professional services. On January 28, 2025, Manhattan Associates issued a press release reporting its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2024. Among other items, the Company disclosed services revenue of $119.5 million for the quarter, growing by only 0.3% compared to the year-ago quarter and falling approximately $2 million short of the guidance provided in October 2024. Manhattan Associates attributed the results to delays in professional services work and deferred deals, predicting that the Company's services revenue would reach a low point in the first quarter of 2025 and that solid revenue growth would not resume until mid-year. Manhattan Associates further revealed emerging challenges in its services business, noting that around 10% of customers with ongoing implementations had scaled back their planned services work for the upcoming calendar and fiscal year. The Company also announced that its 2025 revenues would see modest growth of just 2% to 3%, while GAAP EPS was expected to decline by 10% to 13%. On this news, Manhattan Associates' stock price fell $72.26 per share, or 24.49%, to close at $222.84 per share on January 29, 2025. Then, on February 10, 2025, Manhattan Associates announced that Eddie Capel, Manhattan's President and Chief Executive Officer, would retire from those positions effective February 12, 2025. On this news, Manhattan Associates' stock price fell $23.20 per share, or 11.55%, to close at $177.70 per share on February 10, 2025.

Title: Bitcoin Slips With XRP, ADA as Nvidia's Massive $5.5B Charge Sours Investor Sentiment

The mood in the equity and crypto market turned sour late Tuesday as Nvidia shares crashed in after-hours trading following a $5.5 billion charge tied to the Trump administration's decision to ban the company's H20 chip sales to China. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, fell to $83,600, extending the retreat from the two-week high of $86,440 reached earlier in the day, CoinDesk data showed. Payments-focused XRP followed a similar trajectory, falling over 2% to $2.08, while Cardano's ADA token slipped 4% to $0.61. The CoinDesk 20 Index, a broader market gauge, weakened over 2%. Meanwhile, coins supposedly associated with artificial intelligence (AI) continued to fare worse as shares in NVDA tanked 8% to $89.10 after the company disclosed in a regulatory filing that it expects to write down $5.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter due to the new restrictions on exports of its H20 chip to China. The news came a day after unusual activity in NVDA put options pointing to an impending market swoon. The futures tied to the Nasdaq index fell over 1% as well, offering negative cues to risk assets in general. The next catalyst awaiting release Wednesday morning Eastern time is the U.S. retail sales report for March. Per economists polled by Dow Jones, the data is expected to show a 1.2% increase in consumer spending on the month, up from a 0.2% climb in February. A better-than-expected report will likely help assuage recession fears triggered by President Donald Trump's trade war with China and other trading partners. However, there is a risk that markets will dismiss it as backward-looking, failing to account for the major escalation in trade tensions seen this month. Federal Reserve's Chairman Jerome Powell is also scheduled to speak on Wednesday at the Economic Club of Chicago on his outlook for the U.S. economy. "All eyes are on Powell. Markets are holding their breath for Powell on Wednesday. Between the trade war and rising recession chatter, traders are watching for any hint the Fed might be forced to cut sooner than expected," Secure Digital Markets said in Tuesday's research note. The forward-looking market-based measures like the inflation breakevens have dropped amid trade tensions, pointing to the disinflationary impact of Trump's tariffs. That could provide the Fed with a leeway to cut rates. Early this week, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said the bank would be forced to quickly make a series of "bad news" rate cuts if the U.S. president reimposes the levies unveiled on April 2. Trump announced sweeping tariffs on 180 nations on April 2 but quickly suspended the same for most nations, excluding China, for 90 days.

April 15, 2025 20:00 ET | Source: Kirby McInerney LLP Kirby McInerney LLP NEW YORK, April 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The law firm of Kirby McInerney LLP reminds investors of the April 28, 2025, deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action filed on behalf of investors who acquired Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:RKLB) securities during the period November 12, 2024, through February 25, 2025 (“the Class Period”). [LEARN MORE ABOUT THE CLASS ACTION] On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Rocket Lab’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, the price of Rocket Lab shares declined by $2.21 per share, from $22.49 per share on February 24, 2025, to close at $20.28 on February 25, 2025. The complaint alleges that defendants, throughout the Class Period, failed to disclose that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; and (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner.

April 15, 2025 18:33 ET | Source: Interview Kickstart Interview Kickstart Santa Clara, April 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Santa Clara, California - In February 2025, Meta made headlines by increasing its hiring of engineers, with interview requests surging in that period. As Meta and other top-tier tech companies continue to invest in user experiences, front-end engineering has become a critical area of hiring. Engineers who specialize in crafting fast, responsive, and accessible interfaces are more essential than ever. To learn more visit https://interviewkickstart.com/courses/front-end-engineering-interview-masterclass This hiring spike comes at a time when the broader tech industry is recovering and recalibrating after a wave of layoffs in 2023 and 2024. Against this backdrop, Interview Kickstart has updated its Front-End Engineering course for professionals aiming to break into FAANG and other top-tier companies. Designed and taught by current engineers and hiring managers at FAANG+ companies, the course provides a rigorous, structured path to mastering the technical and interview skills that top employers demand. The demand for engineers with front-end expertise is rising steadily, especially for those skilled in modern frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular. According to a 2024 report from the Burning Glass Institute, front-end developer job postings have grown at an average rate of 15% per year since 2020. Companies are prioritizing candidates who not only know JavaScript and CSS inside out but also understand system design, user performance optimization, and cross-platform delivery. Interview Kickstart Front-end Engineering course covers core fundamentals with an emphasis on data structures and algorithms, a must-have for technical interviews at any elite tech company. Over 5 weeks, learners engage in live classes focused on solving algorithmic challenges, understanding time and space complexity, and approaching problems with optimal solutions. This forms the technical backbone required for any engineer, regardless of specialization. Beyond that foundation, the program includes a dedicated three-week system design module. While many front-end engineers often overlook system design, it is increasingly tested in interviews, particularly for mid-level and senior candidates. The course teaches how to design scalable front-end systems, from rendering pipelines to caching strategies and distributed UI components, which are essential for roles at companies like Meta where products operate at a massive scale. The four-week front-end domain segment focuses on the exact tools, frameworks, and architectures used in modern front-end development. Topics include virtual DOM, component-based design, state management with Redux or Context API, performance optimization, testing, and accessibility, which are all covered through real-world case studies and problems modeled after actual interview questions. Classes are structured around open-ended problems and live feedback, helping participants understand not just how to solve a problem, but how to communicate their thought process effectively during an interview. What sets the Interview Kickstart Front-end Engineering course apart is its career-focused layer. Interview Kickstart provides 6 months of post-program support, including mock interviews with experienced engineers from companies like Google and Apple. These interviews are tailored to front-end roles and simulate the pressure and structure of actual technical interviews. Participants receive detailed feedback on both technical and behavioral performance. There are also dedicated sessions for resume building, personal branding, and LinkedIn optimization to ensure candidates stand out to recruiters and hiring managers. The course is built with working professionals in mind. Each week includes asynchronous foundational content, a timed test and review session, and a four-hour live class on Sundays. Between Monday and Wednesday, learners work on practice problems and attend doubt-clearing sessions, with continuous access to instructors for 1:1 coaching. The program recommends 10–12 hours per week for full participation, balancing structure with flexibility. As companies like Meta increase hiring for engineering teams, and as user experience becomes an even bigger differentiator in product strategy, the need for well-prepared, technically sharp front-end engineers is only going to grow. Interview Kickstart's Front-End Engineering Interview Masterclass offers a direct path to capitalize on this demand. By combining top-tier instruction, real-world practice, and structured interview coaching, the program helps engineers not only improve their skills but translate them into high-paying roles at the companies shaping the future of tech.

Share this article 7 Day Free Trial. Cancel Anytime. Blogging helps people express their views, opinions and insights online. Many newcomers aim to start their own site yet hesitate because they fear all the implicit technical barriers or worry about managing costs and expenses. Over time, however, platforms have adapted to match the capabilities and needs of beginners, making it simpler to get started than ever before. The following article reveals each step in setting up a WordPress blog, from picking a theme to using plugins for security and performance. Keep reading to find out how to establish your site in a straightforward manner. Before purchasing a domain or signing up for a host, it helps to think through the subject you plan to cover. A personal website can revolve around travel, cooking, product reviews, music, or any hobby that sparks your curiosity. Sticking with an area of genuine interest encourages consistent writing, which helps an audience grow. Beginners often question how specific their chosen subject should be. If a person launches a site devoted to music, for instance, they could lose track of unique angles or competition from existing publishers. Those who narrow their scope, such as focusing on a single genre or target demographic, often see steadier growth in an audience. The next step is reflecting on a name that is easy to recall, with keywords related to the topic. Reserving an available domain matching that concept means visitors will likely recognize the subject and return. A blog name typically aligns with the domain. If a blogger chooses âHelenâs Pastriesâ as a name, they might select helenspastries.com as the address, presuming it is not taken. People can verify availability on sites that offer domain searches (Dynadot, Namecheap, GoDaddy, Name.com), or hosting providers that suggest similar names. Lengthy domain names with punctuation can be more difficult to remember, so try to keep it short and to the point. After picking a domain, the next step involves selecting a host. Hosts store files, databases, and media for your blog on servers so visitors can access them around the clock. Well-known providers like Hostinger, SiteGround, and Bluehost offer beginner packages. Low-tier shared plans usually offer one-click WordPress installation and a free Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate. That helps maintain smooth loading and safe data exchange. Many packages include a free domain registration for a year, lowering setup costs further. These approximate prices reflect promotional rates, which can shift by season. Each plan typically includes email addresses and 24/7 support. Over time, upgrading to a higher tier might be wise if traffic surges. Those searching for fewer steps may opt for WordPress.com, although that path has constraints on customization and monetization options. A self-hosted approach with WordPress.org is more flexible for design control and performance tweaks. After signing up for a hosting plan, installation rarely takes more than a few minutes due to automated setup tools. You can learn more about good hosting providers at The Blog Starter â How to Start a Blog. Hosts vary slightly, but most present a button or installer labeled âInstall WordPressâ in their dashboards. After clicking, the system installs core files, configuring them behind the scenes. When that completes, you receive login credentials for the admin panel, accessible at yourdomain.com/wp-admin.Â Note: If you ever need to install WordPress manually, itâs known for its â5-minute installation.â This involves downloading WordPress from WordPress.org, uploading the files to your server, and running the setup script. However, beginners rarely need to do this thanks to managed hosting tools. After installation, you can log into your WordPress admin dashboard by visiting yourdomain.com/wp-admin and entering the credentials you set. Newer versions of WordPress may prompt you with a setup or welcome wizard to configure the basics. In the WordPress dashboard, go to Settings â General to set your Site Title and Tagline. The title is your blogâs name (displayed in the browser tab and header), and the tagline is a short phrase that describes your site. For example, Site Title: Travel with Amy, Tagline: Adventures around the world. You can change these anytime. Next, configure SEO-friendly URLs (permalinks) from the start. Navigate to Settings â Permalinks and choose the âPost nameâ option for your URL structure. Using the post name (e.g., yourdomain.com/my-first-post) makes links descriptive and human-readable. This structure is considered the best choice for most sites due to its user-friendliness and SEO benefits Some WordPress dashboards automatically enable an SSL certificate to secure traffic. If not, consult the hosting dashboard or contact support to activate SSL. That changes your address to https:// for added data protection. In addition, remove default content, such as the sample post âHello World,â so you can start fresh. Spend a few minutes exploring the WordPress admin dashboard. Key areas include Posts (for blog posts), Pages, Appearance (themes and customization), Plugins, Settings, and Users. Knowing where things are will make the next steps easier.Â Readers appreciate an orderly, attractive layout that helps them find topics. WordPress relies on themes to control colors, fonts, and structural design. A WordPress theme controls your blogâs design, layout, and style. Upon installation, WordPress activates a default theme (which may look plain). Youâll likely want to switch to a theme that matches your style and niche. In your dashboard, go to Appearance â Themes â Add New. You can browse over 7,000 free themes in the WordPress.org repository by popularity, latest releases, or feature filtersâ . Each theme includes a live preview, giving a sense of how titles, menus, and images appear. Popular ones are: Plenty of other themes exist, yet these remain frequent go-tos because of their consistent updates and user forums. When you find a theme you like, use the Live Preview to see how it would look on your site (with placeholder content). Keep in mind the preview is just an example; youâll customize the details later. Once youâre satisfied, click Install, then Activate to apply the theme to your blogâ. With your theme active, navigate to Appearance â Customize (this opens the WordPress Customizer, or Site Editor for some themes). Here you can adjust key design elements: Logo, Colors, Fonts, Headers, Menus, etc. Some newer themes (called block themes) use Full Site Editing, where you edit the whole layout with blocks. If you chose a block theme, the Customizer might be replaced by a Site Editor (under Appearance â Editor). The idea is similar â you can edit headers, footers, and templates visually. Test your new theme on multiple devices or screen sizes. You can resize your browser or use WordPressâs preview options to see how your site looks on mobile and tablet. Responsive themes should automatically adjust, but always verify that text is readable and images scale properly on smaller screens. Remember, though: Customize gradually! You donât have to perfect your design all at once. Get the basics in place (logo, colors, menu) and launch your site. You can always refine the appearance over time. Many successful blogs start with a simple theme and evolve their design as they grow. WordPress plugins add optional features to expand your siteâs capabilities, from SEO tuning to spam detection. To add a plugin, go to Plugins â Add New in your dashboard. You can search for plugins by name or functionality. Always check the pluginâs reviews, active installations, and last updated date to ensure itâs reputable and compatible with your WordPress version. Install and activate the plugin, then configure its settings (many plugins add a menu item or settings page).Â Tip: Try not to go overboard with pluginsâinstall only what you need. Each plugin can potentially affect site speed or security, so quality is better than quantity. The above four categories (SEO, caching, backup, security) cover the essentials for a solid foundation. Â Some must-have plugins stand out: While each plugin delivers a beneficial function, installing too many at once can slow a site down. Stick to core essentials, then expand carefully. Always check that each plugin remains updated, because older versions sometimes contain flaws. A blog can offer more than routine articles. Readers often look for pages like âAbout,â âContact,â and âPrivacy Policy.â These show who you are, how to reach you, and the ways you handle data. Privacy disclosure can prove beneficial if you collect any user details. Once the basic pages are ready, craft your first post.Â Go to Posts â Add New to open the WordPress post editor. Hereâs how to craft your first post: A short piece might suffice as an opener, but regular writing leads to a more engaging site.Â Many bloggers aim to post at least once per week, although that target can vary by schedule. Readers often appreciate consistency, so if you prefer monthly posts, simply keep to that timeline. WordPress can also schedule upcoming posts automatically, which helps maintain momentum. Search engine optimization affects how people discover your site.Â Remember that SEO is a gradual process. You likely wonât rank on the first page of Google overnight, but by consistently applying these practices, your content can gain visibility. See some of the key SEO tips below. On-Page SEO Best Practices: To attract readers from search engines, optimize your content and site structure: Some consider once the theme is applied and posts are published, the job is complete. Yet regular maintenance aids uptime, security, and performance. WordPress and plugin creators issue updates that remove bugs and vulnerabilities. Check the admin panel weekly for update notices. One of the simplest yet most critical security measures is to keep your WordPress core software, themes, and plugins up to date. Updates often include fixes for security vulnerabilitiesâ. In your dashboard, youâll see update notifications whenever a new version is available. Get in the habit of checking for updates regularly (WordPress can also auto-install minor core updates by default). Enable auto-updates for plugins and themes if your site environment allows it, but be cautious â occasionally an update could introduce a compatibility issue. A good practice is to run backups before applying major updates, so you can roll back if something goes wrong. Remove any plugins or themes you arenât using. Inactive plugins and themes can still pose security risks if left on your server.For instance, if you tried out a plugin but decided not to use it, delete it entirely. Similarly, you might switch themes during setup â feel free to delete old themes except one default theme (WordPress requires at least one theme installed). Having fewer add-ons reduces potential vulnerabilities and also makes your site leaner. (Best practice: remove unused plugins/themes or at least keep them updated if you canât remove them During WordPress installation, you set an admin username and password. Make sure your administrator username is unique (avoid the default âadminâ username, as that is the first guess for hackers)â Even though we set up a backup plugin earlier, itâs worth reiterating: maintain regular backups as part of your maintenance routine. Backups not only help with security incidents (like restoring after a hack) but also with any site crash or accidental content deletion. Test restoring a backup at least once (perhaps on a staging site or locally) so you know the process works. Many backup plugins can be set to automatically delete old backups to save space; configure those limits according to your storage capacity. If you enabled comments on your blog posts, check the Comments section in the dashboard periodically. Mark spam comments as spam (your Akismet plugin will catch most). Approve legitimate comments and reply to them to build community. Also, promptly delete any toxic or inappropriate comments to keep your site welcoming. Adjust discussion settings to your comfort â for example, you might require that a comment author has a previously approved comment or that all comments await moderation, which can control spam and troll comments. Part of maintenance is also reviewing your content occasionally. As your blog grows, update older posts if information changes or if you can improve them (this helps SEO and keeps content fresh). Check for broken links with a plugin or online tool (broken external links can frustrate readers and hurt SEO slightly; update or remove any broken links you find). Readers who sense sincerity and accuracy often return. That means double-checking facts, linking to reliable references, and disclaiming if a statement reflects personal experience. Inserting quotes from experts or sources can anchor your words in real-world context. People also appreciate a blog design free from pop-ups or intrusive ads. While ads can generate revenue, excessive promotion early on might frustrate newcomers. Prioritize a stable reading experience so that your site remains inviting. Selecting high-quality images can support your discussions. For instance, a food blog with crisp, properly lit images of completed dishes may gain fans faster. Similarly, a travel blog might feature original photos from trips. Avoid using copyrighted images without permission. Stock photo websites grant licenses for general purposes, so check usage terms before uploading. Over time, blog owners can encourage comments by replying promptly. Readers interested in a topic sometimes have questions, so providing answers fosters engagement. Those interactions can shape future posts or spark ideas for expansions. It also helps to incorporate a contact page or form so that visitors can reach out privately. Sometimes, they want to suggest improvements or ask about collaborations. If you plan on affiliate partnerships or sponsored articles, follow transparent guidelines by disclaiming any benefit. This practice instills trust. Maintaining social presence can further expand a blog. Each new entry can be shared on platforms like Twitter or Instagram. Many readers discover posts through these channels rather than direct searches, so a consistent effort helps you remain visible. Keeping the site up to date means ensuring the theme and plugins stay current. Changes in web standards affect WordPress over time, prompting new features or best practices. If your theme is no longer supported by its developers, or if a plugin remains unmaintained, it might be time to switch. Readers hoping to start a WordPress site can adopt this method for a thorough, well-structured online presence. They begin by settling on a topic and searching for a domain that matches their theme. Selecting a reliable host secures a stable foundation, with automated WordPress installation removing the bulk of the technical load. Next, they pick a theme that looks appealing across various devices. Adding a few essential plugins ensures protection, provides caching benefits, and helps with website optimization. When creating pages, offering an âAboutâ section promotes an authentic connection with visitors, while a âContactâ page enables constructive interaction. That steady building process continues after the first posts go live. Bloggers can keep refining their craft, analyzing traffic data, and seeking feedback to shape subsequent material. Any site worth visiting includes elements like trust, strong style, and clear intent. Posting valuable content on a consistent basis fosters loyal readers. The steps listed here form a reliable approach for beginners who crave a quick start. By investing time in meaningful posts and practicing safe maintenance routines, owners often develop a unique platform that resonates with individuals worldwide.

Title: Internet Governance - The End of Multi-Stakeholderism?

Internet Governance - The End of Multi-Stakeholderism? April 2025 When the Internet outgrew its academic and research roots and gained some prominence and momentum in the broader telecommunications environment its proponents found themselves to be in opposition to many of the established practices of the international telecommunications arrangements and even in opposition to the principles that lie behind these arrangements. For many years, governments were being lectured that the Internet was special, and to apply the same mechanisms of national telecommunications and trade regulations to the Internet might not wreck the entire Internet, but they would surely isolate the nation that was attempting to apply these measures. Within this broad category was the notion that conventional means of conducting trade in services was not applicable to the Internet. While an early mantra of âThe Internet must be free!â quickly foundered when it encountered pragmatic realities of trying to pay the bills, the next mantra of "Don't tax the Internet!" gathered significant momentum. What was meant here was an admonition to governments not to attempt to unduly constrain the flow of data with taxes and related imposts, as such actions applied in a careless manner was likely imperil the future value of the Internet. This was a unique opportunity to take the role of public communications away from the sclerotic and bloated telephone monopolies and apply some of the vibrant innovative energy that was driving the computer industry into the communications realm. But while the Internet might have had some claim to exceptionalism in the 1990s, such a characterisation was unsustainable in the longer term. It was clear by the time of the millennium that the previous regime of national telephone operators and the treaties that governed the international aspects of this global service had been sidelined. The Internet was sweeping all before it and each time it engaged with another sector it appeared to emerge from the encounter as a clear victor. The Internet might still be exceptional, but by the millennium it was recognised that it was not always exceptional in a good way. In 2003 and 2005 the United Nations hosted the two-part World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) to try and come to terms with these changes, and ideally to try to ensure that all economies would benefit from this revolution in computing and communications. This WSIS summit was in the context of the emergence of the so-called information society and a recognition of a widening digital divide where richer nations were in an obvious position to exploit the possibilities that opened up with the combination of abundant computation and communications services and thereby amass further wealth, while poorer nations yet again found themselves on the other side of the divide. Far from being a tool to help equalise the inequities in our world by allowing all to access information, education and open global markets for their services, the Internet appeared to be yet another tool to further entrench this divide between rich and poor. The United States was a focal point in these discussions. At the time the Internet was still strongly associated with the United States, and the US had spent much of the previous decade both promoting its benefits and profiting from the revenues flowing into US companies that were early adopters of Internet-based services. This promotion of the Internet and the free flow of information was certainly not without elements of self-interest on the part of the US, as it appeared that the interests of the newly emerging corporate behemoths of the Internet and the geo-political and geo-economic aspirations of the US appeared to have much in common. However, it's often difficult to tackle the larger picture in these large-scale international forums, so it was no surprise to see attention turn to the individual elements that were contained within this picture. One of these elements that became a topic of discussion in its own right was the status of the body that oversaw the Internet's protocol parameters, including the names and IP addresses, that are used as part of the central core of the Internet. This function, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) was originally part of the US Defence Advanced Research Project Agency's funded activities. After a few more changes within the US Government agency landscape responsibility for this function was shifted to a self-funded mode operated by a private sector entity, ICANN, with some level of US engagement remaining in place. This was variously portrayed as a control or as a safeguarding measure. Irrespective of the nature of the motivation, the result was that the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, part of the US Department of Commerce, oversaw a contract between the US government and ICANN regarding the operation of the IANA function. Perceptions matter, and the lingering perception here was that the Internet was still seen to be essentially under the control of a single sovereign state, the United States. This unique US role was always going to be a problem for other nations. The international telephone and postal networks were governed by international treaty instruments that had been in place for more than a century. To have a single nation state positioned at the apex of this Internet structure was, to say the least, controversial. Naturally this was a major topic in 2003 at the first WSIS gathering. The UN Secretary General at the time, Kofi Annan, convened a Working Group on Internet Governance (WGIG), a grand title which either conflated this topic to an even greater level of prominence or appropriately stated its central importance to the entire set of concerns with the structure of the Internet at the time. Again, opinions vary here. There was no clear consensus coming out of this WGIG activity, and the 2005 WSIS gathering could not reach any form of agreement on this matter. During the WSIS process the US apparently refused to consider any changes to its pivotal role in the management of the Internet's protocol parameters. The WSIS summit eventually agreed on a compromise approach that deferred any determination on this matter and instead decided to convene a series of meetings that would discuss on the underlying policy principles relating to Internet Governance. We saw the inauguration of a series of Internet Governance Forum (IGF) meetings. These forums were intended to be non-decisional forums for all stakeholders to debate the issues. Originally intended to be convened for a period of five years, culminating in the fifth IGF meeting in Vilnius, Lithuania in 2010, it has continued with a further five-year extension of its mandate, and then a ten-year extension, culminating with the forthcoming IGF meeting in Norway at the end of June 2025. Even within its limited objectives of being a forum for little other than talk the IGF would find it challenging to claim universal success in achieving its mission. The IGF did not manage to address the underlying tensions relating to the pivotal position of the US in the Internet. In 2011 we saw the IBSA proposal (called IBSA because of a summit convened by India, Brazil and South Africa) for a UN committee in Internet Related Policy. In 2013, as a reaction to the US surveillance stories being publicly aired on Wikileaks, a number of internet organisations, including ICANN, the RIRs and the IETF released the "Montevideo Statement" calling on the US to step back from its central role. The US surveillance disclosures also appeared to be a major factor in Brazil's sponsorship of the 2014 netMundial initiatives, which also appeared to have the support of ICANN. Once more the call was for the cessation of the US control over the Internet's protocol parameter function. At much the same time Edward Snowden released a set of material that documented how US agencies were undertaking of widespread surveillance using the Internet. These Wikileaks and Snowden disclosures weakened US resolve, and in October 2016 the previously unthinkable happened. The US government signed away its functional role and passed control of the protocol parameter function to an independent ICANN. If the IGF was the forum to discuss the public policy issues related to the privileged position of the US Government with respect to the Internet, then the principle rational for the IGF also finished in October 2016. In theory at any rate the US no longer claimed the ability to place its finger on the scale with respect to the carriage of these matters. On the other hand, this is perhaps a far too narrow a definition of the role and scope of the IGF. The IGF process has managed to gather a more sophisticated shared understanding of the layers within the Internet and the ways in which these various components both share common objectives and create tensions when competing to achieve similar objectives. The elements of carriage networks, consumer devices, servers and service delivery networks, applications, and application behaviours all operate in a semi-autonomous manner. The previous model of the locus of control of an entire service environment sitting within the telephone company within each nation state was not repeated with the Internet. The Internet has exposed each of the various component service activities as discrete activities, and instead of orchestrating these components within the framework of the procurement processes of the larger service entity, a variety of new markets have been exposed: technology standards, fibre and mobile services, computers in all forms from handsets to servers, applications, service providers and content publishers all operate semi-autonomously, and the orchestration of their actions is through markets and market interactions. The Internet is not operated by a single service delivery company, nor is it a defined destination. It is a series of inter-twined markets. The implication for governance processes was profound, and the IGF has managed to both expose this change and steer a constructive path of commentary and dialogue on these changes as they have happened. I'd like to nominate three major themes of national and international interest in today's Internet that have some relevance to the topic of Internet governance. The first is the issues that can still be summarised as the digital divide. There are still the haves and have nots across the full spectrum of our world. The digital divide is as big as it ever was and there is no visible movement in directions that might be able to ameliorate the societal impacts of these changes. If anything, this divide has further broadened in scope. In absolute terms it may be the case that more individuals have some form of internet access than was thought could possibly be achieved even 10 years ago. But today that's still only one half of the world's population, and the other four billion people are isolated from the mainsteam. The divide also operates across other dimensions, including the cost of access, the quality and speed of access, the accessibility of information, the extent to which goods, services and information are accessible using a local language. They all form subtle aspects and not so subtle aspects of digital exclusion. But when we talk of a digital divide we can broaden our view and look at the position of the world's most valuable digital enterprises, namely Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet and Meta, which have a market capitalisation of some 12 trillion USD (just before the recent Trump-induced stock meltdown). The aggregate position of these six enterprises is so large and so powerful that everybody else, individuals, corporates and most governments, find themselves on the impotent side of this digital divide. The second theme is also not a new theme, but it has dramatically increased in importance in the past two decades. Its components have various labels, including Cyber Security, Malware, Abuse, Spam and Viruses. It can be summarised in the observation that today's Internet is a toxic place that not only provides haven for various criminal and fraudulent activities but also provides haven for darker actions encompassing the current set of concerns relating to terrorism and cyber-offensive tactics from state-based actors. The uncomfortable observation is that technology-based counter-measures may be failing us and the fabric of our society seems to be very vulnerable to concerted hostile cyber-attack. We've adopted strong encryption in many parts of the environment as a means of protecting users against various forms of organised surveillance, but in so doing we've turned off the lighting that would otherwise expose various acts of malfeasance to our law enforcement bodies. We have had to make some tough decisions about balancing personal privacy and open attribution. But this lack of clear attribution and greater ability to embed communications behind strong encryption means that various forms of policing this digital world have become expensive, frustrating and ultimately very selective in its application. There is also the observation that these digital megaliths have made vast profits from their dominant position, while at the same time they have managed to transfer the costs of large-scale deployment of poor quality software and tools back on the public sector. The third theme lies within the changes occurring within the Internet itself. In recent years we've seen the proliferation of content distribution networks that attempt to position all of the data and services that any user would request as close as possible to the user. It used to be the role of the network to bring the user to the content portal, whereas these days we are seeing content shifting itself ever closer to the user. In and of itself that's a relatively significant change to the Internet. The public carriage component of the Internet is shrinking and being replaced by private feeder networks that service these rapidly expanding Content Distribution Networks (CDNs). The bigger question concerns the residual need for global names and addresses in this CDN-centric environment. The Internet is no longer a telecommunications network that carriers user traffic across a common network. Today's Internet is a content distribution network that is very similar to a television broadcast network where the transmission component is limited to the last mile access network. The essential difference here is that on the Internet each user can define their own program. One possible response to these concerns is the perception that these situations are instances of collective failure of the Internet Governance framework. Allowing the private sector unfettered control of the public communications space has produced very mixed results. Yes, the obsessive concern with catering precisely to what users want has produced a remarkably efficient and capable supply chain that can bring the economies of massive scale to market of a single unit, and this is a modern-day marvel. But at the same time the private sector is largely uninterested in the general health and welfare of the larger environment and the internet appears to be the victim of such collective neglect. The public sector's forbearance with the cavalier attitude shown by various Internet players may be reaching a breaking point. The EU initiative with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a clear signal that the honeymoon with technology is over and various national regimes clearly want to see a more responsible and responsive attitude from these players to public concerns. Doubtless we will continue to see fines being set at levels intended to be eye-watering for even the largest of players. While this measure has the unintended side-effect of eliminating the smaller players from the market and potentially stifling competition, a major public sector goal is to bring some sense of broader social responsibility back to the major players. This regulatory stance will no doubt continue in both the EU and in many other regimes. But is this increased national engagement a failure of the Internet Governance framework or a failure of a more conventional role of public sector regulation of a market? Private corporate entities have a primary duty to their shareholders, and do not necessarily have the same over-arching obligation to the public good. If self-interest and public interest coincide, then that is a wonderful coincidence of fortune, but when they differ, corporate self-interest necessarily wins. It is naive to expect that any messages of constraint and prudence to the private sector would be heeded unless it has the authority of regulatory impost with some form of punitive enforcement measure. If governments are feeling emboldened to enact regulatory measures for an industry that until now enjoyed some level of immunity from conventional social responsibilities, then how do these same governments feel about the actors that look after the elements of Internet infrastructure? The recent erratic moves by the US President to initiate a trade war on a global scale will have far-reaching implications far beyond stock markets and will inevitably include the digital world and what we refer to as Internet Governance. The US moves on the unilateral imposition of tariffs can be interpreted as a vote of no confidence in global trade and open markets by the US, and a resurgence of a theme of strategic national self-reliance in all areas of economic activity, including the digital realm. The question of course is how will others react? This week I saw a notice from a DNS hosting provider relating to hosting Russian domain names: "We are contacting you about a recent communication from the Russian Federal Service for Supervision in Communications and Information Technologies and Mass Media (Roskomnadzor). This relates to the potential future restrictions on foreign hosting providers and the need for domain administrators who use foreign DNS infrastructure to transition to Russian hosting providers listed in the official register." There is a visible concern in many national regimes that large amounts of their digital infrastructure are being operated by foreign enterprises, and by "foreign" it is more often than not simply "US". Today's deregulated digital communications environment is held together by commercial contracts and the extent to which such arrangements can be torn asunder by seemingly erratic US presidential edicts no doubt causes many to lose sleep! In a bad case scenario, can these US entities be coopted to hold a country's digital infrastructure hostage as part of the âartâ of a national trade deal? In the extreme worst-case scenario, can these entities be forced to operate in an overtly hostile and disruptive manner in terms of services provided to foreign entities? What happens in a modern national digital economy when its infrastructure underpinnings are deliberately sabotaged by such entities acting under duress from some form of executive order? The order in which we operate the Internet today is held apart from the conventional treaty body for communications (the International Telecommunications Union, or ITU) because the US administration in the late 1990's under President Clinton led a coalition of friendly economies notably Australia, Canada, Japan, and the EU in supporting the move to recognise a private institution to perform the allocation and administration functions for internet infrastructure elements (notably names and addresses) based on what we came to call "multi-stakeholderism. The US recognition of this form of industry self-regulatory governance was more like an insubstantive veneer for many years, as the US administration (in the guise of the NTIA within the Department of Commerce) performed an oversight role of the root zone of the DNS in the background. However, as we've already noted, the US administration backed out of this oversight role around a decade ago and has largely disengaged, being unwilling to continue to pay the diplomatic price of being the backstop in holding this coalition together in the face of large-scale devaluation of US international diplomatic capital by the Wiki Leaks and Snowden incidents. You could argue that by 2020 the job was done in any case. The "value" of the Internet was tightly held by a small elite of truly massive US enterprises and any role of the US administration to support these enterprises in the international realm was no longer necessary. Other countries have been willing to go along with these arrangements for a variety of reasons - there was the ill-defined promise of digital prosperity and other national communities could benefit from this shift to digital infrastructure as well. But the distribution of wealth and social power in this "new" world is vastly different from the old industrial world. Having valuable digital enterprises domiciled in a nation does not translate to widespread economic prosperity. The digital enterprise does not rely on large workforces, and the immense concentration of wealth often results in inventive efforts to avoid conventional forms of corporate taxation by the state. The issue is that the distribution of this digital wealth is very uneven and while a small clique of individuals may live in an extreme level of opulence, large proportions of domestic populations are disenfranchised and marginalised. Not unsurprisingly, we are now seeing a response to this situation, in the form of a wave of populism gain social power in many national communities: Not just in the US, but in Germany, France, Hungary, the UK and other western economies. Such populism is based in part on restoring an old-world order that "protects" national economies and eschews many forms of globalism. At the moment this is being expressed in various ways in a visible shift to national compartmentalism, not only in limiting the cross-border flow of physical goods through the imposition of punitive tariffs, but in the efforts to contain digital assets and infrastructure roles to national entities, domiciled within national boundaries. Obviously, this is not looking good for the Internet. It is increasingly likely that we will return to an order where international dealings are strictly defined through the use of a myriad of regulations overseen by treaty-based organisations. It's extremely challenging to espouse the benefits of an open multi-stakeholder global communications environment when the dream has been so basely corrupted by the exploitative excesses of the small clique of digital megaliths. The year 2025 is particularly challenging when WSIS+20 is reopening the basic debate about the merits of multi-stakeholderism. âNational Internet Sovreignityâ is a powerful meme these days and multi-lateralism, as compared to multi-stakeholderism, has a seductive appearance of addressing demands for greater levels of national autonomy, particularly in communities where populism is a dominant social force. This debate is taking part in an environment when the change in the stance of the US administration has effectively torn up all the old order. It is unclear as to how (or even whether) the US will continue to expend effort to support multi-stakeholderism, and the erratic record of the US on the recent topic of tariffs lends further credence to the stance that the US in no longer a widely trusted and stable advocate of the benefits of multi-stakeholderism in the international realm. In mid-2024 we saw efforts by others national entities (AUDA for .au, CIRA for .ca, InternetNZ for .nz, and Nominet for .uk) to create a coalition to speak up for mult-stakeholderism (A Technical Community Coalition for Multistakeholderism (TCCM) is evidence of others attempting to fill this clear gap. Notable is the absence of the US. I wish this group well, but it is extremely challenging to make the case that today's international climate is in their favour. Given the huge issues in cyber-vulnerabilities, the entrenched position of US megalithic digital corporates, and the extremely erratic position of the US administration at present, the case that the ideals of the Internet that were espoused in WSIS some 20 years ago, and the promises of multi-stakeholderism in the development of digital economies where everyone benefits are still realistic prospects today is extremely hard to make. Itâs far easier to observe that we gave it a try and Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta should be grateful to us for enabling their rapid rise to global dominance. I can't help but feel very pessimistic about the coming years. The attempt to coopt private enterprises to work in a manner that safeguards the public interest in our common public telecommunications realm has failed, again. It reminds me of Theodore Vail's efforts in the early 20th century to do a deal with the US Congress to bestow on AT&T a monopoly in national telephone services in exchange for an undertaking that the company would act with restraint as an enlightened private sector entity that would act in the national public interest. As it turned out AT&T could not resist itself from exploiting its monopoly position for any more than a decade! It looks like national pressures are calling an end to multi-stakeholderism in Internet Governance, hastened by a tectonic shift in the position of the US in international circles. The most likely direction we will now pursue in Internet Governance is a shift to multi-laterism and an increased role for the United Nations and the World Trade Organisation for the middle-ranked nation states, accompanied by a tumultuous period of US unilaterism. Is this all due to the outcome of the 2024 US Presidential election? If there had been different candidates and a different election outcome, would the position we find ourselves be in today be materially different? It seems to me that there are much larger social forces at play that transcend individuals and their actions, however erratic they may be! We are embarking on changes in our society which are as dramatic and even as traumatic as the industrial revolution of the nineteenth century. Such revolutions leave a trail of social dislocation and uncertainty in their wake, and this information revolution is no exception. It is perhaps unsurprising that nation states tend to be more assertive in such situations as they try and mitigate some of the worst excesses of such social disruptions. One side-effect of this increasing nationalistic stance is that various international institutions, both regional and global, tend to be regarded with increasing levels of distrust from these national regimes and from populist national fora. In times of uncertainty and stress nations naturally try to raise the drawbridge and attempt to insulate themselves from such disruptions by asserting greater levels of control within their own national realm. The root cause of all social dislocation is attributed to the actions of foreign bodies and they claim that greater levels of national determinism will restore some aspect of a myth of prior national greatness and prosperity. The industrial revolution was certainly triggered by the refinement of the steam engine, but the social revolution was far larger in scope than the invention of a simple mechanical device. In a similar line of thought, maybe it's not the Internet or its governance that lies at the heart of many of today's issues. Maybe it's the broader issues of our enthusiastic adoption of computing and communications that has formed a propulsive force for widespread social dislocation in today's world.

Major U.S. equities declined slightly Tuesday, a reprieve from the trade-related volatility that has driven significant swings in stocks in recent weeks. Market indexes ticked lower following rallies in the previous two sessions and despite strong earnings reports from some of the nation's largest banks. The S&P 500 slipped 0.2%, while the Dow lost 0.4%. The Nasdaq ended Tuesday's session with a minor loss of less than 0.1% Palantir Technologies (PLTR) shares surged for the second straight session, adding 6.2% on Tuesday to notch the S&P 500's top daily performance. The push higher for Palantir stock followed reports that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) acquired an artificial intelligence (AI) military solution developed by the big data analytic software firm. Shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) gained 5.1% after Bloomberg reported that activist investor Elliott Investment Management has accumulated a position worth more than $1.5 billion in the IT services provider. People familiar with the matter told Investopedia that Elliott intends to engage with HPE's leadership on potential steps to boost the tech company's value. According to The Wall Street Journal, Netflix (NFLX) executives outlined a set of optimistic objectives at a business review meeting in March. The targets include doubling the company's revenue by 2030 and achieving a $1 trillion market capitalization. Netflix shares jumped 4.8% ahead of the streaming giant's quarterly earnings report, which is set to be released Thursday afternoon. Shares of Albemarle (ALB), the world's largest lithium producer, dropped 5.9%, falling the most of any S&P 500 constituent. The move lower came after several research firms reduced their price targets on the stock. Analysts pointed to numerous factors behind more muted forecasts for Albemarle, including the potential for trade tensions to weigh on global sales in the automotive sector, which could result in sustained pressure on prices for battery components. Bank of America expressed a cautious view of the chemical sector, pointing to softness in cyclical demand and headwinds related to global trade. Analysts indicated that these factors are contributing to lower levels of confidence around upcoming earnings estimates. BofA downgraded Dow (DOW) stock to "underperform" from "buy," and shares of the chemicals giant lost 4.0% following the double downgrade. Shares of Molina Healthcare (MOH) sank 3.8% after Baird analysts downgraded the stock to "neutral" from "outperform." According to the analyst team, companies in the managed care and health care facilities industries could be unlikely to increase their guidance in the near term given policy uncertainties related to Medicare Part D programs.

Title: Not invincible: Tech burned by tariff war

SUBSCRIBE & SAVE Less than $3 per week Tariffs on Asian countries are shaking up Silicon Valley, driving up prices and deepening global tensions Big Tech is a big loser in a global trade war, said Julia Shapero in The Hill. Last week's stock market rout was especially hard on companies like Apple, Dell, and HP that "depend extensively on manufacturing and supply chains that run through China and Taiwan." Apple certainly knew it wasn't going to dodge any trade war unscathed, "given that most of its products are produced in China." But even efforts to diversify away from China in recent years didn't save it after steep tariffs were also placed Vietnam (46 percent) and India (26 percent). It will be difficult for Apple and other companies not to pass the costs on to consumers. Wall Street analysts, for instance, have calculated that all the tariffs planned for computer equipment will raise the $799 price of the cheapest iPhone 16 model to over $1,140. Tech companies that hardly import anything are also getting battered, said Mike Isaac in The New York Times. Tech giants like Meta and Google that rely on digital advertising collect billions from "small and medium-size businesses" from around the world that are likely to "spend less on advertising" in the United States. Meta is particularly vulnerable. Roughly "10 percent of its revenue in 2023 was from Chinese companies spending heavily on advertising." Temu and Shein, Chinese e-commerce platforms, are expected to practically disappear after Trump closed the trade loophole that allowed them to sell cheap products in the U.S. Tariffs will even "boost costs for businesses building the infrastructure to deliver artificial intelligence," said Isabelle Bousquette in The Wall Street Journal. Trump exempted semiconductors from tariffs for now. But everything from the price of steel used to build data centers to the wiring inside of them is under the threat of taxation. Tech lobbyists are still hoping that tariffs bring Europe to the negotiating table, said Brendan Bordelon and Gabby Miller in Politico. Silicon Valley has for years "been complaining about foreign regulations on their platforms—taxes, fines, and restrictions that the U.S. doesn't impose." One of their biggest hopes was that Trump's tariffs would finally make European countries back down. They still might. But for now, the EU is suggesting it may "double down," hitting U.S. tech companies even harder in a counterstrike that can easily snowball into a tech cold war. Escape your echo chamber.

Title: Dollar-Cost Averaging Versus Lump Sum Investing
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/kristinmckenna/2025/04/15/dollar-cost-averaging-versus-lump-sum-investing/
Time Published: 2025-04-15T19:06:00Z

ByKristin McKenna ByKristin McKenna, Senior Contributor. If you have a large amount of excess cash to invest, consider dollar-cost averaging as it helps ... More investors stay invested and avoid the temptation to try to time the market. If you have a large amount of excess cash to invest, you may wonder if it’s better to invest over time by dollar-cost averaging or put a lump sum into the market at once. Whether you have extra cash sitting on the sidelines or are second-guessing your investment strategy, it’s easy to let hindsight bias or a fear of losing money impact your decisions. Especially during periods of heightened uncertainty, dollar-cost averaging a large sum can be an effective way to reduce risk and avoid temptation to try and time the market or predict short term volatility. Dollar-cost averaging is an investment strategy that invests a set amount of money over a period of time as illustrated by the example below. If markets decline, investors can buy more shares with the same investment amount, and thus benefit more from an eventual recovery. Of course, in rising markets, the opposite is true. How dollar-cost averaging can help investors during volatile markets. By making a continuous investment at predetermined intervals, perhaps the first trading day of the month, it takes the decision making out of it and helps minimize volatility as contributions are spread over time. As market conditions change, for better or worse, you'll continue investing. The example below compares two scenarios: a lump sum investment of $120,000 in January 2020 compared to a dollar-cost average strategy with $10,000 invested each month from January through December 2020. Both scenarios assume all funds are invested in the S&P 500 (SPY). Since 2020 was one of the most volatile years in the history of the financial markets, it's a good example. Comparing a hypothetical lump sum investment of $120,000 in the S&P 500 on January 2020 vs a ... More dollar-cost averaging strategy (investing $10,000/month from January to December 2020). End of year values reflected in dollar terms. As you can see, by the end of the year, the dollar-cost averaging strategy marginally outperforms investing a lump sum immediately. Over time, since historically markets have been positive in magnitude and frequency more often than negative, we would expect lump sum investing to outperform. Despite a long-term view that shows growth potential over a typical investment horizon, it's so important not to discount the impact of investor psychology during downturns. Using the example above, by March 23rd 2020 (the bottom for the calendar year), the lump sum investor's portfolio would be worth less than $84,000, marking an unrealized loss of about $36,000 from their initial investment. In contrast, the dollar-cost averaging investor's account would be just shy of $22,000, for an unrealized loss of roughly $8,000. Here, the lump sum investor may be more prone to panic selling during declining markets and going back to cash. If they did, and if the other account continued putting money in the market at regular intervals, the gap at the end of the year would be significant. Investing over time can be particularly impactful for individuals experiencing a one-time sudden wealth or liquidity event. Of course, in practice, investors will want to match their risk tolerance with a diversified portfolio. The reality is that many investors don’t like to invest more when the market is down. The stock market is the only place where people run from a sale. In hindsight, after the market has recovered, investors often regret not taking advantage of what they now know to be a great buying opportunity. Dollar-cost averaging helps investors avoid the temptation to try to time the market or worse: abandon their investment plan altogether if facing significant losses. It can also help smooth the impact of price volatility and potentially lead to more favorable average prices. When it comes to dollar-cost averaging vs lump sum investing, the best approach may ultimately be a personal decision. Due to transaction costs and the cash drag on a portfolio, in situations where there's a smaller investment amount, it might be more advantageous to go with a lump sum approach. Also consider your target asset allocation and share prices compared to your excess cash. The stock market is no place to invest for quick returns. While dollar-cost averaging can help reduce the short-term impact of market fluctuations, avoiding volatility in the financial markets is unrealistic. Instead, investors should stay focused on long-term wealth building strategies and making sure their asset allocation is right given their life stage and risk tolerance. Time in the market is better than timing the market over the long term, and history shows that the longer you stay invested in the stock market, the better your chances of making money. So why not put a large sum to work at once? Investors often downplay the behavioral aspects of investing until faced with a big decision that carries risk. So when the thought of putting all your money in the market at once seems too stressful—don’t! Dollar-cost averaging can help individuals sleep at night. After all, hoarding cash isn’t an investment strategy. Disclosures Kristin McKenna is a Forbes contributor.

Since the second Trump administration announced sweeping global tariffs on April 2, 2025, it has been a dizzying process trying to track what duties are actually active and on what nations, goods and resources. What is clear, according to numerous experts we consulted, is that the prices Americans will soon be paying on all sorts of products—from sofas to washing machines—are going to rise; that’s because tariffs, often positioned as taxes levied on foreign countries and companies, are, in fact, paid by American businesses importing the goods, with some level of elevated consumer prices following on. Prices are going to rise on products ranging from washing machines to bath towels to chocolate bars. ... More We spoke to the experts to find out what to expect and when. To better understand what the effects of these policies will be and how our readers’ lives may change, we spoke with multiple economists and finance researchers to find out what developments we can expect to see across the many products we test and recommend at Forbes Vetted. These experts also shared their advice on how to think about consumer purchasing in the short term, and gave guidance on how to navigate this tricky and uncertain time. Currently, there is a 10% baseline tariff on everything imported to the United States, with higher tariffs imposed on various industries based abroad. Many of these tariffs are nearly as high as 50%, per data sourced from the government. “A baseline tariff is a tariff rate set by our government on all countries,” says Professor Albert Williams, Ph.D, Finance Chair of the Wayne Huizenga College of Business at Nova Southeastern University. On the other hand, he explains that a reciprocal tariff is a further elevated duty imposed as either a retaliation or a punitive measure implemented based on perceived unfair trade practices. Few of those elevated reciprocal tariffs are currently in place, though, as the White House granted a 90-day freeze on April 9, temporarily keeping things at that baseline 10%. (Some industries, like automobiles, steel and aluminum, and as of April 14, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, might see levies go into effect despite this.) One other—and quite notable—exception to this reprieve is on imports from China, who has the world’s second-largest economy. “The entire menu of tariffs currently in effect is well over 100% on China,” says Professor Jason Miller, Ph.D, with Michigan State University’s Eli Broad College of Business. He adds: “There are tariffs on [almost everything] except for carveouts for [products like] lumber and wood products and copper,” Miller says. “A great many products are affected,” he adds. What won’t be affected, at least for now, is a selection of tech products. Scarcely a week after imposing wide-ranging blanket tariffs on China, the Trump Administration announced exemptions on smartphones, computers, computer chips and several other high-tech product categories, making them subject to much lower duties than the rest of China’s imports. This is seen as a direct but short-term assist to American tech giants, chiefly Apple. But it might be a short-term gift, as the White House has said tariffs on these items are “coming soon.” According to Professor Babak Hafezi, who teaches International Business at American University, “How these tariffs have been imposed will cause nearly everything to increase in price.” He adds that “We have to understand that we have a globalized supply chain with parts being made all over the world and [products] assembled in other countries.” While the exemption of many high-tech devices might keep the price of iPhones, laptops, and other hardware stabler than previously expected—at least for now—you can expect higher price tags for things like appliances, TVs and other complex manufactured goods. Imported foods, apparel, luxury items and more will become pricier, including everything from French wine to Italian leather. And coffee and chocolate will no doubt be more expensive, too. Ironically, tariffs levied on foreign goods often prompt an increase on domestically produced goods as well. If a retailer raises the price on a pound of French cheese by five dollars, for example, they may well elevate the cost of a comparable American product by two or three dollars, since it will still seem like the better bargain. The same is true for other domestically produced products, from apparel to technology to toys. And in addition to higher prices for the consumer, tariffs may lead to supply chain disruptions for both internationally and domestically produced products. This is, in part, because China has vastly limited its exports to the United States in response to the reciprocal tariffs placed on its manufacturers. As an example, our recommendation for one of the best couches, the Rose Sofa from Chicago-based custom sofa maker Interior Define is temporarily unavailable due to trade fluctuations borne by the tariffs. We may see more brands and items follow suit as raw materials become prohibitively expensive or altogether unavailable. While we may see some price increases immediately in anticipation of tariffs, the majority of these will take place a few months after they fully go into effect, “once existing inventories are cycled through and the tariffed items are now being sold,” says professor Miller. That means that with the White House’s current delays, we should see an impact by the summer. And as for whether to stock up before that time, professor Miller advises proceeding with some nuance: “Given all the uncertainty about what tariffs will actually be, I would tell folks only to go forward on purchases for something like a smartphone if they were planning on replacing that phone anyway in the next few months. The same applies with items like laptops.” Long story short, if you were about to buy something you need, go ahead and make the purchase, especially for already pricey items that may be subject to additional price hikes soon. Also shop for those intentional items when you see a meaningful discount; while it’s still too early to tell how shopping events later in the year, like Amazon Prime Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday will ultimately be affected, it’s smart to pick up what you truly need if you can get it for a good deal. (We’ll continue to track these savings in our ongoing sale coverage.) That said, if you’re not actively in the market for a given product, don’t panic buy early—even if it’s currently discounted. While we’re still waiting to see how drastic and widespread price increases may be in coming months, here are some of the items we’re keeping an eye on, and that you may want to consider purchasing now if they need to be replaced: The back-and-forth over whether smartphones, computers and other technology will be impacted by tariffs means nothing is certain; if you are in the market for a new device, such as the iPhone 15 Pro Max or a new Android phone, you may want to buy it. The same goes for laptops, printers and other electronics like our top-recommended TVs. Apple According to the Alliance for American Manufacturing, about 75% of all furniture sold in America is produced overseas. If you’re in the market for a new desk, bedroom set or living room seating, such as one of the best sofas Forbes Vetted team spent more than a year testing, this is a good time to go for it. Sundays The vast majority of shoes, such as Forbes Vetted reader-favorite Hoka walking shoes, are made overseas, and the price on shoes of all types is likely to rise when tariffs hit and new designs come out. This is also the case for things like men’s shorts, crossbody bags, bath towels and other clothing, accessories and textiles we test and recommend. Frontgate We regularly cover home appliances, such as whole-house humidifiers, stackable washers and dryers, and other hardware that can be quite expensive even without tariff-induced price hikes. If you have already budgeted for a home appliance, it could be a good idea to buy now before prices rise further. You can all but count on higher prices on numerous foods and beverages, such as the aforementioned chocolate, coffee and wine subscriptions, but also on other imports like olive oil and flowers. Maeve Chocolate Contrary to common misconception, tariffs are not paid by foreign countries or foreign companies; they are paid by the company importing goods from overseas or by an agent for the domestic company. In other words, in the case of these recent tariffs, they will be paid for by American businesses. The money raised goes through the United States Custom and Border Protection agency and becomes federal government revenue. “Tariff taxes collected are added to the government’s revenues, which are then used for education, social programs, military, healthcare spending and more,” says professor Williams. Some of the costs incurred by those importers are absorbed by the companies affected, but the rest are largely passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. In effect, everyday consumers eventually shoulder some burden of increased prices triggered by tariffs. A “recession” is defined as two or more consecutive quarters of decline in economic activity significant enough that the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP) shrinks. The types of economic activity tracked include a higher unemployment rate, a slowdown in industrial production, reduced consumer spending and reduced business investment and profit. Some economists warn that the current tariff program may lead to a recession. “This is what most economists are worried about,” says professor Hafezi. “If we have rising prices because of tariffs and enter a recession, we could enter a timeframe of stagflation. This is a staggering economy that cannot rebalance because tariffs impose an artificially high rate on prices, and discounting will be minimal because the supply chain will have taken all discounts possible to keep prices down as much as possible. This staggering economy is happening while you have further inflationary elements that dampen economic activity. Furthermore, companies will take multiple quarters to move their supply chains to rebalance production to countries that are not tariffed or are less so. This will take time.” Bottom line: During times of recession, consumer spending tends to drop, which further slows the economy. As a result, merchandise prices often drop to accommodate that lowered demand, and while cheaper phones, toilet paper and office chairs might seem like a good thing, reduced prices also often mean less profits for retailers, which can cause hiring freezes and layoffs. These only make a potential recession worse and more protracted.

That means that with the White House’s current delays, we should see an impact by the summer. And as for whether to stock up before that time, professor Miller advises proceeding with some nuance: “Given all the uncertainty about what tariffs will actually be, I would tell folks only to go forward on purchases for something like a smartphone if they were planning on replacing that phone anyway in the next few months. The same applies with items like laptops.” Long story short, if you were about to buy something you need, go ahead and make the purchase, especially for already pricey items that may be subject to additional price hikes soon. Also shop for those intentional items when you see a meaningful discount; while it’s still too early to tell how shopping events later in the year, like Amazon Prime Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday will ultimately be affected, it’s smart to pick up what you truly need if you can get it for a good deal. (We’ll continue to track these savings in our ongoing sale coverage.) That said, if you’re not actively in the market for a given product, don’t panic buy early—even if it’s currently discounted. While we’re still waiting to see how drastic and widespread price increases may be in coming months, here are some of the items we’re keeping an eye on, and that you may want to consider purchasing now if they need to be replaced: The back-and-forth over whether smartphones, computers and other technology will be impacted by tariffs means nothing is certain; if you are in the market for a new device, such as the iPhone 15 Pro Max or a new Android phone, you may want to buy it. The same goes for laptops, printers and other electronics like our top-recommended TVs. Apple According to the Alliance for American Manufacturing, about 75% of all furniture sold in America is produced overseas. If you’re in the market for a new desk, bedroom set or living room seating, such as one of the best sofas Forbes Vetted team spent more than a year testing, this is a good time to go for it. Sundays The vast majority of shoes, such as Forbes Vetted reader-favorite Hoka walking shoes, are made overseas, and the price on shoes of all types is likely to rise when tariffs hit and new designs come out. This is also the case for things like men’s shorts, crossbody bags, bath towels and other clothing, accessories and textiles we test and recommend. Frontgate We regularly cover home appliances, such as whole-house humidifiers, stackable washers and dryers, and other hardware that can be quite expensive even without tariff-induced price hikes. If you have already budgeted for a home appliance, it could be a good idea to buy now before prices rise further. You can all but count on higher prices on numerous foods and beverages, such as the aforementioned chocolate, coffee and wine subscriptions, but also on other imports like olive oil and flowers. Maeve Chocolate Contrary to common misconception, tariffs are not paid by foreign countries or foreign companies; they are paid by the company importing goods from overseas or by an agent for the domestic company. In other words, in the case of these recent tariffs, they will be paid for by American businesses. The money raised goes through the United States Custom and Border Protection agency and becomes federal government revenue. “Tariff taxes collected are added to the government’s revenues, which are then used for education, social programs, military, healthcare spending and more,” says professor Williams. Some of the costs incurred by those importers are absorbed by the companies affected, but the rest are largely passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. In effect, everyday consumers eventually shoulder some burden of increased prices triggered by tariffs. A “recession” is defined as two or more consecutive quarters of decline in economic activity significant enough that the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP) shrinks. The types of economic activity tracked include a higher unemployment rate, a slowdown in industrial production, reduced consumer spending and reduced business investment and profit. Some economists warn that the current tariff program may lead to a recession. “This is what most economists are worried about,” says professor Hafezi. “If we have rising prices because of tariffs and enter a recession, we could enter a timeframe of stagflation. This is a staggering economy that cannot rebalance because tariffs impose an artificially high rate on prices, and discounting will be minimal because the supply chain will have taken all discounts possible to keep prices down as much as possible. This staggering economy is happening while you have further inflationary elements that dampen economic activity. Furthermore, companies will take multiple quarters to move their supply chains to rebalance production to countries that are not tariffed or are less so. This will take time.” Bottom line: During times of recession, consumer spending tends to drop, which further slows the economy. As a result, merchandise prices often drop to accommodate that lowered demand, and while cheaper phones, toilet paper and office chairs might seem like a good thing, reduced prices also often mean less profits for retailers, which can cause hiring freezes and layoffs. These only make a potential recession worse and more protracted.

As markets swing wildly on tariff headlines and economic uncertainty, a curious split is emerging: Retail investors are diving in, while institutional players are stepping back. Even as big banks report blowout trading revenue, the underlying behavior suggests churn — not conviction. Retail flows into U.S. stocks have surged this past week, with everyday investors “aggressively buying the dip,” according to Vanda Research, even as volatility spikes and recession warnings linger. Trading app data shows a notable uptick in activity, especially among tech names and single-stock bets. In short: Main Street is leaning in. Hedge funds have slashed their equity exposure by nearly $45 billion over the past 30 days, according to data shared by The Kobeissi Letter, marking a sharp divergence from the retail crowd. While the pullback intensified following Trump’s April 2 “Liberation Day” speech, when tariff rhetoric escalated and volatility spiked, the retreat has been underway for months. Goldman Sachs (GS) reported that hedge funds sold the largest volume of stocks in a single week since 2010, according to a client note reviewed by Reuters. That week followed Liberation Day — but it capped a broader selloff that began earlier this year. In fact, back in February, Goldman flagged that hedge funds were already unloading global equities at the most aggressive pace since 2013, dumping nearly every sector except real estate as tariff announcements began to roll out. The selling has been broad-based, spanning regions and industries, with IG describing the pace as “unprecedented” and highlighting the move as a clear signal of mounting risk aversion. The timing matters: Major U.S. indexes have yet to recover to pre–Liberation Day levels, and professional money managers appear more cautious in the face of policy whiplash. Rather than piling into rebounds, many seem to be reallocating or sitting tight — reflecting a stark contrast with retail investors still buying dips. Looking further out, stocks remain broadly underwater for the year, with the S&P 500 down around 8%, the Dow off about 5%, and the Nasdaq trailing with a 12% decline. Small-cap stocks have been hit even harder, with the Russell 2000 down more than 15% year-to-date. In contrast, gold has emerged as a standout performer, with the PHLX Gold/Silver Index up nearly 39% amid rising demand for (at least perceived) safe-haven assets. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and Morgan Stanley (MS) made over $12 billion in equities trading revenue in the first quarter, capitalizing on surging client activity. But the story isn’t necessarily one of aggressive bets on battered stocks — it’s one of reaction and repositioning. Busy trading desks signal motion, not conviction. Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and other retail/institutional favorites are still under pressure. If “buy the dip” enthusiasm was dominant among pros, you’d likely see stronger rebounds in these names. Similarly, if broad-based bullish conviction were driving flows, we’d likely see sharper index recoveries. So, while the earnings boom reflects the central role these firms play in helping clients reposition quickly in response to shocks, it does not always signal bullish sentiment. Just now, it may signal the opposite. While institutional players are rotating, rebalancing, or simply waiting things out, retail investors appear to be betting on a comeback—or perhaps are just conditioned by years of dip-buying muscle memory. Whether that confidence is rewarded or punished will depend on what happens next in Washington and on Wall Street.

Title: BP Faces Shareholder Showdown Amid Oil Price Crash

More Info BP is holding its annual general meeting on April 17 in the early days of its strategy reset to return to its core oil and gas business while oil prices have crashed by more than $10 per barrel this month. Shareholders, especially activist hedge fund Elliott, will want to make their position known at the AGM votes on Thursday. Activist investor Elliott, which has been pushing for dramatic changes at BP since amassing a 5% stake in the supermajor, is likely to express its continued frustration with BP’s performance by voting against the re-election of directors. Fortunately for BP, one of the constant campaigners that has been pushing for years for shareholder resolutions on emissions and climate accountability at AGMs, Follow This, has just decided to pause its climate resolutions at Big Oil – for the first time since 2016 – citing investor hesitation about ESG investments and campaigning. Related: U.S. Oil Production Cuts May Be Avoided “Shareholder resolutions have been critical in compelling five oil majors to set emissions reduction targets, but most institutional investors are reluctant to use their voting power,” Mark van Baal of Follow This said last week ahead of the AGMs at the oil and gas supermajors. “It’s a strategic pause to get more investors on board and to discuss how to work together to uphold shareholder rights.” The backlash against ESG, combined with the trade war, has left investors uncertain about how to proceed with climate action, Follow This said. The climate campaign group noted that it “speaks with investors about addressing these barriers, exploring what prevents investors, like BlackRock, LGIM, and NBIM, from casting their votes in favour of Paris-alignment despite their public climate commitments.” In BP’s case, however, the step-back of Follow This appears to be the only good news for the company and its management these days. BP’s shares continue to lose more than its peers, including Shell and the U.S. supermajors, and have dipped in value more than those of the other majors during the oil price rout triggered by fears of weaker oil demand in light of the trade wars and uncertainty about tariffs. Year to date, BP’s stock has plunged by 18% despite the strategy reset announced at the end of February. To compare, Shell’s shares have lost 13% so far this year, while Exxon and Chevron have dropped by 4% and 6% respectively—much less than the oil price decline. BP’s strategy reset has failed to lift its stock performance despite the supermajor walking back on renewable energy spending and stepping up investment in fossil fuels. BP vowed to increase its investment in upstream oil and gas to $10 billion per year while slashing spending on clean energy by more than $5 billion a year. The pressure on BP became more intense this year after Elliott bought a nearly 5% stake in the supermajor and demanded changes in strategy or even board reshuffles. In a move seen as a win for Elliott, BP chair Helge Lund this month announced his intention to step down from the role “most likely during 2026.” This announcement doesn’t mean Elliott wouldn’t vote against Lund or other board directors at the shareholders’ meeting this week to express its dissatisfaction with how the company has been run. In a very unfortunate development for BP, any positive share performance from the strategy reset was obliterated within a month by the tariff and trade wars, which crashed the price of Brent Crude oil to the low $60s per barrel. Lower oil prices could test BPs ability to sustain its returns to shareholders, including dividends, especially as the supermajor flagged an increase in its net debt in the first quarter of 2025. BP warned of a weak natural gas trading result for the first quarter and said its net debt at quarter-end is expected to be around $4 billion higher compared to the fourth quarter, primarily due to a working capital build. This, BP said, is largely expected to reverse, reflecting seasonal inventory effects, timing of payments including annual bonus payments, and payments related to low carbon assets held for sale. But Elliott and other shareholders will want more, and BP could struggle to deliver.

Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures.

(“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB) securities between November 12, 2024 and February 25, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR ROCKET LAB INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Rocket Lab securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than April 28, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck’s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil’s growth in China. The full truth finally emerged on February 4, 2025, when Merck announced it would no longer achieve the long-forecasted $11 billion in sales of Gardasil by 2030, as it would cease shipments of Gardasil to China “through at least midyear” to facilitate a “rapid reduction of inventory.” Defendants claimed this was necessitated by the continued over-inflation of overall channel inventories as demand in China for Gardasil had “not recovered to the level we had expected.” Following this news, Merck’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $99.79 per share on February 3, 2025, Merck’s stock price fell to $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025, a decline of more than 9% in the span of just a single day.

Editor Activism C.Z. Means, Independent media alliance, Unlimited Hangout, Whitney Webb In Part I of this series on the overlap between the worlds of Sean “Diddy” Combs and Jeffrey Epstein, we examine Combs’ early years, his mentors and the industry figures who ensured their, as well as Combs’ own, commercial success. Ties to organized crime and intelligence are readily apparent and point toward a truly sinister reason behind this network’s patronage of Combs and his close associates, like Andre Harrell and Russell Simmons. Beginning in late 2023, a series of startling and unsettling allegations against Sean Combs –– a record executive and rapper known over the years by stage names like “Puff Daddy,” “P. Diddy” and presently “Diddy” –– have emerged. As the allegations and lawsuits facing Combs have snowballed, so, too, has public interest in the case. The sheer amount of accusations suggests that Combs, in addition to being very sexually and physically violent, filmed many assault encounters and orgies that occurred at his now notorious “Freak Off” parties, sometimes with hidden or security cameras. He also now stands accused of “operating an empire of sexual crimes,” with federal agents having alleged that several of Combs’ victims were of “barely legal” or “barely illegal” age at the time of their abuse. Combs’ apparent documentation of these events strongly suggests that he was interested in keeping these records for more than his perverse enjoyment, as either a form of a protection or as a means to control those who appeared in these films, i.e. blackmail. As a result, speculation has grown about who is allegedly on the “list” of people filmed by Combs in this way, prompting comparisons to the alleged “list” of sex trafficker, pedophile and intelligence asset Jeffrey Epstein. The comparisons between Epstein and Combs have only grown, with even the homeland security agents who raided Combs’ Miami home suggesting that Combs was “as bad as Epstein.” However, as has long been a theme of Unlimited Hangout’s Epstein-related reporting, including the book One Nation Under Blackmail, the Jeffrey Epstein case has been poorly explored by the federal government, mainstream media outlets, and even many independent media outlets. A deeper examination of the Epstein case makes it clear that Epstein was not the sole mastermind or sole beneficiary of the sex trafficking and blackmail operation in which he engaged. Instead, Epstein served as an operator for a larger, monied network of oligarchs with extensive organized crime connections in addition to significant affiliations with intelligence agencies. He was also more than a sex trafficker for this group, having aided this network extensively in arms trafficking, money laundering and other crimes (many financial) that fall outside of the focus on his sex-related offenses. It should come as no surprise upon closer examination of Sean Combs that, like Epstein, he was operating on behalf of a larger network that he did not ultimately control. Instead, it arguably controlled him. As this three-part series from Unlimited Hangout will endeavor to show, Combs was acting on behalf of an oligarch network that directly overlaps with that of Epstein. However, Combs used to influence a different industry and a different community for the benefit of these intelligence and organized crime-connected oligarchs. In Part I of this series, we will examine the often overlooked early years of Combs and his entrance into the music industry. While Combs’ own rise (from birth to the founding of Bad Boy Records in 1993) is certainly chronicled, a major focus of this piece is on the mentors and figures who facilitated his rise into the upper echelons of hip hop celebrity, especially Andre Harrell and Clive Davis, as well as other figures who had a significant influence on Combs’ early career into the music industry, like Russell Simmons. Not only did these figures bring Combs into the music industry, they also stand accused of initiating Combs into the types of activities he is now in prison for, awaiting trial. Also explored in this piece are the corporations behind the success of Combs’ mentors and later Combs himself, namely the Music Corporation of America (MCA) and Arista Records. When taken together with other claims from the period, namely about efforts to manipulate hip hop for the benefit of the private prison industry in the early to mid-1990s, it appears that this network’s interest in Combs, as well as his mentors, was part of something much larger that sought to target not just the hip hop industry itself, but the African-American community at large. Subsequent installments of this series will examine Combs’ activities –– in music, in retail and beyond –– and how the same network detailed in Part I also enabled those activities, which notably parallel Combs’ deeper descent into acts of sexual violence and abuse. Another installment will examine how one close associate of Combs also connects very directly with the sex trafficking activities of Jeffrey Epstein, indicating that the overlap between the two cases is more significant than previous reporting and the current cases against Combs have suggested. Sean Combs was born in Harlem, NY on November 4, 1969 to a schoolteacher and ex-model named Janice Combs (née Smalls) and Melvin Earl Combs, an Air Force serviceman and sometimes associate of American Gangster heroin kingpin Frank Lucas. Melvin Combs helped make ends meet by running a number of legal and less-than-legal operations; including a cab and limousine chauffeuring company, multiple bars Combs owned, and a portion of Harlem drug traffic.i A toddler-aged Combs tagged along with Melvin on visits to Lucas’ home, even playing with his daughter. According to an interview prior to his death, the aged gangster alleged that Combs didn’t share his toys. “I learned early in life that there’s only two ways out of that [lifestyle]: dead or in jail,” explained Combs in 2013, speaking of his father’s lifestyle. “It made me work even harder… I have his hustler’s mentality.” According to contemporaries, Melvin was an immaculate dresser. While less flashy than Lucas, who once attracted the attention of the feds by sitting ringside at a Muhammad Ali –Joe Frazier bout in a $100,000 fur coat, Melvin still pulled out enough stops to be granted the street nickname “Pretty Melvin.” When Sean Combs was 3 years old, Melvin Combs was gunned down while sitting in a loitering car near Central Park West. Per Susan Traugh, Melvin was shot in the head, likely at point blank range considering he was seated in his Mercedes-Benz—this manner of a hit is consistent with an enforcer killing.ii According to an interview conducted by author Zack O’Malley-Greenburg, someone in Melvin Combs’ circle believed he was about to inform on a sensitive business deal to law enforcement and that this is what precipitated his murder.iii From this, former associates and law enforcement have speculated that Melvin Combs was a federal informant. If allegations from incarcerated contemporaneous label heads like Suge Knight and former bodyguards are to believed, Sean Combs may have done the same, allegedly informing for the FBI over the course of his career. A recent article from journalist Legs McNeil lays out the Lucas-Combs criminal enterprise in greater detail than previously reported. It also shows that Melvin Combs, in addition to his dealings with Lucas, had an arguably deeper affiliation with the Gambino crime family near the end of his life. The Gambinos may have even put out his hit. McNeil writes: Melvin Combs, a small-time hustler, was introduced to selling heroin when Lucas fronted him several kilos from his Golden Triangle connection. He joined the crew of Willie Abraham, the 42-year-old owner of the Harlem Gold Lounge and a convicted heroin dealer who’d already spent five years in jail. Unlike Lucas, Abraham was getting his heroin from the Mafia—specifically, the Gambino crime family. In 1971, Melvin was arrested for possession of heroin and $45,000 in cash. When Abraham’s heroin‐cutting mill was raided later that year, and Abraham was charged with participating in an extensive conspiracy to distribute $5 million a year in heroin at the wholesale level in Harlem, the Bronx, and Westchester County, Melvin was suspected by Alphonse “Funzi” Sisca, head of the Gambinos’ New Jersey crew, of being a rat. McNeil also noted that “The New York Times reported that the prosecutor in the Abraham case told the judge that law enforcement believed Melvin’s murder ‘might ultimately be traced to members of the heroin‐distributing conspiracy.’” A newspaper clipping from the Saturday, February 24th, 1973 edition of the New York Daily News reveals that the Gambino-backed Willie Abraham crew had plenty or reason to suspect Combs of informing or at least blamed him for the arrests. The article notes that their relationship to Combs appears to have led directly to Abraham and his collaborators’ convictionson conspiracy charges, including Gambino man Alphonso Sisca of New Jersey: Willie Abraham […] was found guilty in Manhattan Federal Court yesterday of being a kingpin narcotics wholesaler whose ring flooded the metropolitan area with more than 1,000 pounds of drugs in 2 1/2 years. A task force of federal, state and local cops smashed the ring in a series of raids in December 1971 as the result of information obtained through the court approved wiretaps on another big time narcotics dealer’s phone. The dealer, Melvin Combs, 31, of 1853 Central Ave., Yonkers, was found shot to death in January 1972 on Manhattan’s West Side. This evidence of a reported “wiretap” supports the claim that Abraham and his Gambino Family backers had Combs murdered because they blamed him for the arrests, regardless of whether Combs had actually been an informant. Throughout this article, connections to the Gambino crime family, as well as the Genovese crime family, are a recurring theme. In the earliest years of his life, Sean Combs lived in Esplanade Gardens. His mother Janice recognized the performative, attention-hungry character her son possessed early on. This led to Combs’ first advertising gig at the age of 2, when he starred in a Baskin-Robbins TV commercial. Later, Combs modeled alongside The Wiz actress Stephanie Mills in Essence magazine. Following in his mother’s footsteps, these early modeling jobs presaged Combs’ lifelong relationship with the modeling industry, which in comparable fashion to Jeffrey Epstein, would eventually become the hunting grounds which Combs would scour for victims for his orgiastic sexual blackmail parties and pathological predation.iv During his middle school years, Combs’ mother Janice relocated the family to Westchester, a middle-class suburb of Mount Vernon. Combs enrolled in the prestigious Mount Saint Michael Academy (MSMA), a Catholic school located in the Bronx, where his popularity eventually soared due to his exploits on the varsity football team, which won a division title during his time there. Combs’ hopes of receiving a scholarship to play D1 in college came crashing down when he broke his leg during his senior year. Yet, it was already too late for his confidence. He was reportedly given the nickname “Puffy” due to the way he strutted around with his chest puffed out.v Throughout his middle and high school years, Combs also exhibited an entrepreneurial streak, reportedly selling T-shirts and ties at Macy’s while working multiple newspaper routes simultaneously. This early relationship with Macy’s prefigures both his later merchandising deals with the department store, which saw his fragrance line Sean John stock the shelves nationwide, and the recent lawsuit filed by a John Doe from Ohio who alleges that Combs “orally raped” him in the stockroom of the flagship Macy’s in New York in 2008. His accuser alleges that Macy’s even endeavored to cover up the crime in order to preserve their lucrative business relationship. While speculative, there is a possibility that this may have even been the same Macy’s that had employed Combs as a minor. Notably, while Combs attended the all-boys Mount Saint Michael’s Academy, a major sex abuse case involving minor victims that led to the indictments of two faculty members was brewing at the institution. Marist Brother Timothy Brady –– the principal of MSMA for the entirety of Combs’ high school career — was arrested, charged, and sentenced to prison in 1988 for the abuse of three minor boys at the Catholic Academy in the Bronx over the course of 1987, Combs’ senior year. Following the ‘86/’87 academic year, Br. Brady was quietly removed from his position and shipped off to a Marist retreat in Arizona. Despite his crimes, Brady was reinstated as a hockey moderator at a separate Marist Brothers institution in the 1990s, once again providing him access to minors, and was listed on the Marist Brothers website until 2010. For some inexplicable reason, the court records pertaining to Brady’s conviction and incarceration remain sealed. Accusations of sexual impropriety appear to have been a constant in MSMA’s history. In 2011, a former assistant principal received a sweetheart no-jail sentence after pleading guilty to possession of child porn on an electronic device at the school. From 2009 to 2012, a lawsuit filed by Brian Elliott sought monetary damages for the routine abuse and rape he alleges he suffered at the hands of an MSMA employee named Br. Galligan between the ages of 8 and 13 over the years of 1977 through 1983. The case wound its way through various Delaware, New York, and appellate courts. If factual, Elliott’s victimization by Galligan would have ended around the time of Combs’ freshman year in high school, meaning Elliott and Combs were close in age. More recently, multiple cases seeking redress of child sexual abuse suffered at the hands of the MSMA faculty have been filed pursuant to New York’s Child Victims Act and the “look-back window” that has enabled past victims previously barred from filing complaints by the statute of limitations to now pursue them. These include a torts CVA complaint filed on behalf of a John Doe suing the Academy & the Marist Brothers of the Schools for having enabled his abuse at the hands of Principal Brady, who allegedly fondled the plaintiff in the nurse’s office in 1985 when Doe was 16. It appears this unnamed potential victim would have been in the same class as Combs. Quoting from the complaint, “Upon information and belief, at all relevant times, Defendants knew that priests and brothers of the Catholic Church and within the Marist Brothers, under their supervision and control, were grooming and sexually molesting children with whom the priests and brothers would have contact in their ministry and pastoral functions.” Another lawsuit accusing the Marist Brothers of protecting a pedophile faculty member named Brother Lee advanced in the Supreme Court of Bronx County in 2023, surviving multiple motions for dismissal & summary judgment, seemingly indicating that multiple members of the school’s faculty –– including its principal –– were perpetrating sex crimes against minors during Combs’ high school career. And once again, the complainant alleges that he was abused by Brother Lee between the years of 1984 and 1985, when he was 15-16 years of age, conclusively indicating that he also would have been in Combs’ class of 1987. Taking all of this information into account, it appears that sexual abuse was endemic and widespread at MSMA during Combs’ time there. While impossible to confirm, there is a possibility that Combs was groomed or among the victims or else somehow connected to these aforementioned cases. Certainly, those type of experiences early in life are statistically associated with a person offending in similar ways later in life. Also, as an aside, the FBI and DA’s office appear to have used the fraught climate at MSMA to initiate a COINTELPRO-inspired smear and lawfare campaign against Fr. Bernard Lynch, the first gay married priest and Fordham-trained Irish psychotherapist, who inspired a “witch-hunt” organized by the Vatican, archdiocese, and the FBI in retaliation to his outspoken advocacy for gay rights. More specifically, Lynch had founded Dignity NY, the first gay ministry in New York City in 1982, bringing him to the attention of Mayor Ed Koch, who drafted him onto his AIDS Task Force.vi While attending Mount St. Michael’s, a teenage Combs began frequenting several New York nightclubs, which reportedly led to his first encounter with the music industry and famous musicians like Michael Jackson. As detailed in an interview, given in 1994 shortly after launching Bad Boy Records, Combs seemingly claimed he was cast as a background dancer in one of Jackson’s videos as a teen: “Around the age of 16 or 17, I started dancing, going to the various clubs, and that was during the time when somebody—(if) a big artist like Diana Ross, Fine Young Cannibals, or even Michael Jackson had a video—the directors would come into the clubs and see all the kids that were dancing and pick various dancers to be in the videos. So I got picked to be in some of those videos, and, um, as I was dancing in videos and stuff like that, I would see the behind the scenes. I was about to go to college at Howard University and I didn’t know what I wanted to do. So I saw the people behind the scenes, and I was like, ‘that’s maybe something I wanted to do’, so I started like asking questions and getting information on the music industry…” Combs’ apparent encounter with Michael Jackson, while still only a teenage dancer on the NY club circuit, presages the significant relationship that later emerged between the music mogul and the King of Pop, which lasted for decades until Jackson’s premature and suspicious death. These interlocks between Combs and Jackson are worth mentioning for a few reasons: both artists have grappled with accusations of sexual abuse; both men have spent years surrounded by Zionist powerbrokers (within and outside of the music industry) who ingratiated themselves into their good graces or insinuated their way into their circles; and both Combs and Jackson cultivated close friendships with billionaire Epstein affiliate and Bill Clinton associate, Ron Burkle. For instance, Burkle, who will be a focus of Part II of this series for his ties to Combs, was close to Jackson and later purchased Jackson’s infamous Neverland Ranch estate for $22 million in 2020. Burkle is also reportedly the godfather to Combs’ children. While developing his ties to both Jackson and Combs, Burkle was a frequent flier on Jeffrey Epstein’s infamous private jet –– the “Lolita Express” –– particularly on flights including former President Bill Clinton, who he employed as an advisor to his firm, the Yucaipa Companies around the same period. Following his graduation from Mount St. Michael Academy, Combs enrolled at the prestigious Howard University in Washington, DC to study business in 1987. He promptly set about further inflating his street cred as he expanded his horizons into a new popularity-maximizing enterprise –– party planning and promotion. His parties were described by classmates as offering a “once-in-a-lifetime type of vibe” and Combs spared no expense in spreading the word, driving around campus in his convertible to pass out fliers for events. Author Susan Traugh wrote that some of Combs’ collegiate parties attracted thousands of guests. Comb’s entrance onto the hip hop scene began during his freshman year when Combs scored a side-gig as rapper-beatboxer Doug E. Fresh’s valet, where he “shuttl[ed] Fresh’s clothes to and from the dry cleaner in his Volkswagen Rabbit convertible.”vii All the while, Combs organized parties in and around the Beltway as well as back home in New York City on the weekends. He was also a background dancer in one of Fresh’s music videos around this time. While at Howard, the darker, predatory side of Combs’ reputation also began to take shape, with accusations of belligerence, sexual harassment, and domestic violence following in his wake. Contemporaneous accounts provided by sources to Rolling Stone tell of Combs beating a girlfriend with his belt in full view of the public on the Howard quad. Another time, he tapped on the glass window of an English class in session to try and coax a woman into skipping. On another occasion, he non-consensually caressed a woman’s back and asked her if he could introduce her to “one of his friends.” By age 20, Combs had begun focusing more of his attention on his nascent internship and career at Uptown Records, a job he had first secured in 1990 via his Mount Vernon neighbor, the rapper Heavy D. Combs’ initiative soon saw him become former Def Jam recordman Andre Harrell’s intern. He commuted from Howard to NYC via Amtrak in the mornings, stowing away in the bathroom to avoid paying fare. He also shadowed party promoter Jessica Rosenblum during the planning stages for Heavy D’s platinum-album celebration. Rosenblum “obliged his requests to take him to all the ‘freaky’ nightspots on the Lower East Side.”viii Rosenblum takes credit for having introduced Combs to some of the biggest names among NY scenesters and club kids — as well as updating his eyewear fashion. Rosenblum graduated from her hip hop party promoter career to become a NYC interior designer wedded to Steve Young, head of global litigation for one of the Big 4 Accounting firms, Ernst & Young. In the late 1980s, while still a student at Howard, Combs learned that Uptown Records’ A&R (artists and repertoire) executive had vacated the company. Combs took his boss Andre Harrell out to lunch to press for the job and, after a successful schmooze, soon transformed himself into one of the youngest talent scouts in the industry.ix Combs later told Rolling Stone that, after joining Uptown, “Andre became like my big brother. He bought a mansion, gave me a room [. . .] Not a mansion, a big house. It was a mansion to me, though, and he had gave [sic] me a room in the house.” Prior to his mentorship of Sean Combs, Uptown’s Andre Harrell first broke into the nascent hip hop industry by way of his rap duo Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde, which he and a friend had formed in high school. Harrell withdrew from Lehman College in 1983 to focus on his career as an account executive selling airtime for New York all-news AM station WINS. WINS was previously owned by radio pioneer J. Elroy McCaw, an ex-OSS agent and member of the Advisory Council to the US National Security Council.x McCaw hired trailblazing disc jockey Allan Freed to man the mic at the station, a deal that was brokered by record executive Morris Levy.xi Per Potash, a US Assistant Attorney later claimed that Levy’s jazz label Roulette Records, boosted by his relationship with WINS’ Freed –– the most popular DJ in the country in the 1950s and 1960s –– was a “way station for heroin trafficking.” Levy and Roulette were also linked to organized crime, specifically the Genovese crime family. Levy was notably the main financier behind the first hip hop record label, Sugar Hill. The zenith of Freed’s celebrity was exemplified by Paramount Pictures hiring him at a rate of $29,000 per day to make a teen movie in 1957. Shortly thereafter, Freed was targeted by a smear campaign, resulting in him being unceremoniously and inexplicably fired by McCaw in 1958. Freed was singled out by Orrin Hatch’s Congressional committee during the first “payola” scandal involving the bribing of radio stations in return for singles plays. As a result, Freed became the face of the scandal, his career in shambles. As Potash writes regarding Freed’s downfall, “Morris Levy, the source of much of the payola bribe money, was never called to testify.”xii Months after joining WINS, Harrell’s job prospects experienced a dramatic upswing when he met Russell Simmons, co-founder of the Def Jam record label, who would later become very close to Sean Combs. Simmons soon offered Harrell a job with Def Jam. Within two short years (a rapid ascent mirroring Combs’ own), Harrell worked his way up to VP and general manager of the label. Def Jam’s early success was due in part to its 1984 distribution deal with CBS and its subsidiary Columbia Records. At the time, the label was run by Walter Yetnikoff, a close associate and friend of Clive Davis –– the man who would later become Sean Combs’ second mentor after Harrell that is a later focus of this piece. Appointed by Paley, Yetnikoff is heavily implicated in the Payola scandals of the 1980s that involved the “independent promotion” syndicate known as The Network, for which CBS Records was one of the biggest clients.xiii Yetnikoff went to some ends to protect the established payola system, firing his deputy president Dick Asher in 1983 and, per UPI, even quashing an investigation by the Recording Industry Association of America. By 1986, CBS Records had come under the control of Laurence Tisch, the billionaire head of Loews Corporation and a founding member of the Leslie Wexner and Charles Bronfman-brokered “Mega Group.” Harrell’s success in management, contrary to music-making, seemed to have clarified things for Harrell, as his short-lived stint as a Profile Records artist came to a close when his high school rap duo with Alonzo Brown split up in 1986. That same year, Harrell struck out on his own to create Uptown. However, before leaving Def Jam, Harrell was responsible for Def Jam’s hiring of Israeli-American Lyor “Little Lansky” Cohen, who would later force out Def Jam co-founder Rick Rubin in order to co-run the label with Simmons. Years later, upon leaving Def Jam, Cohen would team up with the family who had taken control of Def Jam in the 1990s, the Bronfmans, to become the top executive at Warner Music, an event that will be revisited in Part II of this series. Not unlike Def Jam, Uptown’s early success (and the furtherance of Harrell’s career in the industry) was due to its distribution deal with a major entertainment conglomerate. In Uptown’s case, the company in question was the Music Corporation of American (MCA), an entertainment giant that dominated the American music and movie industry for many decades. Uptown’s early distribution deal with MCA began in 1987 and soon expanded into a formal partnership with the company a year later in 1988. Their ties grew even deeper in 1992, when MCA offered Uptown a $50 million deal whereby Uptown expanded into film and television. In a Vanity Fair obituary for Andre Harrell, screenwriter and journalist Barry Michael Cooper describes an anecdote involving Harrell and a bust-up at the MCA Records Conference in Midtown Manhattan that demonstrates how Harrell employed street enforcers and drug dealers at Uptown, and that they even procured him a gun for protection: There was a rumor going around the streets of New York that Teddy’s manager, former drug dealer and karate enthusiast Gene Griffin, had smacked Andre in the conference of MCA Records in Midtown Manhattan. Journalist and author Nelson George, gave me Andre’s telephone number, so I could confirm the story. I called Andre and identified myself, and asked him about the confrontation with Griffin. I also asked him about the story of two of his Uptown Record executives—Jimmy “Luv” Jenkins and George Harrell (no relation), two of the most respected street dudes from the Highbridge neighborhood of the Bronx, and 116th Street in Harlem, respectively—giving him a .45 automatic to keep for protection. Andre tried to place the gun in the back of his waistband. However, the .45 slipped through and down his pants, and landed on the floor of the elevator. Andre, Jimmy, and George jumped back, but the gun didn’t discharge. Andre didn’t respond for almost a minute, and then said to me, “Who are you supposed to be? Ed Bradley? Things happen.” We cracked up laughing, and became fast friends after that. In addition to MCA being critical to Harrell’s career and MCA’s success, Uptown’s relationship with MCA also appears to align with one of Combs’ earliest known sex crimes. For instance, one of the earliest allegations against Combs asserts that Combs sexually assaulted a victim after an MCA event in New York in 1990 or 1991, a time when Combs was still an Uptown employee. As Strictly Business scriptwriter Nelson George intimated in a Substack post eulogizing his friend Andre Harrell, Harrell was a known “party animal” who frequently threw house parties in the “work space/social club/temporary housing” that served as the nascent Uptown Records’ offices. In fact, one of these parties in 1990 served as the source of inspiration for Strictly Business, the film that George co-wrote with Pam Gibson and which Andre Harrell executive produced for Island World Pictures (a company then affiliated with Polygram, which took a significant stake in Def Jam in 1992). It was Harrell’s role in the film that reportedly led MCA to enter into its $50 million multimedia deal with Uptown in 1992 that saw Harrell’s company expand into film. Strictly Business concerns a young mail room clerk setting up a black middle manager at a real estate firm with a club chick played by the emerging starlet Halle Berry. Bobby the mail clerk is a party boy with aspirations of graduating from the trainee broker program, and so he agrees to help Waymon navigate seducing the attractive woman in return for his higher-up’s sponsorship of his candidacy. While the plot may seem like normal rom-com fare and relatively benign, when viewed within the context of the kinds of sexual quid pro quos that occur within the music industry and Harrell’s close ties to figures like Combs, Simmons, and their broader social networks, it starts to take on a distinctly different slant. Speaking of sexual quid pro quos in the music industry and questionable label romances, Andre Harrell left an indelible influence on Combs’ love life. He hired Uptown R&B singer Al B. Sure’s model girlfriend Kim Porter to work as a receptionist at the label. Combs’ was immediately smitten with her, loving what he couldn’t have. They would go on to have an on-and-off again relationship spanning the years from 1994 to 2018, the time of her mysterious death after contracting a virulent case of lobar pneumonia. We will return to Porter and Combs’ ties to the modeling industry in Part III of this series. Andre Harrell was also a consultant for the film New Jack City. New Jack City’s screenwriter Barry Michael Cooper recalls how he and producer George Jackson called his close friend Andre Harrell into Robert De Niro’s Tribeca Productions compound to watch the dailies from New Jack City a week before production wrapped. Cooper and Jackson wanted to gauge Andre Harrell’s reaction to New Jack City’s narrative and the depictions of street life as it related to the crack epidemic. Per Cooper’s retelling, apparently Harrell raved and affectionately called the film “The Black Godfather.” New Jack City’s narrative revolves around a Harlem gang called the Cash Money Brothers who ascend to the top of the drug-dealing food chain in the borough once crack cocaine is introduced to the streets. The film featured gangster rap mainstay Ice-T in a prominent role and christened the careers of Wesley Snipes and Chris Rock, seeing a healthy return of nearly $50 million on a budget of $8 million. The controversial film was developed by Warner Brothers, which was then run by Steve Ross. Ross was able to build up his business empire, Kinney National Company (which later became Warner), largely through his association with New York crime lords Manny Kimmel and Abner “Longy” Zwillman. Zwillman was a close associate of Meyer Lansky and Sam Bronfman. Ross, as a Warner executive, later frequented Robert Maxwell’s yacht in the late 1980s, a time when Maxwell was deeply associated with a litany of organized crime figures across the globe. In addition, top Warner executives close to Ross personally were convicted for their roles in a mob-tied racketeering scheme that was also allegedly involved Ross, though he somehow evaded charges. Considering his informal consultation on the film and the fact that Harrell had underwritten “new jack swing” — Uptown’s claim to fame and the genre from which the film took its name, which fused streetwise hip hop beats and melodic R&B for the first time — Harrell’s influence over the New Jack City production is clear. This is an important point, as it relates to mob-linked entertainment companies (in this case Warner Brothers) financing the glorification of drug dealing around 1991, a topic that we will return to in much greater detail near the end of this piece. While MCA undoubtedly dominated much of American entertainment for decades, it was also deeply connected to organized crime and political power. In terms of MCA’s political power, this arguably peaked under the Reagan administration, which boasted extremely close ties to the company. MCA even played a role in covert operations that brought together organized crime interests and intelligence agencies during this period. The most iconic executive in MCA’s history, Lew Wasserman, joined the company in 1936. By that point, Wasserman had established longstanding, close ties to Jewish mobster and Meyer Lansky-associate Moe Dalitz, having allegedly initiated those ties by having first served as the publicist for the Dalitz-controlled Mayfair Casino. However, some sources contend that Wasserman had joined Dalitz’s Mayfield Road Gang before working at the Mayfair. Wasserman later married the daughter of Dalitz’s long-time lawyer Henry Beckerman, who he had first met through his work at the casino. Wasserman and MCA were also the forces chiefly responsible for the political career of former president Ronald Reagan. Reagan, previously an actor before becoming a politician, had been represented by MCA since 1940. Soon after, he became Wasserman’s first “million dollar client.” Wasserman later engineered Reagan’s campaign to lead the Screen Actors Guild, where Reagan made significant policy changes designed to give MCA an edge over other entertainment companies. Wasserman and other top MCA executives, such as Taft Schreiber and Jules Stein, played an intimate role in Reagan’s successful gubernatorial bid, as well as financing his later campaign for president of the United States. When Reagan was president, his Attorney General Edwin Meese notably quashed what had been an ongoing investigation into MCA’s organized crime ties. Meese later resigned following his involvement in the Bronx-based Wedtech scandal (see end note vi). That probe was initiated when evidence was found that MCA was engaged in business relations with the Gambino crime family. More specifically, MCA had hired a high-ranking Gambino associate, Salvatore Pisello, as an official representative of the company, even though Pisello had no experience in the music or movie business. At the time Pisello was doing business with MCA, he was also simultaneously a partner of Morris Levy, the Genovese family-linked record executive behind Roulette Records who financed the early hip hop label Sugar Hill. Levy’s connection to Andre Harrell’s early employer WINS was noted earlier in this article. MCA kept Pisello around even though they lost money on every deal where Pisello had represented them and continued to work with him after his mob ties became publicly known. This was done at the behest of Wasserman, then chairman of the board of MCA, and Sidney Sheinberg, then president of MCA Inc., despite protests from other board members. One of the main MCA executives that had been closely involved with the company’s Pisello dealings, Irving Azoff, was subsequently promoted to become head of MCA’s Music Entertainment Division, the division that –– shortly thereafter –– entered into a distribution agreement with Andre Harrell’s Uptown Records. Azoff has long publicly praised Harrell and later eulogized him at his 2020 funeral. Irving Azoff was also Combs’ neighbor in the exclusive Beverly Hills enclave known as “Billionaires’ Row” up until Combs put the $60 million estate on the market in September 2024, not long after DHS raided the property. The shuttered federal investigation into MCA also turned up evidence that the company was tied to the Genovese crime family. As noted earlier, the Genovese crime family had also been linked to Morris Levy (Levy was also involved with some of Pisello’s dealings with MCA). In addition, during this same period, the mob-style murder of retail billionaire Leslie Wexner’s then-tax attorney, Arthur Shapiro, led Columbus police investigators to link both Shapiro’s death and Wexner himself to Genovese criminal interests. Shortly after Shapiro’s death, Jeffrey Epstein entered into Wexner’s inner circle, “tasked with getting [Wexner’s] finances in order.” MCA also has connections to a significant, yet largely forgotten scandal of the 1980s involving many of the same players from the Iran-Contra network, as well as figures like Robert Maxwell. The scandal, known as the PROMIS software scandal, saw operatives tied to US and Israeli intelligence team up with organized crime elements to both steal and then repurpose PROMIS –– a then-revolutionary software product for data management –– as a back-door surveillance system that was marketed to other intelligence agencies, sensitive government research laboratories, and a litany of banks around the globe. One of MCA’s top executives, Eugene Gianquinto, who then led MCA’s Home Entertainment Division, was intimately involved in major aspects of the scandal and its illegal activities. Gianquinto later took credit for the closure of the Department of Justice’s investigation into MCA’s mob ties. More specifically, MCA and Gianquinto were connected to the elements of the PROMIS scandal based within the mob-linked joint venture between the Cabazon Indian Reservation and the Wackenhut Corporation to develop weapon systems –– some of which were intended for the CIA-backed Nicaraguan Contras. Journalist Danny Casolaro, who died in connection with his efforts to expose the network ultimately behind the PROMIS scandal, had stated before his death that he was writing about a network he called “the Octopus,” which –– oddly enough –– was a longstanding nickname for MCA. Between 1994 and 1995, MCA was acquired by the Bronfman family company, Seagrams. A few years later, the Bronfmans also took control of Def Jam. The Bronfmans, like MCA itself, have an extensive history of organized crime connections, which date back to the mob-brokered bootlegging of American Prohibition in the 1920s. Wasserman, a long-time associate of Edgar Bronfman Sr., got a Seagrams board seat out of the deal and became chairman emeritus of the company. Edgar Bronfman Jr. quickly brought on Hollywood powerbroker Michael Ovitz, who later became president of Disney and a Jeffrey Epstein associate. Bronfman Jr. is also listed in Epstein’s black book and his father’s alleged ties to Epstein’s Bear Stearns career likely played a role in Epstein’s ouster from the bank in 1981. Ovitz, at the time he teamed up with Bronfman Jr., was close to Herbert Allen of Allen & Co, a company with ties to organized crime as well as the aforementioned PROMIS scandal. The Bronfmans, particularly Edgar Bronfman Jr., will feature prominently in Part II of this series, with Bronfman negotiating major deals with Combs in the early 2000s. In 1991, Edgar Jr.’s uncle, Charles Bronfman, teamed up with Leslie Wexner (then already very intimately tied to Epstein) in 1991 to create the “Study Group” or “Mega Group,” an ostensibly philanthropic organization that was chiefly focused on ethno-philanthropy and philanthropy directed at promoting Zionism and financing aspects of the state of Israel. Yet, this particular group brought together some of the most prominent corporate billionaires in the United States, the majority of whom share ties to organized crime. Wexner, as previously mentioned was tied to Genovese crime interests by Columbus police, while the Bronfmans’ own history with organized crime, specifically the Lansky-co-founded National Crime Syndicate, have been extensively documented. Other early members include other organized crime-linked families like the Crowns of Chicago (via Lester Crown) and Laurence Tisch, owner of CBS including its many influential record labels. The Tisch family, mentioned throughout this article, has ties to organized crime as well. For instance, Laurence Tisch engaged in a suspicious sale of his shares in the struggling Franklin National Bank to Michele Sindona, the Italian mafia-linked businessman who played a major role in Operation Gladio, which brought together the CIA, Italian Mafia and the Vatican. Sindona was also a member of the infamous Italian freemasonic lodge P2. In addition, the Tisch family company, Loews, did extensive business with Resorts International. For instance, Loews was the long-time operator of Resorts International-owned hotel Paradise Island Hotel and Villas in the Bahamas. Senate testimony later linked Paradise Island specifically to Meyer Lansky. Resorts International itself deserves an important mention as well, given that it started as Mary Carter Paint Company, a CIA front company founded by the Dulles brothers with extensive ties to Meyer Lansky and his associates, that focused on developing businesses in the Bahamas. After the death of the company’s long-time, mob-linked head James Crosby in 1986, Donald Trump took over the company, only to lose control of it two years later. Another member of this exclusive club, the “Mega Group,” was director Steven Spielberg. A protégé of Lew Wasserman and Sidney Sheinberg, Spielberg would later play an unusual role in king-making the future film career of director Brett Ratner, an associate of Russell Simmons, Andre Harrell, and Sean Combs who boasts of his childhood ties to Meyer Lansky and to the alleged heir to Lansky’s criminal enterprises, Al Malnik. Ratner’s significance is a focus of a later section of this piece. After becoming the A&R man at Harrell’s Uptown, Combs dropped out of Howard to pursue his dream. He then truly made a name for himself with his handling of the nascent careers of newcomers Mary J. Blige and Jodeci. His reworking of their sounds and re-styling of their images led to both debut records going multi-platinum. Combs’ success at Uptown, however, was marred by his role in planning events and parties that turned violent. In addition, more recent accusations of sexual violence, the filming of rapes and other crimes are alleged to have taken place during Combs’ later years at Uptown, making violence a noticeable and early theme in Combs’ early music industry career. In December 1991, the tragedy of the Community College of New York celebrity basketball game stampede, which Combs had helped plan, forced him and his mother to lay low, leading to them hiding out in a Manhattan hotel to avoid scrutiny amid rumors of possible criminal charges for Combs. The stampede ultimately left 9 dead. Combs had promoted this game as a charity event intended to raise funds for AIDS relief over the radio and through informal channels. The massive crowd, which had gathered to watch Heavy D (one of Uptown’s main artists) and LL Cool J (one of Def Jam’s first big acts) shoot hoops, ended up breaking into a fatal stampede. A report commissioned by the New York Mayor’s office condemned “almost all of the individuals involved in the event[, who] demonstrated a lack of responsibility” as well as NYPD officers in the scene, who were accused of “serious lapses in judgment.” The report blamed Combs in particular “for allowing two inexperienced subordinates to handle a potentially perilous event and for deceiving ticket buyers about [the event’s] charitable intent.” “City College is something I deal with every day of my life,” Combs later said in 1998. “But the things that I deal with can in no way measure up to the pain that the families deal with. I just pray for the families and pray for the children who lost their lives every day.” During this period, when Combs was still at Uptown, his penchant for throwing wild, and allegedly violent, parties continued. However, it soon merged with new scenes, particularly those of the music industry and the New York club scene. In his memoir Notorious C.O.P., the former head of the NYPD Rap Intelligence Unit Derrick Parker (a COINTELPRO legacy program that grew directly out of interagency cooperation & the BOSS unitxiv) writes of his first introduction to Combs: “Even before the CCNY disaster, well before he was a tabloid fixture, I became aware of Puffy [i.e. Sean Combs]. He was hard to miss as he gallivanted around early ’90s hip-hop clubs and up the ladder of the music industry, right from the bottom rung. At the time, Puffy was little known outside music biz circles: he wasn’t even a performer yet, but a rising A&R executive at Uptown Records who threw crazy, notoriously raucous parties at a midtown club called Red Zone. I knew about Puffy even then because I’d always kept one foot in the music world. I’d been promoting parties and hitting the clubs, as well as performing and recording demos as an R&B singer.”xv Red Zone was a short-lived Midtown club ensconced in a former ABC filming studio at 440 West 54th Street. “Club Kids” like Michael Alig, RuPaul, and others in the late 1980s and early 1990s were known to frequent the establishment. The establishment was first opened by Maurice Brahms, the uncrowned king of the NYC Club Scene, the former restaurateur and owner-operator of infamous, gay-catering nightlife discotheques such as Bonds, Infinity, & Underground. Brahms entered into business with his South African second cousin John Addison, a gay model who once dated Roy Cohn. Cohn was Donald Trump’s mentor who had close ties to the Reagan administration, as well as organized crime and sexual blackmail operations. Cohn was also closely linked to the Genovese and Gambino crime families, and represented their bosses, Tony Salerno and Paul Castellano, respectively. Maurice Brahms and John Addison’s former regulars, Steve Rubell and Ian Schrager (son of Lansky associate Louis “Max the Jew” Schrager, a Brooklyn gambling boss), went on to open a direct competitor — Studio 54. As fate would have it, John Addison had introduced the pair to Cohn, who would later become Studio 54’s lawyer. Addison’s introduction of Rubell and Schrager to Cohn set in motion a series of events that later led to Addison’s and Maurice Brahms’ incarceration. Schrager and Rubell approached Cohn for his help in blocking the opening of Brahms’ and Addison’s new club New York, New York in 1977. Cohn, in turn, enlisted then-Assistant District Attorney Peter Sudler and Special Agent Mark Britt from SDNY in a sting operation. Brahms’ and Addison’s establishment was raided under the auspices of perjured search warrants. This then led to raids at their respective homes. Agents reportedly illegally seized a ledger that showed that the pair had been skimming $1.3 million from the Infinity, the club where the cousins first encountered Schrager and Rubell (who subsequently also served prison time for similar crimes related to their nightclubs). Brahms and Addison were ultimately pressured into pleading guilty. Brahms was sentenced to 3 years in prison in NYC. Maurice Brahms’ final club was the aforementioned Red Zone, where Combs hosted his Uptown Record-era mixers. Given Combs’ association with these elements of the New York nightclub scene, the more recent revelation of Combs’ later bisexual “Freak Off” orgies becomes far less shocking. While his “Freak Off” parties are now notorious, the much earlier Combs-hosted events at Red Zone also developed quite a reputation. For instance, Combs promoted a recurrent party at the Red Zone called “Daddy’s House” that explicitly catered to a hip-hop audience. Apparently violence was so endemic and frequent at these events that Combs routinely had to interrupt the DJs to talk people down and, at one point, even wrote to everyone on his mailing list in an attempt to plead with them to leave the quarrels and weapons at home. Per reports, the violence continued unabated and Red Zone ultimately lost its liquor license following a shooting that occurred outside the venue. A fellow hip hop party promoter named Toi Sojer contradicted Combs’ claims that he was not responsible for any of the violence at these events, stating that, “Puffy’s parties are scary. I was always frightened when I went to Red Zone.” While throwing “scary” parties at venues with suspect owners, Combs is now alleged to have begun engaging in acts of sexual violence while at Uptown. Recent lawsuits additionally assert that other figures (and companies) tied to Uptown were directly related to those crimes. On November 23, 2023, just before the expiration of the NY State Adult Survivor’s Act (which created a window free of the statute of limitations during so that adult victims could pursue justice against their abusers), attorneys representing Liza Gardner filed a lawsuit alleging that, in 1990/1991, Combs and singer Aaron Hall took turns raping her and a friend after an MCA Records event in their corporate offices. The victim was allegedly only 16 years old at the time, while Combs was still working as a talent director at Uptown. Aaron Hall, like Combs, had significant ties to the Bronx, having grown up there, and was a member of the Uptown Records-signed band Guy with Teddy Riley, thus considered one of the architects of “new jack swing.” Further illustrating the ties between New Jack City and Uptown Records, Guy had a cameo as themselves in the film. Per the lawsuit, the alleged assault began one night when Combs and Hall were flirtatious and handsy with the reported victims at an MCA Records event. After the fete, the pair invited the two girls back to Hall’s apartment, where the men plied them with drinks and drugs before taking turns having sex with both friends. The lawsuit also alleges that Combs visited the home in which she and her friend were staying a few days after the incident. The visit allegedly turned violent, with Combs choking out Jane Doe, physically threatening her so as to impress upon her what might happen if she or her friend chose not to stay silent regarding their experience. It’s been speculated following the announcement of Gardner’s complaint that the lyrics to Aaron Hall’s song “Don’t Be Afraid”, released by MCA as one of the singles for the official soundtrack of Juice, may obliquely refer to the rape of Gardner. It was recently reported in the press that Aaron Hall is suddenly missing. According to Gardner and her attorney Tyrone Blackburn, they have exhausted all options as far as reaching Hall at his past known addresses, and will now have to resort to serving him summons via publication in newspapers of note. New evidence further suggests a culture of crime at Uptown and the label’s apparent enabling of Gardner’s mistreatment. Gardner recently amended her complaint after a sworn statement by the other woman who was reportedly raped at Hall’s New Jersey apartment (also a minor at the time) was entered. The unnamed woman claimed that DeVanté Swing, a member of the Uptown act Jodeci (whose career Combs was then managing) not only voyeuristically looked on as Gardner was raped by Combs, but that the two girls had been lured from North Carolina and were staying with Swing at his residence in NJ, which was allegedly “subsidized” by Uptown Records at the time. Swing was subsequently added to the lawsuit as a co-defendant. Furthermore, Swing’s alleged voyeurism of Gardner’s rape at the hands of Combs is in keeping with an abiding pattern of Combs’ sexual violence. Namely that, time and again, affiliates either watch his crimes, participate in them directly, or else view video footage of them after the fact. In Gardner’s filing, both MCA Records and Geffen Records are also named as co-defendants. David Geffen’s label had just been sold to MCA the same year that the assaults allegedly took place. Both Geffen and the now defunct MCA are owned by Universal Music Group (UMG) today, the major label crafted by the Bronfman family that is now overseen by Lucian Grainge, a former MCA and CBS Records executive. Both Lucian Grainge and UMG were initially named as co-defendants in Rodney Jones’ lawsuit against Sean Combs for enabling his sex trafficking activities. Also in November 2023, Joi Dickerson-Neal filed the second of three sexual assault lawsuits that targeted Combs in the span of that week. Dickerson-Neal had graced a music video opposite Combs in 1990. Dickerson-Neal has stated that her proximity to Combs in the video spurred a warning from Sister Soulja, who had told the young woman to keep her distance from Combs. Dickerson-Neal claims that she surrendered to Combs’ constant advances in 1991, reluctantly agreeing to a dinner date. She insisted, however, that they meet at Wells Restaurant in Harlem, her place of employment at the time, due to concerns about Combs, hoping that the presence of coworkers would help her feel more secure. In the filing, Dickerson-Neal contends that Combs spiked her beverage while she’d excused herself to the restroom. When they left the premises, she claims he forced her to take a hit from a blunt, and that the combined impacts of the drugging left her legs feeling “rubbery.” She alleges that Combs then drove her to a nearby “studio” (most likely affiliated with either Uptown/MCA) and then raped her at a residence in the neighborhood seemingly owned by an acquaintance of both individuals, during which he filmed her violation. Following these traumatic events, Jodeci singer DeVanté Swing allegedly revealed to the victim that Combs had filmed her rape and was playing the footage for everyone at the “studio” like some kind of perverse trophy. If true, this would mean that myriad Uptown employees saw this video. This is one of the earliest allegations that involves Combs and the non-consensual films of sexual assault and rape crimes. It also alludes to the possible collection of sexual blackmail compiled by Combs –– a pattern that would repeat in subsequent allegations in the lead up to his 2024 incarceration. Eventually, Andre Harrell felt Combs was getting too “cocky” in his position at Uptown and fired him in 1993. Nevertheless, the two remained friends, with Harrell becoming the godfather to Combs’ son Justin, who was born later that same year. Combs, shortly after leaving Uptown, created Bad Boy Records with Kirk Burrowes in 1993. Combs’ new label quickly entered into a distribution deal with Arista Records worth $15 million. Davis says he met Combs when Combs was 23 years old and that, soon after meeting, Davis “helped introduce [Combs] to the right music executives who could assist him in ushering in ‘the forthcoming Hip Hop revolution.’” Bad Boy Records’ prolonged success was ensured by its early deal with Arista (which later expanded into a joint venture) as well as the man who would become Combs’ second record mentor in the music industry, Arista’s founder and president Clive Davis. Davis’ Arista was originally founded as part of Columbia Pictures’ music label portfolio. At the time Arista entered into its joint venture with Combs’ Bad Boys, the label had been sold by Columbia Pictures to BMG, a German media company. However, Davis controlled Arista as if it were his own personal fiefdom until 2000, when he left the label due to BMG’s age restriction policy for executives. Bad Boy Records ended what had then become a joint venture with Arista a few years after Davis’ departure. Shortly thereafter, Bad Boy attached itself to Bronfman-controlled interests in the music industry, which will be revisited in Part II of this series. Clive Davis grew up in Crown Heights, the son of a middle-class Jewish electrician and salesman. He excelled at Erasmus Hall High School and was a member of the New York City branch of the National Honor Society dubbed Arista, which would later serve as inspiration for the name of his label at Columbia Pictures. His early academic success earned Davis a full scholarship to New York University. He then attended Harvard Law School, from which he graduated in 1956. Two years following his graduation, Davis joined “…the large, white-shoe firm, Rosenman, Colin, Kaye, Petschek, and Freund. Sam Rosenman was counsel to Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman; Ralph Colin’s clients included William Paley and CBS.”xvi Other notable clients of Rosenman & Colin LLP include two offshore banks owned by Bruce Rappaport that had served as “repositories of illicit funds from several illegal operations,” specifically related to drug trafficking. Rappaport, as noted in One Nation Under Blackmail, boasted close ties to the CIA, particularly via his close friend William Casey, as well as to Israeli intelligence and organized crime. Rappaport was particularly affiliated with organized crime networks that included Semion Mogilevich, an Eastern European mob boss who became a close business associate of Robert Maxwell in the late 1980s. Clive Davis’ storied career in the music industry began via his earlier career at Rosenman & Colin. While working at the firm (which –– as previously noted –– counted CBS as a client), Davis was hired to become assistant counsel of the CBS subsidiary, Columbia Records. He became the label’s general counsel a year later. Davis had been hired by Harvey Schein, a former colleague of Davis’ at Rosenman & Colin. Schien was a protégé of William Paley, the long-time head of CBS and “father of modern broadcasting.” Paley, the son of Ukrainian Jewish immigrants, had worked building up CBS into the main network of radio and main record label in the United States, having a profound effect on mass media and the shaping of Americans’ musical tastes and political perceptions. During World War II, Paley served in the Office of War Information, becoming Chief of Radio of the U.S. military’s Psychological Warfare Division. Paley developed a very close relationship with scions of the Rockefeller dynasty, David and Nelson, as well as others close to the Rockefellers, like former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. David Rockefeller and Kissinger both later eulogized Paley at his funeral in 1990, with Kissinger also serving as the chairman of Paley’s foundation. In the mid-1980s, Paley personally ensured that Laurence Tisch would take over CBS (including its record labels). As noted earlier in this piece, Tisch, in 1991, served as a founding member of the so-called “Mega Group” alongside Leslie Wexner, Charles and Edgar Bronfman and Lew Wasserman protégé Steven Spielberg, among others. Clive Davis’ infamous and undeniably “revolutionary” tenure as President of CBS Records (1967-1973) is most aptly characterized by the transition from the jazz, folk, and pop ethos of the 1950s to the industry-wide embrace of rock in the 1970s. Somewhat akin to the careers of Andre Harrell or Combs, he was a relatively young label executive well-placed to take advantage of shifting cultural trends, effectively making his name synonymous with an emergent genre for a time. In Davis’s self-hagiographizing, he had an epiphany at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival and became determined to pivot to rock music. “I sensed change. I don’t know, even now, how I knew”.xvii Of course, this was an exaggeration, as rock had already been dominating the singles charts for more than a decade. Davis’ legacy in this period as it relates to rock music was essentially ensured after he poached an assembly of Monterey acts from their minor labels along with those who were still languishing in obscurity.xviii During his tenure at Columbia Records, Davis managed and/or signed Bob Dylan, Janis Joplin, The Electric Flag, Santana, Bruce Springsteen, Billy Joel, Chicago, Loggins & Messina, Aerosmith, Earth Wind & Fire, and the Grateful Dead. While Davis had been successful at CBS, he left the company under a cloud of scandal. Davis became a focus of an investigation led by the US Attorney’s Office in Newark, a probe that would later become known as Project Sound. As part of the investigation, “allegations began to surface in the press that CBS Records had bribed black radio stations and done business with an organized crime figure.” The scandal ultimately led to Clive Davis’ decision to make a deal in 1971 with two record producers tied to Motown Records, Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff.xix Davis had sought out Gamble and Huff due to a desire to “conquer the R&B charts.” As part of the negotiations, Davis allowed Gamble’s and Huff’s company to promote the music that, per the deal, was produced and distributed by CBS. Perhaps unknown to Davis at the time, Gamble’s and Huff’s company and its promotional efforts engaged in the practice of payola, the illegal practice whereby firms pay radio stations to play singles without disclosing that payments were made. CBS was implicated in the arrangement through David Wynshaw, Clive Davis’ closest aide at CBS.xx Press reports soon stated that CBS music subsidiaries were being investigated for bribing radio stations, not just with money, but also drugs and sex, in order “to increase use of its products on black-oriented radio stations.” CBS, in connection with the Project Sound probe, uncovered that Davis had left a “trail of phony invoices” totaling at least $94,000 over six years that were meant to cover up Davis’ use of funds for personal parties and renovations to his properties.xxi Davis was ultimately fired by CBS as a result. Soon, the CBS “payola” scandal took on a darker hue. In February 1972, a few days after Davis had been fired from CBS, eight people were indicted in Newark on conspiracy and smuggling charges connected to a “multimillion dollar heroin ring operating in Italy, Canada, and the United States.” The connective tissue between CBS and this drug bust soon became apparent. A woman, recently fired from CBS for being “doped up” at work, had been indicted after working for a food stand that doubled as a front for the heroin ring in question. Patsy Falcone, aka Pasquale Falconio, an associate of the Genovese crime family, had also been indicted. Investigators found that Falcone also had a tie to CBS by way of his “friendship” with Davis’ protege David Wynshaw as well as via Frank Campana, a former CBS A&R man with whom Falcone had started a management company. Falcone and Campana’s company managed several acts signed to CBS. Investigators later stated that Davis’ name had been mentioned by Falcone in bugged telephone conversations and that evidence found on Falcone had listed Wynshaw as a “source for prostitutes.” Documents incriminating Wynshaw were reportedly found on Falcone at the time of his arrest. It was later reported that, “with the help of Dave Wynshaw, Falcone bilked CBS Records. The two men set up sham companies in… New Jersey… CBS unwittingly paid more than $75,000 to these nonexistent operations.”xxii Wynshaw figured prominently into Davis’ downfall as it was Wynshaw who had both helped facilitate the money funneled to Falcone and who had written up false invoices that obscured the payments that Davis had used for personal enrichment. It was also believed that Wynshaw’s role involved laundering money that was used for “off-the-record” items, like procuring drugs and prostitutes for CBS parties, conferences, & artists, leading him to be colloquially known as “Clive’s pimp” at the label. As a Rolling Stone article from the period speculated based on industry rumors at the time, Davis’ unceremonious firing by CBS over personal enrichment and embezzlement of funds (of $94,000, then deemed paltry by industry insiders) may have been a strategic attempt to get ahead of the larger “Drugola” scandal and the possibility that federal investigators might pursue charges against Davis, his trusted aide Wynshaw, and others at the company. Despite the scandal, Davis quickly found his way back into the industry. A little over a year after having been fired from CBS/Columbia, in the summer of 1974, Davis was hired as a consultant for Bell Records, “a barely profitable subsidiary of Columbia Pictures (no corporate relation to CBS).” According to a 1977 New York Times article, “Davis’s consulting took the form of letting go most of [Bell’s] performers and the executives who had signed them, retaining only a handful as the basis for a renamed company, Arista, with himself in the president’s chair.” Arista’s formation and success relied heavily on Alan Hirschfield, a major entertainment executive who had recently become CEO of Columbia Pictures. Hirschfield was instrumental in bringing Davis on as a consultant for Bell and who supported Davis’ formation of Arista. Davis, as well as Hirschfield’s family, have framed Hirschfield as having essentially co-founded the label with Davis. Hirschfield had found himself serving in the top post in Columbia Pictures thanks to the same connection that saw him become at top executive at other entertainment conglomerates, like Fox and Warner Brothers. That connection was to Allen & Company, as Hirschfield’s father Norman was a close friend and associate of Charles and Herbert Allen, the founders of the company. Norman Hirschfield also worked for Allen & Co., particularly in its natural gas division and also in scouting other “business opportunities” for the firm. Later, in the 1970s and 1980s, when Allen & Co. took a stake in a major entertainment firm, Columbia included, they ensured their interests were represented through the installation of Norman’s son, Alan Hirschfield, in a top executive post. Charles and Herbert Allen and their firm Allen & Co. have documented ties to intelligence-linked figures and scandals, as well as organized crime. As noted in One Nation Under Blackmail, the Allen brothers had significant organized crime connections, particularly via companies based in the Bahamas that were run and developed by close associates of Jewish mobster and co-founder of the National Crime Syndicate, Meyer Lansky. In addition, Allen & Co. was a client of the CIA-linked David Baird Foundation and Charles and Allen and David Baird had several dealings with an associate of mob boss Moe Dalitz and Alexander Guterma, who was a key part of the United Dye scandal that had also ensnared figures like Roy Cohn. Allen & Co. also financed Earl Brian’s efforts to buy out Inslaw Inc. as part of the PROMIS scandal (discussed in greater detail shortly) and had other close business ties to Brian, including being significant shareholders in Brian’s company Hadron. The Allen brothers also had significant ties to Leslie Wexner’s mentors, Max Fisher and Alfred Taubman. Taubman had been close to the Allens since the 1950s. For Fisher, the connection was forged at the time he was heading up United Brands, the CIA-linked company that Fisher took over the same year that its former top executive, Eli Black, suspiciously fell to his death from the 44th floor of the Pan Am building in Manhattan. Black was the father of Leon Black, the Drexel Burnham Lambert executive who would later found Apollo Global Management and become a very close and now notorious associate of Jeffrey Epstein. While still at United Brands, Fisher joined Taubman and the Allen brothers in a joint venture that culminated in the takeover of the Irvine Ranch in California. The overlap doesn’t end there. Columbia Pictures’ Alan Hirschfield was a close associate of lawyer Allen Tessler and served alongside Tessler as a top executive at Data Broadcasting Corporation. Tessler was the family lawyer for the organized crime-linked Gouletas family and their real estate empire. Tessler also later joined the board of Leslie Wexner’s The Limited in 1987. Evangeline Gouletas shared an office space with Epstein during this time, which also coincides with the development of the close-knit relationship between Wexner and Epstein. Another key client of Tessler’s was the aforementioned Earl Brian, who had close ties to Allen & Co. and was one of the masterminds of the PROMIS scandal that involved MCA, organized crime, US intelligence and Israeli intelligence (with Robert Maxwell facilitating aspects of the scheme on behalf of Israel). Tessler’s law firm, Shea & Gould, also represented organized crime clients like Carmine de Sapio, a close friend of Roy Cohn’s, and also had significant connections to William Casey, Reagan’s CIA director. Tessler, who was chairman of Wexner’s The Limited’s Finance Committee by 1990, came into direct contact with Epstein some time around this period as well. Tessler appears in Epstein’s infamous “black book” with two addresses and four different phone numbers listed. Among the numbers listed is Tessler’s line at Data Broadcasting, where he and Hirschfield worked side-by-side. The company had been acquired by Earl Brian’s firm Infotechnology in 1987. In other words, Clive Davis’ ascent to become a major music executive was aided largely by figures tied to same clandestine network composed of intelligence-linked and organized crime elements that also forms the basis for the network that would also later figure prominently in the rise of Jeffrey Epstein. This is also evident in Davis’ close friendship with the family of the Mega Group’s Laurence Tisch, particularly his nephew Jonathan who took over the family business Loews Corp in 1989. This connection later led Davis to donate several million to the Tisch School of the Arts at NYU, producing the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music under the Tisch School umbrella. It is also notable that the “drugola” scandal linked to Davis had ties specifically to the Genovese crime family, an organized crime network also linked to MCA, Morris Levy, Roy Cohn and Leslie Wexner, as noted earlier in this piece. After the scandal around Combs began to break, Clive Davis, as well as Andre Harrell of Uptown and Russell Simmons of Def Jam/Rush Management, have been accused of propelling Combs into the patterns of criminal behavior for which he is now infamous. For instance, one-time rival (and former friend of Combs) Suge Knight has claimed that Davis, Harrell and Simmons used “alcohol, drugs” – specifically cocaine – to “compromise” Combs’ “manhood.” This is particularly significant in the case of Davis’ ties to the “Drugola” scandal, which involved using sex, drugs and bribes to specifically target “black-oriented radio stations” and music. Claims similar to those made by Knight have since been echoed by Combs’ former bodyguard Gene Deal. It is worth noting here that Davis’ protégé L.A. Reid, who took over Arista Records from Davis, has also been accused of sexual misconduct and assault. Reid, alongside Combs, were both instrumental in the success of recording artists Justin Bieber and Usher. Knight has argued that Davis, Simmons and Harrell first “compromised” Combs and then Combs went on to use alcohol, drugs, and gay sex to “control” younger artists like Usher and Bieber. Notably, Combs’ entry into the world of Andre Harell, Simmons and, shortly thereafter, Clive Davis, coincides with the development of his obsessive drive to record everything, presumably for blackmail-related purposes. For instance, music video director Cole Bennett asserted that Combs told him that he’d begun recording “footage of everything” in 1992 and even advised Bennett to do the same. In addition, Kirk Burrowes, the co-founder of Bad Boy Records with Combs, has claimed that Combs sought to compromise him using this same method. Burrowes has filed a lawsuit against Combs, claiming Combs subjected him to “repeated sexual harassment, physical aggression and forced compliance with degrading sexual acts” throughout the 1990s. Burrowes claims that Combs targeted him with “unwanted sexual advances” including acts of “nudity, sexual overtones, voyeurism and acts of exhibitionism,” some of which allegedly took place during business meetings, and that this was part of a larger “campaign of control.” The outcome of this campaign, per Burrowes, was the use of “physical violence, blackmail, career sabotage and financial extortion” to force Burrowes out of his 25% stake in Bad Boy Records. Though Davis was a key part of the early creation and formation of Bad Boy Records, he is not named in Burrowes’ suit. However, Combs may have been “controlled” in a similar way by Davis, per some sources. Suge Knight, for instance, has alleged that he was told by the former head of Interscope Records, Jimmy Iovine, that Combs had regularly engaged in sexual acts with Davis, suggesting that his relationship with Davis and Davis’ early, crucial involvement with Bad Boy were built on the back of sexual favors. This is certainly possible given the well-known mechanism within the entertainment industry of sexual favors as a way to secure lucrative roles and deals –– e.g. the Harvey Weinstein scandal. In addition, Davis notably came out publicly as bisexual in a memoir published when he was 80 years old, where he writes that he began to openly engage in sex with the same gender in the 1980s. Combs’ alleged bisexuality has been a major topic of discussion in relation to the scandal leading up to his arrest last year. Knight has also claimed that Russell Simmons and Andre Harrell had also engaged in similar behavior with each other. Notably, the network behind Clive Davis, which overlaps with that behind Epstein, also involved similar “sugar daddy”-style relationships. These include rumors that Epstein and his long-time benefactor Leslie Wexner were intimate, e.g. former State of Ohio Inspector General David Sturtz telling journalist Bob Fitrakis that Epstein was Wexner’s “boyfriend.” Given that Russell Simmons is one of the men alleged to have mentored Combs in this type of criminal behavior, it is worth taking a look also at some of the recent allegations that have been made against Simmons and some of his associates, who – like Simmons – also boasted close ties to Combs. Beginning in 2017, Russell Simmons was hit with a slew of rape and sexual harassment lawsuits and accusations. One of Simmons’ earliest accusers, model Keri Claussen Khalighi, alleged that Simmons raped her in full view of the director Brett Ratner in 1991. Before the 2017 allegations, police had previously probed Simmons and Ratner for claims of jointly engaging in sexual battery back in 2001. Over a dozen women have since accused Simmons of sexual misconduct or crimes, while Ratner himself has been separately accused of similar crimes, including rape, by at least 10 women. Following the barrage of accusations, Simmons has laid low in Bali, Indonesia, embracing life as a “stateless” US citizen in a bid to evade the court’s jurisdiction. As will be explained in greater detail shortly, Ratner fled to Israel but is now planning a comeback, currying favor with the Trump family to that effect. Ratner is a long-time close associate of Simmons, with some reports calling Ratner a “protégé” of Simmons. Simmons is credited with helping start Ratner’s career, as the two met while Ratner was still in film school (NYU’s Tisch School) and Ratner began filming music videos for Simmons-managed artists like Public Enemy soon after their meeting. Ratner also filmed a music video for Combs’ longtime associate Heavy D, who had first gotten Combs his internship at Uptown, in 1994. Getty images alone hosts hundreds of photographs of Ratner and Simmons partying together over the years. Ratner, like Simmons, was also a very close associate of Combs, bringing Combs as his guest to several premieres of his films. Ratner was also a frequent attendee of numerous Combs-hosted parties as well as charity fundraisers. They also arrived together at prominent award shows and Ratner also filmed music videos for Combs, such as his 2001 single “Diddy.” Combs selected Brett Ratner and Ron Burkle, among others, to be his guests of honor when he delivered a commencement address to his alma mater Howard University in 2014. Ratner’s close association with both Simmons and Combs is notable for a few reasons. First, there is the fact that Ratner, as previously mentioned, was accused by several actresses of sexual misconduct, resulting in him being dropped from his agency and the “canceling” of his Hollywood career. In addition, Ratner took over directing the X-Men series from Bryan Singer, with whom Ratner is reportedly close. Singer has been accused of pedophilia and sordid affiliations with the Digital Entertainment Network (DEN), which was run by pedophile Marc Collins-Rector and also involved child star turned crypto mogul Brock Piece. (For Unlimited Hangout’s past reporting on DEN and Pierce, see here) Second, there is the man that Ratner considers his father –– Alvin Malnik. The feeling is apparently mutual, with Malnik referring to Ratner as one of his sons. The close-knit tie is telling as Malnik has very significant organized crime ties, particularly to Meyer Lansky. Not only that, but according to a Forbes investigation cited by the LA Times, Malnik “invented the black art of money-laundering, taking mob money and routing it to legitimate ventures.” Forbes wrote that: In the 1960s, Miami lawyer Alvin Malnik set up the Bank of Commerce in the Bahamas. Mob money flowed into its secret numbered accounts by the hundreds of millions–[mob financier Meyer] Lansky money, most of it–and then out again into Tibor Rosenbaum’s International Credit Bank of Switzerland before returning to the United States for investment. For those familiar with One Nation Under Blackmail, both Lansky and Rosenbaum also had significant ties to the Israeli intelligence apparatus, especially Rosenbaum who helped finance keys aspects of Israeli intelligence, including via the means that Malnik reportedly helped to develop. In addition, Malnik’s other ties to Lansky were considerable. For instance, Malnik had previously been banned from working in New Jersey casinos due to state regulators confirming his ties to Lansky and Sam Cohen, another mobster. Malnik had even been named Lansky’s “heir apparent” by Reader’s Digest upon Lansky’s 1983 death, while the Miami News noted that Lansky had wanted Malnik to take over all of his “legitimate enterprises” after this death. That article also cited federal agents that claimed that Malnik also stood to inherit “Lansky’s lucrative gambling, pornography, prostitution, labor racketeering and extortion operations.” Malnik also had a close association with Joel Steinger, a notorious fraud that operated a massive Ponzi scheme targeting the elderly and terminally ill. Steinger, like Malnik, had developed close ties to Lansky personally by the 1970s and married the daughter of a Miami banker alleged to be a close Lansky associate. In addition, Malnik was involved in strange ways with Michael Jackson in his later years. As noted previously, billionaire Ron Burkle ––- who also cultivated close ties to Bill Clinton and Jeffrey Epstein, along with Combs himself –– had significant connections to Jackson during this same period. The Malnik-Burkle-Jackson connection, as well as Burkle’s significant ties to both Epstein and Combs, will be covered in Part II of this series. Malnik’s own “protégé,” his adopted son Brett Ratner, claims to have also fostered a close relationship early on with Meyer Lansky himself. In a 2011 interview, Ratner stated the following: “I grew up on Miami Beach. I lived on Collins Avenue at the Carriage House on 54th Street. And two doors down was the Imperial House where every day after school I would ride my bike and I would walk down the street with an old man who would walk his dog. We would walk together and everyone at the store would kiss my ass when I was with him. He would take me to this restaurant called the Villa Capri and everybody was always treating me so nice. I didn’t realize it until I was in line at the supermarket with my mom and I opened up Rolling Stone and I saw his picture on the back. It was Meyer Lansky’s obituary. Everybody thought it was weird because he was 80 and I was 12. He was the biggest gangster in the world and he was like my best friend as a kid.” While some may discount this claim as fantasy on Ratner’s part, his close ties to Malnik –– Lanksy’s “heir” –– during the same period of his alleged association with Lansky lends the story credence. In addition, it is worth noting that Ratner’s “big break” that allowed him to become a famous director came somewhat unexpectedly in his “mediocre” film school career via Steven Spielberg. As previously noted, Spielberg was a protégé of Wasserman and Schienberg of MCA, a company with significant mob (and intelligence) affiliations, while Wasserman himself was connected to Lansky’s network via his long-time tie to Lansky associate Moe Dalitz. Spielberg is also a reported member of the previously mentioned “Mega Group” that unites Spielberg with organized crime-linked oligarchs like Epstein’s main benefactor Leslie Wexner, among others. Ratner would later follow the Lansky model of evading charges and scrutiny for illegal activities by immigrating to Israel. After he was accused of extreme sexual misconduct, including alongside Simmons, Ratner fled to Israel. A week before his escape, Ratner had been Benjamin Netanyahu’s special guest, along with former Epstein defense lawyer Alan Dershowitz, at the United Nations. Articles on Ratner’s trip to the UN with Netanyahu noted that Ratner is a former close business associate of Australian media tycoon James Packer, who has been closely linked to Netanyahu. Packer’s business venture with Ratner, RatPac Entertainment was notably partnered for several years with Dune Entertainment, the film business of Trump’s former Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. Mnuchin left the venture shortly after joining the first Trump administration, which coincided with many of the accusations against Ratner being made public, crippling the firm’s once meteoric rise. Packer, for his part, was a key part of the corruption trial that continues to dog current Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but has taken a backseat following the onset of the Israel-Gaza War in October 2023. Packer’s ties to both Netanyahu as well as former Mossad chief Yossi Cohen were deemed so extensive that they were considered a “national risk” in court testimony. Packer also once threatened to “sic” Mossad operatives on businessmen and was seeking to form a cybersecurity venture with Mossad-linked individuals around the same time he created RatPac with Brett Ratner. In addition, Packer was known to have partied with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, including on the yacht of Australian trucking magnate Lindsay Fox in 1995 when Epstein and Maxwell were the “guests of honour” on the cruise. Furthermore, Packer has also come under scrutiny for his ties to Stanley Ho, a casino magnate with ties to Chinese organized crime and to the Clinton-era scandal “Chinagate,” which also involved Epstein. As it relates to Epstein, a star in many of Ratner’s films with close social ties to the director, Chris Tucker, would later find himself on infamous Epstein-brokered plane trips alongside Bill Clinton and Kevin Spacey. The Combs-Simmons-Ratner clique have a history of cultivating ties to Donald Trump. For instance, one image photographed by Getty shows Ratner on stage with Combs at Russell Simmon’s “Art for Life Palm Beach” event honoring Combs in 2005. The event was hosted at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago and attended by the Trumps. The Trumps also attended some premieres of Ratner’s films. Trump became closely associated with Combs beginning in the 1990s. While those ties will be discussed in detail in Part II of this series, it is worth noting that First Lady Melania Trump has teamed up with the self-exiled Ratner, who is now directing a documentary about her life that is due to launch on Amazon Prime later this year. The First Lady is an executive producer of the film, which began production shortly after her husband’s 2024 election win. In addition, according to New York magazine, Ratner was recently seen visiting Mar-a-Lago along with the aforementioned James Packer, where they were photographed dining with Trump and Elon Musk earlier this year. A month later, it was reported that Packer bought a Trump-owned property neighboring both Mar-a-Lago’s private club and the Trump estate there. The property was previously used by close Trump associates visiting Mar-a-Lago and by the Secret Service during his first presidential term. Ratner has reportedly been involved in “fanning” the closeness between Trump and Packer that resulted in the property sale. Notably, Packer had previously bought a property neighboring another state leader, Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu, back in 2016. In addition, Ratner and the Trump family, as well as Russell Simmons, were among the guests invited to the wedding of Al Malnik’s son, Jarod Malnik, in early 2024. Ultimately, in tracing the network in which Combs had become deeply enmeshed by the early and mid-1990s, we are left with deep connections to intelligence-linked elements of organized crime. This same network of organized criminals also played a key part in enabling the activities of sex criminal and intelligence asset Jeffrey Epstein, from at least the 1970s onward, as detailed in the book One Nation Under Blackmail. With such connections established, the question then becomes –– what did this group seek in someone like Sean Combs, and more broadly, in exerting its influence over the entertainment industry and specifically African-American music? While speculative, it appears that various connections leading back to MCA and its influence can help us arrive at one unsettling possibility. During this period, not only was MCA a dominant force in entertainment (and early hip-hop specifically), but Laurence Tisch –– through his 1985 takeover of CBS –– controlled another key branch of the music industry through 1995. With the Bronfmans taking over MCA, and later Def Jam and Warner Music (as will be noted in Part II), the influence of the so-called “Mega Group” billionaires over the music industry became extremely significant during the 1990s. With Combs teaming up with Clive Davis, with significant ties to this same network, to form his own label Bad Boy Records in 1995, this tiny group of billionaires had the ability to shape hip-hop, the cultural engine of the African-American community, in major ways. The same year that the Bronfman and Tisch clans formally joined forces with Leslie Wexner and others like MCA-linked Steven Spielberg via the “Mega Group,” American record labels had allegedly begun to conspire to promote crime in hip-hop lyrics with the ostensible goal of facilitating the filling of private prisons, as those that ran the record labels were allegedly deeply connected to private prison firms. An account from an anonymous industry insider details how, in 1991, he was invited to a clandestine meeting where he was forced to sign a non-disclosure agreement. He recounted the events of that meeting as follows: Quickly after the meeting began, one of my industry colleagues (who shall remain nameless like everyone else) thanked us for attending. He then gave the floor to a man who only introduced himself by his first name and gave no further details about his personal background. I think he was the owner of the residence but it was never confirmed. He briefly praised all of us for the success we had achieved in our industry and congratulated us for being selected as part of this small group of “decision-makers”. At this point, I begin to feel slightly uncomfortable at the strangeness of this gathering. The subject quickly changed as the speaker went on to tell us that the respective companies we represented had invested in a very profitable industry which could become even more rewarding with our active involvement. He explained that the companies we work for had invested millions into the building of privately owned prisons and that our positions of influence in the music industry would actually impact the profitability of these investments. I remember many of us in the group immediately looking at each other in confusion. At the time, I didn’t know what a private prison was but I wasn’t the only one. Sure enough, someone asked what these prisons were and what any of this had to do with us. We were told that these prisons were built by privately-owned companies that received funding from the government based on the number of inmates. The more inmates, the more money the government would pay these prisons. It was also made clear to us that since these prisons are privately owned, as they become publicly traded, we’d be able to buy shares. Most of us were taken back by this. Again, a couple of people asked what this had to do with us. At this point, my industry colleague who had first opened the meeting took the floor again and answered our questions. He told us that since our employers had become silent investors in this prison business, it was now in their interest to make sure that these prisons remained filled. Our job would be to help make this happen by marketing music that promotes criminal behavior, rap being the music of choice. He assured us that this would be a great situation for us because rap music was becoming an increasingly profitable market for our companies, and as employees, we’d also be able to buy personal stocks in these prisons. Immediately, silence came over the room. You could have heard a pin drop. While efforts have been made over the years to dismiss this account as fantasy and/or conspiracy (despite it being deemed credible and promoted by prominent figures in hip-hop), other accounts from this period suggests that it should not be so easily discounted. For instance, Portia Maultsby, Professor Emerita of Folklore and Ethnomusicology at Indiana University, has been quoted as stating that: In the early 1990s, a former graduate student, then keyboardist for Stevie Wonder, called me upset that some record labels were actively recruiting Black men with criminal records to record rap. He believed that they were encouraging criminal acts among this group. In addition, prominent rappers have claimed, from the 1990s onward, that the music industry is financially entangled with the private prison industry and encourages “criminal behavior” through hip-hop due to those entanglements. While some outlets have noted that private prison companies and record labels share major index managers like Vanguard among their top shareholders, the ties between the two industries are significantly deeper and directly involve organizations mentioned throughout this article. Clinton, not unlike Ronald Reagan, was very “under the thumb” of MCA’s Lew Wasserman. Wasserman began backing Clinton’s presidential campaigns in 1992, but had first met Clinton back when he was governor of Arkansas, where his administration notoriously enabled illicit Iran-Contra-linked activities. Lew Wasserman would later broker the close ties between Clinton and his grandson, Casey Wasserman (who like Clinton, was an Epstein associate). This led to the Wasserman Foundation becoming one of the main donors to the controversial Clinton Foundation. Wasserman, as well as his protégé Steven Spielberg, were major donors to Clinton’s 1996 re-election campaign, so much so that it earned them overnight stays in the White House’s Lincoln bedroom. In addition, other Mega Group figures like Edgar Bronfman were also major donors to Clinton. Bronfman and Wasserman both received the Presidential Medal of Freedom during Clinton’s presidencies. Notably, companies tied to Bronfman and Wasserman, i.e. MCA/Universal, played a major role in lobbying for the passage of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, which Clinton signed into law and which allowed extreme industry consolidation and the formation of de facto monopolies in entertainment and beyond. A few years earlier, in 1994, Bill Clinton had signed a controversial crime bill which enacted several “funding incentives blamed for driving mass incarceration.” Though mass incarceration existed before the 1994 crime bill (largely beginning in the administration of the MCA-controlled Ronald Reagan), that bill is blamed with exacerbating the crisis, which has disproportionately impacted the African-American community and benefited two companies in particular. Those two companies were the biggest private prison companies in the United States at the time, and they still are today. One was the Corrections Corporation of America (CCA), now known as CoreCivic, while the other was Geo Group, formerly Wackenhut Corrections Corporation (WCC). Notably, WCC’s IPO took place the same year as the passage of the crime bill, 1994, which notably coincides with the account of the 1991 clandestine meeting where it was claimed that the private prison companies would go public once the music industry had began to promote violence and crime in hip-hop lyrics for the benefit of private prison companies like Wackenhut. WCC was formed in 1984 as a subsidiary of the Wackenhut Corporation. WCC’s parent company, Wackenhut, developed significant ties to MCA during the 1980s. As detailed earlier, Wackenhut had entered into a joint venture with the Cabazon Reservation to covertly develop weapon systems for CIA-backed paramilitaries that also repurposed the PROMIS software for espionage purposes. Top MCA executive Eugene Gianquinto was directly involved with companies that later joined the Cabazon-Wackenhut operation and later took credit for quashing the federal investigation into MCA’s mob ties. In addition, Allen & Company and Earl Brian, who were connected with the PROMIS scandal, were also significantly tied to Alan Hirschfield, who is said to have co-founded Arista Records with Clive Davis, which spawned Combs’ Bad Boy Records in 1993. Evidence of MCA’s close ties to the CIA, beyond those indicated by the PROMIS scandal, were noted by Lew Wasserman biographer Dennis McDougal. McDougal received a response from the CIA, in response to a FOIA request, “that seventeen separate computer searches revealed MCA did work with the CIA. The CIA refused to release any of its MCA documents on grounds that it might endanger national security.” Melanie Carlson, writing for Covert Action Magazine, also thoroughly detailed MCA’s ties to the mob, the CIA, the PROMIS scandal and the death of journalist Danny Casolaro in a 2024 investigation. Like MCA, Wackenhut also had ties to the CIA. Between that point and the passage of the 1994 crime bill, figures like Frank Carlucci and Bobby Ray Inman, both former CIA deputy directors, served on Wackenhut’s board. Carlucci also had unusual connections to the network around Robert Booth Nichols, the organized crime-linked figure who had brought together Wackenhut, the Cabazon Indian reservation and MCA as part of the PROMIS scandal. In addition, before becoming Reagan’s CIA director William Casey, one of the October Surprise/Iran-Contra architects, had been Wackenhut’s outside legal counsel. In 1992, two years before the Clinton crime bill was passed, SPY Magazine reported on extensive ties between Wackenhut and the CIA, citing CIA operatives and former Wackenhut executives who noted that Wackenhut allowed the CIA to use its offices as fronts for its activities. The SPY investigation also noted how many of the figures who connected Wackenhut to the CIA were also key cogs in the Iran-Contra affair, which is also indicated by Wackenhut’s role in the PROMIS scandal. This is significant as some of those same figures tied directly to the CIA-Wackenhut connection, like Richard Secord, were also tied to Leslie Wexner and Jeffrey Epstein’s efforts to relocate the Iran-Contra airline of infamy, the CIA-linked Southern Air transport, to Columbus, OH for the express benefit of Wexner and his clothing empire. After Wexner and Epstein’s efforts were successful, the airline’s main flights were between Columbus and Hong Kong. As noted in One Nation Under Blackmail, that effort, which also coincides with Epstein’s most of his 17 visits to the Clinton White House, was explicitly considered by some Ohio law enforcement officials to be tied to clandestine and criminal activities, most likely arms trafficking given Epstein’s background in covert arms trafficking networks in the 1980s. In addition, Epstein’s main contact at the White House during that time, Mark Middleton, was a central part of the “Chinagate” scandal, one major aspect of which involved the smuggling of cheap Chinese weapons into American urban areas after Chinese gun imports were banned early on in the Clinton administration. Prior to that ban, the US had been China’s top market for guns. A significant cache of weapons being smuggled by this network into Oakland, CA was intercepted by the FBI in what is now remembered as Operation Dragon Fire, which was – at that point – the largest seizure of illegal automatic assault weapons in US history. The main individuals behind the illicit gun smuggling were tipped off and managed to flee the US prior to the FBI’s planned sting operation. However, the main company involved – China’s Norinco – had notable ties, not just to the “Chinagate” scandal itself, but also to Epstein’s former mentor and weapons dealer, Douglas Leese. The company was also allegedly involved with past arms deals that had involved both Leese and Epstein. In addition, when Clinton was serving as governor of Arkansas, he had significant connections to Iran-Contra-linked arms and drug trafficking, meaning he had a prior, documented history of enabling illicit arms smuggling operations while in public office and just prior to becoming US president. At the same time that Wackenhut and CIA-connected figures were apparently helping repurpose Iran-Contra assets for the sake of flooding the US black market with cheap yet illicit weapons, the same network was also littering US urban areas with drugs, specifically crack cocaine. As reported by the late Gary Webb in his iconic Dark Alliance series (and subsequent book of the same name), a massive drug ring in California was peddling crack cocaine specifically to Latino and African-American urban communities during the 1990s, with millions in profits being used to finance CIA-backed paramilitary groups in Nicaragua. It was argued at the time that this represented a continuation of the Iran-Contra nexus that came under scrutiny in the 1980s and the CIA’s clandestine efforts to finance the Nicaraguan “Contras” through illicit means. After Webb’s Dark Alliance series concluded, the outlet that had run it –– the San Jose Mercury News –– published an editorial noting that Webb’s work “can only feed longstanding rumors in black communities that the U.S. government ‘created’ the crack cocaine epidemic to kill and imprison African-Americans and otherwise wreak havoc in inner cities.” Central to the CIA-Contra-Crack Cocaine nexus were Nicaraguan asset and eventual DEA informant Oscar Danilo Blandón, one of the largest importers and suppliers of cocaine at the height of the crack epidemic, and his one-time business partner Freeway Ricky Ross, who hailed from Compton and who grew to operate an interstate crack ring that helped launder and finance the covert war on the Nicaraguan Sandinistas. In 1991, during one of his prison stints, Freeway Ricky Ross was cellmates with one of the other top crack dealers in Los Angeles, Michael “Harry O” Harris. As investigative researcher John Potash details in The FBI War on Tupac Shakur, Gary Webb asserted that Ross was effectively the national point man for the trafficking operations that were remotely manipulated by former Vice President Bush and CIA Director William Casey in the 1980s.xxiii His eventual cellmate Harry O was one of his top understudies. Potash writes: Other findings further support the notion that Death Row Records dually worked as a front company for various U.S. Intelligence operations. Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Gary Webb was the first to link Death Row Records to the CIA from the record company’s inception. Webb quoted the probation officer of national crack trafficker Freeway Ricky Ross. That probation officer cited a silent partner of Death Row, a Michael “Harry-O” Harris, as one of Ross’ two understudies. New Yorker magazine and other media outlets described how Vice-President George Bush helped run key components of the CIA/Contra/Crack operations with CIA Director William Casey. Webb detailed the CIA cocaine trafficking network that went from Nicaraguan Contras, such as Danilo Blandón, to Freeway Ricky Ross. A CIA Inspector General backed these findings about the CIA trafficking cocaine in 1998. Webb claimed that Ross was their national point man, trafficking “multimillion-dollar cocaine shipments across America.” This would have made Michael Harris and Death Row Records important assets for the intelligence community. Evidence suggests that Ricky Ross worked closely with CIA-collaborating cocaine traffickers such as Danilo Blandón and Ron Lister in the ’80s. Also, at that time, Lister met regularly with former CIA Covert Operations director Bill Nelson, who had worked under George H. W. Bush at the CIA.xxiv Harry O would have become a silent partner in Death Row Records with Suge Knight, Dr. Dre, The D.O.C, and corrupt defense lawyer David Kenner.xxv This is significant to this story and the Sean “Diddy” Combs investigation at large, as not only was Death Row an intelligence front, but it was also teeming with dirty cops and corrupt informants who’d been assigned to moonlight as security guards at the label for drugs/weapons dealing, informing, and COINTELPRO purposes.xxvi This includes the intentional sabotage of the Bloods and Crips gang truce (both gangs with which Harry O intimately collaborated in his crack distribution efforts, as well as the Cali Cartel) and the fabrication and exploitation of the East vs. West rap feud that would ultimately lead to the seemingly government-sanctioned murders of both activist rapper Tupac Shakur and Biggie Smalls, operations in which both Sean Combs and Suge Knight seemingly played pivotal roles. In Part II of this series, we will examine the East vs. West rap feud and the deaths of Tupac and Biggie, as well as their relevance to the Sean Combs story, in greater detail. More recently, Freeway Ricky Ross — now once again free after he successfully appealed his life imprisonment without the possibility of parole sentence on the grounds that the three strikes law had been misapplied — appeared on the podcast of hip hop journalist DJ Vlad and revealed that not only had he and Death Row silent partner Harry O been cellmates at the time that Michael Harris introduced Suge Knight to attorney David Kenner, but that Ross was initially going to be another “silent partner” in the label. According to Ross, this partnership only dissolved when he was released from prison prior to Harry O and got in contact with Suge Knight. Seemingly in order to protect his own drug-supplying stake in the Death Row enterprise, Michael “Harry O” Harris warned Ross off from working with Suge. Ross, in deference to street codes, declined to go behind Harry O’s back and supply Knight. Per Ross, back in 1991 at the time that Death Row was formed, he used to sit in at the no-contact visit meetings between Knight, Kenner, and Harris while he and Harris were incarcerated together. Once the label was up and running, it quickly turned to cocaine trafficking, arguably a branch or mutation of the same CIA-Contra-Crack Cocaine nexus for which assets like Freeway Ricky Ross and Michael Harris had earlier been burned and for which journalist Gary Webb was excessively attacked (and as some believe, murdered) to cover up. These music industry, organized crime, intelligence, and federal law enforcement connections are also hugely significant as Death Row –– in conjunction with Combs’ Bad Boy Records –– was one of the primary Trojan horses by which “gangster rap” was injected into the culture, often at the expense of more radical, activist or outright revolutionary hip hop acts who, if they refused to cater to the whims of certain record executives, would see their commercial prospects suffer. One of the mechanisms for the dissemination of drug and crime glorifying culture was the cruel and deliberate coercion and corruption of conscious rappers (see: Potash’s FBI War regarding Suge Knight’s pushing of drugs on both Dr. Dre, who’d previously preached abstinence, and Tupac).xxvii There is also the case of films like New Jack City, which involved Combs’ mentor Andre Harrell and arguably romanticizes crack dealing. The film was also made by Warner. Warner, as previously noted, was built out of the association of its long-time head, Steve Ross, with Meyer Lansky associates. Ross himself had become close to Robert Maxwell, an intelligence asset tied to organized crime and a key figure in the Epstein network as well as the PROMIS scandal, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, a time when Maxwell was attempting to gain a foothold in New York City. This further suggests that mob-linked or mob-adjacent entertainment companies were working to culturally engineer African-American culture for the benefit of CIA-linked crack dealing and, ultimately, CIA-linked companies like Wackenhut that dominated the private prison industry. Given the above, all the elements of a perfect storm to perpetuate mass incarceration of African-Americans were put into place along the same timeline and by many of the same actors –– actors deeply tied to the CIA and organized crime. When we add the alleged efforts to stoke violence in hip-hop, as exemplified by Combs’ and his Bad Boy Records after he had become enmeshed in this very network as well as his West Coast rivals, we have yet another component that suggests this network used its influence over the hip-hop industry to socially engineer criminal behavior, while also ensuring that cheap, addictive drugs and cheap guns simultaneously flooded urban African-American communities. The MCA and CIA-connected Wackenhut would have reaped mass profits from this apparent operation, as the number of prisoners in its private prisons swelled. However, other major multi-national corporations who utilized inmate labor from these prisoners benefitted as well. A litany of American companies, like WalMart and Microsoft, are among those who have a long history of profiting handsomely from inmate labor. Several of these corporations include companies run by the “Mega Group” billionaires, like Lester Crown’s General Dynamics, a major military contractor, and Leslie Wexner’s Victoria’s Secret (though the lingerie firm claimed to have ended the contract after it became public knowledge in the late 1990s). This context certainly zooms out significantly from the specific Combs scandal that began to unravel at the end of 2023. However, it also helps us understand the case. Combs appears to have been brought into a network where he was controlled through sex and drugs, and then made a celebrity. As a celebrity, he used his own music, his record label and his influence to control other upcoming rappers and musicians while also helping shape the future of hip-hop toward that allegedly sought by music industry executives and their clandestine partners in the CIA, the mob and the private prison industry. Combs, from the early 1990s onward, appears to have been a key frontman for this network and its ambitions. He was likely not the sole mastermind or beneficiary of all of the scandalous parties, sexual violence, public promotion of violence, and alleged blackmail in which he engaged. He was a product of a network and a system that –– in the case of Combs –– was seeking to target and corrupt the broader African-American community in similar ways. Ultimately, Combs, like some other prominent entertainers, was servile to his music industry masters. He worked within a system those masters controlled and attempted to expand his own influence and power within that system, but –– at the end of the day –– he was never in charge. In the next installment of this series, we will explore Combs’ expanding influence in hip-hop and also in other industries, like retail, again all courtesy of the very same network outlined in this piece. While Combs publicly projected power and success, both of those things were conditional and, like Epstein, now exposed, he is due to take the fall in order to take the heat off of the people behind the curtain.

Lynch stemmed from an FBI probe launched in July 1987 (the summer prior to Combs departing for college) that was initiated after lay teachers at the academy complained about Lynch’s and Brady’s behavior with students. Fr. Lynch was jointly indicted around the same time as his boss Principal Brady, but was ultimately exonerated by the Hon. Justice Burton Roberts when a letter was produced during cross-examination that showed the FBI coerced student John Schaeffer into falsely accusing his former instructor under the false pretense that he wouldn’t be required to testify. There were also clear contradictions in the dates of the alleged abuse in Schaeffer’s testimony. Furthermore, as contended by Fr. Lynch’s defenders, the case against him was potentially politically motivated by his activism as well as other on-going corruption investigations in NYC including the Wedtech scandal, which first broke in 1986 and was named after a DOD-contractor based in the Bronx who secured governmental contracts through fraud, bribery, and other illegal means. The numerous scandals that beset New York municipal politics in the late 1980s led to Rudy Giuliani’s successful prosecution of Bronx Democratic Party leader Stanley Friedman on federal corruption charges. Friedman was a law partner of Roy Cohn, a notorious mob lawyer also known for having been Donald Trump’s mentor. Friedman’s protege, Bronx borough president Stanley Simon, resigned amid pending criminal charges stemming from his involvement with Wedtech. In 1988, long serving US Rep. Mario Biaggi of the Bronx was ultimately convicted by Giuliani on bribery, extortion, tax evasion, and obstruction charges in connection to Wedtech, shown to have accepted bribes from the Bronx company in return for the procurement of federal contracts. Bronx congressman Robert Garcia also resigned after Giuliani convicted him on bribery and extortion charges related to Wedtech in 1989—the ruling was later reversed on appeal. Note that the Wedtech and MSMA sex abuse scandals both revolved around the Bronx and that their court proceedings overlapped. While speculative, the FBI and DA office’s willingness to use dirty tricks in pursuit of a conviction of Fr. Lynch may have meant to distract from Wedtech, which was beginning to knock on the door of the Reagan administration, posing a danger to press secretary Lyn Nofziger and ultimately leading to AG Edwin Meese’s resignation in 1988. vii.

Title: Wall Street banks are cashing in on trade war chaos
URL: https://qz.com/bank-earnings-stock-goldman-sachs-bank-america-jpmorgan-1851776233
Time Published: 2025-04-15T15:40:00Z
Full Content:
Banks are minting money from stock market whiplash. Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and Morgan Stanley (MS) pulled in more than $12 billion in equities trading revenue last quarter. That surpasses the peak of the post-pandemic trading boom, The Wall Street Journal (NWSA) reports. “So far, the business is performing very well and clients are very active,” Goldman CEO David Solomon told analysts. That activity is being driven by investors scrambling to recalibrate portfolios with each new signal on how President Donald Trump’s tariff plans might unfold. But inside the country’s biggest banks, first-quarter financial results tell a very different story — one where volatility isn’t a headwind, but a revenue engine. Yet despite the trading bonanza — and a modest rally in recent days — bank stocks remain deeply in the red. The sector is down roughly 15% year-to-date, compared with an 8% drop in the S&P 500 and a 13% decline in the Nasdaq. For investors, the question now is whether trading-fueled profits are a blip — or a turning point for the sector. Goldman Sachs opened the earnings floodgates Monday, reporting a 15% jump in profit to $4.74 billion, or $14.12 per share. That beat Wall Street expectations, and was powered by strong trading revenues. Posting results Tuesday, Bank of America (BAC) also outperformed, posting EPS of $0.90 on $27.37 billion in revenue. Like Goldman, it credited its trading division for the upside. CEO Brian Moynihan noted the bank is riding a wave of volatility, but warned that “we potentially face a changing economy in the future.” Citigroup (C) followed with a solid beat of its own: First-quarter net income of $4.1 billion, or $1.96 per share, on $21.6 billion in revenue — a 3% increase from the prior year. Results were strong across all five of Citi’s core businesses, with standout performances in its markets and wealth divisions. And last Friday, JPMorgan Chase announced earnings of $5.07 per share on $46.01 billion in revenue, with adjusted EPS of $4.91 excluding a one-time gain from the First Republic acquisition. Trading, investment banking, and asset management all helped drive the beat. Morgan Stanley that day reported net revenues of $17.7 billion, up from $15.1 billion a year earlier, also beating earnings estimates. It cited strong momentum in trading and wealth management, underscoring just how broad the gains have been across the financial sector — even if investor sentiment hasn’t yet caught up. BlackRock (BLK) also delivered: 12% top-line growth to $5.28 billion, adjusted EPS of $11.30, and record net inflows of $84 billion, led by iShares ETFs. The firm now manages $11.58 trillion in assets. So why are banks thriving amid all this chaos? In short: Volatility equals volume. When markets are choppy — as they’ve been throughout the first quarter, and even more so this month in the wake of Trump’s shifting tariff plans — investors rush to reposition their portfolios, hedging bets and chasing safer ground. That activity generates trading fees for banks, especially in their equities and fixed-income divisions. It’s a bit of a paradox: While market turmoil often hits consumer confidence and corporate dealmaking, it can be a windfall for bank trading desks tasked with executing those reactions. Still, a booming trading quarter (or two) doesn’t necessarily mean bank stocks are about to take off. Historically, financials tend to lag in recoveries, especially when the outlook for interest rates, credit quality, and economic growth is so murky. For instance, after the 2008 financial crisis, bank stocks took years to return to pre-crisis levels — while sectors such tech and consumer discretionary stocks bounced back much faster. And even in 2020, when trading revenues surged during pandemic volatility, that boost didn’t translate into lasting stock outperformance. For now, Wall Street banks are quietly riding the storm they didn’t directly create. Whether that success translates into enthusiasm for their own stocks is another question entirely, especially with economic risks still looming — and the full impact of tariffs yet to hit Main Street.

Title: Mark Zuckerberg takes the stand in historic antitrust trial that could force breakup of Meta

Thank you. Please check your inbox to confirm. Brian Witte, Associated Press Brian Witte, Associated Press Barbara Ortutay, Associated Press Barbara Ortutay, Associated Press Leave your feedback WASHINGTON (AP) — Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg took to the witness stand on the first day of a historic antitrust trial to defend his company against allegations it illegally monopolized the social media market. The trial could force the tech giant to break off Instagram and WhatsApp, startups Meta bought more than a decade ago that have since grown into social media powerhouses. WATCH: How Meta’s blockbuster antitrust trial could have major implications for big tech FTC attorney Daniel Matheson called Zuckerberg as the first witness, as it seeks to prove that Meta acquired Instagram and WhatsApp to preserve its monopoly in the social networking space. At the trial, Matheson focused on a communication sent to colleagues that illustrated Zuckerberg’s frustration with a lack of progress on developing a photo-sharing app to compete with Instagram’s. “The way I read this message is that I’m not happy about how we’re executing on that project,” Zuckerberg said. Matheson followed up by asking if that was because of Instagram’s rapid growth. “That does seem to be what I’m highlighting,” Zuckerberg said, adding that he’s always urging his teams to do better. Later in the day, Zuckerberg appeared frustrated when Matheson asked him about his concerns expressed about how fast Instagram was growing. “I don’t have the full timeline of Instagram’s development in my head,” Zuckerberg said, when Matheson asked him about his mention of its growth. “You could probably get that better from somebody else.” Matheson also asked about comments of plans to keep Instagram running, while focusing on Facebook and not investing in Instagram. Zuckerberg said he wouldn’t characterize it as a plan, and he insisted that Instagram wasn’t neglected. “In practice, we ended up investing a ton in it after we acquired it,” Zuckerberg, who testified most of the afternoon, said. In opening statements, Matheson said Meta has used its position to generate enormous profits even as consumer satisfaction has dropped. He said Meta was “erecting a moat” to protect its interests by buying the two startups. Mark Hansen, an attorney for Meta, said the FTC was making a “grab bag” of arguments that were wrong. He said Meta has plenty of competition and has made improvements to the startups it acquired. “This lawsuit, in summary, is misguided,” Hansen said, adding: “anyway you look at it, consumers have been the big winners.” The trial will be the first big test of President Donald Trump’s Federal Trade Commission’s ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta — then called Facebook — in 2020, during Trump’s first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market. Meta, the FTC argues, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing Zuckerberg’s strategy, “expressed in 2008: ‘It is better to buy than compete.’ True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats.” Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and “neutralize perceived competitive threats,” the FTC says in its complaint, just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers. READ MORE: Meta agrees to pay $25 million settlement to Trump over Jan. 6 suspension lawsuit Facebook bought Instagram — then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following — in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal’s value fell to $750 million after Facebook’s stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012. Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller “acqui-hires” — a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion. WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta’s competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple’s messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp. Meta, meanwhile, says the FTC’s lawsuit “defies reality.” “The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others. More than 10 years after the FTC reviewed and cleared our acquisitions, the Commission’s action in this case sends the message that no deal is ever truly final. Regulators should be supporting American innovation, rather than seeking to break up a great American company and further advantaging China on critical issues like AI,” the company said in a statement. In a filing last week, Meta also stressed that the FTC “must prove that Meta has monopoly power in its claimed relevant market now, not at some time in the past.” This, experts say, could also prove challenging since more competitors have emerged in the social media space in the years since the company bought WhatsApp and Instagram. Meta’s fate will be decided by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who late last year denied Meta’s request for a summary judgment and ruled that the case must go to trial. While the FTC may face an uphill battle in proving its case, the stakes are high for Meta, whose advertising business could be cut in half if it’s forced to spin off Instagram. Meta isn’t the only technology company in the sights of federal antitrust regulators, Google and Amazon face their own cases. The remedy phase of Google’s case is scheduled to begin on April 21.

Title: Bitcoin ETF market steadies as BlackRock sees modest inflows with only outflows from Fidelity
URL: https://cryptoslate.com/insights/bitcoin-etfs-break-even-after-april-outflows-1m-out-1m-in/
Time Published: 2025-04-15T15:12:53Z

Market sees cautious optimism in Bitcoin ETFs as BlackRock compensates for Fidelity's outflows. Spot Bitcoin ETFs showed early signs of stabilizing in mid-April following an aggressive seven-day period of outflows exceeding $872 million triggered by intensified US-China trade tensions. After ETF withdrawals tapered on April 10 with $14.9 million in outflows, activity nearly halted on April 11, recording minimal outflows of just $1 million. This reduction indicated cautious market sentiment and an emerging pause among investors reassessing Bitcoin’s stability around the $85,000 mark. April 14 marked a turning point, ending the prolonged outflow streak with modest net inflows totaling $1.5 million. Notably, Fidelity’s FBTC ETF recorded substantial withdrawals of $35.2 million, highlighting continued profit-taking or strategic repositioning by certain institutional investors, reflecting lingering caution. In contrast, BlackRock’s IBIT ETF attracted $36.7 million, effectively offsetting Fidelity’s losses and signaling selective confidence returning to the ETF market. Overall, ETF market enthusiasm remains muted compared to previous bullish phases, indicating that investors remain watchful, awaiting clearer signals from both macroeconomic conditions and sustained Bitcoin price stability.

Title: Ripple’s Garlinghouse Believes Bitcoin’s Astronomical Breakout To $200,000 Is ‘Not Unreasonable’

Time Published: 2025-04-15T15:00:06Z
Full Content:
Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has predicted that Bitcoin’s mega explosion to the elusive $200,000 level is possible, as regulators in the United States have swiftly changed their approach to regulating crypto. “I think $200,000 is not unreasonable,” Garlinghouse told Fox Business on April 11, adding that he would not forecast the price of XRP, which powers the XRP Ledger, as it is “too close to home.” The apex cryptocurrency was recently changing hands around $84,183, representing a 2.1% gain over the past seven days, as per crypto data provider CoinGecko. The Ripple boss remarked that he avoids making short-term Bitcoin predictions as he is mainly focused on long-term macro trends. He expects macro tailwinds and the reversal of US regulatory animosity to continue propelling the crypto market higher: “I think about what the macro trends are playing out for the crypto industry, for the XRP ecosystem. XRP has been the best-performing major crypto in the last 90 days. We think about it as, what does that look like over the next three years? I’m very optimistic.” In Garlinghouse’s view, people underestimate the implications of the US economy on the crypto market. He highlighted that America, under President Donald Trump, has shifted from “headwinds, hostility” to “tailwinds,” yet the market hasn’t fully priced in the bullish impact of this regulatory change. “The largest asset managers in the world go from relatively frozen out or hostile to now a friendly market. This has sensible regulation that is thinking about pro-innovation here at home,” he opined. Garlinghouse credited David Sacks, Scott Bessent, and the newly confirmed Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman, Paul Atkins, for creating a more crypto-friendly regulatory scene. With the SEC under transformed leadership in the Trump administration, the regulatory landscape is undergoing tremendous changes. For instance, high-profile lawsuits against Coinbase, Robinhood, and Ripple have either been settled or dropped, signaling a new chapter for the industry. Commenting on Ripple’s recent $1.25 billion acquisition of prime broker Hidden Road, Garlinghouse claimed the company would not have signed the deal a year ago because of the hostile regulatory environment under the Biden-Harris administration. He suggests the acquisition could allow Wall Street giants to access crypto through traditional infrastructure. “This allows even larger institutions like BlackRock, like the biggest Wall Street financial institutions, to come into this market in a way they understand with a safer prime broker to help clear transactions and a bigger balance sheet to do that. It’s good for the whole industry,” he postulated.

ByGuruFocus ByGuruFocus, Contributor. By Nabeel Bukhari Every so often, the market overlooks a company delivering on all fronts, and PDD Holdings (PDD, Financial) might be one of them. The company has quietly become one of the most interesting disrupters and has built a global empire, turning its platforms, Pinduoduo and Temu, into household names across continents. Moreover, the numbers speak for themselves in terms of soaring revenue, rising profits, and a balance sheet that provides it the flexibility to keep winning. Yet, the stock remains extremely undervalued. That kind of disconnect does not last forever. Under an aggressive expansion strategy and having proven the ability to do just that, PDD Holdings is changing the game. And as the company grows continuously, this one of the most fascinating stories in the world of e-commerce will become difficult to ignore. For those who are paying attention now, it's an opportunity that's too big to miss out on. PDD Holdings, the owner of Pinduoduo and Temu, is a major player in global e-commerce. It's a socially driven shopping platform in China that started in 2015 and has since become a disruptive force in the industry with its aggressive pricing and speed of expansion. However, the real game-changer came in 2022 when PDD Holdings launched Temu. It is a cross-border marketplace that has taken the world by storm and is now live in over 40 countries. There is no accident to Temu's meteoric rise. Its success has spiked with bargain-basement prices and treasure-hunt shopping experiences selling to millions of cost-conscious consumers. Even I had a great experience with it, and to say the least, the app is addictive. However, the growth at this scale comes with challenges, which you will later see in the analysis. That said, PDD Holdings is doing more than sitting back. It is making smart moves to diversify its revenue. Its recent partnership with DigitBridge will enable it to bring small-to-medium-sized businesses and assist them in simplifying e-commerce operations so that sellers can seamlessly join Temu. It could serve as a strategic play to strengthen Temu's future position. Heading towards financial performance, PDD Holdings just reported another strong quarter with revenue up 24% year-over-year (YOY) to $15.15 billion. That is a good number, but it was less than expectations and has been the slowest growth rate since early 2022. However, the company's fundamentals are still strong. The healthy consumer demand manifested itself in a 33% increase in revenue from transaction services. Meanwhile, the company is keeping profitability up despite rising costs, as operating profit rose 14% to $3.5 billion and net income jumped a solid 18% to $3.76 billion. PDD Holdings Income Statement Breakdown Chart Balance sheet strength and cost concerns: Moreover, PDD Holdings is in an enviable position on the balance sheet. Today the company boasts a whopping $45.4 billion in cash and short-term investments and its cash-to-debt ratio is a staggering 30.13. That's a fortress-like balance sheet that allows it to be aggressive with the capital, while still being financially secure. Further adding to this, the debt levels remain minimal, which is a great sign. PDD Holdings Balance Sheet Breakdown Chart Thad said, rising costs posing concern. Cost of revenue rose 36%, and if that is to be the trend, it might put pressure on margins. But this is not a red flag yet. A core bull case for PDD Holdings is that it has consistently found ways to remain profitable, and this is supported so long as its e-commerce and grocery delivery businesses are strong. There was already some caution going in on this report. The previous quarter had seen YOY growth but a sequential decline, and even the management had warned about a possible dip in the profits. Yet, PDD Holdings delivered where it needed to, that is, in earnings growth. It is likely that the holiday season helped, but posting strong profits while absorbing rising costs is a sign of a tough company. Looking ahead, investors should keep a close eye on how the company balances the two: expansion with cost control. If PDD Holdings continues its earnings momentum and keeps costs under control, the current valuation discount would be a positive rather than a negative. Beyond Q4, PDD Holding's full-year performance is particularly impressive. With strong growth in both online marketing services up 29% YOY and an astounding 108% YOY spike in transaction services revenue to $26.84 billion, fiscal year 2024 was a blockbuster for it. It's obvious that the company's aggressive expansion is paying off. Still, more impressively, operating profit soared 85% YOY to $14.85 billion while net income climbed a mind-boggling 87% to $15.4 billion, indicating the company had pulled it off despite increasing costs. Speaking of costs, operating expenses jumped 35% YOY to $18.02 billion, probably due to high marketing spend, but PDD Holdings still managed to increase margins substantially. The company has plenty of financial firepower to keep on investing in growth with $16.7 billion in operating cash flow. There's no doubt that PDD Holdings is balancing aggressive expansion with profitability, but with raising fulfillment and payment processing costs, sustaining this momentum without killing margins is the real challenge ahead. PDD Holdings currently appears to be a hidden gem in the market. The stock is trading at a steep 55.86% discount based on its GF Value of $201.63 compared to its current stock price of $88.97. That’s a significant gap, especially considering the company’s robust earnings growth. PDD Holdings GF Value Chart As for valuation metrics, PDD Holding’s trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 7.70 times is 38.83% below the sector median, and the forward P/E of 7.30 times is 44.81% below. In short, the stock is cheap, and even though it has delivered solid profits, the market may not be fully appreciating of the stock’s potential. Digging a bit further, enterprise-value-based multiples corroborate the story. PDD Holding’s forward EV/EBITDA of 4.44 times is at a 49% discount to the sector median of 8.72. Even more compelling is that its forward EV/EBIT of 4.42 times is at a 66% discount to the sector’s 13.11. These numbers reveal that PDD Holdings is not only profitable, but profitable at a valuation that seems quite modest. That said, there is one factor to watch. The company’s forward EV/Sales multiple of 1.21 times is 12.97% above the sector median of 1.07. It means investors are factoring in strong revenue growth already. If margins don’t come up to the levels of those expectations, then there could be some pressure on valuation. Ultimately, PDD Holdings has an amazing balance sheet and surging profitability, which makes the disconnect between its intrinsic value and the market price an opportunity to watch out for. Therefore, for now, the valuation screams opportunity, but execution will be the key here. Now, let’s compare MercadoLibre and Alibaba with PDD Holdings to determine who is a better value play out of the three. MercadoLibre is at a hefty premium, as its trailing P/E is 51.30 times and forward P/E almost 41.11 times, which is more than four times PDD Holding's valuation. While MercadoLibre's growth story is strong, that kind of premium pricing leaves close to no room for error. On the other hand, Alibaba’s trailing P/E of 11.94 times and forward P/E of 11.64 times are more reasonable but still slightly higher than PDD Holdings. The trend continues when we take a closer look at EV metrics. MercadoLibre's relatively high forward EV/EBITDA of 24.36 times and EV/EBIT (TTM) of 38.48 times indicate that there is a substantial premium. While EV/EBITDA at 8.17 times and EV/EBIT at 11.60 times for Alibaba is more moderate but again higher than PDD Holding’s levels. No matter how you slice it, PDD Holdings is trading at a discount. The gap remains wide on a revenue multiple basis. PDD Holding’s EV/Sales is a much lower figure than MELI’s 3.91 times or Alibaba’s 1.64 times. This makes it the most attractively valued of the three. PDD Valuation Ratio Comparison Chart When top investors make a move, it’s worth noting, and PDD Holdings has been on the radar of some big names. Institutions like BlackRock, Vanguard, and Baillie Gifford have large positions in the company, while billionaire investor David Tepper’s Appaloosa Management has also been adding to its stake. It is a powerful vote of confidence in PDD Holding's long-term potential. PDD Holdings Volume of Guru Trades The latest activity on guru trades is leaning bullish. Despite some investors taking profits, there is a notable uptick in buying which suggests that smart money sees value. The strong accumulation that took place in late 2024 and early 2025, particularly when the stock dipped, is a sign of conviction rather than hesitation. Heavyweights are standing firm and building on top of their positions, attracting long-term investors. And as already mentioned, when top investors back something up, that is usually for a reason. PDD Holdings EPS Quarterly Estimate Trends With that, here is where I see PDD Holding's stock trading over the next year. Over the next three years, PDD's forward P/E is estimated to drop steadily, from 7.33 times in 2025 to 5.29 times in 2027. The fact that earnings are expected to see strong growth is captured in this downward trend, and the consensus EPS estimates support it. As EPS continues to accelerate, PDD Holding’s stock could be substantially undervalued at the current levels and that’s where the opportunity comes. We would see a significant re-rating and a solid upside if sentiment shifts and investors start recognizing PDD Holding’s momentum. Base case-A conservative valuation re-rating: If I take, for example, a 2025 EPS estimate of $7.33 and apply a 9-10x forward P/E, which is in line with PDD Holding’s historical valuation range, we reach a price target of $108.54 to $120.60. It’s about 22% to 36% upside from current levels. The assumption in this scenario is that the execution remains steady but the market could still be cautious with PDD Holdings, preventing its multiple from expanding more rapidly. Bull case-A stronger growth premium: But how PDD Holdings would react if investor sentiment improves? That’s where things get interesting. A 12-13 times forward P/E suddenly looks reasonable if the stock begins to get valued like some of its higher growth peers. If PDD Holdings were to trade at 12 times, it would be worth $144.72 and 13 times would result in $156.78, which is a 63-76% upside. To drive this out, PDD Holdings would need to continue its current earnings and margin expansion and have investors competent enough to have faith in its long-term trajectory. PDD Scenario Analysis Even in the worst-case scenario, PDD offers a modest upside. However, if things go right and the market sorts itself eventually, the gains would be high. GuruFocus analysts also believe that there is an upside of 73.37%, with bullish targets even higher. This is one of those setups where patience becomes the key, and for long-term investors, PDD Holdings is an opportunity waiting to be discovered. PDD Holdings 12 Month Analyst Price Target Chart Not even the best growth stories are without risk, and the same is true of PDD Holdings. Right now, regulatory scrutiny is one of the biggest concerns. Temu is probed for product safety violations and alleged labor violations related to the supply chain in the U.S. The sales tactics of the firm are also being considered red flags by European regulators. If these problems become worse, PDD Holdings could be fined, restricted in operations, or experience a loss of reputation, all of which are obstacles to its long-term growth. Another wildcard is China's regulatory environment. PDD Holdings is a Variable Interest Entity (VIE) that allows foreign investment in Chinese companies. However, if Beijing goes too hard on this, PDD Holding's entire corporate setup could be at risk. And let’s not forget the competition. Alibaba and JD.com are already fighting back and slowing revenue growth. If PDD Holdings can't hold its edge, investors betting on its continued superiority may need to readjust their hopes. PDD Holdings is a compelling case being a high-growth, cash-rich e-commerce powerhouse trading at a steep discount. It is continuously executing, and delivering profitability even as it is aggressively investing. However, the market has not yet fully priced in its potential and that's the opportunity. There are risks, but they exist everywhere, isn't it? PDD Holdings has always been able to adapt and outperform. With earnings momentum still strong and institutional investors betting big, it is hard to ignore its upside. If the company stays on course, today's discount could become tomorrow's massive gain.

Featured Shows MSNBC TV More Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows While most of the country spends Tax Day occupied with the stress of W2s, 1099s and tax-filing software, millionaires like us pay our tax attorneys top dollar to make sense of all the red tape for us. That doesn’t mean Tax Day isn’t still a nightmare for us, too, albeit for a different reason. For us, as Patriotic Millionaires, April 15 serves as a scary reminder of the rigged nature of America’s tax code. The U.S. tax system has enabled a concentration of wealth so extreme that it threatens our economy, our democracy and the planet. And this year’s Tax Day is even scarier, as Republicans are negotiating a tax bill that would further rig the system in favor of wealthy people like us and deepen America’s inequality crisis. According to Forbes’ 2025 Billionaires List, the U.S. has 902 billionaires whose combined net worth is a record $6.8 trillion. These 902 individuals hold more wealth than the entire bottom half of the country; their riches exceed the GDP of every country in the world aside from the U.S. and China. Our economy doesn’t stand a chance when this much money is concentrated in the hands of wealthy people like us. Of the many factors that drive America’s growing inequality, our tax code is among the most significant. For much of the 20th century, the U.S. had a fairly progressive tax structure that limited large, dynastic fortunes. That is no longer the case. Those who are already rich can make money in ways that are subject to income taxes at lower rates or don’t count as “income” at all (for example, by borrowing against unrealized capital gains). Billionaires now pay lower effective tax rates than all other income groups. For the ultrawealthy like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, paying $0 in federal income taxes isn’t outside the realm of possibility. Our organization, Patriotic Millionaires, has frequently sounded the alarm over the threat that wealth inequality poses to society. Our economy doesn’t stand a chance when this much money is concentrated in the hands of wealthy people like us. It leaves millions of working people without the incomes they need to buy products and services necessary for survival while also maintaining strong consumer demand. Our democracy doesn’t stand a chance when a mere 100 billionaire families are responsible for 1 out of every 6 dollars spent in federal elections, giving them an outsized voice and access to our elected officials and candidates for office. And our planet doesn’t stand a chance when the ultrawealthy can continue to accelerate climate change into overdrive with their private jets, superyachts and spaceships. The problem of extreme wealth has festered for years, if not decades, but it has taken on a new level of urgency with President Donald Trump and Elon Musk at the helm of the federal government. Billionaires subsidized Trump’s ticket back to the White House, accounting for no less than a third of the funds he raised. Musk alone contributed $235 million to Trump’s presidential bid. Now Musk and his fellow billionaires are getting major returns on their political investment, including the massive tax savings from the “big, beautiful” bill that the GOP is crafting. Last week, Republicans in the House and the Senate moved one step closer to passing their respective budget blueprints: Both of their plans would cut taxes by no less than $5 trillion, and most of those cuts would be used to extend many of the expiring provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act — a bill that overwhelmingly benefited the wealthy. If, as seems likely, the ultrawealthy receive another tax windfall from Republicans, it will only increase the threat that they pose to democracy. This would be bad news at any time and under any administration, but this is especially so under President Trump. Democracy is already hanging by a thread as the president targets perceived enemies, including universities, law firms and the media; purges the Justice Department of officials involved in criminal prosecutions against him; expresses interest in pursuing an unconstitutional third term in office; and declares himself a king on social media. To be clear, we don’t have a problem with wealth in and of itself. We make no apologies for our own financial success. People need financial incentives to innovate and work hard, and in the end, their ingenuity benefits all of us. There are several actions lawmakers must take to safeguard society from the ravages of extreme wealth concentration. What we do, however, have a problem with is a small handful of people having so much wealth that it inevitably becomes power. We have a problem with billionaires like Trump and Musk using the government to improve their own financial situations and business ventures. More than that, though, we have a problem with the fact that the tax code has done virtually nothing whatsoever to prevent the oligarchic crisis in which America finds itself. If our federal tax system continues to privilege income from wealth over income from work, and if Republicans get their way in passing even more tax cuts for the rich in the coming months, we’ll have baked a totally oligarchic concentration of wealth into America’s economic cake. There are several actions lawmakers must take to safeguard society from the ravages of extreme wealth concentration, but it is imperative they begin with reforming the tax code to ensure all millionaires and billionaires like us pay our rightful share in taxes. Paying taxes for the betterment of society is our civic duty that we are glad to do, because those who don’t have the wealth we have should be able to not only survive but thrive in our society. And with so much on the line, it is important that wealthy people carry out this sacred duty now more than ever. There’s no sugarcoating it: Tax Day is a nightmare. And thanks to what Trump, Musk and other ultrawealthy oligarchs are doing to our country, that nightmare has become recurring. To wake our country up and pull our economy, democracy and planet back from the brink of total collapse, lawmakers need to tax wealthy people like us before it’s too late.

Title: How Wall Street’s emerging cold war might impact your portfolio (Prakash Bhudia)

The market just got nuked. After hitting record highs for months, we’re suddenly in the steepest selloff since COVID. Spoiler alert: This isn’t your typical correction. Let’s cut through the noise: these tariffs aren’t a bluff. When President Trump says, “I don’t want anything to go down, but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something,” he’s signaling a willingness to endure pain to remake global trade. The numbers are staggering -145% on Chinese imports, followed by Beijing’s 125% retaliation. Source: PIIE This isn’t posturing; it’s economic warfare. What’s particularly jarring too, is the misapplication of economic theory. Brent Neiman, a University of Chicago economist, claims his research was "dramatically misapplied" by the Trump administration-using his framework incorrectly to justify these tariffs. Here's the uncomfortable reality: the U.S. trade deficit actually reflects the dollar’s role as the world’s reserve currency. Foreign entities currently hold about $7 trillion in U.S. Treasury securities. These deficits aren’t a bug-they’re a system feature. When assets that generally don’t correlate- Bitcoin, gold, tech stocks- all see a correction simultaneously like they did on 14 April, that's not rotation; that’s liquidity stress. What’s especially telling is the correlation spike across these usually uncorrelated assets. This isn't mere rotation; it's liquidity stress reminiscent of early COVID around 13 March. The market had priced in a near-perfect narrative: AI-fueled productivity, a soft landing, and geopolitical calm. That fairy tale is now unraveling. This isn’t just another policy adjustment-it’s the beginning of a profound shift in how capital flows internationally. The Triffin Dilemma-the structural paradox where the U.S. must run deficits to supply the world with dollars-is being challenged in real-time. Think about it: foreign central banks hold over $3 trillion in dollar reserves. If the U.S. were to successfully reduce its trade deficit (however unlikely), it could ironically create global dollar shortages, triggering worldwide financial instability. Why gold dropped and why smart money is still buying it Gold took a hit alongside everything else, but don’t misread the signal. It's not weakness—it's a liquidity crunch in action. What we’ve seen recently isn’t gold failing as a safe haven; it's a classic liquidity unwind. In moments of stress, gold often gets sold not because it's weak but because it's liquid. Essentially, it's the ATM traders go to during margin calls. The longer-term outlook remains bullish for gold, especially if trade fragmentation continues and central banks accelerate their diversification away from the dollar. The tariff situation has created a brutal dilemma for the Fed and other central banks. Initially, markets feared tariffs would reignite inflation and prompt more rate hikes. But the reality looks more like stagflation - higher prices with weaker growth. Do central banks hike into slowing growth or wait and risk inflation taking off again? The market is betting on paralysis, with rate hike probabilities recently declining. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, has even suggested the U.S. may already be in the early stages of a recession, echoing concerns from other influential figures. A CNBC survey found about 69% of CEOs believe a recession is either underway or imminent. In this environment, several opportunities stand out: This isn’t just market drama - it’s hitting Main Street. Some small businesses are already freezing orders or warning they can’t absorb new customs costs. Many could be pushed to the brink with thin margins and weak pricing power. If that spills into labor markets or retail consumption, this could evolve from a correction into something much broader. As the New York Times notes, companies dependent on importing goods from China are already in chaos due to soaring tariff rates. Information moves at warp speed now, and that’s changing how markets function. One false headline about tariff delays recently moved markets by trillions before being debunked. For traders, the edge isn’t just about knowing more - it’s about filtering better. The risk is no longer just being wrong, it’s being too reactive to the wrong signal. The bottom line? We’re not in Kansas anymore. The game’s rules are changing, and traders who recognise this shift early will be left standing when the dust settles. This isn’t just another dip to buy - it’s a fundamental rewiring of global markets. Proceed accordingly.

Title: VMware closing a door opens up new VDI possibilities

VMware's fall is leading organizations to explore alternative VDI When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. There has been increasing attention on open and closed technologies in relation to the development of AI and large language models (LLMs) in the past few years. Meta released Llama as open source, XAI released GROK-1 and, of course, the open source release of China’s DeepSeek model in recent months has been widely publicized. It’s evident that open source technology benefits from community adoption and development, enabling faster iteration, greater security testing and the contributions of many more active minds, experiences and skill sets. Whether the recent LLM releases are driven by such beliefs or by commercial instincts (likely both), it certainly helps in preventing a single player from dominating the market. This perspective was highlighted by the ironically named OpenAI trying to stifle DeepSeek adoption in recent weeks. Co-Founder at Inevidesk. The tensions of open versus closed technologies have long existed in less sensitive, yet still important, areas. Closed technologies tend to be much more widely adopted as they are more easily packaged and deployed and require less depth of expertise. This can lead to monopolies of the type exemplified by Microsoft or Adobe, whose dominance stifles any real competition; the sheer weight of users and finances might preclude serious challenges. In other areas there might not be monopolies, but still a general market domination by a handful of vendors. Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) is a good example, where VMware and Citrix have shared the spoils for many years. And if their dominance has been challenged in recent years, this has been due to the growth of cloud hyperscalers which, for the most part, were extensions of existing global, powerful big tech such as Microsoft, Google and Amazon. This state of play is starting to shift somewhat, driven in part by dissatisfaction and distrust of the cloud giants (almost certainly concentrated further by their involvement in AI). This is causing many organizations to ‘reshore’ on-premises or cloud hosted in their own private data center. This dissatisfaction has been fueled by the slow collapse of VMware - perhaps the most well known and widely used of the legacy VDI vendors. VMware was purchased by Broadcom in November 2023, who almost immediately announced several changes including the divestment of their end user computing (EUC) which included Horizon VDI services. The EUC business was subsequently purchased by KKR, a global investment firm, that now offers VDI services under the ‘Omnissa’ brand. The lack of interest shown by Broadcom in the EUC service is a huge knock in confidence for the continued viability of this model, which is not profitable enough for them. It’s uncertain whether the software can be revived under new ownership and there have been worrying indications. Last year, Gartner warned of uncertainty regarding Omnissa’s roadmap and continued semi-dependence for many users on other VMware products. Concerns are currently compounded by recent large-scale layoffs which in one sense should be expected as a post-sale reconstruction, but of course could easily result in the loss of critical internal expertise and a drop in service levels. The recent upheaval has also caused issues concerning price increases and significantly lengthy waits for renewal quotations. Such concerns are driving customers towards other options and, with Citrix remaining complex and expensive and certainly out of the reach of many SMEs, we are seeing a rise of open source related solutions starting to emerge. Many organizations are now offering KVM-based solutions which both avoid the increasing risks and expense associated with the legacy vendors to offer more accessible, flexible and cost-efficient VDI services. Changes in Microsoft virtualization access licensing in recent years helped open possibilities in the space, which has allowed for more efficient use of hardware and more bespoke options. There are industry specific services arising to serve architecture, engineering and construction (AEC), media production and other compute heavy sectors as well as more generalist, knowledge worker options for finance, law and similar businesses. As VDI offers the potential for higher levels of security, more efficient estate management and greater flexibility in our continuing challenging economic climate, this is to be welcomed. Innovation is critical for a healthy technical ecosystem and the ability to address specific industry requirements, whilst also continuing to focus on lowering carbon impacts and creating greater resilience. Businesses and channel operators should be open to such possibilities and actively engage with potential future partners to support development and mitigate the likelihood of monopolies and big tech dominance. We can see the overreach of some of these players in the news every day; supporting independent innovators is a proactive means of preventing an overgeneralization of power and its associated risks.

Title: How Are the ‘Magnificent 7’ Companies Faring Amid Trump’s Tariffs?

To say it’s been two tumultuous weeks for the group of tech stocks dubbed the “Magnificent Seven” would be an understatement. Shares in Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META) and Nvidia have swung wildly in recent days as investors react to President Donald Trump’s volatile tariff announcements. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. The Magnificent Seven fell sharply on April 2 after Trump unveiled his so-called “Liberation Day” tariffs, which enacted a blanket 10 percent levy and higher “reciprocal” tariffs for the U.S.’s largest trading partners. That same day, 25 percent levies on imported autos and auto parts also went into effect—causing a selloff across automobile stocks. Shortly after those reciprocal tariffs took effect, on April 9, the President announced that he would pause them for 90 days—except for China, whose tariffs were raised to 145 percent. Two days later, the administration said smartphones and a list of electronics manufactured in China would be exempt from the high tariffs. The chaos has understandably caused tech stocks to ricochet. While the Magnificent Seven companies are particularly vulnerable to tariffs since three-quarters of their suppliers are located abroad, some have more to lose than others. Apple, for example, relies on China for the bulk of its iPhone production, while Amazon’s e-commerce business sources heavily from overseas. Here’s a look at how the Magnificent Seven has fared in recent days: Apple’s hardware-centric business makes it especially vulnerable to trade barriers. The iPhone maker’s share price fell 23 percent in the days following April 2. Its shares rebounded on April 9 along with the broader market after Trump’s 90-day reprieve spared manufacturing hubs like India, which produces 15 percent of all iPhones, from high tariffs. Apple shares jumped again today (April 14) after most of its products were exempt from tariffs imposed on China, which currently produces around 90 percent of iPhones. Like the rest of the Magnificent Seven, Microsoft took a hit after Trump’s initial wave of global tariffs but regained ground following the president’s temporary pause. The software giant is less exposed to trade shocks than its tech peers, thanks to a business model that leans heavily on software products. The Microsoft division that produces hardware like Surface devices and Xbox consoles made up just 21 percent of revenue, according to its latest earnings report. That cushion has helped insulate Microsoft from the volatility hammering more hardware-heavy firms. Nvidia shares, which slid alongside the market after the initial tariff news, rebounded after Trump exempted certain computer components from China tariffs. But the rally may be short-lived, as the chipmaker faces tariffs on semiconductor imports, which Trump says are on the way. (Nvidia chips are primarily made in Taiwan.) In a bid to get ahead of such levies, Nvidia today announced plans today to pour up to $500 billion over the next four years into domestic A.I. chip production. Amazon’s shares have fallen by a total of 7 percent in the past dozen days. Trump’s tariffs, especially his levies on China, are expected to hit the e-commerce giant hard as up to 70 percent of goods sold on Amazon are sourced from China. But Amazon isn’t completely reliant on e-commerce—its cloud unit AWS accounts for around half the company’s profits and won’t be as impacted by the administration’s levies as Amazon’s physical goods business. Meta may not rely heavily on hardware like some of its tech rivals, but that didn’t spare its stock from a steep drop—down more than 13 percent in just two days after April 2. Shares bounced back with the rest of the Magnificent Seven after Trump’s 90-day reprieve, but the threat still looms. The company’s core business—selling digital ads, many of them from foreign brands—stands to take a hit if global tariffs squeeze international marketing budgets. Even without a direct hardware link, Meta is far from immune to the ripple effects. (Meta’s Quest VR headsets are manufactured in Taiwan.) Like Meta, the Google parent company’s revenue primarily comes from advertising and software services. Its share price has been less volatile than some of its Big Tech peers, down 7 percent after “Liberation Day” and rebounded 10 percent after the reprieve was announced. Tesla may build its cars in the U.S., but that wasn’t enough to shield the automaker from fallout. While the company dodged the administration’s 25 percent tariff on imported vehicles, it wasn’t as lucky with car parts—30 to 40 percent of which are sourced from abroad and now face added levies. Tesla (TSLA) shares have slid more than 10 percent over the past two weeks, dragged down not just by tariff concerns but also by growing public backlash to Elon Musk’s controversial role as head of the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Meanwhile, the company has suspended new orders for its American-made Model S and Model X vehicles in China, which currently has a 125 percent retaliatory tariff against U.S. goods.

Meta may not rely heavily on hardware like some of its tech rivals, but that didn’t spare its stock from a steep drop—down more than 13 percent in just two days after April 2. Shares bounced back with the rest of the Magnificent Seven after Trump’s 90-day reprieve, but the threat still looms. The company’s core business—selling digital ads, many of them from foreign brands—stands to take a hit if global tariffs squeeze international marketing budgets. Even without a direct hardware link, Meta is far from immune to the ripple effects. (Meta’s Quest VR headsets are manufactured in Taiwan.) Like Meta, the Google parent company’s revenue primarily comes from advertising and software services. Its share price has been less volatile than some of its Big Tech peers, down 7 percent after “Liberation Day” and rebounded 10 percent after the reprieve was announced. Tesla may build its cars in the U.S., but that wasn’t enough to shield the automaker from fallout. While the company dodged the administration’s 25 percent tariff on imported vehicles, it wasn’t as lucky with car parts—30 to 40 percent of which are sourced from abroad and now face added levies. Tesla (TSLA) shares have slid more than 10 percent over the past two weeks, dragged down not just by tariff concerns but also by growing public backlash to Elon Musk’s controversial role as head of the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Meanwhile, the company has suspended new orders for its American-made Model S and Model X vehicles in China, which currently has a 125 percent retaliatory tariff against U.S. goods.

Tokens associated with artificial intelligence (AI) fared worse than the biggest cryptocurrencies over the past 24 hours. The relative weakness comes amid unusual activity in put options tied to shares of Nvidia (NVDA), the chipmaker that on Monday said it will will start building its AI supercomputers in the U.S. While bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market value, added 0.6% over 24 hours to $85,500, TAO, the token of blockchain-based machine learning network Bittensor, traded 3.6% lower at $239 and decentralized GPU rendering platform Render Network's RNDR token was 1.7% down at $3.93, according to data source Coingecko. Other tokens, including FET, SEI and GRT lost 2%. Nvidia short-dated put options saw notable activity on Monday, according to data tracked by Convex Value. The action was concentrated in the $100 strike put options expiring on April 17, April 25 and May 2. Additionally, there was activity in the $60 put expiring on April 17 and $50 and $85 strike puts expiring on May 16. Convex Value called the activity in these so-called out-of-the-money put options at strikes below the Santa Clara, California-based company's spot price of $110 unusual. "My bet would be [these are] protective plays," an analyst at the platform told CoinDesk. Buying a put option is akin to buying insurance against market slides. Traders typically snap them up when looking to profit from or hedge their spot/futures bets from a potential market decline.

Full Content:
Zero Hash, a crypto infrastructure firm specializing in stablecoin payment rails, said it has processed over $2 billion in tokenized fund flows over the past four months as demand for real-world assets is accelerating. Tokenized real-world assets is a red-hot crypto sector, with several global traditional financial firms leveraging blockchain rails to record ownership and move assets such as securities, funds, commodities. They do so to achieve operational gains and near-instant settlements. It's forecasted to be huge opportunity: BCG and Ripple projected the market to grow to $18 trillion by 2033. Zero Hash's stablecoin infrastructure serves as a key backbone for tokenized assets, supporting tokenized funds from traditional asset managers including BlackRock, Franklin Templeton and Republic, enabling around-the-clock stablecoin transactions across 22 blockchains. That includes BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), Franklin Templeton’s BENJI, and the Hamilton Lane Private Infrastructure Fund. The company supports seven stablecoins and handles regulatory compliance requirements for its partners, positioning it as a backbone for asset managers deploying tokenized versions of traditional instruments like treasuries and private credit. The total value of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) on public blockchains reached $20.6 billion, up from $15.2 billion at the end of 2024, according to data from rwa.xyz. Zero Hash claimed it processed roughly 35% of that net inflow. "Tokenized finance is no longer theoretical," Zero hash founder and CEO Edward Woodford said in a statement. "Institutions are deploying real capital to tokenization and need the payment infrastructure to match.” Krisztian Sandor is a U.S. markets reporter focusing on stablecoins, tokenization, real-world assets.

Title: Unlimited Expands ETF Lineup with New Global Macro Hedge Fund Strategy

Time Published: 2025-04-15T13:05:00Z
Full Content:
April 15, 2025 09:05 ET | Source: Unlimited Unlimited NEW YORK, April 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bob Elliott, CEO and CIO of Unlimited, today announced the launch of the Unlimited HFGM Global Macro ETF (NYSE: HFGM), a new actively managed exchange-traded fund offering exposure to global macro hedge fund style strategies. The Fund capitalizes on Mr. Elliott’s extensive experience as a systematic global macro portfolio manager by dynamically allocating capital long and short across a wide range of global markets opportunities in search of mispricing. The fund utilizes liquid exchange-listed futures contracts, and a basket of ETFs based upon systematic signals. The positions are adjusted based on evolving market conditions with the goal of adding diversification benefits to investors’ portfolios. HFGM seeks to capitalize on global market mispricing opportunities spanning currency, fixed income, equity, credit and exchange rate markets. Global macro managers have a long track record of generating consistent alpha with low correlation to the broader equity and fixed income markets. HFGM deploys Unlimited’s proprietary, data-driven technology to interpret the current positioning of global macro managers and replicate those positions in its own portfolio. The launch of HFGM expands on Unlimited’s mission to provide investors with access to hedge fund-style returns without the high fees and tax inefficiencies that can erode performance over time. Unlimited’s ETF offering includes the Unlimited HFND Multi-Strategy Return Tracker ETF (NYSE: HFND), which has a two-year track record of offering investors exposure to a broad set of hedge fund style strategies. “Financial advisors and institutional investors facing turbulent markets are looking for ways to diversify their portfolios, but many find the high fees, lack of liquidity and adverse tax treatment associated with traditional alts offerings untenable," said Mr. Elliott. "Our Global Macro ETF was designed to offer a volatility target aligned with equity markets as an investor-friendly way to add the diversification features of alts to a balanced portfolio.” Hedge fund strategies overall have historically generated strong uncorrelated returns for investors, but high fees combined with inefficient tax structures have significantly eroded that performance. HFGM offers a transparent, liquid, and cost-effective alternative to traditional hedge fund allocations, carrying a lower expense ratio than the standard "2 and 20" hedge fund fee model. HFGM is the first of several new actively managed ETFs the firm plans to launch over the coming months. The suite includes two additional strategies that have been approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission with launch plans in the works for later this year, Unlimited HFMF Managed Futures ETF and Unlimited HFEQ Equity Long/Short ETF. Unlimited’s ETFs are managed by Mr. Elliott, former investment committee member at Bridgewater Associates and Bruce McNevin, co-founder and Chief Data Scientist at Unlimited. Mr. McNevin brings extensive experience in quantitative modeling and data science, having held positions at hedge funds Clinton Group and Midway Group, as well as Bank of America and BlackRock. For more information on HFGM or HFND, please visit https://www.unlimitedetfs.com Media Contacts: Before investing you should carefully consider the Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other information is in the prospectus. A prospectus may be obtained by visiting www.unlimitedetfs.com. Please read the prospectus carefully before you invest. Important Risks Underlying ETFs Risks. The Fund will incur higher and duplicative expenses because it invests in Underlying ETFs. There is also the risk that the Fund may suffer losses due to the investment practices of the Underlying ETFs. The Fund will be subject to substantially the same risks as those associated with the direct ownership of securities held by the Underlying .ETFs. Management Risk. The Fund is actively managed and may not meet its investment objective based on the Sub-Adviser’s success or failure to implement investment strategies for the Fund. Machine Learning, Model and Data Risk. The Fund relies heavily on proprietary “machine learning” selection processes. In addition, the composition of the Fund’s portfolio is heavily dependent on proprietary quantitative models as well as information and data supplied by third parties (“Models and Data”). Volatility Risk. The Fund seeks to achieve a higher level of volatility than its target hedge fund industry sector, which may result in substantial price fluctuations over short periods. As a result, the value of the Fund’s investments may rise or fall significantly, and investors should be prepared for increased levels of volatility compared to traditional equity funds. Commodity Risk. Underlying ETFs that invest in the commodities markets may be subject to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities. Derivatives Risk. The Fund’s or an Underlying ETF’s derivative investments have risks, including the imperfect correlation between the value of such instruments and the underlying assets or index; the loss of principal, including the potential loss of amounts greater than the initial amount invested in the derivative instrument; the possible default of the other party to the transaction; and illiquidity of the derivative investments. Emerging Markets Risk. The Fund may invest in Underlying ETFs that invest in securities issued by companies domiciled or headquartered in emerging market nations. Investments in securities traded in developing or emerging markets, or that provide exposure to such securities or markets, can involve additional risks relating to political, economic, currency, or regulatory conditions not associated with investments in U.S. securities and investments in more developed international markets. Fixed Income Securities Risk. The Fund may invest in Underlying ETFs that invest in fixed income securities. The prices of fixed income securities may be affected by changes in interest rates, the creditworthiness and financial strength of the issuer and other factors. An increase in prevailing interest rates typically causes the value of existing fixed income securities to fall and often has a greater impact on longer-duration and/or higher quality fixed income securities. Foreign Securities Risk. Foreign securities held by Underlying ETFs in which the Fund invests involve certain risks not involved in domestic investments and may experience more rapid and extreme changes in value than investments in securities of U.S. companies. Futures Contracts Risk. The Fund or Underlying ETFs may invest in futures contracts. Risks of futures contracts include: (i) an imperfect correlation between the value of the futures contract and the underlying asset; (ii) possible lack of a liquid secondary market; (iii) the inability to close a futures contract when desired; (iv) losses caused by unanticipated market movements, which may be unlimited; (v) an obligation for the Fund or an Underlying ETF, as applicable, to make daily cash payments to maintain its required margin, particularly at times when the Fund or Underlying ETF may have insufficient cash; and (vi) unfavorable execution prices from rapid selling. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Short Selling Risk. The Fund may make short sales of securities of Underlying ETFs, which involves selling a security it does not own in anticipation that the price of the security will decline. Short sales may involve substantial risk and leverage. Short sales expose the Fund to the risk that it will be required to buy (“cover”) the security sold short when the security has appreciated in value or is unavailable, thus resulting in a loss to the Fund. Short sales also involve the risk that losses may exceed the amount invested and may be unlimited. Swap Agreement Risk. The Fund or an Underlying ETF may invest in swap agreements. Swap agreements could result in losses if the underlying asset or reference does not perform as anticipated. Swaps can have the potential for unlimited losses. They are also subject to counterparty risk. If the counterparty fails to meet its obligations, the Fund (or the Underlying Fund) may lose money. Definitions: 20 and 2 strategy: Describes the standard fee structure charged by advisers of private funds, which generally includes a 2% asset-based management fee, in addition to a 20% performance fee charged on the profits on investments.

Title: Should India Follow the US and Establish a Bitcoin Reserve?

Time Published: 2025-04-15T12:32:46Z

Photo Credit: Unsplash The valuation of the crypto sector currently stands at $2.7 trillion (roughly Rs. 2,31,56.903 crore) US President Donald Trump announced the creation of separate reserves for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the US last month, in a boost for the digital assets sector. The decision prompted Sweden and South Korea to open dialogue around considering Bitcoin as a potential reserved asset. There's currently no word on whether the Government of India is planning to establish a strategic crypto reserve. Gadgets 360 discussed the possibility of India's Bitcoin reserve with Polygon and Avail co-founders Sandeep Nailwal and Anurag Arjun. Polygon founder Nailwal said that US President Donald Trump has kickstarted a race to acquire Bitcoin and other altcoins for long-term benefits to the US economy. He said that India, which is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, may regret its conservative approach on crypto if it fails to catch up with other big economies in a timely manner. “The world is long past the days when Bitcoin was considered an experiment or simply a haven for criminals. Some of the world's largest asset managers, sovereign wealth funds, and national governments have invested large amounts of money in BTC and the broader altcoin market, indicating the rising adoption of the asset class,” Nailwal told Gadgets 360. Abu Dhabi's investment company, Mubadala and Norway's Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM) are prominent financial firms that have begun to deal with Bitcoin via investments in pro-crypto firms like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and BlackRock's Bitcoin ETFs. In India, Mumbai-based IT training firm Jetking has acquired Bitcoin tokens worth Rs. 10 crore. The January 2025 edition of the World Bank's Global Economic Prospects (GEP) report projected India's economy to grow at a steady rate of 6.7 percent in both FY26 and FY27, significantly outpacing global and regional peers. The IMF also estimates India's growth to remain robust at 6.5 percent for 2025 and 2026. "India can seriously consider creating a crypto stockpile to diversify its reserves and elevate the integration of blockchain with its economic ecosystem," Nailwal said. However, Polygon chief also cautioned that the authorities need to strengthen tech infrastructure, cybersecurity, and introduce a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies before establishing a crypto reserve. Existing gaps in crypto awareness, legal provisions, and enforcement of criminal punishments could pose risks to India's financial stability if crypto is considered as a reserved asset. India can allocate one to two percent of its foreign exchange reserves to crypto assets as a pragmatic starting point, Avail Co-Founder Anurag Arjun told Gadgets 360. Avail is a blockchain firm that supports the design of Web3 applications. Arjun also co-founded Polygon alongside Nailwal in 2017 but exited the firm in 2023. "India needs to see the creation of a crypto reserve as more than just about jumping on a trend. It's more about positioning India strategically in a rapidly evolving global financial landscape," Arjun said. “An small allocation of India's foreign exchange reserves to crypto makes for a modest exposure that limits risk while enabling India to experiment strategically, mirroring institutions like BlackRock (managing $50 billion in Bitcoin ETFs) and corporations like MicroStrategy, whose stock surged 1,500 percent after adopting Bitcoin as a treasury reserve. In the short term, such a move would position India as a forward-thinking economy, attracting blockchain innovation and global capital,” he added. Avail's co-founder also highlighted that Bitcoin's fixed supply of 21 million tokens offers protection against inflationary pressures in traditional currencies, serving as a hedge against monetary instability in an increasingly uncertain world. “With 17 percent of the global population and a tech-savvy workforce, India has the demographic and intellectual capital to lead rather than follow. Digital assets offer a hedge against dollar hegemony, a tool for financial inclusion, and a bridge to the digital economy—critical for sustaining growth in a digitising world. A late entry into the race would mean acquiring assets at significantly higher prices, placing India at a strategic disadvantage,” he added. India is also at liberty to keenly analyse US' step of putting seized crypto funds into its crypto reserves. In February this year, India's Enforcement Directorate (ED) seized its biggest crypto fund worth Rs. 1,646 crore investigating a money laundering case. Other similar probes have also roped in hefty crypto funds that have been placed under the custodies of Binance, ZepPay, WazirX, and CoinDCX. Nimen Shah, a senior chartered accountant and international tax advisor from Mumbai, said India's financial position is on solid ground, which eliminates any urgency for it to venture into creating crypto reserves. "Cryptocurrencies are volatile and still largely unregulated. They enable private financial transactions without the involvement of any central bank or broker, making them susceptible to misuse by criminals. Because crypto lets individuals process financial transactions without an intermediary, it threatens the autonomy and control of central banks on a global level," Shah told Gadgets 360. Over the last few years, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) lifted its ban on crypto, while the government introduced a 30 percent tax on cryptocurrency incomes, which has been criticised by many crypto investors. In 2024, former RBI governor Shaktikanta Das called crypto risky and highly speculative, addressing the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman also stated last year that crypto cannot be viewed as a legitimate currency in India. “India need not rush into a creating a crypto reserve. Given the apprehensions of the RBI and other stakeholders, it would be a very long leap to go from zero regulations to crypto reserves,” Shah said, while dismissing the idea of crypto becoming an alternative to the US dollar for India. He said that crypto activities are more intensive in the US than in India. “Crypto is not big enough either as an industry or as an acceptable enough asset class to impact our monetary policy or our financial system. We are a long way away from there,” Shah added. As of Tuesday, the valuation of the crypto sector stood at $2.7 trillion (roughly Rs. 2,31,56.903 crore) with over 13 million tokens in circulation. Bitcoin, the most expensive crypto token, is presently trading at $85,600 (roughly Rs. 73.4 lakh).

Title: ‘You couldn’t make it up’: Customers told publican of plan to demolish his business for Cork Luas route
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/2025/04/15/you-couldnt-make-it-up-customers-told-publican-of-plan-to-demolish-his-business-for-cork-luas-route/
Time Published: 2025-04-15T12:31:51Z
Full Content:
A publican has said he learned from customers that his business might be acquired and demolished as part of the proposed €2 billion Luas Cork project. Con Dennehy, who runs the Venue Bar in Ballintemple with his partner Kate Tierney, said he thought it was a late April Fool’s prank when he heard Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) had earmarked the bar for demolition as part of its “emerging preferred route” (EPR) for the light rail system. A 39-page TII document outlines the proposed route for Luas Cork, which would see it running down the Cork Docklands towards Páirc Uí Chaoimh and towards Ballintemple village, where the Venue has operated for more than 100 years. “The EPR then crosses Blackrock Road and on to Churchyard Lane where a portion of landtake will be required to facilitate the alignment,” it notes. “This includes the acquisition of the Venue Bar, a well-known Ballintemple landmark. It is proposed to reinstate this corner site as part of the works.” Mr Dennehy told The Irish Times he was inundated with texts and screenshots of a page from the document on Monday while the proposed route was being officially announced by Taoiseach Michéal Martin and Minister for Transport Darragh O’Brien at Cork City Hall. “I said to Kate ‘Is this April first or what?‘,” he said. “One of the staff rang then and said ‘When were ye going to tell me the bar is going to be demolished?‘. They thought we knew about it but we knew nothing at all about it. It was the first we heard of it.” He said he arrived at the bar at 2pm and there was a letter from TII with a brochure and maps outlining the plan. Mr Dennehy and Ms Tierney have run the Venue for 10 years and the pub is popular with GAA and music fans due to it being a five-minute walk from Páirc Uí Chaoimh and the Docklands site where the Live at the Marquee concerts are held. He said the planned acquisition of his premises could have serious implications for the business. While he and Ms Tierney have no immediate plans to sell the pub, Mr Dennehy said it could put off potential buyers should they seek to do so in the future. Mr Dennehy said he had not yet read through the entire consultation document, but the Venue appears to be one of only two or three businesses named and identified for acquisition. “What I find absolutely amazing about this is that yesterday’s event was the launch of a public consultation process and they don’t see fit to consult or inform people directly affected by their plans. You couldn’t make it up,” he said. In a statement, TII said Monday’s launch was the start of a consultation period for the EPR and it was committed “to engaging fully with all stakeholders as the project is refined and developed. “We informed Mr Dennehy at the earliest opportunity about the impact which the proposed scheme would have on his property,” it said. “It is TII’s policy to inform all affected stakeholders at the same time and Mr Dennehy was treated no differently to any of the other affected stakeholders.” TII said it intended to be fair and transparent and that affected stakeholders should “contact us at their earliest convenience so we can discuss their individual situations”.

Title: Rocket Lab tapped for major defense contracts to advance hypersonic testing

The U.S. Air Force has brought Rocket Lab onboard its $46 billion Enterprise-Wide Agile Acquisition Contract (EWAAC), an indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity (IDIQ) arrangement intended to streamline access to innovative technologies and services. Structured for flexibility in funding and application, EWAAC runs through 2031 and enables rapid procurement of technical solutions across domains. Simultaneously, the United Kingdom's Ministry of Defence has included Rocket Lab in its Hypersonic Technologies and Capability Development Framework (HTCDF), a program valued at approximately $1.3 billion (\xa31 billion). Through this framework, Rocket Lab is now eligible to compete for contracts that will support the UK's pursuit of sovereign hypersonic technology. Rocket Lab plans to offer a suite of services under both frameworks, including use of its Hypersonic Accelerator Suborbital Test Electron (HASTE) vehicle. HASTE is a suborbital derivative of the Electron rocket and shares many core features, such as carbon composite construction and 3D-printed Rutherford engines. However, it includes a modified Kick Stage and is optimized for hypersonic test applications, with a payload capacity of up to 700 kg (1,540 lbs). Capable of delivering payloads at speeds exceeding 7.5 km per second, HASTE supports testing of high-speed air-breathing systems, gliders, ballistic vehicles, and reentry technologies. To date, Rocket Lab has completed three HASTE missions for the U.S. Department of Defense, including two launches within a span of just 21 days. These missions were conducted from Launch Complex 2 at Wallops Island, Virginia. Combined with its broader operations, Rocket Lab has launched over 200 payloads from its sites in the United States and New Zealand. Sir Peter Beck, Rocket Lab founder and CEO, remarked: "The ability to contribute toward the collective security of the United States and the United Kingdom across both of these important programs is a proud moment for the HASTE team, and a demonstration of Rocket Lab's commitment to lead from the front when it comes to innovative and unique solutions for hypersonic technology development. Keeping pace with global developments means more affordable tests at a higher rate that expands the boundaries of hypersonic technology - and that's a capability we're already providing all in one platform with HASTE, at a commercial price and cadence that serves the mission of both nations."

Title: The future of IRS Direct File looks grim
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/irs-direct-file-trouble-tax-day-mistake-angst-2025-4
Time Published: 2025-04-15T12:05:32Z
Full Content:
Hello! It's Tax Day in America. Wishing you all luck from afar — hopefully, you don't follow in my colleague Zak Jason's steps and forget to attach your W2. And today's big story is right on theme: We're taking a look at what's going on inside the IRS. What's on deck Markets: One crucial consequence of President Trump's trade war is being overlooked. Tech: Facebook isn't about connecting with friends anymore, Mark Zuckerberg said during day one of Meta's antitrust trial. Business: These automakers are picking up the slack from Tesla's slumping sales. But first, let's talk taxes. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. How are you filing your taxes this year? You might be using IRS Direct File, the nation's first free tax-filing system. But its future is looking grim: A senior Treasury official told BI it was a failed and disappointing program used by only a small fraction of the nation's taxpayers. Sam Corcos, a DOGE official and one of the group's public faces, has also said he thinks the relatively new program should be shut down, sources told BI. The uncertainty has disappointed people who believe Direct File is emblematic of the very things that DOGE is supposed to be building, BI's Juliana Kaplan and Jack Newsham write. It's meant as a tech solution to file taxes quickly and directly to the IRS, bypassing fees to for-profit software companies. However, critics of the tool say it's too costly and wasn't implemented legally. Tax season is a source of angst for many Americans. This year, some IRS employees who have returned to the office are in the same boat. Workers under the IRS's return-to-office mandate said they've operated out of conference rooms and cafeterias, battled spotty internet connections, and navigated boxes of paperwork scattered throughout the halls. IRS employees told BI that while RTO had come with certain upsides, like leaving work at the office, the return has been tumultuous and the opposite of efficient. "People are not happy, and it's going to affect productivity going forward," one employee said. 1. An overlooked byproduct of Trump's trade: the weakest dollar in years. Typically seen as a safe haven during market volatility, the US dollar index is sitting near a three-year low. This may reflect souring global sentiment toward the US following unpredictable tariffs. 2. Webull's stock is soaring. The digital investment platform's shares spiked as much as 500% to $79.56 on Monday. Webull went public via SPAC merger after combining with SK Growth Opportunities and delaying its IPO plans in 2021. 3. Asia's auto stocks surge. Major automakers like Toyota and Honda saw significant stock gains on Tuesday after Trump said he was considering a temporary exemption on imports. 1. Apple can't catch a break right now. On Friday, the iPhone maker appeared to be off the hook on tariffs until President Trump clarified on Sunday that tech products would be subject to separate levies in the future. But Apple's China problem goes beyond tariffs. 2. Trump's trade war is putting robots to work. The robots-as-a-service company Formic said its customers have increased their robot usage this year. It's likely these brands were using robots to save money ahead of tariff-related price increases. 3. Facebook isn't really for friends, Mark Zuckerberg said. In a landmark antitrust case, the FTC is arguing that Meta monopolizes apps that share content with friends and family. Zuckerberg testified Facebook's main purpose has evolved beyond connecting with friends. 1. The biggest winners from Tesla's sales slump. The carmaker's competitors are taking bigger bites of Tesla's market share while the overall EV market grows. In the US, GM and Ford are some of the big winners, while BMW and VW are soaring in Europe. 2. Starbucks baristas' new fit. Starting May 12, Starbucks store employees will be required to wear a solid-color black top to highlight the iconic green apron. The dress code is the latest change the coffee chain has made as it tries to boost sales. 3. Pay us or give us a TV show. A Trump ally suggested Warner Bros. Discovery could please the president by offering money, programming, or both. That says a lot about the relationship between the president and the media in 2025, Peter Kafka writes.

Posted on April 15, 2025 by Selcuk Disci in R bloggers | 0 Comments The exemption of key electronic components from tariffs is likely to positively impact Apple more, which manufactures approximately 90% of its iPhones in China, compared to other tech giants like Microsoft and Nvidia. Furthermore, the k-means clustering chart shows that Apple has diverged year to date, specifically after the April 2 tariffs. Source code: Copyright © 2025 | MH Corporate basic by MH Themes

Title: 'I’m from the technocracy and I’m here to help' - how tech bros are taking over the world
URL: https://www.computerweekly.com/opinion/Im-from-the-technocracy-and-Im-here-to-help-how-tech-bros-are-taking-over-the-world
Time Published: 2025-04-15T07:18:00Z
Full Content:
Michael Kvakin - Fotolia When I first saw the photos of all of the tech broligarchy lined up behind Donald Trump on his inauguration day something struck me as off. I couldn't figure out what was bothering me until now. I realised they didn't just look like very powerful attendees, they looked much more like very powerful shareholders in government - and unelected ones at that. We can see today where that power translates directly into US government policymaking with the reductions on certain tech tariffs from China. Let's look at what that means for Apple alone. With 90% of iPhones manufactured in China, Apple faced potential price increases of up to $3,500 per phone under the proposed 145% tariff. In 2024, US imports of smartphones from China were valued at $41.7bn while laptops were valued at $33.1bn. The tariff exemption therefore translates into avoided costs of approximately $60bn annually for these two categories alone. And while Apple will have only a share of that benefit, it's a staggering return for Tim Cook's donation of $1m to Trump’s inaugural committee - which also marked Cook’s first time attending a presidential inauguration, despite his political views often differing from Trump’s policies. But it's not only tech’s influence in policymaking areas such as tariffs that directly affect their bottom line, we need to think about their broader reach in the realm of geopolitics. Where did the ideas of making Canada the 51st State, or annexing Greenland actually emerge from? If there was a policy vacuum here it was neatly filled by none other than Elon Musk drawing on the ideas of his maternal grandfather Joshua Norman Haldeman. Haldeman was a key proponent of the Technocracy movement which started in the early 1930s in the US and then spread to Canada. It proposed the creation of the Technate of America. This would do away with borders, merging the US, Canada, Mexico, Central America and Greenland into a single nation under a regime of engineers and technicians. Sounds familiar, right? Its essential argument was that there was no room for politics in society and that engineers and scientists were best placed to decide what was best for citizens in terms of organising resources and society. In 2019 Musk tweeted on X, “Accelerating Starship development to build the Martian Technocracy”. Except now it looks like he is not waiting to do it on Mars, he's doing it here in real time. The idea of the futility of the nation state and of politics in favour of new technological frontiers is echoed in The sovereign individual published in 1997. This book examined the social, economic and political implications of the coming technology on society and particularly politics and governments. Authors James Dale Davidson and William Rees-Mogg - father of Jacob Rees-Mogg - wrote, “Representative democracy as it is now known will fade away to be replaced by the new democracy of choice in the cybermarketplace. If our deductions are correct the politics of the next century will be much more varied and less important than that to which we have become accustomed. The 20th century nation-state will starve to death as its tax revenues decline,” Or, as Mark Zuckerberg puts it, “Companies not countries”. The authors also predicted the impact of coming technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) when they wrote, “Lifetime employment will disappear as jobs increasingly become tasks or piece work rather than positions within an organisation. New survival strategies will evolve involving greater concentration on the development of leisure skills, sports abilities as well as providing services to the growing numbers of sovereign individuals as income inequality within jurisdictions rises.” The tome has had a substantial impact in Silicon Valley with Rees-Mogg travelling there more than a decade after the book's publication to discuss it with students at Stanford University. In 2014, PayPal founder and Trump advisor Peter Thiel told Forbes magazine that The sovereign individual had influenced him more than any other book. Indeed, in recently republished versions of the book Thiel has provided a new foreword. And Thiel’s investments align with these principles where he believes that cryptocurrency ventures will bypass traditional monetary systems. Expect further policy reach in the future in the provision of universal basic income (UBI), which many of these tech bros are very keen on. They understand more than most how many professions are under threat and how many people will be left without work. What are people to do when their labour is no longer required? Perhaps they will spend their time in the fantasy worlds created by technologists, doomscrolling endlessly on Insta and other platforms while being paid by the government via UBI. This is what the author Jonathan Taplin tackles in his book The end of reality when he says “That is my greatest fear: that enchanted by the magic of the Technocrats’ immutable money, infinite frontiers, eternal life we will sleep through a right-wing revolution and wake up to find our democracy gone and our children being turned into Meta cyborgs”. And if you think having Trump as President of the United States with Elon Musk as his sidekick is a nightmare, ponder if you will the dystopian prospect of Mark Zuckerberg running for the highest office. Can you imagine the data he has amassed that could be used to further his political ambitions? What opponents might be suppressed or compromised? Yet as described in Sarah Wynn-Williams recent book Careless people, Zuckerberg has already paved the way for his political ambitions from as far back as 2017 when he finally realised how important Facebook was in the election of Donald Trump. In her insider account, Wynn-Williams wrote, “He also had Facebook’s board approve a new stock structure that would allow him to run for office. The filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission expressly allows Mark Zuckerberg to leave Facebook for up to two years without losing control of the company if his absence is ‘in connection with his serving in a government position or office’.” These are not benign actors, scrappy startup founders who move fast and break things - they share world views that are destroying our democracies as we know it. Yet politicians are in thrall to the power that these men yield. We may already be existing in the new technocracy for our times. They already decide how and when we should use their products, removing our choice and agency – consider the recent inclusion of Meta AI into WhatsApp, which you cannot turn off. Ronald Reagan once said the nine most terrifying words in the English language are, “I'm from the government and I'm here to help.” So if you hear, “I’m from the technocracy and I’m here to help,” you won't be surprised if it's our new form of government.

Title: Total Control 24 (TC24) Under Review: Best Prostate Health Supplement for Men in 2025

April 14, 2025 20:14 ET | Source: Total Control 24 (TC24) Total Control 24 (TC24) New York City, April 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 1. Introduction: Prostate Health in Men Over 40 Prostate health is one of the most overlooked yet critical areas of concern for aging men. As men enter their 40s and beyond, hormonal shifts, inflammation, and lifestyle changes begin to impact the health of the prostate gland—a small but vital organ that supports urinary function and reproductive health. Recent studies reveal that nearly 50% of men in their 50s and up to 90% of men in their 80s suffer from symptoms related to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), an age-associated enlargement of the prostate. These symptoms include: For many, these symptoms emerge gradually and are often dismissed as a regular part of aging. However, untreated BPH can significantly reduce quality of life. It disrupts sleep, causes anxiety in social settings, and contributes to chronic fatigue and low mood. Most men are unaware that the underlying triggers are often tied to an overproduction of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), declining testosterone levels, and elevated oxidative stress that inflames the prostate tissue. These biological shifts reduce urinary flow efficiency, disrupt bladder function, and can impact overall male vitality. While prescription medications like alpha-blockers or 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors are commonly used, they often come with unwanted side effects such as dizziness, low libido, or sexual dysfunction. That's why more men are turning to natural prostate supplements to regain control of their health—without harsh chemicals. This brings us to Total Control 24 (TC24), a revolutionary prostate support supplement that is being recognized as a top-rated formula for prostate health in men over 40. Designed to support normal prostate size, healthy urinary flow, and hormonal balance, TC24 combines clinically researched, bioavailable ingredients into a powerful daily solution. In this in-depth review, we will examine how Total Control 24 works, explore the top prostate health ingredients, evaluate the science behind its formula, compare it with other popular prostate supplements, and outline the pricing, return policy, and customer satisfaction guarantee. If you are seeking the best prostate health supplement that delivers results naturally, Total Control 24 deserves your attention. 2. Understanding the Problem: Why You're Experiencing Prostate Symptoms As men age, prostate-related discomfort becomes increasingly common—and it's not just about getting older. Several interconnected biological and environmental factors contribute to the gradual decline of prostate function. Understanding these causes is the first step toward lasting relief and better health. Hormonal Shifts and DHT Accumulation One of the primary drivers behind prostate enlargement is the hormonal imbalance that occurs with age. Testosterone levels begin to decline in a man's 40s, while dihydrotestosterone (DHT)—a more potent derivative of testosterone—often remains elevated. DHT can cause the cells in the prostate to multiply excessively, leading to an enlarged gland that puts pressure on the urethra. This creates frustrating urinary issues, including weak stream, urgency, and nighttime urination. Oxidative Stress and Inflammation Oxidative stress occurs when there is an imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants in the body. In the prostate, this can lead to inflammation and cellular damage. Chronic inflammation is a key factor in the development of BPH and may even contribute to more serious conditions if not addressed. Antioxidant-rich nutrients, like those found in TC24, help reduce this inflammation and protect the prostate against cellular breakdown. Lifestyle Factors That Exacerbate Symptoms In addition to biological changes, lifestyle habits also influence prostate health. Poor diet, lack of physical activity, alcohol consumption, and chronic stress can all worsen urinary symptoms and hormone imbalances. Additionally, high body fat can lead to increased estrogen production in men, further throwing off the delicate balance of male hormones. The Emotional Toll of Prostate Problems The daily struggle of dealing with frequent bathroom trips, poor sleep, or sexual dissatisfaction is more than a physical burden—it can affect self-confidence, work performance, and relationships. Many men report feeling embarrassed or isolated due to their symptoms, which in turn can lead to anxiety or even depression. Prostate issues are not just an inconvenience; they are an actual quality-of-life issue. The good news is that men do not have to live with these challenges. Addressing the root causes of prostate issues—hormonal imbalance, inflammation, and oxidative stress—can deliver lasting relief. This is precisely where Total Control 24 excels, providing a natural and comprehensive approach to restoring prostate health. Learn More About Total Control 24 Ingredients and How They Support Prostate Wellness 3. What is Total Control 24 (TC24)? Total Control 24 (TC24) is a next-generation prostate health supplement created by Adem Naturals. Designed specifically for men over 40 who are struggling with the signs of prostate enlargement and urinary discomfort, TC24 offers a multi-action formula targeting the key root causes of prostate decline. Rather than simply masking symptoms, TC24 works to support: This advanced supplement is manufactured in the USA in an FDA-registered, GMP-certified facility. TC24 uses a clean-label formula that is non-GMO, free of gluten and soy, and contains no artificial additives or fillers. Each capsule delivers a potent dose of herbal extracts, minerals, and antioxidants—all of which are selected for their ability to support long-term prostate health. Its formula includes several clinically backed ingredients such as Pygeum Africanum, Lipophytol®, Boron, and Myrciaria Jaboticaba, which work synergistically to promote urinary comfort and hormonal harmony. What makes Total Control 24 unique is its strategic formulation: the combination of time-tested herbs and patented nutrients designed for bioavailability, precision dosing, and comprehensive coverage of prostate and urinary functions. Whether you're just starting to notice changes in your urinary habits or have been living with BPH-related discomfort for years, TC24 presents a compelling, natural solution worth considering. The Science Behind Total Control 24 Ingredients Myrciaria Jaboticaba (Jaboticaba) Myrciaria jaboticaba is a Brazilian superfruit known for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. It is rich in polyphenols such as ellagic acid and anthocyanins, which play a central role in modulating inflammation—a key contributor to prostate enlargement and discomfort. Recent research from the Federal University of Alfenas (2024) demonstrated that jaboticaba peel extract significantly reduces markers of oxidative stress and cellular inflammation. Additionally, a 2020 study published in the journal Food & Function found that its polyphenolic compounds protect DNA from oxidative damage, a critical factor in preventing cellular aging and potential mutation in prostate cells. Further evidence published in Food Chemistry (2025) and ScienceDirect highlights jaboticaba's role in reducing nitric oxide overproduction, which is often elevated in inflamed prostate tissue. This makes jaboticaba an essential component of natural prostate health formulas, helping maintain cellular integrity, reduce swelling, and support normal prostate function. Lipophytol® (Phytosterol Complex) Lipophytol® is a patented microencapsulated phytosterol complex that delivers enhanced bioavailability of beta-sitosterol and related plant sterols. These compounds are known to inhibit 5-alpha-reductase, the enzyme that converts testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone closely associated with prostate growth and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Studies confirm that beta-sitosterol can improve urinary flow, reduce post-void residual volume, and alleviate symptoms like urgency and weak stream. Lipophytol®'s advanced encapsulation ensures better stability and absorption, allowing for more consistent and reliable results. As a DHT blocker and bladder support agent, Lipophytol® helps address hormonal imbalances and urinary discomfort, two common issues affecting men with aging prostates. Pygeum africanum (African Plum Tree Bark Extract) Pygeum africanum has been used for decades in European herbal medicine to treat prostate-related urinary symptoms. Its bioactive compounds—phytosterols, triterpenes, and ferulic acid esters—exhibit both anti-inflammatory and anti-androgenic effects. According to a Cochrane meta-analysis and studies published in The American Journal of Medicine, Pygeum extract consistently reduces the frequency of nighttime urination, increases peak urine flow, and lowers the volume of residual urine. It also helps regulate hormonal activity within the prostate, contributing to symptom relief in men with enlarged prostates. With extensive clinical support, Pygeum provides multidimensional benefits, targeting inflammation, supporting hormone regulation, and improving quality of life through enhanced urinary function. Boron Boron is a trace mineral that plays a significant role in maintaining prostate health, particularly through its effects on hormone metabolism and inflammation. Research in Cancer Causes & Control (2007) and other peer-reviewed journals have shown that men with higher boron intake have a lower incidence of prostate cancer. Boron helps balance testosterone and estrogen levels, lowers prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and enhances vitamin D metabolism—all of which are beneficial for prostate tissue maintenance. It also exhibits anti-inflammatory properties by modulating cytokines and reducing oxidative stress markers. In the context of Total Control 24, boron acts as a foundational mineral that enhances hormonal balance and supports prostate health at the cellular level, especially in aging men.

Title: The Business of the AI Labs

Apr 11, 2025 • Max I will soon be joining Anthropic, and so this is my last opportunity to write down some thoughts on the AI lab business model before I can be accused of spilling any inside information. Although large language model (LLM) providers like OpenAI and Anthropic have spearheaded a new AI revolution, it is still not clear at this point that they are good businesses. The question on the minds of investors is whether these pioneering labs will reap profits, or whether instead other parts of the AI ecosystem (hardware vendors, cloud platforms, or end-user companies) will capture the lion’s share of value. This article surveys the competitive landscape and suggests some strategies that the labs could pursue to secure good economics for themselves. (While questions of AI safety its broader societal impact are important, I will leave these topics aside here and focus purely on the financial angle.) I. No technical leader The status quo is that labs are spending considerable resources training successively better models. For example, OpenAI has raised $60bn, Meta is spending as much as $60bn per year, and xAI has raised $12bn. Their reward for deploying these resources is to spend just a few months at the top of the benchmark leaderboards before being supplanted by a competitor. Despite the increasingly secretive development process of LLM technology, no lab has been able to take a decisive technical lead. Why does this happen? Perhaps the most important factor is that the labs are making many parallel discoveries. Technological breakthroughs often appear simultaneously as soon as prerequisites are in place - consider Newton and Leibnitz, or Tesla and Marconi. Even in the case where ideas aren’t rediscovered independently, many of these labs are based in California, where employment law that is hostile to non-compete agreements allows employees - and hence ideas - to flow freely throughout the community. Once public, ideas spread like wildfire. For instance, the Transformer architecture itself (from Google’s 2017 paper “Attention is All You Need”) was rapidly adopted by everyone even in domains far outside the original machine translation usecase. More recently, techniques like LoRA or FlashAttention provide big efficiency gains and are implemented widely mere months after invention. Working in favour of parallel discovery is that LLMs remain fundamentally simple technology, so you might expect that a lot of the improvements that make them better are also relatively simple. Consider that a complete specification for a leading open-source LLM such as Lllama can be written in a few hundred lines of pytorch. Torch itself can be implemented in less than a thousand lines of code. Validating this intuition, Dario Amodei has said that Anthropic has “$100 million secrets that are a few lines of code”. II. Competitors abound Barriers to entry in the industry do not seem to be high - witness, for example, the quick ascendancy of xAI. The technical progress made by incumbent labs can be replicated by making the right hires. Once you have this knowledge, actual model training costs are quite moderate. Notoriously, the Deepseek R3’s main training run cost only $5m. Anthrophic’s CEO, Dario Amodei, reports that Claude 3.5 Sonnet cost “a few $10M’s to train”. Putting these numbers in the context of the multi-billion-dollar funding rounds by the labs, it seems that most of the spend must be on smaller-scale experiments and researcher time - which seemingly only serves to create IP with a very short shelflife. This means that deep-pocketed investors have continued to fund new entrants, fuelling the Red Queen’s race in LLM tech. They do this because of desire for a regional champion (Mistral), concerns about AI safety (Anthropic), to avoid dependence on a limited group of suppliers (Meta), a desire to “democratise” access to AI (Stability), or perhaps just ego (xAI). A related factor keeping barriers to entry low is that of model extraction, where you train your own model on output from another. As early as 2020, a paper found that you could get 90%+ agreement with a victim BERT model for only a few hundred dollars worth of tokens generated by the victim. In 2023, Stanford replicated GPT 3.5’s instruction tuning on a Llama base model using just $500 worth of tokens. By some estimates, a leading LLM can be replicated by training your own model on just 1T output tokens from the victim model: the cost of these tokens for GPT-4o would be just ~$5m. Although there is only weak evidence for it, some suspect that DeepSeek’s frontier models partially owe their excellent benchmark performance to being trained on GPT-4o output. The implication is stark. An LLM lab might invest tens of millions in training a cutting-edge model, only to have others reap the benefits by training cheap knock-offs using its outputs. This dynamic is reminiscent of generic drugs copying a pharmaceutical formula: the R&D investment is large, but once the product is released to the public, copycats can emerge at marginal cost. LLM labs are not blind to this threat. They impose API terms to forbid using their model outputs to train competitors. But enforcement is difficult and moreover, labs face a dilemma: the more widely they distribute and monetize their models (which they need to do to recoup costs), the more they enable potential distillation by third parties. III. Strategic dynamics In classic tech strategy, one way to gain power is to commoditize your complement – make the product or input that you don’t sell cheap and abundant, so that demand (and pricing power) increases for the part you do sell. In the AI ecosystem, we see multiple players applying this strategy against each other: LLM Labs vs. Compute Providers (Nvidia, et al.): Training and inferencing cutting-edge models requires vast compute, much of which is supplied by Nvidia’s GPUs (or similar AI chips). From a lab’s perspective, this dependency is dangerous – if one vendor holds a near-monopoly on hardware, they can extract a lot of the value via high chip prices. Nvidia earns an extraordinary gross margin of more than 70%, even while selling cards at MSRP far lower than the grey market price. LLM labs are thus highly motivated to commoditize the hardware side. We see Anthropic, for example, making sure its models run on a variety of hardware: they use Google’s TPU v5e chips “at scale” for training Claude, and they also partner with Amazon to use AWS’s custom Trainium accelerators. Hyperscalers (Cloud Platforms) vs. LLM Labs: The big cloud providers – Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud – view AI models as valuable content that can drive compute consumption on their platforms. But if one model lab becomes too powerful (able to dictate high prices or exclusive access), it threatens the cloud’s control. So hyperscalers try to commoditize the models themselves. One approach is backing multiple AI labs and open models: e.g. Amazon has invested in Anthropic, while also partnering with smaller startups and supporting open-source Hugging Face models on its Bedrock service. Microsoft has a special relationship with OpenAI, but it also hosts alternatives (like Meta’s LLaMA) on Azure, and develops its own “Phi” model inhouse. Google has its in-house models (PaLM, Gemini, etc.) but also invested in Anthropic to cover a second source. The cloud wants customers to view models as swappable commodities available through its API marketplace and commoditize the LLM model layer, so that the real money is made on cloud infrastructure usage. This is classic complement commoditization: make the AI model cheap (or even free) so that customers use more cloud compute and storage. AI Customers (Enterprises, Tech Companies) vs. Both Labs and Cloud: Large consumer-facing companies like Meta, and many enterprise users of AI, have a stake in not becoming overly dependent on outside AI providers. For them, the AI model (and even cloud) is a input to their core business – a complement to what they do. Their incentive is to commoditize AI capabilities so that they can integrate intelligence into their products without paying monopoly rents. Zuckerberg has described Meta’s open-sourcing of LLaMA in this light: by releasing a high-quality model to the public, Meta hopes to undermine the proprietary advantage of OpenAI et al and ensure a competitive pool of models. If everyone has strong LLMs, no single supplier can overcharge Meta or dominate the market narrative – and Meta itself can benefit from the community improvements on these models. In summary, there is a strategic tug-of-war in the AI ecosystem: Each player tries to commoditize the other layers. This strategic dynamic will heavily influence profit pools. If the hyperscalers succeed, the labs could see their models become low-margin components, with most profit accruing to the cloud platforms selling the compute cycles. And if open-source efforts backed by users succeed, no one supplier may have big margins – AI might become an infrastructure commodity that end-users deploy at cost. IV. A way out? So, LLM labs spend huge resources just to keep pace technically with a growing number of competitors, all while facing intense commoditization pressure from the other actors in the ecosystem. Is there any reason to believe that these can become good businesses? One point of hope is that while OpenAI’s API margins are being compressed, as of early 2024 they were still at a relatively healthy 55% level. More recently, DeepSeek claimed an 80% gross margin. Revenue growth is also extremely healthy - OpenAI expects revenue to triple in 2025. Anthropic is growing even faster, albeit from a lower base. How can these margins and revenue growth levels be sustained long term, given the neck-and-neck nature of the technical race and wide field of competitors? Ideas would include: I think it’s worth paying particular attention to the “drop in remote worker”, as envisioned in e.g. Aschenbrenner’s Situational Awareness. A number of labs (Anthropic, OpenAI, Manus) are working towards an AI agent that you would be able to onboard to your company’s intranet just like any remote employee, and which could then e.g. start to code its way through your JIRA backlog, come up with new product designs, coordinate with suppliers to negotiate costs, or prepare reports on business strategy. This has a number of advantages over the current business of selling tokens: In short, while there are certainly challenges to the AI lab business model, it does seem like there are a lot of strategic options open to them. It seems unlikely to me that the labs will end up being completely commoditized - so maybe there is some hope for my Anthropic stock options after all :-) © - Powered by Jekyll & whiteglass - Subscribe via RSS

Brian Witte, Associated Press Brian Witte, Associated Press Barbara Ortutay, Associated Press Barbara Ortutay, Associated Press Leave your feedback WASHINGTON (AP) — A historic antitrust trial began Monday for Meta Platforms Inc. in a case that could force the tech giant to break off Instagram and WhatsApp, startups it bought more than a decade ago that have since grown into social media powerhouses. The trial is bringing Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg into federal court in Washington to testify. In opening statements, Federal Trade Commission attorney Daniel Matheson said Meta has used a monopoly to generate enormous profits as consumer satisfaction has dropped. He said Meta was “erecting a moat” to protect its interests by buying the two startups because the company feared they were a threat to Meta’s dominance. Zuckerberg and other Meta witnesses will testify during the trial. “We’re going to give them their chance to tell their side of the story,” Matheson said. Mark Hansen, an attorney for Meta, said the FTC was making a “grab bag” of arguments that were wrong. He said Meta has plenty of competition and has made improvements to the startups it acquired. “This lawsuit, in summary, is misguided,” Hansen said, adding: “anyway you look at it, consumers have been the big winners.” The trial will be the first big test of President Donald Trump’s Federal Trade Commission’s ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta — then called Facebook — in 2020, during Trump’s first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market. READ MORE: Meta agrees to pay $25 million settlement to Trump over Jan. 6 suspension lawsuit Meta, the FTC argues, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s strategy, “expressed in 2008: ‘It is better to buy than compete.’ True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats.” Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and “neutralize perceived competitive threats,” the FTC says in its complaint, just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers. “Unable to maintain its monopoly by fairly competing, the company’s executives addressed the existential threat by buying up new innovators that were succeeding where Facebook failed,” the FTC says. Facebook bought Instagram — then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following — in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal’s value fell to $750 million after Facebook’s stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012. Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller “acqui-hires” — a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion. WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta’s competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple’s messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp. “The FTC already has the difficult task, whether it’s looking at 10 years ago or five years ago or today, of trying to define what is the market we’re talking about in a sufficiently narrow way that it can show Meta has a ton of power in that market,” said Paul Swanson, an antitrust attorney for the law firm Holland & Hart. “And I do think that challenge has gotten harder as the years have gone by and we see more and more potential competitors in social media spaces.” Meta, meanwhile, says the FTC’s lawsuit “defies reality.” “The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others. More than 10 years after the FTC reviewed and cleared our acquisitions, the Commission’s action in this case sends the message that no deal is ever truly final. Regulators should be supporting American innovation, rather than seeking to break up a great American company and further advantaging China on critical issues like AI,” the company said in a statement. In a filing last week, Meta also stressed that the FTC “must prove that Meta has monopoly power in its claimed relevant market now, not at some time in the past.” This, experts say, could also prove challenging since more competitors have emerged in the social media space in the years since the company bought WhatsApp and Instagram. Meta’s fate will be decided by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who late last year denied Meta’s request for a summary judgment and ruled that the case must go to trial. Boasberg “seems to be skeptical” of the FTC’s narrow market definition in his rulings to date, Swanson said. He added that the judge also said it is a “fact question,” which means he is open to hearing what the FTC and its experts have to say to define that narrow market. While the FTC may face an uphill battle in proving its case, the stakes are high for Meta, whose advertising business could be cut in half if it’s forced to spin off Instagram. Meta isn’t the only technology company in the sights of federal antitrust regulators, Google and Amazon face their own cases. The remedy phase of Google’s case is scheduled to begin on April 21. A federal judge declared the search giant an illegal monopoly last August. “A big theme here is we are applying 19th-century laws to 21st-century markets. And I think it’s an open question whether the judge-made developments to antitrust law can keep up with markets as they are changing — these fluid and dynamic tech markets in particular,” Swanson said. “And this will be a case that speaks directly to that.” Your tax-deductible donation ensures our vital reporting continues to thrive.

Before we go any further: I hate to ask you to do this, but I need your help — I'm up for this year's Webbys for the best business podcast award. I know it's a pain in the ass, but can you sign up and vote for Better Offline? I have never won an award in my life, so help me win this one. Soundtrack: Mastodon - High Road I wanted to start this newsletter with a pithy anecdote about chaos, both that caused by Donald Trump's tariffs and the brittle state of the generative AI bubble. Instead, I am going to write down some questions, and make an attempt to answer them. Last week, OpenAI closed "the largest private tech funding round in history," where it "raised" an astonishing "$40 billion," and the reason that I've put quotation marks around it is that OpenAI has only raised $10 billion of the $40 billion, with the rest arriving by "the end of the year." The remaining $30 billion — $20 billion of which will (allegedly) be provided by SoftBank — is partially contingent on OpenAI's conversion from a non-profit to a for-profit by the end of 2025, and if it fails, SoftBank will only give OpenAI a further $20 billion. The round also valued OpenAI at $300 billion. To put that in context, OpenAI had revenues of $4bn in 2024. This deal values OpenAI at 75 times its revenue. That’s a bigger gulf than Tesla at its peak market cap — a company that was, in fact, worth more than all other legacy car manufacturers combined, despite making far less than them, and shipping a fraction of their vehicles. I also want to add that, as of writing this sentence, this money is yet to arrive. SoftBank's filings say that the money will arrive mid-April — and that SoftBank would be borrowing as much as $10 billion to finance the round, with the option to syndicate part of it to other investors. For the sake of argument, I'm going to assume this money actually arrives. Filings also suggest that "in certain circumstances" the second ($30 billion) tranche could arrive "in early 2026." This isn't great. It also seems that SoftBank's $10 billion commitment is contingent on getting a loan, "...financed through borrowings from Mizuho Bank, Ltd., among other financial institutions." OpenAI also revealed it now has 20 million paying subscribers and over 500 million weekly active users. If you're wondering why it doesn’t talk about monthly active users, it's because they'd likely be much higher than 500 million, which would reveal exactly how poorly OpenAI converts free ChatGPT users to paying ones, and how few people use ChatGPT in their day-to-day lives. The Information reported back in January that OpenAI was generating $25 million in revenue a month from its $200-a-month "Pro" subscribers (it still loses money on every one of them), suggesting around 125,000 ChatGPT Pro subscribers. Assuming the other 19,875,000 users are paying $20 a month, that puts its revenue at about $423 million a month, or about $5 billion a year, from ChatGPT subscriptions. This is what reporters mean when they say "annualized revenue" by the way — it's literally the monthly revenue multiplied by 12. Bloomberg reported recently that OpenAI expects its 2025 revenue to "triple" to $12.7 billion this year. Assuming a similar split of revenue to 2024, this would require OpenAI to nearly double its annualized subscription revenue from Q1 2025 (from $5 billion to around $9.27 billion) and nearly quadruple API revenue (from 2024's revenue of $1 billion, which includes Microsoft's 20% payment for access to OpenAI's models, to $3.43 billion). While these are messy numbers, it's unclear how OpenAI intends to pull this off. The Information reported in February that it planned to do so by making $3 billion a year selling "agents," with ChatGPT subscriptions ($7.9 billion) and API calls ($1.8 billion) making up the rest. This, of course, is utter bollocks. OpenAI's "agents" can't do even the simplest tasks, and three billion dollars of the $12.7 billion figure appears to be a commitment made by SoftBank to purchase OpenAI's tech for its various subsidiaries and business units. Let's say out the numbers precisely: We can assume, in this case, that OpenAI likely has, in the best case scenario, access to roughly $16 billion in liquidity at any given time. It's reasonable to believe that OpenAI will raise more debt this year, and I'd estimate it does so to the tune of around $5 billion or $6 billion. Without it, I am not sure what it’s going to do. As a reminder: OpenAI loses money on every single user. When I wrote "How Does OpenAI Survive?" and "OpenAI Is A Bad Business," I used reported information to explain how this company was, at its core, unsustainable. Let's refresh our memories. It seems, from even a cursory glance, that OpenAI's costs are increasing dramatically. The Information reported earlier in the year that OpenAI projects to spend $13 billion on compute with Microsoft alone in 2025, nearly tripling what it spent in total on compute in 2024 ($5 billion). This suggests that OpenAI's costs are skyrocketing, and that was before the launch of its new image generator which led to multiple complaints from Altman about a lack of available GPUs, leading to OpenAI's CEO saying to expect "stuff to break" and delays in new products. Nevertheless, even if we assume OpenAI factored in the compute increases into its projections, it still expects to pay Microsoft $13 billion for compute this year. This number, however, doesn't include the $12.9 billion five-year-long compute deal signed with CoreWeave, a deal that was a result of Microsoft declining to pick up the option to buy said compute itself. Payments for this deal, according to The Information, start in October 2025, and assuming that it's evenly paid (the terms of these contracts are generally secret, even in the case of public companies), this would still amount to roughly $2.38 billion a year. However, for the sake of argument, let's consider the payments are around $198 million a month, though there are scenarios — such as, say, CoreWeave's buildout partner not being able to build the data centers or CoreWeave not having the money to pay to build them — where OpenAI might pay less. To be clear, and I’ll explain in greater detail later, this wouldn’t be a good thing, either. While it would be off the hook for some of its payments, it would also be without the compute that’s essential for it to continue growing, serving existing customers, and building new AI models. Cash and compute are both essential to OpenAI’s survival. OpenAI has dedicated somewhere in the region of $19 billion to the Stargate data center project, along with another $19 billion provided by SoftBank and an indeterminate amount by other providers. Based on reporting from Bloomberg, OpenAI plans to have 64,000 Blackwell GPUs running "by the end of 2026," or roughly $3.84 billion worth of them. I should also note that Bloomberg said that 16,000 of these chips would be operational by Summer 2025, though it's unclear if that will actually happen. Though it's unclear who actually pays for what parts of Stargate, it's safe to assume that OpenAI will have to, at the very least, put a billion dollars into a project that is meant to be up and running by the end of 2026, if not more. As of now, Stargate has exactly one data center under development in Abilene, Texas, and as above, it's unclear how that's going, though a recent piece from The Information reported that it was currently "empty and incomplete," and that if it stays that way, "OpenAI could walk away from the deal, which would cost Oracle billions of dollars." Though the article takes pains to assure the reader that won't be likely, even an inkling of such a possibility is a bad sign. Business Insider's reporting on the site in Abilene calls it a "$3.4 billion data center development" (as did the press release from site developer Crusoe), though these numbers don't include GPUs, hardware, or the labor necessary to run them. Right now, Crusoe is (according to Business Insider) building "six new data centers, each with a minimum square footage...[which will] join the two it is already constructing for Oracle." Oracle has signed, according to The Information, a 15-year-long lease with Crusoe for its data centers, all of which will be rented to OpenAI. In any case, OpenAI’s exposure could be much, much higher than the $1bn posited at the start of this section (and I’ll explain in greater depth how I reached that figure at the bottom of this section). If OpenAI has to contribute significantly to the costs associated with building Stargate, it could be on the hook for billions. Data Center Dynamics reports that the Abilene site is meant to have 200MW of compute capacity in the first half of 2025, and then as much as 1.2GW by "mid-2026." To give you a sense of total costs for this project, former Microsoft VP of Energy Brian Janous said in January that it costs about $25 million a megawatt (or $25 billion a gigawatt), meaning that the initial capital expenditures for Stargate to spin up its first 200MW data center will be around $5 billion, spiraling to $30 billion for the entire project. Or perhaps even more. The Information has reported that the site, which could be "...potentially one of the world's biggest AI data centers," could cost "$50 billion to $100 billion in the coming years." Assuming we stick with the lower end of the cost estimates, it’s likely that OpenAI is on the hook for over $5 billion for the Abilene site based on the $19 billion it has agreed to contribute to the entire Stargate project, the (often disagreeing) cost projections of the facility), and the contributions of other partners. This expenditure won’t come all at once, and will be spread across several years. Still, assuming even the rosiest numbers, it's hard to see how OpenAI doesn't have to pony up $1 billion in 2025, with similar annual payments going forward until its completion, and that is likely because the development of this site is going to be heavily delayed by both tariffs, labor shortages, and Oracle's (as reported by The Information) trust in "scrappy but unproven startups to develop the project." Based on reporting from The Information last year, OpenAI will spend at least $2.5 billion across salaries, "data" (referring to buying data from other companies), hosting and other cost of sales, and sales and marketing, and then another billion on what infrastructure OpenAI owns. I expect the latter cost to balloon with OpenAI's investment in physical infrastructure for Stargate. Based on previous estimates, OpenAI spends about $2.25 to make $1. At that rate, it's likely that OpenAI's costs in its rosiest revenue projections of $12.7 billion are at least $28 billion — meaning that it’s on course to burn at least $14 billion in 2025. Assuming that OpenAI has all of its liquidity from last year (it doesn't, but for sake of argument, let’s pretend it still has the full $10 billion), as well as the $10 billion from SoftBank, it is still unclear how it meets its obligations. While OpenAI likely has preferential payment structures with all vendors, such as its discounted rates with Microsoft for Azure cloud services, it will still have to pay them, especially in the case of costs related to Stargate, many of which will be up-front costs. In the event that its costs are as severe as reporting suggests, it’s likely the company will find itself needing to raise more capital — whether through equity (or the weird sort-of equity that it issues) or through debt. And yes, while OpenAI has some revenue, it comes at a terrible cost, and anything that isn’t committed to paying for salaries and construction fees will likely be immediately funnelled directly into funding the obscene costs behind inference and training models like GPT 4.5 — a "giant expensive model" to run that the company has nevertheless pushed to every user. Worse still, OpenAI has, while delaying its next model (GPT-5), promised to launch its o3 reasoning model after saying it wouldn't do so, which is strange, because it turns out that o3 is actually way more expensive to run than people thought. Reasoning models are almost always more expensive to operate, as they involve the model “checking” its work, which, in turn, requires more calculations and more computation. Still, o3 is ludicrously expensive even for this category, with the Arc Prize Foundation (a non-profit that makes the ARC-AGI test for benchmarking models) estimating that it will cost $30,000 a task. As of right now, SoftBank has committed to the following: SoftBank's exposure to OpenAI is materially harming the company. To quote the Wall Street Journal: While one might argue that SoftBank has a good amount of cash, the Journal also adds that it’s somewhat hamstrung in its use as a result of CEO Masayoshi Son's reckless gambles: Worse still, it seems, as mentioned before, that SoftBank will be financing the entirety of the first $10 billion — or $7.5 billion, assuming it finds investors to syndicate the first tranche, and they follow through right until the moment Masayoshi Son hits ‘send’ on the wire transfer . As a result, SoftBank will likely have to start selling off parts of its valuable holdings in companies like Alibaba and ARM, or, worse still, parts of its ailing investments from its Vision Fund, resulting in a material loss on its underwater deals. This is an untenable strategy, and I'll explain why. While we do not have much transparency into OpenAI's actual day-to-day finances, we can make the educated guess that its costs are increasing based on the amount of capital it’s raising. If OpenAI’s costs were flat, or only mildly increasing, we’d expect to see raises roughly the same size as previous ones. Its $40bn raise is nearly six times the previous funding round. Admittedly, multiples like that aren’t particularly unusual. If a company raises $300,000 in a pre-seed round, and $3m in a Series A round, that’s a tenfold increase. But we’re not talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars, or even millions of dollars. We’re talking about billions of dollars. If OpenAI’s funding round with Softbank goes as planned, it’ll raise the equivalent of the entire GDP of Estonia — a fairly wealthy country itself, and one that’s also a member of Nato and the European Union. That alone should give you a sense of the truly insane scale of this. Insane, sure, but undoubtedly necessary. Per The Information, OpenAI expects to spend as much as $28 billion in compute on Microsoft's Azure cloud in 2028. Over a third of OpenAI's revenue, per the same article, will come from SoftBank's (alleged) spend.It's reasonable to believe that OpenAI will, as a result, need to raise in excess of $40 billion in funding a year, though it's reasonable to believe that it will need to raise more along the lines of $50 billion or more a year until it reaches profitability. This is due to both its growing cost of business, as well as its various infrastructure commitments, both in terms of Stargate, as well as with third-party suppliers like CoreWeave and Microsoft. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's statements around costs also suggest that they're increasing. In late February, Altman claimed that OpenAI was "out of GPUs." While this suggests that there’s demand for some products — like its image-generating tech, which enjoyed a viral day in the sun in March — it also means that to meet the demand it needs to spend more. And, at the risk of repeating myself, that demand doesn’t necessarily translate into profitability. As discussed above, SoftBank has to overcome significant challenges to fund both OpenAI and Stargate, and when I say "fund," I mean fund the current state of both projects, assuming no further obligations. The Information reports that OpenAI forecasts that it will spend $28 billion on compute with Microsoft alone in 2028. The same article also reports that OpenAI "would turn profitable by the end of the decade after the buildout of Stargate," suggesting that OpenAI's operating expenses will grow exponentially year-over-year. These costs, per The Information, are astronomical: SoftBank has had to (and will continue having to) go to remarkable lengths to fund OpenAI's current ($40 billion) round, lengths so significant that it may lead to its credit rating being further downgraded. Even if we assume the best case scenario — OpenAI successfully converts to a for-profit entity by the end of the year, and receives the full $30 billion — it seems unlikely (if not impossible) for it to continue raising the amount of capital they need to continue operations. As I’ve argued in previous newsletters, there are only a few entities that can provide the kinds of funding that OpenAI needs. These include big tech-focused investment firms like Softbank, sovereign wealth funds (like those of Saudi Arabia and the United Emirates), and perhaps the largest tech companies. These entities can meet OpenAI’s needs, but not all the time. It’s not realistic to expect Softbank, or Microsoft, or the Saudis, or Oracle, or whoever, to provide $40bn every year for the foreseeable future. This is especially true for Softbank. Based on its current promise to not borrow more than 25% of its holdings, it is near-impossible that SoftBank will be able to continue funding OpenAI at this rate ($40 billion a year), and $40 billion a year may not actually be enough. Based on its last reported equity value of holdings, SoftBank's investments and other assets are worth around $229 billion, meaning that it can borrow just over $57bn while remaining compliant with these guidelines. In any case, it is unclear how SoftBank can fund OpenAI, but it's far clearer that nobody else is willing to. Before we go any further, it's important to note that OpenAI does not really have its own compute infrastructure. The majority of its compute is provided by Microsoft, though, as mentioned above, OpenAI now has a deal with CoreWeave to take over Microsoft's future options for more capacity. Anyway, in the last 90 days, Sam Altman has complained about a lack of GPUs and pressure on OpenAI's servers multiple times. Forgive me for repeating stuff from above, but this is necessary. These statements, in a bubble, seem either harmless or like OpenAI's growth is skyrocketing — the latter of which might indeed be true, but bodes ill for a company that burns money on every single user. Any mention of rate limits or performance issues suggests that OpenAI is having significant capacity issues, and at this point it's unclear what further capacity it can actually expand to outside of that currently available. Remember, Microsoft has now pulled out of as much as 2GW of data center projects, walked away from a $1 billion data center development in Ohio, and declined the option on $12bn of compute from CoreWeave that OpenAI had to pick up — meaning that it may be pushing up against the limits of what is physically available. While the total available capacity of GPUs at many providers like Lambda and Crusoe is unknown, we know that CoreWeave has approximately 360MWavailable, compared to Microsoft's 6.5 to 7.5 Gigawatts, a large chunk of which already powers OpenAI. If OpenAI is running into capacity issues, it could be one of the following: Per The Information's reporting, Microsoft "promised OpenAI 300,000 NVIDIA GB200 (Blackwell) chips by the end of 2025," or roughly $18 billion of chips. It's unclear if this has changed since Microsoft allowed OpenAI to seek other compute in late January 2025. I also don't believe that OpenAI has any other viable options for existing compute infrastructure outside of Microsoft. CoreWeave's current data centers mostly feature NVIDIA's aging "Hopper" GPUs, and while it could — and likely is! — retrofitting its current infrastructure with Blackwell chips, doing so is not easy. Blackwell chips require far more powerful cooling and server infrastructure to make them run smoothly (a problem which led to a delay in their delivery to most customers), and even if CoreWeave was able to replace every last Hopper GPU with Blackwell (it won't), it still wouldn't match what OpenAI needs to expand. One might argue that it simply needs to wait for the construction of the Stargate data center, or for CoreWeave to finish the gigawatt or so of construction it’s working on. As I've previously written, I have serious concerns over the viability of CoreWeave ever completing its (alleged) contracted 1.3 Gigawatts of capacity. Per my article: However, even if I were to humour the idea, it is impossible that any of this project is done by the end of the year, or even in 2026. I can find no commitments to any timescale, other than the fact that OpenAI will allegedly start paying CoreWeave in October (per The Information), which could very well be using current capacity. I can also find no evidence that Crusoe, the company building the Stargate data center, has any compute available. Lambda, a GPU compute company that raised $320 million earlier in this year, and according to Data Center Dynamics "operates out of colocation data centers in San Francisco, California, and Allen, Texas, and is backed by more than $820 million in funds raised just this year," suggesting that it may not have their own data centers at all. Its ability to scale is entirely contingent on the availability of whatever data center providers it has relationships with. In any case, this means that OpenAI's only real choice for GPUs is CoreWeave or Microsoft. While it's hard to calculate precisely, OpenAI's best case scenario is that 16,000 GPUs come online in the summer of 2025 as part of the Stargate data center project. That's a drop in the bucket compared to the 300,000 Blackwell GPUs that Microsoft had previously promised. OpenAI is, regardless of how you or I may feel about generative AI, one of the fastest-growing companies of all time. It currently has, according to its own statements, 500 million weekly active users. Putting aside that each user is unprofitable, such remarkable growth — especially as it's partially a result of its extremely resource-intensive image generator — is also a strain on its infrastructure. The vast majority of OpenAI's users are free customers using ChatGPT, with only around 20 million paying subscribers, and the vast majority on the cheapest $20 plan. OpenAI's services — even in the case of image generation — are relatively commoditized, meaning that users can, if they really care, go and use any number of other different Large Language Model services. They can switch to Bing Image Creator, or Grok, or Stable Diffusion, or whatever. Free users are also a burden on the company — especially with such a piss-poor conversion rate — losing it money with each prompt (which is also the case with paying customers), and the remarkable popularity of its image generation service only threatens to bring more burdensome one-off customers that will generate a few abominable Studio Ghibli pictures and then never return. If OpenAI's growth continues at this rate, it will run into capacity issues, and it does not have much room to expand. While we do not know how much capacity it’s taking up with Microsoft, or indeed whether Microsoft is approaching capacity or otherwise limiting how much of it OpenAI can take, we do know that OpenAI has seen reason to beg for access to more GPUs. In simpler terms, even if OpenAI wasn’t running out of money, even if OpenAI wasn’t horrifyingly unprofitable, it also may not have enough GPUs to continue providing its services in a reliable manner. If that's the case, there really isn't much that can be done to fix it other than: The problem is that these measures, even if they succeed in generating more money for the company, also need to reduce the burden on OpenAI's available infrastructure. Remember: data centers can take three to six years to build, and even with the Stargate's accelerated (and I'd argue unrealistic) timelines, OpenAI isn't even unlocking a tenth of Microsoft's promised compute (16,000 GPUs online this year versus the 300,000 GPUs promised by Microsoft). Though downtime might be an obvious choice, capacity issues at OpenAI will likely manifest in hard limits on what free users can do, some of which I've documented above. Nevertheless, I believe the real pale horses of capacity issues come from arbitrary limits on any given user group, meaning both free and paid users. Sudden limits on what a user can do — a reduction in the number of generations of images of videos for paid users, any introduction of "peak hours," or any increases in prices are a sign that OpenAI is running out of GPUs, which it has already publicly said is happening. However, the really obvious one would be service degradation — delays in generations of any kind, 500 status code errors, or ChatGPT failing to fully produce an answer. OpenAI has, up until this point, had fairly impressive uptime. Still, if it is running up against a wall, this streak will end. The consequences depend on how often these issues occur, and to whom they occur. If free users face service degradation, they will bounce off the product, as their use is likely far more fleeting than a paid user, which will begin to erode OpenAI's growth. Ironically, rapid (and especially unprecedented) growth in one of OpenAI’s competitors, like xAI or Anthropic, could also represent a pale horse for OpenAI. If paid users face service degradation, it's likely this will cause the most harm to the company, as while paid users still lose OpenAI money in the end, it at least receives some money in exchange. OpenAI has effectively one choice here: getting more GPUs from Microsoft, and its future depends heavily both on its generosity and there being enough of them at a time when Microsoft has pulled back from two gigawatts of data centers specifically because of it moving away from providing compute for OpenAI. Admittedly, OpenAI has previously spent more on training models than inference (actually running them) and the company might be able to smooth downtime issues by shifting capacity. This would, of course, have a knock-on effect on its ability to continue developing new models, and the company is already losing ground, particularly when it comes to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek. As part of its deal with SoftBank, OpenAI must convert its bizarre non-profit structure into a for-profit entity by December 2025, or it’ll lose $10 billion from its promised funding. Furthermore, in the event that OpenAI fails to convert to a for-profit by October 2026, investors in its previous $6.6 billion round can claw back their investment, with it converting into a loan with an attached interest rate. Naturally, this represents a nightmare scenario for the company, as it’ll increase both its costs and its outgoings. This is a complex situation that almost warrants its own newsletter, but the long and short of it is that OpenAI would have to effectively dissolve itself, start the process of forming an entirely new entity, and distribute its assets to other nonprofits (or sell/license them to the for-profit company at fair market rates). It would require valuing OpenAI's assets, which in and of itself would be a difficult task, as well as getting past the necessary state regulators, the IRS, state revenue agencies, and the upcoming trial with Elon Musk only adds further problems. I’ve simplified things here, and that’s because (as I said) this stuff is complex. Suffice to say, this isn’t as simple as liquidating a company and starting afresh, or submitting a couple of legal filings. It’s a long, fraught process and one that will be — and has been — subject to legal challenges, both from OpenAI’s business rivals, as well as from civil society organizations in California. Based on discussions with experts in the field and my own research, I simply do not know how OpenAI pulls this off by October 2026, let alone by the end of the year. OpenAI has become a load-bearing company for the tech industry, both as a narrative — as previously discussed, ChatGPT is the only Large Language Model company with any meaningful userbase — and as a financial entity. Its ability to meet its obligations and its future expansion plans are critical to the future health — or, in some cases, survival — of multiple large companies, and that's before the after-effects that will affect its customers as a result of any financial collapse. The parallels to the 2007-2008 financial crisis are startling. Lehman Brothers wasn’t the largest investment bank in the world (although it was certainly big), just like OpenAI isn’t the largest tech company (though, again, it’s certainly large in terms of market cap and expenditure). Lehman Brothers’ collapse sparked a contagion that would later spread throughout the global financial services industry, and consequently, the global economy. I can see OpenAI’s failure having a similar systemic effect. While there is a vast difference between OpenAI’s involvement in people’s lives compared to the millions of subprime loans issued to real people, the stock market’s dependence on the value of the Magnificent 7 stocks (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, NVIDIA and Tesla), and in turn the Magnificent 7’s reliance on the stability of the AI boom narrative still threatens material harm to millions of people, and that’s before the ensuing layoffs. And as I’ve said before, this entire narrative is based off of OpenAI’s success, because OpenAI is the generative AI industry. I want to lay out the direct result of any kind of financial crisis at OpenAI, because I don't think anybody is taking this seriously. Per The Information, Oracle, which has taken responsibility for organizing the construction of the Stargate data centers with unproven data center builder Crusoe, "...may need to raise more capital to fund its data center ambitions." Oracle has signed a 15-year lease with Crusoe, and, to quote The Information, "...is on the hook for $1 billion in payments to that firm." To further quote The Information: In simpler terms, Oracle is building a giant data center for one customer — OpenAI — and has taken on the financial burden associated with it. If OpenAI fails to expand, or lacks the capital to actually pay for its share of the Stargate project, Oracle is on the hook for at least a billion dollars, and, based on The Information's reporting, is also on the hook to buy the GPUs for the site. In reality, this development will likely cost tens of billions of dollars, $19 billion of which is due from OpenAI, which does not have the money until it receives its second tranche of funding in December 2025, which is contingent partially on its ability to convert into a for-profit entity, which, as mentioned, is a difficult and unlikely proposition. It's unclear how many of the Blackwell GPUs that Oracle has had to purchase in advance, but in the event of any kind of financial collapse at OpenAI, Oracle would likely take a loss of at least a billion dollars, if not several billion dollars. I have written a lot about publicly-traded AI compute firm CoreWeave, and it would be my greatest pleasure to never mention it again. Nevertheless, I have to. The Financial Times revealed a few weeks ago that CoreWeave's debt payments could balloon to over $2.4 billion a year by the end of 2025, far outstripping its cash reserves, and The Information reported that its cash burn would increase to $15 billion in 2025. As per its IPO filings, 62% of CoreWeave's 2024 revenue (a little under $2 billion, with losses of $863 million) was Microsoft compute, and based on conversations with sources, a good amount of this was Microsoft running compute for OpenAI. Starting October 2025, OpenAI will start paying Coreweave as part of its five-year-long $12 billion contract, picking up the option that Microsoft declined. This is also when CoreWeave will have to start making payments on its massive, multi-billion dollar DDTL 2.0 loan, which likely makes these payments critical to CoreWeave's future. This deal also suggests that OpenAI will become CoreWeave's largest customer. Microsoft had previously committed to spending $10 billion on CoreWeave's services "by the end of the decade," but CEO Satya Nadella added a few months later on a podcast that its relationship with CoreWeave was a "one-time thing." Assuming Microsoft keeps spending at its previous rate — something that isn't guaranteed — it would still be only half of OpenAI's potential revenue. CoreWeave's expansion, at this point, is entirely driven by OpenAI. 77% of its 2024 revenue came from two customers — Microsoft being the largest, and using CoreWeave as an auxiliary supplier of compute for OpenAI. As a result, the future expansion efforts — the theoretical 1.3 gigawatts of contracted (translation: does not exist yet) compute — are largely (if not entirely) for the benefit of OpenAI. In the event that OpenAI cannot fulfil its obligations, CoreWeave will collapse. It is that simple. I’m basing this on a comment I received from Gil Luria, Managing Director and Head of Technology Research at analyst D.A. Davidson & Co: CoreWeave receives preferential access to NVIDIA's GPUs, and makes up billions of dollars of its revenue. CoreWeave then takes those GPUs and raises debt using them as collateral, then proceeds to buy more of those GPUs from NVIDIA. NVIDIA was the anchor for CoreWeave's IPO, and CEO Michael Intrator said that the IPO "wouldn't have closed" without NVIDIA buying $250 million worth of shares. NVIDIA invested $100 million in the early days of CoreWeave, and, for reasons I cannot understand, also agreed to spend $1.3 billion over four years to, and I quote The Information, "rent its own chips from CoreWeave." Buried in CoreWeave's S-1 — the document every company publishes before going public — was a warning about counterparty credit risk, which is when one party provides services or goods to another with specific repayment terms, and the other party not meeting their side of the deal. While this was written as a theoretical (as it could, in theoretically, come from any company to which CoreWeave acts as a creditor) it only named one company: OpenAI. As discussed previously, CoreWeave is saying that, should a customer — any customer, but really, it means OpenAI — fail to pay its bills for infrastructure built on their behalf, or for services rendered, it could have a material risk to the business. CoreWeave's continued ability to do business hinges heavily on its ability to raise further debt (which I have previously called into question), and its ability to raise further debt is, to quote the Financial Times, "secured against its more than 250,000 Nvidia chips and its contracts with customers, such as Microsoft." Any future debt that CoreWeave raises would be based upon its contract with OpenAI (you know, the counterparty credit risk threat that represents a disproportionate share of its revenue) and whatever GPUs it still has to collateralize. As a result, a chunk of NVIDIA's future revenue is dependent on OpenAI's ability to fulfil its obligations to CoreWeave, both in its ability to pay them and their timeliness in doing so. If OpenAI fails, then CoreWeave fails, which then hurts NVIDIA. Contagion. With Microsoft's data center pullback and OpenAI's intent to become independent from Redmond, future data center expansion is based on two partners supporting CoreWeave and Oracle: Crusoe and Core Scientific, neither of which appear to have ever built an AI data center. I also must explain how difficult building a data center is, and how said difficulty increases when you're building an AI-focused data center. For example, NVIDIA had to delay the launch of its Blackwell GPUs because of how finicky the associated infrastructure (the accompanying servers and cooling them) is. For customers that already had experience handling GPUs, and therefore likely know how to manage the extreme temperatures created by them. As another reminder, OpenAI is on the hook for $19 billion of funding behind Stargate, money that neither it nor SoftBank has right now. Imagine if you didn't have any experience, and effectively had to learn from scratch? How do you think that would go? We're about to find out! Crusoe is a former cryptocurrency mining company that has now raised hundreds of millions of dollars to build data centers for AI companies, starting with a $3.4 billion data center financing deal with asset manager Blue Owl Capital. This (yet-to-be-completed) data center has now been leased by Oracle, which will, allegedly, fill it full of GPUs for OpenAI. Despite calling itself "the industry’s first vertically integrated AI infrastructure provider," with the company using flared gas (a waste byproduct of oil production) to power IT infrastructure, Crusoe does not appear to have built an AI data center, and is now being tasked with building a 1.2 Gigawatt data center campus for OpenAI. Crusoe is the sole developer and operator of the Abilene site, meaning, according to The Information, "...is in charge of contracting with construction contractors and data center customers, as well as running the data center after it is built." Oracle, it seems, will be responsible for filling said data center with GPUs and the associated hardware. Nevertheless, the project appears to be behind schedule. The Information reported in October 2024 that Abeline was meant to have "...50,000 of NVIDIA's [Blackwell] AI chips...in the first quarter of [2025]," and also suggested that the site was projected to have 100,000 Blackwell chips by the end of 2025. Here in reality, a report from Bloomberg in March 2025 (that I cited previously) said that OpenAI and Oracle were expected to have 16,000 GPUs available by the Summer of 2025, with "...OpenAI and oracle are expected to deploy 64,000 NVIDIA GB200s at the Stargate data center...by the end of 2026." As discussed above, OpenAI needs this capacity. According to The Information, OpenAI expects Stargate to handle three-quarters of its compute by 2030, and these delays call into question at the very least whether this schedule is reasonable, if not whether Stargate, as a project, is actually possible. I've written a great deal about CoreWeave in the past, and specifically about its buildout partner Core Scientific, a cryptocurrency mining company (yes, another one) that has exactly one customer for AI data centers — CoreWeave. A few notes: Core Scientific is also, it seems, taking on $1.14 billion of capital expenditures to build out these data centers, with CoreWeave promising to reimburse $899.3 million of these costs. It's also unclear how Core Scientific intends to do this. While it’s taken on a good amount of debt in the past — $550 million in a convertible note toward the end of 2024 — this would be more debt than it’s ever taken on. It also, as with Crusoe, does not appear to have any experience building AI data centers, except unlike Crusoe, Core Scientific is a barely-functioning recently-bankrupted bitcoin miner pretending to be a data center company. How important is CoreWeave to OpenAI exactly? From Semafor: But will it survive long term? Going back to the point of contagion: If OpenAI fails, and CoreWeave fails, so too does Core Scientific. And I don’t fancy Crusoe’s chances, either. At least Crusoe isn’t public. Up until fairly recently, Microsoft has been the entire infrastructural backbone of OpenAI, but recently (to free OpenAI up to work with Oracle) released it from its exclusive cloud compute deal. Nevertheless, per The Information, OpenAI still intends to spend $13 billion on compute on Microsoft Azure this year. What's confusing, however, is whether any of this is booked as revenue. Microsoft claimed earlier in this year that it surpassed $13 billion in annual recurring revenue — by which it means its last month multiplied by 12 — from artificial intelligence. OpenAI's compute costs in 2024 were $5 billion, at a discounted Azure rate, which, on an annualized basis, would be around $416 million in revenue a month for Microsoft. It isn't, however, clear whether Microsoft counts OpenAI's compute spend as revenue. Microsoft's earnings do not include an "artificial intelligence" section, but three separate segments: As a result, it's hard to say specifically where OpenAI's revenue sits, but based on an analysis of Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment from FY23 Q1 (note, financial years don’t always correspond with the calendar year, so we just finished FY25 Q2 in January) through to its most recent earnings, and found that there was a spike in revenue from FY23 Q1 to FY24 Q1. In FY23 Q1 (which ended on September 30, 2022, a month before ChatGPT's launch), the segment made $20.3 billion. The following year, in FY24 Q1, it made $24.3 billion — a 19.7% year-over-year (or roughly $4 billion) increase. This could represent the massive increase in training and inference costs associated with hosting ChatGPT, peaking at $28.5 billion in revenue in FY24 Q4 — before dropping dramatically to $24.1 billion in FY25 Q1 and raising a little to $25.5 billion in FY25 Q2. OpenAI spent 2023 training its GPT-4o model before transitioning to its massive, expensive "Orion" model which would eventually become GPT 4.5, as well as its video generation model "Sora." According to the Wall Street Journal, training GPT 4.5 involved at least one training run costing "around half a billion dollars in computing costs alone." These are huge sums, but it’s worth noting a couple of things. First, Microsoft licenses OpenAI’s models to third parties, so some of this revenue could be from other companies using GPT on Azure. And there’s also other companies running their own models on Azure. We’ve seen a lot of companies launch AI products, and not all of them are based on LLMs. Muddling things further, Microsoft provides OpenAI access to Azure cloud services at a discounted rate. And so, there’s a giant question mark over OpenAI’s contribution to the various spikes in revenue for Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud segment, or whether other third-parties played a significant role. Furthermore, Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI isn’t entirely in cold, hard cash. Rather, it has provided the company with credits to be redeemed on Azure services. I’m not entirely sure how this would be represented on accounting terms, and if anyone can shed light on this, please get in touch. Would it be noted as revenue, or something else? OpenAI isn’t paying Microsoft, but rather doing the tech equivalent of redeeming some airmiles, or spending a gift card. Additionally, while equity is often treated as income for tax purposes — as is the case when an employee receives RSUs as part of their compensation package — under the existing OpenAI structure, Microsoft isn’t a shareholder but rather the owner of profit-sharing units. This is a distinction worth noting. These profit-sharing units are treated as analogous to equity, at least in terms of OpenAI’s ability to raise capital, but in practice they aren’t the same thing. They don’t represent ownership in the company as directly as, for example, a normal share unit would. They lack the liquidity of a share, and the upside they provide — namely, dividends — is purely theoretical. Another key difference: when a company goes bankrupt and enters liquidation, shareholders can potentially receive a share of the proceeds (after other creditors, employees, etc are paid). While that often doesn’t happen (as in, the liabilities far exceed the assets of the company), it’s at least theoretically possible. Given that profit-sharing units aren’t actually shares, where does that leave Microsoft? This stuff is confusing, and I’m not ashamed to say that complicated accounting questions like these are far beyond my understanding. If anyone can shed some light, drop me an email, or a message on Twitter or BlueSky, or post on the Better Offline subreddit. I have done my best to write this piece in as objective a tone as possible, regardless of my feelings about the generative AI bubble and its associated boosters. OpenAI, as I've written before, is effectively the entire generative AI industry, with its nearest competitor being less than five percent of its 500 million weekly active users. Its future is dependent — and this is not an opinion, but objective fact — on effectively infinite resources. If it required $40 billion to continue operations this year, it is reasonable to believe it will need at least another $40 billion next year, and based on its internal projections, will need at least that every single other year until 2030, when it claims, somehow, it will be profitable "with the completion of the Stargate data center." OpenAI requires more compute resources than anyone has ever needed, and will continue to do so in perpetuity. Building these resources is now dependent on two partners — Core Scientific and Crusoe — that have never built a data center, as Microsoft has materially pulled back on data center development, which have (as well as the aforementioned pullback on 2GW of data centers) "slowed or paused" some of its "early stage" data center projects. This shift is directly linked to Microsoft’s relationship with OpenAI, withTD Cowen's recent analyst report saying that data center pullbacks were, and I quote its March 26 2025 data center channel checks letter, "...driven by the decision to not support incremental OpenAI training workloads." In simpler terms, OpenAI needs more compute at a time when its lead backer, which has the most GPUs in the world, has specifically walked away from building it. Even in my most optimistic frame of mind, it isn't realistic to believe that Crusoe or Core Scientific can build the data centers necessary for OpenAI's expansion. Even if SoftBank and OpenAI had the money to invest in Stargate today, dollars do not change the fabric of reality. Data centers take time to build, requiring concrete, wood, steel and other materials to be manufactured and placed, and that's after the permitting required to get these deals done. Even if that succeeds, getting the power necessary is a challenge unto itself, to the point that even Oracle, an established and storied cloud compute company, to quote The Information, "...has less experience than its larger rivals in dealing with utilities to secure power and working with powerful and demanding cloud customers whose plans change frequently." A partner like Crusoe or Core Scientific simply doesn't have the muscle memory or domain expertise that Microsoft has when it comes to building and operating data centers. As a result, it's hard to imagine even in the best case scenario that they're able to match the hunger for compute that OpenAI has. Now, I want to be clear — I believe OpenAI will still continue to use Microsoft's compute, and even expand further into whatever remaining compute Microsoft may have. However, there is now a hard limit on how much of it there's going to be, both literally (in what's physically available) and in what Microsoft itself will actually OpenAI them to use, especially given how unprofitable GPU compute might be. Last week, a truly offensive piece of fan fiction — framed as a "report" — called AI 2027 went viral, garnering press coverage with the Dwarkesh Podcast and gormless, child-like wonder from the New York Times' Kevin Roose. Its predictions vaguely suggest a theoretical company called OpenBrain will invent a self-teaching agent of some sort. It's bullshit, but it captured the hearts and minds of AI boosters because it vaguely suggests that somehow Large Language Models and their associated technology will become something entirely different. I don't like making predictions like these because the future — especially in our current political climate — is so chaotic, but I will say that I do not see, and I say this with complete objectivity, how any of this continues. I want to be extremely blunt with the following points, as I feel like both members of the media and tech analysts have failed to express how ridiculous things have become. I will be repeating myself, but it's necessary, as I need you to understand how untenable things are. I see no way in which OpenAI can continue to raise money at this rate, even if OpenAI somehow actually receives the $40 billion, which will require it becoming a for-profit entity. While it could theoretically stretch that $40 billion to last multiple years, projections say it’ll burn $320 billion in the next five years. Or, more likely, I can’t see a realistic way in which OpenAI gets the resources it needs to survive. It’ll need a streak of unlikely good fortune, the kind of which you only ever hear about in Greek epic poems: If those things happen, I’ll obviously find myself eating crow. But I’m not worried. In the present conditions, OpenAI is on course to run out of money or compute capacity, and it's unclear which will happen first. Even in a hysterical bubble where everybody is agreeing that this is the future, OpenAI currently requires more money and more compute than is reasonable to acquire. Nobody has ever raised as much as OpenAI needs to, and based on the sheer amount of difficulty that SoftBank is having in raising the funds to meet the lower tranche ($10bn) of its commitment, it may simply not be possible for this company to continue. Even with extremely preferential payment terms — months-long deferred payments, for example — at some point somebody is going to need to get paid. I will give Sam Altman credit. He's found many partners to shoulder the burden of the rotten economics of OpenAI, with Microsoft, Oracle, Crusoe and CoreWeave handling the up-front costs of building the infrastructure, SoftBank finding the investors for its monstrous round, and the tech media mostly handling his marketing for him. He is, however, over-leveraged. OpenAI has never been forced to stand on its own two feet or focus on efficiency, and I believe the constant enabling of its ugly, nonsensical burnrate has doomed this company. OpenAI has acted like it’ll always have more money and compute, and that people will always believe its bullshit, mostly because up until recently everybody has. OpenAI cannot "make things cheaper" at this point, because the money has always been there to make things more expensive, as has the compute to make larger language models that burn billions of dollars a year. This company is not built to reduce its footprint in any way, nor is it built for a future in which it wouldn't have access to, as I've said before, infinite resources. Worse still, investors and the media have run cover for the fact that these models don't really do much more than they did a year ago and for the overall diminishing returns of Large Language Models. I have had many people attack my work about OpenAI, but none have provided any real counterpoint to the underlying economic argument I've made since July of last year that OpenAI is unsustainable. This is likely because there really isn't one, other than "OpenAI will continue to raise more money than anybody has ever raised in history, in perpetuity, and will somehow turn from the least-profitable company of all time to a profitable one." This isn’t a rational argument. It’s a religious one. It’s a call for faith. And I see no greater pale horse of the apocalypse than Microsoft's material pullback on data centers. While the argument might be that Microsoft wants OpenAI to have an independent future, that's laughable when you consider Microsoft's deeply monopolistic tendencies — and, for that matter, it owns a massive proportion of OpenAI’s pseudo-equity. At one point, Microsoft’s portion was valued at 49 percent. And while additional fundraising has likely diluted Microsoft’s stake, it still “owns” a massive proportion of what is (at least) the most valuable private startup of all time. And we’re supposed to believe that Microsoft’s pullback — which limits OpenAI’s access to the infrastructure it needs to train and run its models, and thus (as mentioned) represents an existential threat to the company — is because of some paternal desire to see OpenAI leave the childhood bedroom, spread its wings, and enter the real world? Behave. More likely, Microsoft got what it needed out of OpenAI, which has reached the limit of the models it can develop, and which Microsoft already retains the IP of. There’s probably no reason to make any further significant investments, though they allegedly may be part of the initial $10 billion tranche of OpenAI’s next round. It's also important to note that absolutely nobody other than NVIDIA is making any money from generative AI. CoreWeave loses billions of dollars, OpenAI loses billions of dollars, Anthropic loses billions of dollars, and I can't find a single company providing generative AI-powered software that's making a profit. The only companies even close to doing so are consultancies providing services to train and create data for models like Turing and Scale AI — and Scale isn't even profitable. The knock-on effects of OpenAI's collapse will be wide-ranging. Neither CoreWeave nor Crusoe will have tenants for their massive, unsustainable operations, and Oracle will have nobody to sell the compute it’s leased from Crusoe for the next 15 years. CoreWeave will likely collapse under the weight of its abominable debt, which will lead to a 7%+ revenue drop for NVIDIA at a time when revenue growth has already begun to slow. On a philosophical level, OpenAI's health is what keeps this industry alive. OpenAI has the only meaningful userbase in generative AI, and this entire hype-cycle has been driven by its success, meaning any deterioration (or collapse) of OpenAI will tell the market what I've been saying for over a year: that generative AI is not the next hyper-growth market, and its underlying economics do not make sense. I am not writing this to be "right" or "be a hater." If something changes, and I am wrong somehow, I will write exactly how, and why, and what mistakes I made to come to the conclusions I have in this piece. I do not believe that my peers in the media will do the same when this collapses, but I promise you that they will be held accountable, because all of this abominable waste could have been avoided. Large Language Models are not, on their own, the problem. They're tools, capable of some outcomes, doing some things, but the problem, ultimately, are the extrapolations made about their abilities, and the unnecessary drive to make them larger, even if said largeness never amounted to much. Everything that I'm describing is the result of a tech industry — including media and analysts — that refuses to do business with reality, trafficking in ideas and ideology, celebrating victories that have yet to take place, applauding those who have yet to create the things they're talking about, cheering on men lying about what's possible so that they can continue to burn billions of dollars and increase their wealth and influence. I understand why others might not have written this piece. What I am describing is a systemic failure, one at a scale hereto unseen, one that has involved so many rich and powerful and influential people agreeing to ignore reality, and that’ll have crushing impacts for the wider tech ecosystem when it happens.

Before we go any further: I hate to ask you to do this, but I need your help — I'm up for this year's Webbys for the best business podcast award. I know it's a pain in the ass, but can you sign up and vote for Better Offline? I have never won an award in my life, so help me win this one. Soundtrack: Mastodon - High Road I wanted to start this newsletter with a pithy anecdote about chaos, both that caused by Donald Trump's tariffs and the brittle state of the generative AI bubble. Instead, I am going to write down some questions, and make an attempt to answer them. Last week, OpenAI closed "the largest private tech funding round in history," where it "raised" an astonishing "$40 billion," and the reason that I've put quotation marks around it is that OpenAI has only raised $10 billion of the $40 billion, with the rest arriving by "the end of the year." The remaining $30 billion — $20 billion of which will (allegedly) be provided by SoftBank — is partially contingent on OpenAI's conversion from a non-profit to a for-profit by the end of 2025, and if it fails, SoftBank will only give OpenAI a further $20 billion. The round also valued OpenAI at $300 billion. To put that in context, OpenAI had revenues of $4bn in 2024. This deal values OpenAI at 75 times its revenue. That’s a bigger gulf than Tesla at its peak market cap — a company that was, in fact, worth more than all other legacy car manufacturers combined, despite making far less than them, and shipping a fraction of their vehicles. I also want to add that, as of writing this sentence, this money is yet to arrive. SoftBank's filings say that the money will arrive mid-April — and that SoftBank would be borrowing as much as $10 billion to finance the round, with the option to syndicate part of it to other investors. For the sake of argument, I'm going to assume this money actually arrives. Filings also suggest that "in certain circumstances" the second ($30 billion) tranche could arrive "in early 2026." This isn't great. It also seems that SoftBank's $10 billion commitment is contingent on getting a loan, "...financed through borrowings from Mizuho Bank, Ltd., among other financial institutions." OpenAI also revealed it now has 20 million paying subscribers and over 500 million weekly active users. If you're wondering why it doesn’t talk about monthly active users, it's because they'd likely be much higher than 500 million, which would reveal exactly how poorly OpenAI converts free ChatGPT users to paying ones, and how few people use ChatGPT in their day-to-day lives. The Information reported back in January that OpenAI was generating $25 million in revenue a month from its $200-a-month "Pro" subscribers (it still loses money on every one of them), suggesting around 125,000 ChatGPT Pro subscribers. Assuming the other 19,875,000 users are paying $20 a month, that puts its revenue at about $423 million a month, or about $5 billion a year, from ChatGPT subscriptions. This is what reporters mean when they say "annualized revenue" by the way — it's literally the monthly revenue multiplied by 12. Bloomberg reported recently that OpenAI expects its 2025 revenue to "triple" to $12.7 billion this year. Assuming a similar split of revenue to 2024, this would require OpenAI to nearly double its annualized subscription revenue from Q1 2025 (from $5 billion to around $9.27 billion) and nearly quadruple API revenue (from 2024's revenue of $1 billion, which includes Microsoft's 20% payment for access to OpenAI's models, to $3.43 billion). While these are messy numbers, it's unclear how OpenAI intends to pull this off. The Information reported in February that it planned to do so by making $3 billion a year selling "agents," with ChatGPT subscriptions ($7.9 billion) and API calls ($1.8 billion) making up the rest. This, of course, is utter bollocks. OpenAI's "agents" can't do even the simplest tasks, and three billion dollars of the $12.7 billion figure appears to be a commitment made by SoftBank to purchase OpenAI's tech for its various subsidiaries and business units. Let's say out the numbers precisely: We can assume, in this case, that OpenAI likely has, in the best case scenario, access to roughly $16 billion in liquidity at any given time. It's reasonable to believe that OpenAI will raise more debt this year, and I'd estimate it does so to the tune of around $5 billion or $6 billion. Without it, I am not sure what it’s going to do. As a reminder: OpenAI loses money on every single user. When I wrote "How Does OpenAI Survive?" and "OpenAI Is A Bad Business," I used reported information to explain how this company was, at its core, unsustainable. Let's refresh our memories. It seems, from even a cursory glance, that OpenAI's costs are increasing dramatically. The Information reported earlier in the year that OpenAI projects to spend $13 billion on compute with Microsoft alone in 2025, nearly tripling what it spent in total on compute in 2024 ($5 billion). This suggests that OpenAI's costs are skyrocketing, and that was before the launch of its new image generator which led to multiple complaints from Altman about a lack of available GPUs, leading to OpenAI's CEO saying to expect "stuff to break" and delays in new products. Nevertheless, even if we assume OpenAI factored in the compute increases into its projections, it still expects to pay Microsoft $13 billion for compute this year. This number, however, doesn't include the $12.9 billion five-year-long compute deal signed with CoreWeave, a deal that was a result of Microsoft declining to pick up the option to buy said compute itself. Payments for this deal, according to The Information, start in October 2025, and assuming that it's evenly paid (the terms of these contracts are generally secret, even in the case of public companies), this would still amount to roughly $2.38 billion a year. However, for the sake of argument, let's consider the payments are around $198 million a month, though there are scenarios — such as, say, CoreWeave's buildout partner not being able to build the data centers or CoreWeave not having the money to pay to build them — where OpenAI might pay less. To be clear, and I’ll explain in greater detail later, this wouldn’t be a good thing, either. While it would be off the hook for some of its payments, it would also be without the compute that’s essential for it to continue growing, serving existing customers, and building new AI models. Cash and compute are both essential to OpenAI’s survival. OpenAI has dedicated somewhere in the region of $19 billion to the Stargate data center project, along with another $19 billion provided by SoftBank and an indeterminate amount by other providers. Based on reporting from Bloomberg, OpenAI plans to have 64,000 Blackwell GPUs running "by the end of 2026," or roughly $3.84 billion worth of them. I should also note that Bloomberg said that 16,000 of these chips would be operational by Summer 2025, though it's unclear if that will actually happen. Though it's unclear who actually pays for what parts of Stargate, it's safe to assume that OpenAI will have to, at the very least, put a billion dollars into a project that is meant to be up and running by the end of 2026, if not more. As of now, Stargate has exactly one data center under development in Abilene, Texas, and as above, it's unclear how that's going, though a recent piece from The Information reported that it was currently "empty and incomplete," and that if it stays that way, "OpenAI could walk away from the deal, which would cost Oracle billions of dollars." Though the article takes pains to assure the reader that won't be likely, even an inkling of such a possibility is a bad sign. Business Insider's reporting on the site in Abilene calls it a "$3.4 billion data center development" (as did the press release from site developer Crusoe), though these numbers don't include GPUs, hardware, or the labor necessary to run them. Right now, Crusoe is (according to Business Insider) building "six new data centers, each with a minimum square footage...[which will] join the two it is already constructing for Oracle." Oracle has signed, according to The Information, a 15-year-long lease with Crusoe for its data centers, all of which will be rented to OpenAI. In any case, OpenAI’s exposure could be much, much higher than the $1bn posited at the start of this section (and I’ll explain in greater depth how I reached that figure at the bottom of this section). If OpenAI has to contribute significantly to the costs associated with building Stargate, it could be on the hook for billions. Data Center Dynamics reports that the Abilene site is meant to have 200MW of compute capacity in the first half of 2025, and then as much as 1.2GW by "mid-2026." To give you a sense of total costs for this project, former Microsoft VP of Energy Brian Janous said in January that it costs about $25 million a megawatt (or $25 billion a gigawatt), meaning that the initial capital expenditures for Stargate to spin up its first 200MW data center will be around $5 billion, spiraling to $30 billion for the entire project. Or perhaps even more. The Information has reported that the site, which could be "...potentially one of the world's biggest AI data centers," could cost "$50 billion to $100 billion in the coming years." Assuming we stick with the lower end of the cost estimates, it’s likely that OpenAI is on the hook for over $5 billion for the Abilene site based on the $19 billion it has agreed to contribute to the entire Stargate project, the (often disagreeing) cost projections of the facility), and the contributions of other partners. This expenditure won’t come all at once, and will be spread across several years. Still, assuming even the rosiest numbers, it's hard to see how OpenAI doesn't have to pony up $1 billion in 2025, with similar annual payments going forward until its completion, and that is likely because the development of this site is going to be heavily delayed by both tariffs, labor shortages, and Oracle's (as reported by The Information) trust in "scrappy but unproven startups to develop the project." Based on reporting from The Information last year, OpenAI will spend at least $2.5 billion across salaries, "data" (referring to buying data from other companies), hosting and other cost of sales, and sales and marketing, and then another billion on what infrastructure OpenAI owns. I expect the latter cost to balloon with OpenAI's investment in physical infrastructure for Stargate. Based on previous estimates, OpenAI spends about $2.25 to make $1. At that rate, it's likely that OpenAI's costs in its rosiest revenue projections of $12.7 billion are at least $28 billion — meaning that it’s on course to burn at least $14 billion in 2025. Assuming that OpenAI has all of its liquidity from last year (it doesn't, but for sake of argument, let’s pretend it still has the full $10 billion), as well as the $10 billion from SoftBank, it is still unclear how it meets its obligations. While OpenAI likely has preferential payment structures with all vendors, such as its discounted rates with Microsoft for Azure cloud services, it will still have to pay them, especially in the case of costs related to Stargate, many of which will be up-front costs. In the event that its costs are as severe as reporting suggests, it’s likely the company will find itself needing to raise more capital — whether through equity (or the weird sort-of equity that it issues) or through debt. And yes, while OpenAI has some revenue, it comes at a terrible cost, and anything that isn’t committed to paying for salaries and construction fees will likely be immediately funnelled directly into funding the obscene costs behind inference and training models like GPT 4.5 — a "giant expensive model" to run that the company has nevertheless pushed to every user. Worse still, OpenAI has, while delaying its next model (GPT-5), promised to launch its o3 reasoning model after saying it wouldn't do so, which is strange, because it turns out that o3 is actually way more expensive to run than people thought. Reasoning models are almost always more expensive to operate, as they involve the model “checking” its work, which, in turn, requires more calculations and more computation. Still, o3 is ludicrously expensive even for this category, with the Arc Prize Foundation (a non-profit that makes the ARC-AGI test for benchmarking models) estimating that it will cost $30,000 a task. As of right now, SoftBank has committed to the following: SoftBank's exposure to OpenAI is materially harming the company. To quote the Wall Street Journal: While one might argue that SoftBank has a good amount of cash, the Journal also adds that it’s somewhat hamstrung in its use as a result of CEO Masayoshi Son's reckless gambles: Worse still, it seems, as mentioned before, that SoftBank will be financing the entirety of the first $10 billion — or $7.5 billion, assuming it finds investors to syndicate the first tranche, and they follow through right until the moment Masayoshi Son hits ‘send’ on the wire transfer . As a result, SoftBank will likely have to start selling off parts of its valuable holdings in companies like Alibaba and ARM, or, worse still, parts of its ailing investments from its Vision Fund, resulting in a material loss on its underwater deals. This is an untenable strategy, and I'll explain why. While we do not have much transparency into OpenAI's actual day-to-day finances, we can make the educated guess that its costs are increasing based on the amount of capital it’s raising. If OpenAI’s costs were flat, or only mildly increasing, we’d expect to see raises roughly the same size as previous ones. Its $40bn raise is nearly six times the previous funding round. Admittedly, multiples like that aren’t particularly unusual. If a company raises $300,000 in a pre-seed round, and $3m in a Series A round, that’s a tenfold increase. But we’re not talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars, or even millions of dollars. We’re talking about billions of dollars. If OpenAI’s funding round with Softbank goes as planned, it’ll raise the equivalent of the entire GDP of Estonia — a fairly wealthy country itself, and one that’s also a member of Nato and the European Union. That alone should give you a sense of the truly insane scale of this. Insane, sure, but undoubtedly necessary. Per The Information, OpenAI expects to spend as much as $28 billion in compute on Microsoft's Azure cloud in 2028. Over a third of OpenAI's revenue, per the same article, will come from SoftBank's (alleged) spend.It's reasonable to believe that OpenAI will, as a result, need to raise in excess of $40 billion in funding a year, though it's reasonable to believe that it will need to raise more along the lines of $50 billion or more a year until it reaches profitability. This is due to both its growing cost of business, as well as its various infrastructure commitments, both in terms of Stargate, as well as with third-party suppliers like CoreWeave and Microsoft. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's statements around costs also suggest that they're increasing. In late February, Altman claimed that OpenAI was "out of GPUs." While this suggests that there’s demand for some products — like its image-generating tech, which enjoyed a viral day in the sun in March — it also means that to meet the demand it needs to spend more. And, at the risk of repeating myself, that demand doesn’t necessarily translate into profitability. As discussed above, SoftBank has to overcome significant challenges to fund both OpenAI and Stargate, and when I say "fund," I mean fund the current state of both projects, assuming no further obligations. The Information reports that OpenAI forecasts that it will spend $28 billion on compute with Microsoft alone in 2028. The same article also reports that OpenAI "would turn profitable by the end of the decade after the buildout of Stargate," suggesting that OpenAI's operating expenses will grow exponentially year-over-year. These costs, per The Information, are astronomical: SoftBank has had to (and will continue having to) go to remarkable lengths to fund OpenAI's current ($40 billion) round, lengths so significant that it may lead to its credit rating being further downgraded. Even if we assume the best case scenario — OpenAI successfully converts to a for-profit entity by the end of the year, and receives the full $30 billion — it seems unlikely (if not impossible) for it to continue raising the amount of capital they need to continue operations. As I’ve argued in previous newsletters, there are only a few entities that can provide the kinds of funding that OpenAI needs. These include big tech-focused investment firms like Softbank, sovereign wealth funds (like those of Saudi Arabia and the United Emirates), and perhaps the largest tech companies. These entities can meet OpenAI’s needs, but not all the time. It’s not realistic to expect Softbank, or Microsoft, or the Saudis, or Oracle, or whoever, to provide $40bn every year for the foreseeable future. This is especially true for Softbank. Based on its current promise to not borrow more than 25% of its holdings, it is near-impossible that SoftBank will be able to continue funding OpenAI at this rate ($40 billion a year), and $40 billion a year may not actually be enough. Based on its last reported equity value of holdings, SoftBank's investments and other assets are worth around $229 billion, meaning that it can borrow just over $57bn while remaining compliant with these guidelines. In any case, it is unclear how SoftBank can fund OpenAI, but it's far clearer that nobody else is willing to. Before we go any further, it's important to note that OpenAI does not really have its own compute infrastructure. The majority of its compute is provided by Microsoft, though, as mentioned above, OpenAI now has a deal with CoreWeave to take over Microsoft's future options for more capacity. Anyway, in the last 90 days, Sam Altman has complained about a lack of GPUs and pressure on OpenAI's servers multiple times. Forgive me for repeating stuff from above, but this is necessary. These statements, in a bubble, seem either harmless or like OpenAI's growth is skyrocketing — the latter of which might indeed be true, but bodes ill for a company that burns money on every single user. Any mention of rate limits or performance issues suggests that OpenAI is having significant capacity issues, and at this point it's unclear what further capacity it can actually expand to outside of that currently available. Remember, Microsoft has now pulled out of as much as 2GW of data center projects, walked away from a $1 billion data center development in Ohio, and declined the option on $12bn of compute from CoreWeave that OpenAI had to pick up — meaning that it may be pushing up against the limits of what is physically available. While the total available capacity of GPUs at many providers like Lambda and Crusoe is unknown, we know that CoreWeave has approximately 360MWavailable, compared to Microsoft's 6.5 to 7.5 Gigawatts, a large chunk of which already powers OpenAI. If OpenAI is running into capacity issues, it could be one of the following: Per The Information's reporting, Microsoft "promised OpenAI 300,000 NVIDIA GB200 (Blackwell) chips by the end of 2025," or roughly $18 billion of chips. It's unclear if this has changed since Microsoft allowed OpenAI to seek other compute in late January 2025. I also don't believe that OpenAI has any other viable options for existing compute infrastructure outside of Microsoft. CoreWeave's current data centers mostly feature NVIDIA's aging "Hopper" GPUs, and while it could — and likely is! — retrofitting its current infrastructure with Blackwell chips, doing so is not easy. Blackwell chips require far more powerful cooling and server infrastructure to make them run smoothly (a problem which led to a delay in their delivery to most customers), and even if CoreWeave was able to replace every last Hopper GPU with Blackwell (it won't), it still wouldn't match what OpenAI needs to expand. One might argue that it simply needs to wait for the construction of the Stargate data center, or for CoreWeave to finish the gigawatt or so of construction it’s working on. As I've previously written, I have serious concerns over the viability of CoreWeave ever completing its (alleged) contracted 1.3 Gigawatts of capacity. Per my article: However, even if I were to humour the idea, it is impossible that any of this project is done by the end of the year, or even in 2026. I can find no commitments to any timescale, other than the fact that OpenAI will allegedly start paying CoreWeave in October (per The Information), which could very well be using current capacity. I can also find no evidence that Crusoe, the company building the Stargate data center, has any compute available. Lambda, a GPU compute company that raised $320 million earlier in this year, and according to Data Center Dynamics "operates out of colocation data centers in San Francisco, California, and Allen, Texas, and is backed by more than $820 million in funds raised just this year," suggesting that it may not have their own data centers at all. Its ability to scale is entirely contingent on the availability of whatever data center providers it has relationships with. In any case, this means that OpenAI's only real choice for GPUs is CoreWeave or Microsoft. While it's hard to calculate precisely, OpenAI's best case scenario is that 16,000 GPUs come online in the summer of 2025 as part of the Stargate data center project. That's a drop in the bucket compared to the 300,000 Blackwell GPUs that Microsoft had previously promised. OpenAI is, regardless of how you or I may feel about generative AI, one of the fastest-growing companies of all time. It currently has, according to its own statements, 500 million weekly active users. Putting aside that each user is unprofitable, such remarkable growth — especially as it's partially a result of its extremely resource-intensive image generator — is also a strain on its infrastructure. The vast majority of OpenAI's users are free customers using ChatGPT, with only around 20 million paying subscribers, and the vast majority on the cheapest $20 plan. OpenAI's services — even in the case of image generation — are relatively commoditized, meaning that users can, if they really care, go and use any number of other different Large Language Model services. They can switch to Bing Image Creator, or Grok, or Stable Diffusion, or whatever. Free users are also a burden on the company — especially with such a piss-poor conversion rate — losing it money with each prompt (which is also the case with paying customers), and the remarkable popularity of its image generation service only threatens to bring more burdensome one-off customers that will generate a few abominable Studio Ghibli pictures and then never return. If OpenAI's growth continues at this rate, it will run into capacity issues, and it does not have much room to expand. While we do not know how much capacity it’s taking up with Microsoft, or indeed whether Microsoft is approaching capacity or otherwise limiting how much of it OpenAI can take, we do know that OpenAI has seen reason to beg for access to more GPUs. In simpler terms, even if OpenAI wasn’t running out of money, even if OpenAI wasn’t horrifyingly unprofitable, it also may not have enough GPUs to continue providing its services in a reliable manner. If that's the case, there really isn't much that can be done to fix it other than: The problem is that these measures, even if they succeed in generating more money for the company, also need to reduce the burden on OpenAI's available infrastructure. Remember: data centers can take three to six years to build, and even with the Stargate's accelerated (and I'd argue unrealistic) timelines, OpenAI isn't even unlocking a tenth of Microsoft's promised compute (16,000 GPUs online this year versus the 300,000 GPUs promised by Microsoft). Though downtime might be an obvious choice, capacity issues at OpenAI will likely manifest in hard limits on what free users can do, some of which I've documented above. Nevertheless, I believe the real pale horses of capacity issues come from arbitrary limits on any given user group, meaning both free and paid users. Sudden limits on what a user can do — a reduction in the number of generations of images of videos for paid users, any introduction of "peak hours," or any increases in prices are a sign that OpenAI is running out of GPUs, which it has already publicly said is happening. However, the really obvious one would be service degradation — delays in generations of any kind, 500 status code errors, or ChatGPT failing to fully produce an answer. OpenAI has, up until this point, had fairly impressive uptime. Still, if it is running up against a wall, this streak will end. The consequences depend on how often these issues occur, and to whom they occur. If free users face service degradation, they will bounce off the product, as their use is likely far more fleeting than a paid user, which will begin to erode OpenAI's growth. Ironically, rapid (and especially unprecedented) growth in one of OpenAI’s competitors, like xAI or Anthropic, could also represent a pale horse for OpenAI. If paid users face service degradation, it's likely this will cause the most harm to the company, as while paid users still lose OpenAI money in the end, it at least receives some money in exchange. OpenAI has effectively one choice here: getting more GPUs from Microsoft, and its future depends heavily both on its generosity and there being enough of them at a time when Microsoft has pulled back from two gigawatts of data centers specifically because of it moving away from providing compute for OpenAI. Admittedly, OpenAI has previously spent more on training models than inference (actually running them) and the company might be able to smooth downtime issues by shifting capacity. This would, of course, have a knock-on effect on its ability to continue developing new models, and the company is already losing ground, particularly when it comes to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek. As part of its deal with SoftBank, OpenAI must convert its bizarre non-profit structure into a for-profit entity by December 2025, or it’ll lose $10 billion from its promised funding. Furthermore, in the event that OpenAI fails to convert to a for-profit by October 2026, investors in its previous $6.6 billion round can claw back their investment, with it converting into a loan with an attached interest rate. Naturally, this represents a nightmare scenario for the company, as it’ll increase both its costs and its outgoings. This is a complex situation that almost warrants its own newsletter, but the long and short of it is that OpenAI would have to effectively dissolve itself, start the process of forming an entirely new entity, and distribute its assets to other nonprofits (or sell/license them to the for-profit company at fair market rates). It would require valuing OpenAI's assets, which in and of itself would be a difficult task, as well as getting past the necessary state regulators, the IRS, state revenue agencies, and the upcoming trial with Elon Musk only adds further problems. I’ve simplified things here, and that’s because (as I said) this stuff is complex. Suffice to say, this isn’t as simple as liquidating a company and starting afresh, or submitting a couple of legal filings. It’s a long, fraught process and one that will be — and has been — subject to legal challenges, both from OpenAI’s business rivals, as well as from civil society organizations in California. Based on discussions with experts in the field and my own research, I simply do not know how OpenAI pulls this off by October 2026, let alone by the end of the year. OpenAI has become a load-bearing company for the tech industry, both as a narrative — as previously discussed, ChatGPT is the only Large Language Model company with any meaningful userbase — and as a financial entity. Its ability to meet its obligations and its future expansion plans are critical to the future health — or, in some cases, survival — of multiple large companies, and that's before the after-effects that will affect its customers as a result of any financial collapse. The parallels to the 2007-2008 financial crisis are startling. Lehman Brothers wasn’t the largest investment bank in the world (although it was certainly big), just like OpenAI isn’t the largest tech company (though, again, it’s certainly large in terms of market cap and expenditure). Lehman Brothers’ collapse sparked a contagion that would later spread throughout the global financial services industry, and consequently, the global economy. I can see OpenAI’s failure having a similar systemic effect. While there is a vast difference between OpenAI’s involvement in people’s lives compared to the millions of subprime loans issued to real people, the stock market’s dependence on the value of the Magnificent 7 stocks (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, NVIDIA and Tesla), and in turn the Magnificent 7’s reliance on the stability of the AI boom narrative still threatens material harm to millions of people, and that’s before the ensuing layoffs. And as I’ve said before, this entire narrative is based off of OpenAI’s success, because OpenAI is the generative AI industry. I want to lay out the direct result of any kind of financial crisis at OpenAI, because I don't think anybody is taking this seriously. Per The Information, Oracle, which has taken responsibility for organizing the construction of the Stargate data centers with unproven data center builder Crusoe, "...may need to raise more capital to fund its data center ambitions." Oracle has signed a 15-year lease with Crusoe, and, to quote The Information, "...is on the hook for $1 billion in payments to that firm." To further quote The Information: In simpler terms, Oracle is building a giant data center for one customer — OpenAI — and has taken on the financial burden associated with it. If OpenAI fails to expand, or lacks the capital to actually pay for its share of the Stargate project, Oracle is on the hook for at least a billion dollars, and, based on The Information's reporting, is also on the hook to buy the GPUs for the site. In reality, this development will likely cost tens of billions of dollars, $19 billion of which is due from OpenAI, which does not have the money until it receives its second tranche of funding in December 2025, which is contingent partially on its ability to convert into a for-profit entity, which, as mentioned, is a difficult and unlikely proposition. It's unclear how many of the Blackwell GPUs that Oracle has had to purchase in advance, but in the event of any kind of financial collapse at OpenAI, Oracle would likely take a loss of at least a billion dollars, if not several billion dollars. I have written a lot about publicly-traded AI compute firm CoreWeave, and it would be my greatest pleasure to never mention it again. Nevertheless, I have to. The Financial Times revealed a few weeks ago that CoreWeave's debt payments could balloon to over $2.4 billion a year by the end of 2025, far outstripping its cash reserves, and The Information reported that its cash burn would increase to $15 billion in 2025. As per its IPO filings, 62% of CoreWeave's 2024 revenue (a little under $2 billion, with losses of $863 million) was Microsoft compute, and based on conversations with sources, a good amount of this was Microsoft running compute for OpenAI. Starting October 2025, OpenAI will start paying Coreweave as part of its five-year-long $12 billion contract, picking up the option that Microsoft declined. This is also when CoreWeave will have to start making payments on its massive, multi-billion dollar DDTL 2.0 loan, which likely makes these payments critical to CoreWeave's future. This deal also suggests that OpenAI will become CoreWeave's largest customer. Microsoft had previously committed to spending $10 billion on CoreWeave's services "by the end of the decade," but CEO Satya Nadella added a few months later on a podcast that its relationship with CoreWeave was a "one-time thing." Assuming Microsoft keeps spending at its previous rate — something that isn't guaranteed — it would still be only half of OpenAI's potential revenue. CoreWeave's expansion, at this point, is entirely driven by OpenAI. 77% of its 2024 revenue came from two customers — Microsoft being the largest, and using CoreWeave as an auxiliary supplier of compute for OpenAI. As a result, the future expansion efforts — the theoretical 1.3 gigawatts of contracted (translation: does not exist yet) compute — are largely (if not entirely) for the benefit of OpenAI. In the event that OpenAI cannot fulfil its obligations, CoreWeave will collapse. It is that simple. I’m basing this on a comment I received from Gil Luria, Managing Director and Head of Technology Research at analyst D.A. Davidson & Co: CoreWeave receives preferential access to NVIDIA's GPUs, and makes up billions of dollars of its revenue. CoreWeave then takes those GPUs and raises debt using them as collateral, then proceeds to buy more of those GPUs from NVIDIA. NVIDIA was the anchor for CoreWeave's IPO, and CEO Michael Intrator said that the IPO "wouldn't have closed" without NVIDIA buying $250 million worth of shares. NVIDIA invested $100 million in the early days of CoreWeave, and, for reasons I cannot understand, also agreed to spend $1.3 billion over four years to, and I quote The Information, "rent its own chips from CoreWeave." Buried in CoreWeave's S-1 — the document every company publishes before going public — was a warning about counterparty credit risk, which is when one party provides services or goods to another with specific repayment terms, and the other party not meeting their side of the deal. While this was written as a theoretical (as it could, in theoretically, come from any company to which CoreWeave acts as a creditor) it only named one company: OpenAI. As discussed previously, CoreWeave is saying that, should a customer — any customer, but really, it means OpenAI — fail to pay its bills for infrastructure built on their behalf, or for services rendered, it could have a material risk to the business. CoreWeave's continued ability to do business hinges heavily on its ability to raise further debt (which I have previously called into question), and its ability to raise further debt is, to quote the Financial Times, "secured against its more than 250,000 Nvidia chips and its contracts with customers, such as Microsoft." Any future debt that CoreWeave raises would be based upon its contract with OpenAI (you know, the counterparty credit risk threat that represents a disproportionate share of its revenue) and whatever GPUs it still has to collateralize. As a result, a chunk of NVIDIA's future revenue is dependent on OpenAI's ability to fulfil its obligations to CoreWeave, both in its ability to pay them and their timeliness in doing so. If OpenAI fails, then CoreWeave fails, which then hurts NVIDIA. Contagion. With Microsoft's data center pullback and OpenAI's intent to become independent from Redmond, future data center expansion is based on two partners supporting CoreWeave and Oracle: Crusoe and Core Scientific, neither of which appear to have ever built an AI data center. I also must explain how difficult building a data center is, and how said difficulty increases when you're building an AI-focused data center. For example, NVIDIA had to delay the launch of its Blackwell GPUs because of how finicky the associated infrastructure (the accompanying servers and cooling them) is. For customers that already had experience handling GPUs, and therefore likely know how to manage the extreme temperatures created by them. As another reminder, OpenAI is on the hook for $19 billion of funding behind Stargate, money that neither it nor SoftBank has right now. Imagine if you didn't have any experience, and effectively had to learn from scratch? How do you think that would go? We're about to find out! Crusoe is a former cryptocurrency mining company that has now raised hundreds of millions of dollars to build data centers for AI companies, starting with a $3.4 billion data center financing deal with asset manager Blue Owl Capital. This (yet-to-be-completed) data center has now been leased by Oracle, which will, allegedly, fill it full of GPUs for OpenAI. Despite calling itself "the industry’s first vertically integrated AI infrastructure provider," with the company using flared gas (a waste byproduct of oil production) to power IT infrastructure, Crusoe does not appear to have built an AI data center, and is now being tasked with building a 1.2 Gigawatt data center campus for OpenAI. Crusoe is the sole developer and operator of the Abilene site, meaning, according to The Information, "...is in charge of contracting with construction contractors and data center customers, as well as running the data center after it is built." Oracle, it seems, will be responsible for filling said data center with GPUs and the associated hardware. Nevertheless, the project appears to be behind schedule. The Information reported in October 2024 that Abeline was meant to have "...50,000 of NVIDIA's [Blackwell] AI chips...in the first quarter of [2025]," and also suggested that the site was projected to have 100,000 Blackwell chips by the end of 2025. Here in reality, a report from Bloomberg in March 2025 (that I cited previously) said that OpenAI and Oracle were expected to have 16,000 GPUs available by the Summer of 2025, with "...OpenAI and oracle are expected to deploy 64,000 NVIDIA GB200s at the Stargate data center...by the end of 2026." As discussed above, OpenAI needs this capacity. According to The Information, OpenAI expects Stargate to handle three-quarters of its compute by 2030, and these delays call into question at the very least whether this schedule is reasonable, if not whether Stargate, as a project, is actually possible. I've written a great deal about CoreWeave in the past, and specifically about its buildout partner Core Scientific, a cryptocurrency mining company (yes, another one) that has exactly one customer for AI data centers — CoreWeave. A few notes: Core Scientific is also, it seems, taking on $1.14 billion of capital expenditures to build out these data centers, with CoreWeave promising to reimburse $899.3 million of these costs. It's also unclear how Core Scientific intends to do this. While it’s taken on a good amount of debt in the past — $550 million in a convertible note toward the end of 2024 — this would be more debt than it’s ever taken on. It also, as with Crusoe, does not appear to have any experience building AI data centers, except unlike Crusoe, Core Scientific is a barely-functioning recently-bankrupted bitcoin miner pretending to be a data center company. How important is CoreWeave to OpenAI exactly? From Semafor: But will it survive long term? Going back to the point of contagion: If OpenAI fails, and CoreWeave fails, so too does Core Scientific. And I don’t fancy Crusoe’s chances, either. At least Crusoe isn’t public. Up until fairly recently, Microsoft has been the entire infrastructural backbone of OpenAI, but recently (to free OpenAI up to work with Oracle) released it from its exclusive cloud compute deal. Nevertheless, per The Information, OpenAI still intends to spend $13 billion on compute on Microsoft Azure this year. What's confusing, however, is whether any of this is booked as revenue. Microsoft claimed earlier in this year that it surpassed $13 billion in annual recurring revenue — by which it means its last month multiplied by 12 — from artificial intelligence. OpenAI's compute costs in 2024 were $5 billion, at a discounted Azure rate, which, on an annualized basis, would be around $416 million in revenue a month for Microsoft. It isn't, however, clear whether Microsoft counts OpenAI's compute spend as revenue. Microsoft's earnings do not include an "artificial intelligence" section, but three separate segments: As a result, it's hard to say specifically where OpenAI's revenue sits, but based on an analysis of Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment from FY23 Q1 (note, financial years don’t always correspond with the calendar year, so we just finished FY25 Q2 in January) through to its most recent earnings, and found that there was a spike in revenue from FY23 Q1 to FY24 Q1. In FY23 Q1 (which ended on September 30, 2022, a month before ChatGPT's launch), the segment made $20.3 billion. The following year, in FY24 Q1, it made $24.3 billion — a 19.7% year-over-year (or roughly $4 billion) increase. This could represent the massive increase in training and inference costs associated with hosting ChatGPT, peaking at $28.5 billion in revenue in FY24 Q4 — before dropping dramatically to $24.1 billion in FY25 Q1 and raising a little to $25.5 billion in FY25 Q2. OpenAI spent 2023 training its GPT-4o model before transitioning to its massive, expensive "Orion" model which would eventually become GPT 4.5, as well as its video generation model "Sora." According to the Wall Street Journal, training GPT 4.5 involved at least one training run costing "around half a billion dollars in computing costs alone." These are huge sums, but it’s worth noting a couple of things. First, Microsoft licenses OpenAI’s models to third parties, so some of this revenue could be from other companies using GPT on Azure. And there’s also other companies running their own models on Azure. We’ve seen a lot of companies launch AI products, and not all of them are based on LLMs. Muddling things further, Microsoft provides OpenAI access to Azure cloud services at a discounted rate. And so, there’s a giant question mark over OpenAI’s contribution to the various spikes in revenue for Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud segment, or whether other third-parties played a significant role. Furthermore, Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI isn’t entirely in cold, hard cash. Rather, it has provided the company with credits to be redeemed on Azure services. I’m not entirely sure how this would be represented on accounting terms, and if anyone can shed light on this, please get in touch. Would it be noted as revenue, or something else? OpenAI isn’t paying Microsoft, but rather doing the tech equivalent of redeeming some airmiles, or spending a gift card. Additionally, while equity is often treated as income for tax purposes — as is the case when an employee receives RSUs as part of their compensation package — under the existing OpenAI structure, Microsoft isn’t a shareholder but rather the owner of profit-sharing units. This is a distinction worth noting. These profit-sharing units are treated as analogous to equity, at least in terms of OpenAI’s ability to raise capital, but in practice they aren’t the same thing. They don’t represent ownership in the company as directly as, for example, a normal share unit would. They lack the liquidity of a share, and the upside they provide — namely, dividends — is purely theoretical. Another key difference: when a company goes bankrupt and enters liquidation, shareholders can potentially receive a share of the proceeds (after other creditors, employees, etc are paid). While that often doesn’t happen (as in, the liabilities far exceed the assets of the company), it’s at least theoretically possible. Given that profit-sharing units aren’t actually shares, where does that leave Microsoft? This stuff is confusing, and I’m not ashamed to say that complicated accounting questions like these are far beyond my understanding. If anyone can shed some light, drop me an email, or a message on Twitter or BlueSky, or post on the Better Offline subreddit. I have done my best to write this piece in as objective a tone as possible, regardless of my feelings about the generative AI bubble and its associated boosters. OpenAI, as I've written before, is effectively the entire generative AI industry, with its nearest competitor being less than five percent of its 500 million weekly active users. Its future is dependent — and this is not an opinion, but objective fact — on effectively infinite resources. If it required $40 billion to continue operations this year, it is reasonable to believe it will need at least another $40 billion next year, and based on its internal projections, will need at least that every single other year until 2030, when it claims, somehow, it will be profitable "with the completion of the Stargate data center." OpenAI requires more compute resources than anyone has ever needed, and will continue to do so in perpetuity. Building these resources is now dependent on two partners — Core Scientific and Crusoe — that have never built a data center, as Microsoft has materially pulled back on data center development, which have (as well as the aforementioned pullback on 2GW of data centers) "slowed or paused" some of its "early stage" data center projects. This shift is directly linked to Microsoft’s relationship with OpenAI, withTD Cowen's recent analyst report saying that data center pullbacks were, and I quote its March 26 2025 data center channel checks letter, "...driven by the decision to not support incremental OpenAI training workloads." In simpler terms, OpenAI needs more compute at a time when its lead backer, which has the most GPUs in the world, has specifically walked away from building it. Even in my most optimistic frame of mind, it isn't realistic to believe that Crusoe or Core Scientific can build the data centers necessary for OpenAI's expansion. Even if SoftBank and OpenAI had the money to invest in Stargate today, dollars do not change the fabric of reality. Data centers take time to build, requiring concrete, wood, steel and other materials to be manufactured and placed, and that's after the permitting required to get these deals done. Even if that succeeds, getting the power necessary is a challenge unto itself, to the point that even Oracle, an established and storied cloud compute company, to quote The Information, "...has less experience than its larger rivals in dealing with utilities to secure power and working with powerful and demanding cloud customers whose plans change frequently." A partner like Crusoe or Core Scientific simply doesn't have the muscle memory or domain expertise that Microsoft has when it comes to building and operating data centers. As a result, it's hard to imagine even in the best case scenario that they're able to match the hunger for compute that OpenAI has. Now, I want to be clear — I believe OpenAI will still continue to use Microsoft's compute, and even expand further into whatever remaining compute Microsoft may have. However, there is now a hard limit on how much of it there's going to be, both literally (in what's physically available) and in what Microsoft itself will actually OpenAI them to use, especially given how unprofitable GPU compute might be. Last week, a truly offensive piece of fan fiction — framed as a "report" — called AI 2027 went viral, garnering press coverage with the Dwarkesh Podcast and gormless, child-like wonder from the New York Times' Kevin Roose. Its predictions vaguely suggest a theoretical company called OpenBrain will invent a self-teaching agent of some sort. It's bullshit, but it captured the hearts and minds of AI boosters because it vaguely suggests that somehow Large Language Models and their associated technology will become something entirely different. I don't like making predictions like these because the future — especially in our current political climate — is so chaotic, but I will say that I do not see, and I say this with complete objectivity, how any of this continues. I want to be extremely blunt with the following points, as I feel like both members of the media and tech analysts have failed to express how ridiculous things have become. I will be repeating myself, but it's necessary, as I need you to understand how untenable things are. I see no way in which OpenAI can continue to raise money at this rate, even if OpenAI somehow actually receives the $40 billion, which will require it becoming a for-profit entity. While it could theoretically stretch that $40 billion to last multiple years, projections say it’ll burn $320 billion in the next five years. Or, more likely, I can’t see a realistic way in which OpenAI gets the resources it needs to survive. It’ll need a streak of unlikely good fortune, the kind of which you only ever hear about in Greek epic poems: If those things happen, I’ll obviously find myself eating crow. But I’m not worried. In the present conditions, OpenAI is on course to run out of money or compute capacity, and it's unclear which will happen first. Even in a hysterical bubble where everybody is agreeing that this is the future, OpenAI currently requires more money and more compute than is reasonable to acquire. Nobody has ever raised as much as OpenAI needs to, and based on the sheer amount of difficulty that SoftBank is having in raising the funds to meet the lower tranche ($10bn) of its commitment, it may simply not be possible for this company to continue. Even with extremely preferential payment terms — months-long deferred payments, for example — at some point somebody is going to need to get paid. I will give Sam Altman credit. He's found many partners to shoulder the burden of the rotten economics of OpenAI, with Microsoft, Oracle, Crusoe and CoreWeave handling the up-front costs of building the infrastructure, SoftBank finding the investors for its monstrous round, and the tech media mostly handling his marketing for him. He is, however, over-leveraged. OpenAI has never been forced to stand on its own two feet or focus on efficiency, and I believe the constant enabling of its ugly, nonsensical burnrate has doomed this company. OpenAI has acted like it’ll always have more money and compute, and that people will always believe its bullshit, mostly because up until recently everybody has. OpenAI cannot "make things cheaper" at this point, because the money has always been there to make things more expensive, as has the compute to make larger language models that burn billions of dollars a year. This company is not built to reduce its footprint in any way, nor is it built for a future in which it wouldn't have access to, as I've said before, infinite resources. Worse still, investors and the media have run cover for the fact that these models don't really do much more than they did a year ago and for the overall diminishing returns of Large Language Models. I have had many people attack my work about OpenAI, but none have provided any real counterpoint to the underlying economic argument I've made since July of last year that OpenAI is unsustainable. This is likely because there really isn't one, other than "OpenAI will continue to raise more money than anybody has ever raised in history, in perpetuity, and will somehow turn from the least-profitable company of all time to a profitable one." This isn’t a rational argument. It’s a religious one. It’s a call for faith. And I see no greater pale horse of the apocalypse than Microsoft's material pullback on data centers. While the argument might be that Microsoft wants OpenAI to have an independent future, that's laughable when you consider Microsoft's deeply monopolistic tendencies — and, for that matter, it owns a massive proportion of OpenAI’s pseudo-equity. At one point, Microsoft’s portion was valued at 49 percent. And while additional fundraising has likely diluted Microsoft’s stake, it still “owns” a massive proportion of what is (at least) the most valuable private startup of all time. And we’re supposed to believe that Microsoft’s pullback — which limits OpenAI’s access to the infrastructure it needs to train and run its models, and thus (as mentioned) represents an existential threat to the company — is because of some paternal desire to see OpenAI leave the childhood bedroom, spread its wings, and enter the real world? Behave. More likely, Microsoft got what it needed out of OpenAI, which has reached the limit of the models it can develop, and which Microsoft already retains the IP of. There’s probably no reason to make any further significant investments, though they allegedly may be part of the initial $10 billion tranche of OpenAI’s next round. It's also important to note that absolutely nobody other than NVIDIA is making any money from generative AI. CoreWeave loses billions of dollars, OpenAI loses billions of dollars, Anthropic loses billions of dollars, and I can't find a single company providing generative AI-powered software that's making a profit. The only companies even close to doing so are consultancies providing services to train and create data for models like Turing and Scale AI — and Scale isn't even profitable. The knock-on effects of OpenAI's collapse will be wide-ranging. Neither CoreWeave nor Crusoe will have tenants for their massive, unsustainable operations, and Oracle will have nobody to sell the compute it’s leased from Crusoe for the next 15 years. CoreWeave will likely collapse under the weight of its abominable debt, which will lead to a 7%+ revenue drop for NVIDIA at a time when revenue growth has already begun to slow. On a philosophical level, OpenAI's health is what keeps this industry alive. OpenAI has the only meaningful userbase in generative AI, and this entire hype-cycle has been driven by its success, meaning any deterioration (or collapse) of OpenAI will tell the market what I've been saying for over a year: that generative AI is not the next hyper-growth market, and its underlying economics do not make sense. I am not writing this to be "right" or "be a hater." If something changes, and I am wrong somehow, I will write exactly how, and why, and what mistakes I made to come to the conclusions I have in this piece. I do not believe that my peers in the media will do the same when this collapses, but I promise you that they will be held accountable, because all of this abominable waste could have been avoided. Large Language Models are not, on their own, the problem. They're tools, capable of some outcomes, doing some things, but the problem, ultimately, are the extrapolations made about their abilities, and the unnecessary drive to make them larger, even if said largeness never amounted to much. Everything that I'm describing is the result of a tech industry — including media and analysts — that refuses to do business with reality, trafficking in ideas and ideology, celebrating victories that have yet to take place, applauding those who have yet to create the things they're talking about, cheering on men lying about what's possible so that they can continue to burn billions of dollars and increase their wealth and influence. I understand why others might not have written this piece. What I am describing is a systemic failure, one at a scale hereto unseen, one that has involved so many rich and powerful and influential people agreeing to ignore reality, and that’ll have crushing impacts for the wider tech ecosystem when it happens.

Before we go any further: I hate to ask you to do this, but I need your help — I'm up for this year's Webbys for the best business podcast award. I know it's a pain in the ass, but can you sign up and vote for Better Offline? I have never won an award in my life, so help me win this one. Soundtrack: Mastodon - High Road I wanted to start this newsletter with a pithy anecdote about chaos, both that caused by Donald Trump's tariffs and the brittle state of the generative AI bubble. Instead, I am going to write down some questions, and make an attempt to answer them. Last week, OpenAI closed "the largest private tech funding round in history," where it "raised" an astonishing "$40 billion," and the reason that I've put quotation marks around it is that OpenAI has only raised $10 billion of the $40 billion, with the rest arriving by "the end of the year." The remaining $30 billion — $20 billion of which will (allegedly) be provided by SoftBank — is partially contingent on OpenAI's conversion from a non-profit to a for-profit by the end of 2025, and if it fails, SoftBank will only give OpenAI a further $20 billion. The round also valued OpenAI at $300 billion. To put that in context, OpenAI had revenues of $4bn in 2024. This deal values OpenAI at 75 times its revenue. That’s a bigger gulf than Tesla at its peak market cap — a company that was, in fact, worth more than all other legacy car manufacturers combined, despite making far less than them, and shipping a fraction of their vehicles. I also want to add that, as of writing this sentence, this money is yet to arrive. SoftBank's filings say that the money will arrive mid-April — and that SoftBank would be borrowing as much as $10 billion to finance the round, with the option to syndicate part of it to other investors. For the sake of argument, I'm going to assume this money actually arrives. Filings also suggest that "in certain circumstances" the second ($30 billion) tranche could arrive "in early 2026." This isn't great. It also seems that SoftBank's $10 billion commitment is contingent on getting a loan, "...financed through borrowings from Mizuho Bank, Ltd., among other financial institutions." OpenAI also revealed it now has 20 million paying subscribers and over 500 million weekly active users. If you're wondering why it doesn’t talk about monthly active users, it's because they'd likely be much higher than 500 million, which would reveal exactly how poorly OpenAI converts free ChatGPT users to paying ones, and how few people use ChatGPT in their day-to-day lives. The Information reported back in January that OpenAI was generating $25 million in revenue a month from its $200-a-month "Pro" subscribers (it still loses money on every one of them), suggesting around 125,000 ChatGPT Pro subscribers. Assuming the other 19,875,000 users are paying $20 a month, that puts its revenue at about $423 million a month, or about $5 billion a year, from ChatGPT subscriptions. This is what reporters mean when they say "annualized revenue" by the way — it's literally the monthly revenue multiplied by 12. Bloomberg reported recently that OpenAI expects its 2025 revenue to "triple" to $12.7 billion this year. Assuming a similar split of revenue to 2024, this would require OpenAI to nearly double its annualized subscription revenue from Q1 2025 (from $5 billion to around $9.27 billion) and nearly quadruple API revenue (from 2024's revenue of $1 billion, which includes Microsoft's 20% payment for access to OpenAI's models, to $3.43 billion). While these are messy numbers, it's unclear how OpenAI intends to pull this off. The Information reported in February that it planned to do so by making $3 billion a year selling "agents," with ChatGPT subscriptions ($7.9 billion) and API calls ($1.8 billion) making up the rest. This, of course, is utter bollocks. OpenAI's "agents" can't do even the simplest tasks, and three billion dollars of the $12.7 billion figure appears to be a commitment made by SoftBank to purchase OpenAI's tech for its various subsidiaries and business units. Let's say out the numbers precisely: We can assume, in this case, that OpenAI likely has, in the best case scenario, access to roughly $16 billion in liquidity at any given time. It's reasonable to believe that OpenAI will raise more debt this year, and I'd estimate it does so to the tune of around $5 billion or $6 billion. Without it, I am not sure what it’s going to do. As a reminder: OpenAI loses money on every single user. When I wrote "How Does OpenAI Survive?" and "OpenAI Is A Bad Business," I used reported information to explain how this company was, at its core, unsustainable. Let's refresh our memories. It seems, from even a cursory glance, that OpenAI's costs are increasing dramatically. The Information reported earlier in the year that OpenAI projects to spend $13 billion on compute with Microsoft alone in 2025, nearly tripling what it spent in total on compute in 2024 ($5 billion). This suggests that OpenAI's costs are skyrocketing, and that was before the launch of its new image generator which led to multiple complaints from Altman about a lack of available GPUs, leading to OpenAI's CEO saying to expect "stuff to break" and delays in new products. Nevertheless, even if we assume OpenAI factored in the compute increases into its projections, it still expects to pay Microsoft $13 billion for compute this year. This number, however, doesn't include the $12.9 billion five-year-long compute deal signed with CoreWeave, a deal that was a result of Microsoft declining to pick up the option to buy said compute itself. Payments for this deal, according to The Information, start in October 2025, and assuming that it's evenly paid (the terms of these contracts are generally secret, even in the case of public companies), this would still amount to roughly $2.38 billion a year. However, for the sake of argument, let's consider the payments are around $198 million a month, though there are scenarios — such as, say, CoreWeave's buildout partner not being able to build the data centers or CoreWeave not having the money to pay to build them — where OpenAI might pay less. To be clear, and I’ll explain in greater detail later, this wouldn’t be a good thing, either. While it would be off the hook for some of its payments, it would also be without the compute that’s essential for it to continue growing, serving existing customers, and building new AI models. Cash and compute are both essential to OpenAI’s survival. OpenAI has dedicated somewhere in the region of $19 billion to the Stargate data center project, along with another $19 billion provided by SoftBank and an indeterminate amount by other providers. Based on reporting from Bloomberg, OpenAI plans to have 64,000 Blackwell GPUs running "by the end of 2026," or roughly $3.84 billion worth of them. I should also note that Bloomberg said that 16,000 of these chips would be operational by Summer 2025, though it's unclear if that will actually happen. Though it's unclear who actually pays for what parts of Stargate, it's safe to assume that OpenAI will have to, at the very least, put a billion dollars into a project that is meant to be up and running by the end of 2026, if not more. As of now, Stargate has exactly one data center under development in Abilene, Texas, and as above, it's unclear how that's going, though a recent piece from The Information reported that it was currently "empty and incomplete," and that if it stays that way, "OpenAI could walk away from the deal, which would cost Oracle billions of dollars." Though the article takes pains to assure the reader that won't be likely, even an inkling of such a possibility is a bad sign. Business Insider's reporting on the site in Abilene calls it a "$3.4 billion data center development" (as did the press release from site developer Crusoe), though these numbers don't include GPUs, hardware, or the labor necessary to run them. Right now, Crusoe is (according to Business Insider) building "six new data centers, each with a minimum square footage...[which will] join the two it is already constructing for Oracle." Oracle has signed, according to The Information, a 15-year-long lease with Crusoe for its data centers, all of which will be rented to OpenAI. In any case, OpenAI’s exposure could be much, much higher than the $1bn posited at the start of this section (and I’ll explain in greater depth how I reached that figure at the bottom of this section). If OpenAI has to contribute significantly to the costs associated with building Stargate, it could be on the hook for billions. Data Center Dynamics reports that the Abilene site is meant to have 200MW of compute capacity in the first half of 2025, and then as much as 1.2GW by "mid-2026." To give you a sense of total costs for this project, former Microsoft VP of Energy Brian Janous said in January that it costs about $25 million a megawatt (or $25 billion a gigawatt), meaning that the initial capital expenditures for Stargate to spin up its first 200MW data center will be around $5 billion, spiraling to $30 billion for the entire project. Or perhaps even more. The Information has reported that the site, which could be "...potentially one of the world's biggest AI data centers," could cost "$50 billion to $100 billion in the coming years." Assuming we stick with the lower end of the cost estimates, it’s likely that OpenAI is on the hook for over $5 billion for the Abilene site based on the $19 billion it has agreed to contribute to the entire Stargate project, the (often disagreeing) cost projections of the facility), and the contributions of other partners. This expenditure won’t come all at once, and will be spread across several years. Still, assuming even the rosiest numbers, it's hard to see how OpenAI doesn't have to pony up $1 billion in 2025, with similar annual payments going forward until its completion, and that is likely because the development of this site is going to be heavily delayed by both tariffs, labor shortages, and Oracle's (as reported by The Information) trust in "scrappy but unproven startups to develop the project." Based on reporting from The Information last year, OpenAI will spend at least $2.5 billion across salaries, "data" (referring to buying data from other companies), hosting and other cost of sales, and sales and marketing, and then another billion on what infrastructure OpenAI owns. I expect the latter cost to balloon with OpenAI's investment in physical infrastructure for Stargate. Based on previous estimates, OpenAI spends about $2.25 to make $1. At that rate, it's likely that OpenAI's costs in its rosiest revenue projections of $12.7 billion are at least $28 billion — meaning that it’s on course to burn at least $14 billion in 2025. Assuming that OpenAI has all of its liquidity from last year (it doesn't, but for sake of argument, let’s pretend it still has the full $10 billion), as well as the $10 billion from SoftBank, it is still unclear how it meets its obligations. While OpenAI likely has preferential payment structures with all vendors, such as its discounted rates with Microsoft for Azure cloud services, it will still have to pay them, especially in the case of costs related to Stargate, many of which will be up-front costs. In the event that its costs are as severe as reporting suggests, it’s likely the company will find itself needing to raise more capital — whether through equity (or the weird sort-of equity that it issues) or through debt. And yes, while OpenAI has some revenue, it comes at a terrible cost, and anything that isn’t committed to paying for salaries and construction fees will likely be immediately funnelled directly into funding the obscene costs behind inference and training models like GPT 4.5 — a "giant expensive model" to run that the company has nevertheless pushed to every user. Worse still, OpenAI has, while delaying its next model (GPT-5), promised to launch its o3 reasoning model after saying it wouldn't do so, which is strange, because it turns out that o3 is actually way more expensive to run than people thought. Reasoning models are almost always more expensive to operate, as they involve the model “checking” its work, which, in turn, requires more calculations and more computation. Still, o3 is ludicrously expensive even for this category, with the Arc Prize Foundation (a non-profit that makes the ARC-AGI test for benchmarking models) estimating that it will cost $30,000 a task. As of right now, SoftBank has committed to the following: SoftBank's exposure to OpenAI is materially harming the company. To quote the Wall Street Journal: While one might argue that SoftBank has a good amount of cash, the Journal also adds that it’s somewhat hamstrung in its use as a result of CEO Masayoshi Son's reckless gambles: Worse still, it seems, as mentioned before, that SoftBank will be financing the entirety of the first $10 billion — or $7.5 billion, assuming it finds investors to syndicate the first tranche, and they follow through right until the moment Masayoshi Son hits ‘send’ on the wire transfer . As a result, SoftBank will likely have to start selling off parts of its valuable holdings in companies like Alibaba and ARM, or, worse still, parts of its ailing investments from its Vision Fund, resulting in a material loss on its underwater deals. This is an untenable strategy, and I'll explain why. While we do not have much transparency into OpenAI's actual day-to-day finances, we can make the educated guess that its costs are increasing based on the amount of capital it’s raising. If OpenAI’s costs were flat, or only mildly increasing, we’d expect to see raises roughly the same size as previous ones. Its $40bn raise is nearly six times the previous funding round. Admittedly, multiples like that aren’t particularly unusual. If a company raises $300,000 in a pre-seed round, and $3m in a Series A round, that’s a tenfold increase. But we’re not talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars, or even millions of dollars. We’re talking about billions of dollars. If OpenAI’s funding round with Softbank goes as planned, it’ll raise the equivalent of the entire GDP of Estonia — a fairly wealthy country itself, and one that’s also a member of Nato and the European Union. That alone should give you a sense of the truly insane scale of this. Insane, sure, but undoubtedly necessary. Per The Information, OpenAI expects to spend as much as $28 billion in compute on Microsoft's Azure cloud in 2028. Over a third of OpenAI's revenue, per the same article, will come from SoftBank's (alleged) spend.It's reasonable to believe that OpenAI will, as a result, need to raise in excess of $40 billion in funding a year, though it's reasonable to believe that it will need to raise more along the lines of $50 billion or more a year until it reaches profitability. This is due to both its growing cost of business, as well as its various infrastructure commitments, both in terms of Stargate, as well as with third-party suppliers like CoreWeave and Microsoft. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's statements around costs also suggest that they're increasing. In late February, Altman claimed that OpenAI was "out of GPUs." While this suggests that there’s demand for some products — like its image-generating tech, which enjoyed a viral day in the sun in March — it also means that to meet the demand it needs to spend more. And, at the risk of repeating myself, that demand doesn’t necessarily translate into profitability. As discussed above, SoftBank has to overcome significant challenges to fund both OpenAI and Stargate, and when I say "fund," I mean fund the current state of both projects, assuming no further obligations. The Information reports that OpenAI forecasts that it will spend $28 billion on compute with Microsoft alone in 2028. The same article also reports that OpenAI "would turn profitable by the end of the decade after the buildout of Stargate," suggesting that OpenAI's operating expenses will grow exponentially year-over-year. These costs, per The Information, are astronomical: SoftBank has had to (and will continue having to) go to remarkable lengths to fund OpenAI's current ($40 billion) round, lengths so significant that it may lead to its credit rating being further downgraded. Even if we assume the best case scenario — OpenAI successfully converts to a for-profit entity by the end of the year, and receives the full $30 billion — it seems unlikely (if not impossible) for it to continue raising the amount of capital they need to continue operations. As I’ve argued in previous newsletters, there are only a few entities that can provide the kinds of funding that OpenAI needs. These include big tech-focused investment firms like Softbank, sovereign wealth funds (like those of Saudi Arabia and the United Emirates), and perhaps the largest tech companies. These entities can meet OpenAI’s needs, but not all the time. It’s not realistic to expect Softbank, or Microsoft, or the Saudis, or Oracle, or whoever, to provide $40bn every year for the foreseeable future. This is especially true for Softbank. Based on its current promise to not borrow more than 25% of its holdings, it is near-impossible that SoftBank will be able to continue funding OpenAI at this rate ($40 billion a year), and $40 billion a year may not actually be enough. Based on its last reported equity value of holdings, SoftBank's investments and other assets are worth around $229 billion, meaning that it can borrow just over $57bn while remaining compliant with these guidelines. In any case, it is unclear how SoftBank can fund OpenAI, but it's far clearer that nobody else is willing to. Before we go any further, it's important to note that OpenAI does not really have its own compute infrastructure. The majority of its compute is provided by Microsoft, though, as mentioned above, OpenAI now has a deal with CoreWeave to take over Microsoft's future options for more capacity. Anyway, in the last 90 days, Sam Altman has complained about a lack of GPUs and pressure on OpenAI's servers multiple times. Forgive me for repeating stuff from above, but this is necessary. These statements, in a bubble, seem either harmless or like OpenAI's growth is skyrocketing — the latter of which might indeed be true, but bodes ill for a company that burns money on every single user. Any mention of rate limits or performance issues suggests that OpenAI is having significant capacity issues, and at this point it's unclear what further capacity it can actually expand to outside of that currently available. Remember, Microsoft has now pulled out of as much as 2GW of data center projects, walked away from a $1 billion data center development in Ohio, and declined the option on $12bn of compute from CoreWeave that OpenAI had to pick up — meaning that it may be pushing up against the limits of what is physically available. While the total available capacity of GPUs at many providers like Lambda and Crusoe is unknown, we know that CoreWeave has approximately 360MWavailable, compared to Microsoft's 6.5 to 7.5 Gigawatts, a large chunk of which already powers OpenAI. If OpenAI is running into capacity issues, it could be one of the following: Per The Information's reporting, Microsoft "promised OpenAI 300,000 NVIDIA GB200 (Blackwell) chips by the end of 2025," or roughly $18 billion of chips. It's unclear if this has changed since Microsoft allowed OpenAI to seek other compute in late January 2025. I also don't believe that OpenAI has any other viable options for existing compute infrastructure outside of Microsoft. CoreWeave's current data centers mostly feature NVIDIA's aging "Hopper" GPUs, and while it could — and likely is! — retrofitting its current infrastructure with Blackwell chips, doing so is not easy. Blackwell chips require far more powerful cooling and server infrastructure to make them run smoothly (a problem which led to a delay in their delivery to most customers), and even if CoreWeave was able to replace every last Hopper GPU with Blackwell (it won't), it still wouldn't match what OpenAI needs to expand. One might argue that it simply needs to wait for the construction of the Stargate data center, or for CoreWeave to finish the gigawatt or so of construction it’s working on. As I've previously written, I have serious concerns over the viability of CoreWeave ever completing its (alleged) contracted 1.3 Gigawatts of capacity. Per my article: However, even if I were to humour the idea, it is impossible that any of this project is done by the end of the year, or even in 2026. I can find no commitments to any timescale, other than the fact that OpenAI will allegedly start paying CoreWeave in October (per The Information), which could very well be using current capacity. I can also find no evidence that Crusoe, the company building the Stargate data center, has any compute available. Lambda, a GPU compute company that raised $320 million earlier in this year, and according to Data Center Dynamics "operates out of colocation data centers in San Francisco, California, and Allen, Texas, and is backed by more than $820 million in funds raised just this year," suggesting that it may not have their own data centers at all. Its ability to scale is entirely contingent on the availability of whatever data center providers it has relationships with. In any case, this means that OpenAI's only real choice for GPUs is CoreWeave or Microsoft. While it's hard to calculate precisely, OpenAI's best case scenario is that 16,000 GPUs come online in the summer of 2025 as part of the Stargate data center project. That's a drop in the bucket compared to the 300,000 Blackwell GPUs that Microsoft had previously promised. OpenAI is, regardless of how you or I may feel about generative AI, one of the fastest-growing companies of all time. It currently has, according to its own statements, 500 million weekly active users. Putting aside that each user is unprofitable, such remarkable growth — especially as it's partially a result of its extremely resource-intensive image generator — is also a strain on its infrastructure. The vast majority of OpenAI's users are free customers using ChatGPT, with only around 20 million paying subscribers, and the vast majority on the cheapest $20 plan. OpenAI's services — even in the case of image generation — are relatively commoditized, meaning that users can, if they really care, go and use any number of other different Large Language Model services. They can switch to Bing Image Creator, or Grok, or Stable Diffusion, or whatever. Free users are also a burden on the company — especially with such a piss-poor conversion rate — losing it money with each prompt (which is also the case with paying customers), and the remarkable popularity of its image generation service only threatens to bring more burdensome one-off customers that will generate a few abominable Studio Ghibli pictures and then never return. If OpenAI's growth continues at this rate, it will run into capacity issues, and it does not have much room to expand. While we do not know how much capacity it’s taking up with Microsoft, or indeed whether Microsoft is approaching capacity or otherwise limiting how much of it OpenAI can take, we do know that OpenAI has seen reason to beg for access to more GPUs. In simpler terms, even if OpenAI wasn’t running out of money, even if OpenAI wasn’t horrifyingly unprofitable, it also may not have enough GPUs to continue providing its services in a reliable manner. If that's the case, there really isn't much that can be done to fix it other than: The problem is that these measures, even if they succeed in generating more money for the company, also need to reduce the burden on OpenAI's available infrastructure. Remember: data centers can take three to six years to build, and even with the Stargate's accelerated (and I'd argue unrealistic) timelines, OpenAI isn't even unlocking a tenth of Microsoft's promised compute (16,000 GPUs online this year versus the 300,000 GPUs promised by Microsoft). Though downtime might be an obvious choice, capacity issues at OpenAI will likely manifest in hard limits on what free users can do, some of which I've documented above. Nevertheless, I believe the real pale horses of capacity issues come from arbitrary limits on any given user group, meaning both free and paid users. Sudden limits on what a user can do — a reduction in the number of generations of images of videos for paid users, any introduction of "peak hours," or any increases in prices are a sign that OpenAI is running out of GPUs, which it has already publicly said is happening. However, the really obvious one would be service degradation — delays in generations of any kind, 500 status code errors, or ChatGPT failing to fully produce an answer. OpenAI has, up until this point, had fairly impressive uptime. Still, if it is running up against a wall, this streak will end. The consequences depend on how often these issues occur, and to whom they occur. If free users face service degradation, they will bounce off the product, as their use is likely far more fleeting than a paid user, which will begin to erode OpenAI's growth. Ironically, rapid (and especially unprecedented) growth in one of OpenAI’s competitors, like xAI or Anthropic, could also represent a pale horse for OpenAI. If paid users face service degradation, it's likely this will cause the most harm to the company, as while paid users still lose OpenAI money in the end, it at least receives some money in exchange. OpenAI has effectively one choice here: getting more GPUs from Microsoft, and its future depends heavily both on its generosity and there being enough of them at a time when Microsoft has pulled back from two gigawatts of data centers specifically because of it moving away from providing compute for OpenAI. Admittedly, OpenAI has previously spent more on training models than inference (actually running them) and the company might be able to smooth downtime issues by shifting capacity. This would, of course, have a knock-on effect on its ability to continue developing new models, and the company is already losing ground, particularly when it comes to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek. As part of its deal with SoftBank, OpenAI must convert its bizarre non-profit structure into a for-profit entity by December 2025, or it’ll lose $10 billion from its promised funding. Furthermore, in the event that OpenAI fails to convert to a for-profit by October 2026, investors in its previous $6.6 billion round can claw back their investment, with it converting into a loan with an attached interest rate. Naturally, this represents a nightmare scenario for the company, as it’ll increase both its costs and its outgoings. This is a complex situation that almost warrants its own newsletter, but the long and short of it is that OpenAI would have to effectively dissolve itself, start the process of forming an entirely new entity, and distribute its assets to other nonprofits (or sell/license them to the for-profit company at fair market rates). It would require valuing OpenAI's assets, which in and of itself would be a difficult task, as well as getting past the necessary state regulators, the IRS, state revenue agencies, and the upcoming trial with Elon Musk only adds further problems. I’ve simplified things here, and that’s because (as I said) this stuff is complex. Suffice to say, this isn’t as simple as liquidating a company and starting afresh, or submitting a couple of legal filings. It’s a long, fraught process and one that will be — and has been — subject to legal challenges, both from OpenAI’s business rivals, as well as from civil society organizations in California. Based on discussions with experts in the field and my own research, I simply do not know how OpenAI pulls this off by October 2026, let alone by the end of the year. OpenAI has become a load-bearing company for the tech industry, both as a narrative — as previously discussed, ChatGPT is the only Large Language Model company with any meaningful userbase — and as a financial entity. Its ability to meet its obligations and its future expansion plans are critical to the future health — or, in some cases, survival — of multiple large companies, and that's before the after-effects that will affect its customers as a result of any financial collapse. The parallels to the 2007-2008 financial crisis are startling. Lehman Brothers wasn’t the largest investment bank in the world (although it was certainly big), just like OpenAI isn’t the largest tech company (though, again, it’s certainly large in terms of market cap and expenditure). Lehman Brothers’ collapse sparked a contagion that would later spread throughout the global financial services industry, and consequently, the global economy. I can see OpenAI’s failure having a similar systemic effect. While there is a vast difference between OpenAI’s involvement in people’s lives compared to the millions of subprime loans issued to real people, the stock market’s dependence on the value of the Magnificent 7 stocks (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, NVIDIA and Tesla), and in turn the Magnificent 7’s reliance on the stability of the AI boom narrative still threatens material harm to millions of people, and that’s before the ensuing layoffs. And as I’ve said before, this entire narrative is based off of OpenAI’s success, because OpenAI is the generative AI industry. I want to lay out the direct result of any kind of financial crisis at OpenAI, because I don't think anybody is taking this seriously. Per The Information, Oracle, which has taken responsibility for organizing the construction of the Stargate data centers with unproven data center builder Crusoe, "...may need to raise more capital to fund its data center ambitions." Oracle has signed a 15-year lease with Crusoe, and, to quote The Information, "...is on the hook for $1 billion in payments to that firm." To further quote The Information: In simpler terms, Oracle is building a giant data center for one customer — OpenAI — and has taken on the financial burden associated with it. If OpenAI fails to expand, or lacks the capital to actually pay for its share of the Stargate project, Oracle is on the hook for at least a billion dollars, and, based on The Information's reporting, is also on the hook to buy the GPUs for the site. In reality, this development will likely cost tens of billions of dollars, $19 billion of which is due from OpenAI, which does not have the money until it receives its second tranche of funding in December 2025, which is contingent partially on its ability to convert into a for-profit entity, which, as mentioned, is a difficult and unlikely proposition. It's unclear how many of the Blackwell GPUs that Oracle has had to purchase in advance, but in the event of any kind of financial collapse at OpenAI, Oracle would likely take a loss of at least a billion dollars, if not several billion dollars. I have written a lot about publicly-traded AI compute firm CoreWeave, and it would be my greatest pleasure to never mention it again. Nevertheless, I have to. The Financial Times revealed a few weeks ago that CoreWeave's debt payments could balloon to over $2.4 billion a year by the end of 2025, far outstripping its cash reserves, and The Information reported that its cash burn would increase to $15 billion in 2025. As per its IPO filings, 62% of CoreWeave's 2024 revenue (a little under $2 billion, with losses of $863 million) was Microsoft compute, and based on conversations with sources, a good amount of this was Microsoft running compute for OpenAI. Starting October 2025, OpenAI will start paying Coreweave as part of its five-year-long $12 billion contract, picking up the option that Microsoft declined. This is also when CoreWeave will have to start making payments on its massive, multi-billion dollar DDTL 2.0 loan, which likely makes these payments critical to CoreWeave's future. This deal also suggests that OpenAI will become CoreWeave's largest customer. Microsoft had previously committed to spending $10 billion on CoreWeave's services "by the end of the decade," but CEO Satya Nadella added a few months later on a podcast that its relationship with CoreWeave was a "one-time thing." Assuming Microsoft keeps spending at its previous rate — something that isn't guaranteed — it would still be only half of OpenAI's potential revenue. CoreWeave's expansion, at this point, is entirely driven by OpenAI. 77% of its 2024 revenue came from two customers — Microsoft being the largest, and using CoreWeave as an auxiliary supplier of compute for OpenAI. As a result, the future expansion efforts — the theoretical 1.3 gigawatts of contracted (translation: does not exist yet) compute — are largely (if not entirely) for the benefit of OpenAI. In the event that OpenAI cannot fulfil its obligations, CoreWeave will collapse. It is that simple. I’m basing this on a comment I received from Gil Luria, Managing Director and Head of Technology Research at analyst D.A. Davidson & Co: CoreWeave receives preferential access to NVIDIA's GPUs, and makes up billions of dollars of its revenue. CoreWeave then takes those GPUs and raises debt using them as collateral, then proceeds to buy more of those GPUs from NVIDIA. NVIDIA was the anchor for CoreWeave's IPO, and CEO Michael Intrator said that the IPO "wouldn't have closed" without NVIDIA buying $250 million worth of shares. NVIDIA invested $100 million in the early days of CoreWeave, and, for reasons I cannot understand, also agreed to spend $1.3 billion over four years to, and I quote The Information, "rent its own chips from CoreWeave." Buried in CoreWeave's S-1 — the document every company publishes before going public — was a warning about counterparty credit risk, which is when one party provides services or goods to another with specific repayment terms, and the other party not meeting their side of the deal. While this was written as a theoretical (as it could, in theoretically, come from any company to which CoreWeave acts as a creditor) it only named one company: OpenAI. As discussed previously, CoreWeave is saying that, should a customer — any customer, but really, it means OpenAI — fail to pay its bills for infrastructure built on their behalf, or for services rendered, it could have a material risk to the business. CoreWeave's continued ability to do business hinges heavily on its ability to raise further debt (which I have previously called into question), and its ability to raise further debt is, to quote the Financial Times, "secured against its more than 250,000 Nvidia chips and its contracts with customers, such as Microsoft." Any future debt that CoreWeave raises would be based upon its contract with OpenAI (you know, the counterparty credit risk threat that represents a disproportionate share of its revenue) and whatever GPUs it still has to collateralize. As a result, a chunk of NVIDIA's future revenue is dependent on OpenAI's ability to fulfil its obligations to CoreWeave, both in its ability to pay them and their timeliness in doing so. If OpenAI fails, then CoreWeave fails, which then hurts NVIDIA. Contagion. With Microsoft's data center pullback and OpenAI's intent to become independent from Redmond, future data center expansion is based on two partners supporting CoreWeave and Oracle: Crusoe and Core Scientific, neither of which appear to have ever built an AI data center. I also must explain how difficult building a data center is, and how said difficulty increases when you're building an AI-focused data center. For example, NVIDIA had to delay the launch of its Blackwell GPUs because of how finicky the associated infrastructure (the accompanying servers and cooling them) is. For customers that already had experience handling GPUs, and therefore likely know how to manage the extreme temperatures created by them. As another reminder, OpenAI is on the hook for $19 billion of funding behind Stargate, money that neither it nor SoftBank has right now. Imagine if you didn't have any experience, and effectively had to learn from scratch? How do you think that would go? We're about to find out! Crusoe is a former cryptocurrency mining company that has now raised hundreds of millions of dollars to build data centers for AI companies, starting with a $3.4 billion data center financing deal with asset manager Blue Owl Capital. This (yet-to-be-completed) data center has now been leased by Oracle, which will, allegedly, fill it full of GPUs for OpenAI. Despite calling itself "the industry’s first vertically integrated AI infrastructure provider," with the company using flared gas (a waste byproduct of oil production) to power IT infrastructure, Crusoe does not appear to have built an AI data center, and is now being tasked with building a 1.2 Gigawatt data center campus for OpenAI. Crusoe is the sole developer and operator of the Abilene site, meaning, according to The Information, "...is in charge of contracting with construction contractors and data center customers, as well as running the data center after it is built." Oracle, it seems, will be responsible for filling said data center with GPUs and the associated hardware. Nevertheless, the project appears to be behind schedule. The Information reported in October 2024 that Abeline was meant to have "...50,000 of NVIDIA's [Blackwell] AI chips...in the first quarter of [2025]," and also suggested that the site was projected to have 100,000 Blackwell chips by the end of 2025. Here in reality, a report from Bloomberg in March 2025 (that I cited previously) said that OpenAI and Oracle were expected to have 16,000 GPUs available by the Summer of 2025, with "...OpenAI and oracle are expected to deploy 64,000 NVIDIA GB200s at the Stargate data center...by the end of 2026." As discussed above, OpenAI needs this capacity. According to The Information, OpenAI expects Stargate to handle three-quarters of its compute by 2030, and these delays call into question at the very least whether this schedule is reasonable, if not whether Stargate, as a project, is actually possible. I've written a great deal about CoreWeave in the past, and specifically about its buildout partner Core Scientific, a cryptocurrency mining company (yes, another one) that has exactly one customer for AI data centers — CoreWeave. A few notes: Core Scientific is also, it seems, taking on $1.14 billion of capital expenditures to build out these data centers, with CoreWeave promising to reimburse $899.3 million of these costs. It's also unclear how Core Scientific intends to do this. While it’s taken on a good amount of debt in the past — $550 million in a convertible note toward the end of 2024 — this would be more debt than it’s ever taken on. It also, as with Crusoe, does not appear to have any experience building AI data centers, except unlike Crusoe, Core Scientific is a barely-functioning recently-bankrupted bitcoin miner pretending to be a data center company. How important is CoreWeave to OpenAI exactly? From Semafor: But will it survive long term? Going back to the point of contagion: If OpenAI fails, and CoreWeave fails, so too does Core Scientific. And I don’t fancy Crusoe’s chances, either. At least Crusoe isn’t public. Up until fairly recently, Microsoft has been the entire infrastructural backbone of OpenAI, but recently (to free OpenAI up to work with Oracle) released it from its exclusive cloud compute deal. Nevertheless, per The Information, OpenAI still intends to spend $13 billion on compute on Microsoft Azure this year. What's confusing, however, is whether any of this is booked as revenue. Microsoft claimed earlier in this year that it surpassed $13 billion in annual recurring revenue — by which it means its last month multiplied by 12 — from artificial intelligence. OpenAI's compute costs in 2024 were $5 billion, at a discounted Azure rate, which, on an annualized basis, would be around $416 million in revenue a month for Microsoft. It isn't, however, clear whether Microsoft counts OpenAI's compute spend as revenue. Microsoft's earnings do not include an "artificial intelligence" section, but three separate segments: As a result, it's hard to say specifically where OpenAI's revenue sits, but based on an analysis of Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment from FY23 Q1 (note, financial years don’t always correspond with the calendar year, so we just finished FY25 Q2 in January) through to its most recent earnings, and found that there was a spike in revenue from FY23 Q1 to FY24 Q1. In FY23 Q1 (which ended on September 30, 2022, a month before ChatGPT's launch), the segment made $20.3 billion. The following year, in FY24 Q1, it made $24.3 billion — a 19.7% year-over-year (or roughly $4 billion) increase. This could represent the massive increase in training and inference costs associated with hosting ChatGPT, peaking at $28.5 billion in revenue in FY24 Q4 — before dropping dramatically to $24.1 billion in FY25 Q1 and raising a little to $25.5 billion in FY25 Q2. OpenAI spent 2023 training its GPT-4o model before transitioning to its massive, expensive "Orion" model which would eventually become GPT 4.5, as well as its video generation model "Sora." According to the Wall Street Journal, training GPT 4.5 involved at least one training run costing "around half a billion dollars in computing costs alone." These are huge sums, but it’s worth noting a couple of things. First, Microsoft licenses OpenAI’s models to third parties, so some of this revenue could be from other companies using GPT on Azure. And there’s also other companies running their own models on Azure. We’ve seen a lot of companies launch AI products, and not all of them are based on LLMs. Muddling things further, Microsoft provides OpenAI access to Azure cloud services at a discounted rate. And so, there’s a giant question mark over OpenAI’s contribution to the various spikes in revenue for Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud segment, or whether other third-parties played a significant role. Furthermore, Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI isn’t entirely in cold, hard cash. Rather, it has provided the company with credits to be redeemed on Azure services. I’m not entirely sure how this would be represented on accounting terms, and if anyone can shed light on this, please get in touch. Would it be noted as revenue, or something else? OpenAI isn’t paying Microsoft, but rather doing the tech equivalent of redeeming some airmiles, or spending a gift card. Additionally, while equity is often treated as income for tax purposes — as is the case when an employee receives RSUs as part of their compensation package — under the existing OpenAI structure, Microsoft isn’t a shareholder but rather the owner of profit-sharing units. This is a distinction worth noting. These profit-sharing units are treated as analogous to equity, at least in terms of OpenAI’s ability to raise capital, but in practice they aren’t the same thing. They don’t represent ownership in the company as directly as, for example, a normal share unit would. They lack the liquidity of a share, and the upside they provide — namely, dividends — is purely theoretical. Another key difference: when a company goes bankrupt and enters liquidation, shareholders can potentially receive a share of the proceeds (after other creditors, employees, etc are paid). While that often doesn’t happen (as in, the liabilities far exceed the assets of the company), it’s at least theoretically possible. Given that profit-sharing units aren’t actually shares, where does that leave Microsoft? This stuff is confusing, and I’m not ashamed to say that complicated accounting questions like these are far beyond my understanding. If anyone can shed some light, drop me an email, or a message on Twitter or BlueSky, or post on the Better Offline subreddit. I have done my best to write this piece in as objective a tone as possible, regardless of my feelings about the generative AI bubble and its associated boosters. OpenAI, as I've written before, is effectively the entire generative AI industry, with its nearest competitor being less than five percent of its 500 million weekly active users. Its future is dependent — and this is not an opinion, but objective fact — on effectively infinite resources. If it required $40 billion to continue operations this year, it is reasonable to believe it will need at least another $40 billion next year, and based on its internal projections, will need at least that every single other year until 2030, when it claims, somehow, it will be profitable "with the completion of the Stargate data center." OpenAI requires more compute resources than anyone has ever needed, and will continue to do so in perpetuity. Building these resources is now dependent on two partners — Core Scientific and Crusoe — that have never built a data center, as Microsoft has materially pulled back on data center development, which have (as well as the aforementioned pullback on 2GW of data centers) "slowed or paused" some of its "early stage" data center projects. This shift is directly linked to Microsoft’s relationship with OpenAI, withTD Cowen's recent analyst report saying that data center pullbacks were, and I quote its March 26 2025 data center channel checks letter, "...driven by the decision to not support incremental OpenAI training workloads." In simpler terms, OpenAI needs more compute at a time when its lead backer, which has the most GPUs in the world, has specifically walked away from building it. Even in my most optimistic frame of mind, it isn't realistic to believe that Crusoe or Core Scientific can build the data centers necessary for OpenAI's expansion. Even if SoftBank and OpenAI had the money to invest in Stargate today, dollars do not change the fabric of reality. Data centers take time to build, requiring concrete, wood, steel and other materials to be manufactured and placed, and that's after the permitting required to get these deals done. Even if that succeeds, getting the power necessary is a challenge unto itself, to the point that even Oracle, an established and storied cloud compute company, to quote The Information, "...has less experience than its larger rivals in dealing with utilities to secure power and working with powerful and demanding cloud customers whose plans change frequently." A partner like Crusoe or Core Scientific simply doesn't have the muscle memory or domain expertise that Microsoft has when it comes to building and operating data centers. As a result, it's hard to imagine even in the best case scenario that they're able to match the hunger for compute that OpenAI has. Now, I want to be clear — I believe OpenAI will still continue to use Microsoft's compute, and even expand further into whatever remaining compute Microsoft may have. However, there is now a hard limit on how much of it there's going to be, both literally (in what's physically available) and in what Microsoft itself will actually OpenAI them to use, especially given how unprofitable GPU compute might be. Last week, a truly offensive piece of fan fiction — framed as a "report" — called AI 2027 went viral, garnering press coverage with the Dwarkesh Podcast and gormless, child-like wonder from the New York Times' Kevin Roose. Its predictions vaguely suggest a theoretical company called OpenBrain will invent a self-teaching agent of some sort. It's bullshit, but it captured the hearts and minds of AI boosters because it vaguely suggests that somehow Large Language Models and their associated technology will become something entirely different. I don't like making predictions like these because the future — especially in our current political climate — is so chaotic, but I will say that I do not see, and I say this with complete objectivity, how any of this continues. I want to be extremely blunt with the following points, as I feel like both members of the media and tech analysts have failed to express how ridiculous things have become. I will be repeating myself, but it's necessary, as I need you to understand how untenable things are. I see no way in which OpenAI can continue to raise money at this rate, even if OpenAI somehow actually receives the $40 billion, which will require it becoming a for-profit entity. While it could theoretically stretch that $40 billion to last multiple years, projections say it’ll burn $320 billion in the next five years. Or, more likely, I can’t see a realistic way in which OpenAI gets the resources it needs to survive. It’ll need a streak of unlikely good fortune, the kind of which you only ever hear about in Greek epic poems: If those things happen, I’ll obviously find myself eating crow. But I’m not worried. In the present conditions, OpenAI is on course to run out of money or compute capacity, and it's unclear which will happen first. Even in a hysterical bubble where everybody is agreeing that this is the future, OpenAI currently requires more money and more compute than is reasonable to acquire. Nobody has ever raised as much as OpenAI needs to, and based on the sheer amount of difficulty that SoftBank is having in raising the funds to meet the lower tranche ($10bn) of its commitment, it may simply not be possible for this company to continue. Even with extremely preferential payment terms — months-long deferred payments, for example — at some point somebody is going to need to get paid. I will give Sam Altman credit. He's found many partners to shoulder the burden of the rotten economics of OpenAI, with Microsoft, Oracle, Crusoe and CoreWeave handling the up-front costs of building the infrastructure, SoftBank finding the investors for its monstrous round, and the tech media mostly handling his marketing for him. He is, however, over-leveraged. OpenAI has never been forced to stand on its own two feet or focus on efficiency, and I believe the constant enabling of its ugly, nonsensical burnrate has doomed this company. OpenAI has acted like it’ll always have more money and compute, and that people will always believe its bullshit, mostly because up until recently everybody has. OpenAI cannot "make things cheaper" at this point, because the money has always been there to make things more expensive, as has the compute to make larger language models that burn billions of dollars a year. This company is not built to reduce its footprint in any way, nor is it built for a future in which it wouldn't have access to, as I've said before, infinite resources. Worse still, investors and the media have run cover for the fact that these models don't really do much more than they did a year ago and for the overall diminishing returns of Large Language Models. I have had many people attack my work about OpenAI, but none have provided any real counterpoint to the underlying economic argument I've made since July of last year that OpenAI is unsustainable. This is likely because there really isn't one, other than "OpenAI will continue to raise more money than anybody has ever raised in history, in perpetuity, and will somehow turn from the least-profitable company of all time to a profitable one." This isn’t a rational argument. It’s a religious one. It’s a call for faith. And I see no greater pale horse of the apocalypse than Microsoft's material pullback on data centers. While the argument might be that Microsoft wants OpenAI to have an independent future, that's laughable when you consider Microsoft's deeply monopolistic tendencies — and, for that matter, it owns a massive proportion of OpenAI’s pseudo-equity. At one point, Microsoft’s portion was valued at 49 percent. And while additional fundraising has likely diluted Microsoft’s stake, it still “owns” a massive proportion of what is (at least) the most valuable private startup of all time. And we’re supposed to believe that Microsoft’s pullback — which limits OpenAI’s access to the infrastructure it needs to train and run its models, and thus (as mentioned) represents an existential threat to the company — is because of some paternal desire to see OpenAI leave the childhood bedroom, spread its wings, and enter the real world? Behave. More likely, Microsoft got what it needed out of OpenAI, which has reached the limit of the models it can develop, and which Microsoft already retains the IP of. There’s probably no reason to make any further significant investments, though they allegedly may be part of the initial $10 billion tranche of OpenAI’s next round. It's also important to note that absolutely nobody other than NVIDIA is making any money from generative AI. CoreWeave loses billions of dollars, OpenAI loses billions of dollars, Anthropic loses billions of dollars, and I can't find a single company providing generative AI-powered software that's making a profit. The only companies even close to doing so are consultancies providing services to train and create data for models like Turing and Scale AI — and Scale isn't even profitable. The knock-on effects of OpenAI's collapse will be wide-ranging. Neither CoreWeave nor Crusoe will have tenants for their massive, unsustainable operations, and Oracle will have nobody to sell the compute it’s leased from Crusoe for the next 15 years. CoreWeave will likely collapse under the weight of its abominable debt, which will lead to a 7%+ revenue drop for NVIDIA at a time when revenue growth has already begun to slow. On a philosophical level, OpenAI's health is what keeps this industry alive. OpenAI has the only meaningful userbase in generative AI, and this entire hype-cycle has been driven by its success, meaning any deterioration (or collapse) of OpenAI will tell the market what I've been saying for over a year: that generative AI is not the next hyper-growth market, and its underlying economics do not make sense. I am not writing this to be "right" or "be a hater." If something changes, and I am wrong somehow, I will write exactly how, and why, and what mistakes I made to come to the conclusions I have in this piece. I do not believe that my peers in the media will do the same when this collapses, but I promise you that they will be held accountable, because all of this abominable waste could have been avoided. Large Language Models are not, on their own, the problem. They're tools, capable of some outcomes, doing some things, but the problem, ultimately, are the extrapolations made about their abilities, and the unnecessary drive to make them larger, even if said largeness never amounted to much. Everything that I'm describing is the result of a tech industry — including media and analysts — that refuses to do business with reality, trafficking in ideas and ideology, celebrating victories that have yet to take place, applauding those who have yet to create the things they're talking about, cheering on men lying about what's possible so that they can continue to burn billions of dollars and increase their wealth and influence. I understand why others might not have written this piece. What I am describing is a systemic failure, one at a scale hereto unseen, one that has involved so many rich and powerful and influential people agreeing to ignore reality, and that’ll have crushing impacts for the wider tech ecosystem when it happens.

Nvidia (NVDA) on Monday announced plans to build supercomputers entirely in the U.S., with the chipmaker and its partners set to invest up to $500 billion in American AI infrastructure over the next four years. “The engines of the world’s AI infrastructure are being built in the United States for the first time,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a release, adding "American manufacturing helps us better meet the incredible and growing demand for AI chips and supercomputers, strengthens our supply chain and boosts our resiliency.” Nvidia said its supercomputer manufacturing plants in Texas, being built in partnership with Foxconn and Wistron, are set to ramp production in the next 12 to 15 months. The chipmaker said its Blackwell chips have already started production at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (TSM) facilities in Arizona. Nvidia shares were about 1% lower in recent trading, and have fallen about 18% since the start of the year, as concerns about tariffs and other factors have weighed on tech giants.

"We cannot arrest our way out of unsheltered homelessness," Wilson said in the interview, "...because all you're guaranteeing when you arrest somebody and or cite them or take them into jail is you're ensuring that person's gonna be homeless for another day." (Hard cut to former commissioner and current truck stop lawyer Rene Gonzalez, as he fumes at the end of the bar at Jubitz's Ponderosa Lounge.) When leaders at the Northwest Oregon Labor Council voted to allow the Portland police union to join their ranks, it prompted a sizable controversy among labor and police accountability advocates. The council will now take a wider vote on the issue at the end of the month.[image or embed] • More than 100 students and supporters gathered on the campus of the University of Oregon Friday to demand that the school's administration do more to protect the international students that are being wrongfully and cruelly deported by the racist Trump administration. At least four U of O students have had their visas revoked for bullshit reasons (such as traffic tickets or for vocally supporting Palestine), and protesters are calling for better protection for the students, which includes using the university's alert system to notify everyone when ICE arrives on campus. • Outdoor enthusiast store REI is making a public apology for signing on to a letter that endorsed Trump's controversial pick for secretary of the interior, Doug Burgum. The former North Dakota governor had championed drilling in the Alaska wilderness, supporting coal, and building housing on federal land, and the new CEO of REI (who was not around when the letter was signed) was like, "Oh HELL no!", retracted the endorsement and apologized. Several companies had signed on to the letter which was intended to give them "a seat at the table to continue outdoor recreation advocacy" or more accurately to cravenly lick the boot of the most despicable, anti-environment president we've had in decades... your choice. “We don’t want people that should not be in the profession, bouncing from place to place,” Yamhill County Sheriff Sam Elliott said. “We want to see that finality so that bad apples aren’t able to fly under the radar, so to speak.”[image or embed] • Rescue workers paused their search yesterday for a kayaker who went over Willamette Falls in Oregon City late Saturday night. While the victim's boat was found, the body was not—but, in a chilling twist, during the search another currently unidentified body was found. The search is expected to resume today. • In case you haven't heard, WAR IS HELL. And the new film Warfare (directed by Alex Garland) really hammers the point home in a bloody, excruciatingly tense tale of battle, which our reviewer Dom Sinacola smartly notes is "hyperfocused on war as existential, experiential terror." Is it your cup of tea? Read the review and see! Let's go, trivia lovers! It's time to play POP QUIZ PDX. In this week's local trivia game: the ultimate in unhygienic recycling, inside Portland's "Witch's Castle," and an ode to the shittiest pizza in the world! 🍕😒 See how well YOU score![image or embed] IN NATIONAL/WORLD NEWS: • A Pennsylvania man has been charged with attempted murder and terrorism after setting fire to the home of democratic governor Josh Shapiro, while he and his family were sleeping (thankfully no one was injured). The suspect, Cody Balmer, of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, has not come out and identified himself as a Trumper, but did say he "hated" Shapiro and that if he had confronted the governor, would have beat him to death with a hammer. 😬 • King Fool is threatening the press again, this time going after CBS and its show 60 Minutes, which broadcasted a damning (and absolutely correct) segment on Russia's deadly invasion of Ukraine, and Trump's bizarre threats to take over Greenland. The show infuriated Trump who hopped onto Truth Social to bark that the network would "pay a big price" for going after him reporting truthfully on the news. Trump's poll numbers are plummeting after his disastrous economic policies caused the stock market to crash last week.[image or embed] • Despite all evidence to the contrary, Trump's top physician says that the shambling, presidential pile of bile and Big Macs is in “excellent health.” 😂 While he is currently the oldest person ever elected president, and weighs in at 224 lbs, doctors noted that some of his excess weight can be attributed to Balthamore, the cloven-hooved demon of chaos who currently inhabits his body. Meta is going on trial starting today. The US government is advancing a blockbuster antitrust case, alleging that Mark Zuckerberg’s company illegally built a “social networking monopoly” through years of “anticompetitive conduct.”[image or embed] • Today in grotesque space tourism: Jeff Bezo's "Blue Origin" rocket carried an all female crew (including his girlfriend Lauren Sanchez, TV personality Gayle King, and pop star Katy Perry) for a quick ride into space today, where Perry says she couldn’t resist singing “What a Wonderful World” as she gazed upon the earth below.

Title: Nvidia says it will build AI supercomputers in America for the first time

Nvidia (NVDA) will begin manufacturing AI supercomputers in the U.S. for the first time, the company announced Monday. The chip manufacturer wrote in a blog post that it has commissioned more than a million square feet of manufacturing space in Arizona and Texas. At the Texas factories, located in Houston and Dallas, Nvidia will build and test AI supercomputers. The chipmaker expects mass production to ramp up there over the next 12 to 15 months. The Arizona plant, located in Phoenix, will be reserved for manufacturing Blackwell chips. Production there has already begun. Nvidia said it plans to invest $500 billion in AI infrastructure over the next four years through its various manufacturing partnerships. “Nvidia AI supercomputers are the engines of a new type of data center created for the sole purpose of processing artificial intelligence — AI factories that are the infrastructure powering a new AI industry,” the company wrote. It added that it expects its manufacturing of AI chips and supercomputers to “create hundreds of thousands of jobs and drive trillions of dollars in economic security” over the next few decades. “The engines of the world’s AI infrastructure are being built in the United States for the first time,” Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang said in the announcement. “Adding American manufacturing helps us better meet the incredible and growing demand for AI chips and supercomputers, strengthens our supply chain, and boosts our resiliency.” Nvidia previously has touted its AI supercomputers as being capable of allowing anyone to prototype and develop AI models from their personal computers. The company announced the DGX personal AI supercomputers earlier this year. Nvidia stock fell about half a percent following the announcement about its U.S. manufacturing Monday morning. It’s down about 20% on the year in the face of the market uncertainty created by President Donald Trump’s tariffs.

Title: Germany's best employers for professional development according to LinkedIn

The Local Europe ABVästmannagatan 43113 25 StockholmSweden Those looking to move to Germany for work this year, or to switch jobs in the country, might take a tip from LinkedIn's best employers ranking. LinkedIn, the online jobs board turned social media platform, published its "top companies" list for 2025 last week, including a ranking of the "25 best large employers for your professional development" in Germany. Germany's jobs market is marked by uncertainty at the moment as its major industries navigate economic stagnation on the domestic market as well as increasing turbulence on global markets. At the same time - and despite a slight uptick in unemployment - there are plenty of opportunities for jobseekers around, as Germany still lacks the skilled workers it needs to fill positions in key industries. 'The best employers for professional development' According to LinkedIn, more than half of professionals worldwide are currently looking to change change jobs or even industries, and many of them are interested in re-tooling their skills and qualifications to help secure their employment into the future. As well as benefits like a good salary and perks, jobseekers also increasingly expect their employer to provide training opportunities and promote their professional development. READ ALSO: The jobs and skills growing in demand across Germany To help candidates find the best opportunities, LinkedIn's ranking took special interest in employers that help employees develop their careers. Here are the top 25 companies in Germany: Notably, many of the top rated firms are manufacturers and software developers. Siemens, which took the number one spot, largely focuses on manufacturing machinery for automation. Its main locations in Germany are in Munich, Nuremberg and Berlin, and the most common job titles it hires for are project managers, software engineers and product managers. Stryker, which was rated second-highest, is a US-based medical equipment manufacturer with German locations in Freiburg and Kiel. It tends to hire sales representatives, manufacturing engineers, and construction administrators, and seeks employees with skills related to biomedical engineering, general surgery and human movement science. Third on the list is ServiceNow, a California-based software development company with locations in Munich, Frankfurt and Berlin. ServiceNow is focused largely on creating AI platforms for companies and tends to seek IT consultants and account managers. How was the ranking determined? The list of top employers in this category was limited to large companies (at 5,000 employees worldwide with at least 500 in Germany). According to LinkedIn, companies were evaluated on eight factors, which included development, skills growth, business stability, external job prospects, business affinity, gender diversity, educational level (of employees) and employer relevance. Companies with a turnover rate above ten percent were also excluded, as were those that had laid off ten percent or more of their workforce since the start of 2024. Interestingly, those constraints made LinkedIn's ranking look quite different from a a Statista survey of Germany's top employers released at the beginning of the year. That survey, commissioned by Stern magazine, saw the drugstore supermarket DM at the top of the list, followed by Adidas and Google Germany. Several automakers also made the list; BMW, Porsche and Audi were all in the top ten. REVEALED: The 'best' German companies to work for in 2025 Some of those companies were likely omitted from LinkedIn's ranking due to recently announced layoffs, such as those at the above mentioned car makers and Adidas.

Title: Pfizer just had a big setback in its race for an Ozempic competitor

Time Published: 2025-04-14T14:44:00Z
Full Content:
Pfizer (PFE) announced Monday that it is ending development of its daily weight-loss pill following a liver injury to a patient participating in a trial. The patient, who was asymptomatic, recovered after they stopped taking the medication, according to a statement from the U.S.-based pharmaceutical giant. While the statement didn’t directly say the participant’s liver enzymes were elevated, it pointed out that “the overall frequency of liver enzyme elevations across the over 1,400 participant safety database of danuglipron is in-line with approved agents in the class.” This can often indicate damage to liver cells, an issue that has been linked to other weight-loss drugs, according to CNBC. “While we are disappointed to discontinue the development of danuglipron, we remain committed to evaluating and advancing promising programs in an effort to bring innovative new medicines to patients,” Pfizer chief scientific officer Dr. Chris Boshoff said in the release, adding that the company will continue developing other weight-loss drugs. Pfizer said that data from the trial will still be submitted to the scientific community for further study. Pfizer was developing danuglipron, an oral GLP-1 drug, as something of a rival to Ozempic and Wegovy, both of which are manufactured by Denmark-based Novo Nordisk (NVO). Early trials had shown that Pfizer’s pill resulted in about as much weight loss as Wegovy. An oral weight-loss medication would be far less invasive than the injections required by most GLP-1s. Like Pfizer, pharma giants including Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly (LLY), and AstraZeneca (AZN) are working on their own oral weight-loss pills. Viking Therapeutics (VKTX), a San Diego-based pharma company, has also shown promising results in early trials. Despite the setback, Pfizer’s stock was up 0.9% Monday morning. Eli Lilly rose 1.6%, and Novo Nordisk rose 2.5%. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Good morning. A business owner bought a Cybertruck last year to advertise her company. Now, she's one of many cybertruck owners facing growing hostility and threats of violence. "I paid over $400 to teach my staff self-defense," she writes. Read the full story. In today's newsletter, the tech industry received some welcome news over the weekend — sort of. What's on deck Markets: The spasm in the Treasury market last week was a warning for Trump and the US. Tech: Microsoft just tapped the brakes on its AI data center expansion. Is that a bad sign? Business: Elon Musk's marketing strategy for Tesla made showrooms a "sitting duck" for protesters. But first, Big Tech dares to dream. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Confusion abounds this morning. On Friday, the US Customs and Border Protection said devices like smartphones, computers, and memory chips would be exempt from higher tariffs. "This is the dream scenario for tech investors," Dan Ives, the global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, posted on X. "Smartphones, chips being excluded is a game-changer scenario when it comes to China tariffs." Global tech titans breathed a sigh of relief … for a moment. Trump took to Truth Social on Sunday with some clarifications. "NOBODY is getting 'off the hook'," he wrote, adding: "Especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst!" Trump denied there were ever actually exemptions from tariffs because a previous tariff is still in place. "There was no Tariff 'exception'," Trump wrote. "These products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff 'bucket.'" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick echoed Trump's comments during an interview with ABC News on Sunday, saying that tech products would be subject to tariffs after an investigation into the effect importing vital tech components has on national security So, not quite an exemption — but exempt-ish. It was still welcome news for Big Tech. As chaotic as the messaging over the weekend was, certain tech products are no longer exposed to the 145% reciprocal tariff on China. US stock futures are up early Monday, with both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq rising as much as 1.4%. Apple is up more than 5% in premarket trading. 1. A historic week for markets. Stocks plunged and soared every day last week as Wall Street tried to gauge the impact of Trump's shifting tariffs. BI recapped investors' roller coaster ride. 2. The bond market has flashed a warning sign for the US and Trump. Intense volatility in the usually safe bond market put pressure on President Trump to partly pause the trade war last week. A sell-off in US Treasurys pushed bond yields to their highest level since January. 3. A top strategist is waiting for a stock surge. Piper Sandler's Craig Johnson isn't backing down from his high price target for the S&P 500, even despite current volatility. Here's why he still expects it to surge to 6,600 by year-end. 1. Vibe coding is changing the game for investors and founders. Traditionally, VCs have leaned toward software startup founders with coding expertise. Now, as AI tools pitch in, they have shifting expectations. 2. Tech investors feel a funding chill coming on. The AI boom sparked further interest in tech, but recent market turmoil is prompting some VC firms to hold back on big deals. The whole thing feels a bit like "Groundhog Day," one emerging fund manager told BI. 3. Microsoft took its foot off the AI accelerator. Should we be worried? Microsoft has backed away from data center expansion even though the pace of AI investment hasn't slowed a bit. The move is a troubling step, but it's a strategic recalibration, not a retreat, BI's Alistair Barr writes. 1. Tesla's big blue blunder. Elon Musk's marketing strategy of putting Tesla showrooms in the middle of cities' liberal enclaves has now backfired big-time. Being in high-traffic zones has made the showrooms a sitting duck for protesters. 2. It's easier than ever for businesses to jack up prices. Thanks to a whipsawing economy and modern technology, businesses can now change prices at the drop of a hat. Consumers don't always know why the hikes are happening — and they're exhausted. 3. Teens still <3 Chick-fil-A. The chicken chain is teens' favorite restaurant brand, according to a recent Piper Sandler survey. Chick-fil-A has held the first place spot for seven years in a row, the investment bank told BI, consistently beating out McDonald's.

A Nasdaq bounce looks to be brewing on Monday after U.S. officials moved to temporarily exempt smartphones, laptops, and other high-end electronics from the Trump administration’s sweeping 145% tariffs on Chinese imports. The European tech sector signaled strength earlier in the morning, and stateside, Apple (AAPL) shares jumped more than 6%, Dell (DELL) surged over 7%, and Nvidia (NVDA) and Intel (INTC) each climbed over 3% in early trading. The rally reflects just how sensitive markets remain to even short-lived tariff clarity. But that clarity may be fleeting. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said over the weekend that while consumer electronics are spared from reciprocal tariffs, they’re still on track to face new levies — set to hit “in probably a month or two.” Meanwhile, Apple grabbed headlines for a different reason: taking the global top spot in smartphone shipments for the first quarter of 2025. Strong demand for the iPhone 16e in Japan and India helped push Apple ahead of Samsung and its Chinese rivals. Even as supply chain concerns persist, Apple’s global brand power remains formidable. Following strong results from mega-banks last week, Goldman Sachs (GS) reported a 15% jump in profit to $4.74 billion, or $14.12 per share, before Monday’s market open. Strong trading revenues drove the beat, and shares rose 2% in early trading. But Goldman’s performance is also a reminder: Wall Street firms often find ways to thrive in chaos. As a barometer for capital flows and market confidence, Goldman’s beat underscores how volatility, while unsettling, isn’t always unprofitable. Despite Monday’s bounce, market outlooks are getting darker. Analysts at Morgan Stanley (MS) and Citigroup (C) both slashed their year-end targets for U.S. equities, citing decelerating earnings growth, global instability, and increasingly erratic policy moves. With major names like Netflix (NFLX), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), and UnitedHealth (UNH) reporting this week, investor mood may hinge on whether the fundamentals hold — or whether Monday’s premarket optimism proves to be another false dawn. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Menu Meta Platforms Inc. faces a historic antitrust trial beginning Monday that could force the tech giant to break off Instagram and WhatsApp, startups it bought more than a decade ago that have since grown into social media powerhouses. The looming antitrust trial will be the first big test of President Donald Trump’s Federal Trade Commission’s ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta — then called Facebook — in 2020, during Trump's first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market. Meta, the FTC argues, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg's strategy, "expressed in 2008: ‘It is better to buy than compete.’ True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats." IN CASE YOU MISSED IT | Meta agrees to pay $25 million to settle lawsuit from Trump after Jan. 6 suspension Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and “neutralize perceived competitive threats,” the FTC says in its complaint, just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers. “Unable to maintain its monopoly by fairly competing, the company’s executives addressed the existential threat by buying up new innovators that were succeeding where Facebook failed,” the FTC says. Facebook bought Instagram — then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following — in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal's value fell to $750 million after Facebook's stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012. Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller “acqui-hires” — a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion. FROM THE ARCHIVES | Is WhatsApp safe? Here's what you need to know WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta's competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple's messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp. “The FTC already has the difficult task, whether it’s looking at 10 years ago or five years ago or today, of trying to define what is the market we’re talking about in a sufficiently narrow way that it can show Meta has a ton of power in that market,” said Paul Swanson, an antitrust attorney for the law firm Holland & Hart. “And I do think that challenge has gotten harder as the years have gone by and we see more and more potential competitors in social media spaces.” Meta, meanwhile, says the FTC’s lawsuit “defies reality.” “The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others. More than 10 years after the FTC reviewed and cleared our acquisitions, the Commission’s action in this case sends the message that no deal is ever truly final. Regulators should be supporting American innovation, rather than seeking to break up a great American company and further advantaging China on critical issues like AI," the company said in a statement. IN CASE YOU MISSED IT | FTC's rule banning fake online reviews goes into effect In a filing last week, Meta also stressed that the FTC “must prove that Meta has monopoly power in its claimed relevant market now, not at some time in the past." This, experts say, could also prove challenging since more competitors have emerged in the social media space in the years since the company bought WhatsApp and Instagram. Meta's fate will be decided by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who late last year denied Meta's request for a summary judgment and ruled that the case must go to trial. Boasberg “seems to be skeptical” of the FTC's narrow market definition in his rulings to date, Swanson said. He added that the judge also said it is a “fact question," which means he is open to hearing what the FTC and its experts have to say to define that narrow market. While the FTC may face an uphill battle in proving its case, the stakes are high for Meta, whose advertising business could be cut in half if it's forced to spin off Instagram.

Title: AppLovin Corporation (APP) Market Value Craters $20 Billion On March 27 After Muddy Waters Takes Aim, Class Action Pending – Hagens Berman

April 14, 2025 08:41 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, April 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On March 27, 2025, investors in AppLovin (NASDAQ: APP) saw the price of their shares drop $65.92, wiping out about $20 billion of the company’s market value, after prominent short seller Muddy Waters Research revealed its short position in the stock. Muddy Waters’ report comes on the heels of a recently filed securities class action lawsuit, captioned Quiero v. AppLovin Corporation, et al., No. 4:25-cv-02294 (N.D. Cal.). The suit seeks to represent investors who purchased AppLovin securities between May 10, 2023 and February 25, 2025. Hagens Berman is investigating the claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: May 10, 2023 – Feb. 25, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/app Contact the Firm Now: APP@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Recent Development: On March 27, 2025, Muddy Waters Research published a scathing report titled “AppLovin: Deep Data Analysis Shows APP is Just Another Scammy AdTech Company.” The report’s focus is in part on “retargeting” (a strategy that aims to re-engage potential customers who have previously interacted with a brand), “incrementality” (the additional or incremental lift in sales or conversions that a marketing activity generates), and AppLovin’s compliance with third party platforms’ TOS (terms of service). Muddy Waters contends that “APP e-commerce is Mostly Retargeting, Incrementality is Low, and it Clearly Violates Platforms’ TOS.” Muddy Waters alleges that: AppLovin Corporation (APP) Securities Class Action: The Muddy Waters report follows the filing of a securities class action complaint alleging AppLovin made false and misleading statements, while failing to disclose critical details about its flagship AXON 2.0 digital advertising platform. The company had heavily promoted the platform as "the best and fastest-growing product we’ve ever released." Investors were allegedly led to believe that the platform, which reportedly leverages “cutting-edge AI technologies,” would redefine the digital advertising landscape by enhancing ad placement efficiency and expanding into e-commerce and web-based marketing. However, the alleged narrative first shifted on February 26, 2025, when short sellers Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research published damaging reports that raised pointed questions about the company’s claims. Both research firms accused AppLovin of misleading investors regarding the platform's true capabilities and ethical practices. Fuzzy Panda Research alleged that the company violated app store policies by exploiting user data in questionable ways, predicting that tech giants Apple and Google would ban AppLovin from their app stores. Additionally, they accused AppLovin of “stealing data from Meta” as part of its e-commerce initiatives, foreseeing swift retaliation from Meta. Culper Research criticized the company for allegedly using AXON 2.0 as little more than a promotional facade to obscure the real drivers behind its business strategy. Culper's report further claimed that AppLovin's growth in mobile gaming has relied on “systematic exploitation of app permissions that enable advertisements themselves to force-feed silent, backdoor app installations onto users’ phones, with just a single click – an event that is often inadvertent thanks to the Company’s notorious UX gimmicks” and that “each illicit install translates directly to profit.” “We are investigating claims that AppLovin may have misled investors about whether its growth may be attributable to illegitimate conduct,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

By BRIAN WITTE and BARBARA ORTUTAY, AP Technology Writer WASHINGTON (AP) — Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stand on Monday in a historic antitrust trial that could force the tech giant to break off Instagram and WhatsApp, startups it bought more than a decade ago that have since grown into social media powerhouses. The Federal Trade Commission called Zuckerberg as its first witness, as it seeks to prove that Meta acquired Instagram and WhatsApp to preserve its monopoly in the social networking space. In opening statements, FTC attorney Daniel Matheson said Meta has used its position to generate enormous profits even as consumer satisfaction has dropped. He said Meta was “erecting a moat” to protect its interests by buying the two startups because the company feared they were a threat to Meta’s dominance. Zuckerberg and other key Meta witnesses will testify throughout the trial. “We’re going to give them their chance to tell their side of the story,” Matheson said. Mark Hansen, an attorney for Meta, said the FTC was making a “grab bag” of arguments that were wrong. He said Meta has plenty of competition and has made improvements to the startups it acquired. “This lawsuit, in summary, is misguided,” Hansen said, adding: “anyway you look at it, consumers have been the big winners.” The trial will be the first big test of President Donald Trump’s Federal Trade Commission’s ability to challenge Big Tech.

A federal judge declared the search giant an illegal monopoly last August.

Title: Stocks rise as Apple jumps and Goldman beats on earnings. But fears linger beneath the bounce

U.S. stocks edged up Monday as investors digested mixed messages on the trade war, following some of the most chaotic and turbulent weeks in recent market memory. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 312 points, or 0.8%, while the S&P 500 added 42 points, also climbing 0.8% by market close. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was up 107 points, or 0.6%. Gold, meanwhile, slipped 0.8%, suggesting a slight pullback from last week’s mad dash into safe-haven assets. Apple (AAPL) stock climbed, helping lead market indexes higher. A surprise tariff announcement late Friday triggered the tech-led bounce on Monday. The electronics exemption, issued by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, seemed to shield smartphones, laptops, and other consumer electronics from Trump administration tariffs on Chinese goods — offering relief for companies that rely heavily on Chinese manufacturing, such as Apple, Nvidia (NVDA), and Microsoft (MSFT) But the reprieve may be short-lived. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday that the products are still included under a round of semiconductor-related tariffs “coming in probably a month or two.” And President Donald Trump later rejected the idea that there had been any exemption at all, saying that the goods are still subject to existing 20% fentanyl-linked tariffs and that they had merely shifted tariff categories. He said no product was actually exempt, calling the change a simple reclassification. “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook,’” Trump said Sunday on his social media site Truth Social. Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts criticized the shifting policies as “chaos and corruption,” warning that such unpredictability is eroding investor confidence. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Fear & Greed Index is still planted in “extreme fear” territory, reflecting a lack of bullish sentiment amid chaotic policy announcements — to say nothing of chaotic policy determination. The S&P 500’s recent 5% intraday swings suggest volatility that is more structural than seasonal. Analysts at both Morgan Stanley (MS) and Citigroup (C) have cut their year-end forecasts for U.S. stocks, pointing to rising risks from such unpredictable policy moves and continuing geopolitical tensions. Heading into a packed week of corporate earnings in which major banks, healthcare companies, and consumer-facing platforms such as Netflix (NFLX) will report results, each release could either steady or rattle investor nerves. Apple stock jumped 2.2% Monday, lifted by hopes the company will be temporarily exempt from new electronics tariffs. President Trump said Monday afternoon that he was “flexible” when it came to a temporary exemption for Apple. Separately, Apple reclaimed the top spot in global smartphone shipments for the first quarter of 2025, thanks to strong demand for the iPhone 16e in markets such as Japan and India. Even alongside valid fears of disruptions to Apple’s supply chain, the company’s product suite and global brand power remain unmatched. Goldman Sachs (GS) reported a robust 15% increase in first-quarter profit, reaching $4.74 billion, or $14.12 per share, driven by strong trading performance amid market volatility. Goldman stock rose 1.9% Monday. But it’s not just about one earnings beat. Goldman is a bellwether for how corporate America is handling volatility, providing a real-time pulse check on capital flows and investor sentiment in a year that’s been anything but normal. On Monday, it’s a reminder that Wall Street firms may make money whether times are good or bad. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Meta Platforms Inc. faces a historic antitrust trial beginning Monday that could force the tech giant to break off Instagram and WhatsApp, startups it bought more than a decade ago that have since grown into social media powerhouses. The looming antitrust trial will be the first big test of President Donald Trump’s Federal Trade Commission’s ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta — then called Facebook — in 2020, during Trump’s first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market. Meta, the FTC argues, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s strategy, “expressed in 2008: ‘It is better to buy than compete.’ True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats.” Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and “neutralize perceived competitive threats,” the FTC says in its complaint, just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers. “Unable to maintain its monopoly by fairly competing, the company’s executives addressed the existential threat by buying up new innovators that were succeeding where Facebook failed,” the FTC says. Facebook bought Instagram — then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following — in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal’s value fell to $750 million after Facebook’s stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012. Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller “acqui-hires” — a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion. WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged.

He added that the judge also said it is a “fact question,” which means he is open to hearing what the FTC and its experts have to say to define that narrow market. While the FTC may face an uphill battle in proving its case, the stakes are high for Meta, whose advertising business could be cut in half if it’s forced to spin off Instagram. “Instagram is now Meta’s biggest money maker in the U.S., its most lucrative market, where the app accounts for 50.5% of the company’s ad revenues in 2025. Instagram has also been picking up the slack for Facebook on the user front, particularly among young people, for a long time,” said Emarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg. “The trial also comes as Meta is trying to bring back OG Facebook in an effort to appeal to Gen Z and younger users as they join social media. Social media usage is far more fragmented today than it was in 2012 when Facebook acquired Instagram, and Facebook isn’t where the cool college kids hang out anymore. Meta needs Instagram to continue growing, especially as more advertisers think Instagram-first with their Meta budgets.” But Meta isn’t the only technology company in the sights of federal antitrust regulators, Google and Amazon face their own cases. The remedy phase of Google’s case is scheduled to begin on April 21. A federal judge declared the search giant an illegal monopoly last August.

BySeth Matlins, Forbes Staff. According to the International Monetary Fund’s World Uncertainty Index, 6 weeks ago, measures of global uncertainty reached their third highest level since monthly tracking began in 2008, behind only that year’s global economic turmoil and the pandemic. And as any behavioral scientist—or anyone with common sense for that matter—knows, uncertainty clouds and complicates decision making processes and thus the path to purchase and is something other than the optimal macro-context for marketing or marketers. But so it is, and so it makes the need for chief marketers to challenge norms, thinking and doing entrepreneurially and differently, ever more important. What then makes for an entrepreneurial CMO? At Forbes, and as we have for the four years since we created this recognition, we consider the entrepreneurial CMO one who approaches driving growth neither beholden to the status quo nor to disrupting it for the sake of same. We believe the entrepreneurial CMO understands both what has enduring value and what needs to change, whether within their organizations and/or in how they go to market. They are strategic risk-takers, learning and optimizing based on both what works and, inevitably, what doesn’t, believing that failures aren’t failures if you learn from and get better because of them. They see opportunity in constraints and are relentlessly focused on making and doing more with less, no matter how much they might have. Their entrepreneurial approach to marketing challenges assumptions and what’s come and been done before. It’s a mindset that informs their strategies, and evidence of it is often seen through tactical application and activation, the in-market expression of mindset and approach. So too do we recognize the difference between being a great CMO and a great and entrepreneurial one. Not everyone is both and not everyone who is, is both at the same time. A great CMO focuses on what matters most, on what creates and captures demand, and on how to best allocate limited resources to unlimited opportunities. They eschew the rest as distraction and think about the business and their role in driving it strategically and then execute creatively. However, we consider this to be as fundamental as it is essential, and not in and of itself evidence of an entrepreneurial approach. We also recognize that the “entrepreneurial” must be considered within the specific context of different industries, categories, companies, and markets. Because that which may be business as usual for company X might be an entirely new way of thinking and doing for company Y, and our judging and selection of the fifty CMOs recognized on this year’s list makes efforts to account for this. It’s our conviction that a status-quo approach to marketing is an increasingly challenged one. It’s our belief that an entrepreneurial take on driving growth and on the art, science, and practice of marketing is and will be increasingly important to great—even good—CMOs, as there is no current reason to think these times of radical uncertainty will become anything but more so in the near-future. As reminder, this particular Forbes list is a one-and-done list, which is to say that once someone has appeared on it, they are no longer eligible for it. This year’s cohort represents the most geographically diverse one yet, and as you read through it (presented alphabetically), you’ll find evidence of an entrepreneurial marketing approach from leaders stewarding brands and companies across categories and the globe. Each is a chief marketer—regardless of their titles—who has been selected from among hundreds of nominees, based on open-nominations, and judged by qualitative consideration from amongst their peers, marketing industry and agency leaders, executive recruiters, CMO list alumni, and Forbes, by whom all final decisions were made. Regardless of what and where they market, it’s how they market and compete that finds them recognized on this 4th annual Forbes Entrepreneurial CMO 50 list. As in year’s past, we think you’ll find something to learn from each and all of those recognized and invite you to get to know them below. 2025 Forbes Entrepreneurial CMO 50 tk Because despite a fundamental, global reset for commercial real estate driven by economic uncertainty, office-norm disruptions, and the continued evolution towards a post-pandemic new normal, Baer’s marketing embraces the disruption that comes from “breaking models.” Knowing that the times and category require reinvention, Baer and her team have reimagined CBRE’s brand and client experience, marketing’s mission, structure, capabilities, and audiences, and, as she told Forbes, “built a level of accountability the business had not previously experienced.” During her tenure as CMO of the world’s largest commercial real estate services firm, Baer and her team have challenged outdated paradigms and models. At a time when businesses and policymakers are reevaluating how cities function, Baer and her team created the firm’s Shaping Tomorrow’s Cities initiative, positioning CBRE as more than a services provider by urging industry leaders to rethink economic, demographic, and infrastructure challenges. “[Marketing] stepped up to be the ultimate convener, giving a voice—and a platform—to these consequential themes,” Baer tells Forbes. Since its launch, this program alone has doubled the firm’s client engagement. In Q4 2024, CBRE’s reported revenues increased 16% year-over-year (YoY). Linda Bethea Because Bethea’s focus on “championing unorthodox ways of doing things” ensures the company’s marketing remains agile and continually “tweaked” based on performance. With the company since 2020, Bethea has found new ways to solve problems and meet unmet consumer needs with what she describes as a “test and learn” approach. To these ends, Bethea and her team work to create a culture of learning and risk-taking, embracing what inevitable failures can teach, “curating a wall of ‘fame & shame’ highlighting both our successes and failures to help our team become more comfortable with risk-taking.” Examples of Bethea’s unorthodox and entrepreneurial approach include launching STōK, a “bold” cold-brew brand—not just in partnership with Wrexham AFC but by “sponsoring a stadium in a country where the product isn’t sold?” As she asked Forbes, “what is bolder than that?” Facing budget declines of 70% for International Delight, a $1B+ portfolio brand, Bethea and her team took an insight—75% of 18-24-year-olds watch at least one hour of reality TV weekly—and created a TikTok reality show, Créme House, to drive engagement and growth. In the last quarter reported, Danone saw an increase in like-for-like sales of 5.8% across its North American market. Benjamin Braun Because Braun markets with the conviction that scale isn’t incompatible with agility and that “even if you work for a massive global conglomerate like Samsung you operate as a start-up team.” With a remit including oversight of the company’s marketing across 44 countries, Braun tells Forbes that you can’t “allow yourself to become complacent and slow. You think big and figure out how to deliver without a budget or people. Change,” he says, “is driven by people with ideas. Not budgets.” For Braun, marketing isn’t just about storytelling—it’s about proving real business results because, and as he says, “only then will we gain credibility.” Illustrations of this and his entrepreneurial approach are seen in the brand’s activation at the Paris Olympics. Rather than spending millions on advertising, Braun and his team went guerrilla—gifting 17,000 Samsung foldable phones to Olympians and Paralympians, requesting only that they unpack them on social media. This led to “Victory Selfies” on Olympic podiums, massive global exposure at a fraction of the cost, and a 23% sales increase. International online research data and analytics firm YouGov recently named Samsung the #1 Best Global Brand for 2025. Heidi Browning Because as sports’ traditional broadcast model evolves to a multi-platform and direct-to-consumer one, Browning markets knowing engaging the next generation of fans requires a transformation in skills and approach. Equating the entrepreneurial mindset driving the league’s marketing to the “cowboy ethos” she learned growing up in Montana, Browning tells Forbes, this cowboy spirit creates the “fearless pursuit of new frontiers, question(ing) everything; both why and why not; and being comfortable with the unknown.” To ensure the NHL’s continued growth, Browning and her team apply the lessons of start-up culture to invite new fans and revenues into the sport and league. Examples include creating the Power Players Youth Advisory Board, embedding Gen Z perspectives directly into marketing decisions to ensure future generation relevance, launching an original content docuseries, “Face-Off: Inside the NHL,” with Amazon Studios among others, and which succeeded in driving both upper and lower funnel growth metrics. The NHL saw record-breaking business performance in 2023-24, with revenue reaching $6.2 billion, a 5.7% year-over-year increase, and total attendance hitting an all-time high of 22.9 million. Jason Bunge Because when Bunge joined the 102-year-old toy category icon as its first CMO in 2023, “there was,” as he told Forbes, “the opportunity and need to build an entirely new marketing organization; construct a new set of marketing capabilities to snap to the company’s evolving business portfolio, and perhaps most importantly, redefine the role of marketing for the different needs of each business.” The former Riot Games CMO and his team approach driving growth recognizing the challenges and opportunities for the company’s principal business lines (toys, physical games and digital/video games) “are bespoke, and the marketing organization must be able to demonstrate agility, efficiency and scale in how it addresses each.” To these ends, Bunge carved out 5% of their budget “for a first-of-its-kind company test-and-learn agenda,” in order “to inject a new mindset of ‘roles of brands’, (because) not everything was going to grow and not everything needed the same type or amount of marketing.” This approach drove insights allowing Bunge and his team to understand where resources would have the greatest impact and return. As Bunge shared, “having an entrepreneurial mindset sometimes means breaking old habits and fighting hard to create space and oxygen for new approaches.” Emma Chalwin Because as she leads all marketing globally for this enterprise software company, Chalwin is intent on driving growth by “breaking the B2B mold.” As Chalwin and her team disrupt Workday’s traditional marketing and ensure it is anything but category-typical, she never loses sight of the fact that, as she told Forbes, “we’re not just selling to a business; we’re selling to the people who work there.” This human-centric approach to enterprise marketing is driven by a mindset rooted in what she describes as rule-breaking, risk-taking and acting like “an entrepreneur inside a Fortune 500 company.” Believing that challenging the status quo of B2B marketing requires a sense of humor and resolve, she and her team launched the Rock Star 2.0 campaign, bringing an “unexpected irreverence” that challenged conceptions about who the rock stars of business are. Chalwin tells Forbes the campaign increased web traffic by over 50% and lead-to-sales conversions by 17%. She’s also working to train 20,000 employees as brand ambassadors to ensure everyone can share a consistent and compelling brand story. Workday’s FY25 revenues increased 16.4% YoY. Kim Chappell Because in order to compete against industry Goliaths, Chappell is helping build this infant formula company into more than just a business and is reshaping conversations and expectations about modern parenting. For Chappell, being an entrepreneurial marketer isn’t just a mindset—it’s a muscle. As she told Forbes, “you have to train yourself to move in the moment without hesitation—with limited resources and often without a blueprint for success. If you don’t go do the work, it’s just another idea, what-if, or magic moment lost.” One example of Chappell’s approach to advancing the conversations driving Bobbie’s growth, is when a Times Square billboard featuring culinary influencer Molly Baz, pregnant, in underwear, and holding lactation cookies over her breasts was removed for violating the billboard owner’s guidelines, Chappell and her team saw opportunity and moved to both seize and make the moment. In only two weeks, Bobbie had Baz back on a Times Square billboard, this time breastfeeding her newborn—a cultural first—and apt illustration of Chappell’s entrepreneurial conviction that “not everything needs a quarter of planning to be on brand, bold and successful.” Chappell tells Forbes that over the past year, Bobbie has become the fastest-growing brand in its category. Daniel Cherry III Because for Cherry, entrepreneurial marketing is about “always being in beta, and instead of fearing failure embracing it as critical feedback pushing ideas one step closer to thrilling the consumer.” As Cherry helped lead the brand through the very public early-end of its controversial partnership with Kanye West his perspective on failure as feedback would make the difference. “We suffered a crisis of confidence and almost believed the hype,” he told Forbes. But rather than replacing the void left by the end of that partnership with another, Cherry thought and did differently, turning to adidas’ greatest asset—its archive—and creating “Originals LA.” Intended as a new business unit not just a marketing approach, Cherry’s idea for moving the business forward looked backwards. By tapping the brand’s archives, Cherry and his team helped put adidas back at the center of sneaker culture, as evidenced by the near ubiquity of Sambas and Gazelles over the past year. Cherry also built forward, championing new collaborations blending nostalgia with modernity, launching initiatives like the adidas Foundation, and restructuring creative workflows to give designers greater autonomy. For the quarter ending December 2024, company revenues had increased nearly 24% YoY. Kristyn Cook Because in the crowded and complex insurance market, Cook leads marketing for this category leader with a conviction that it’s only by “taking the right calculated risks where you have opportunity to win big.” Importantly though, the work Cook leads proves entrepreneurial marketing doesn’t always mean chasing reinvention for reinvention’s sake, Cook and her team are amplifying State Farm’s most powerful assets—its signature red, iconic jingle, and, of course, Jake from State Farm—by positioning them in high-profile, real-world moments that matter. “Our goal is to stay nimble so we can jump in on trending cultural moments,” Cook told Forbes. As examples, the brand has been a first-mover in the category in Gaming, and when Donna Kelce became a cultural focal point, State Farm took advantage of the moment by placing Jake next to her at a game, amplifying brand I.P. and creating a clutter-breaking moment for the brand. A 25-year company veteran, Cook oversees both marketing and sales. And in support of the 18,000 agents in its network, she and her team “always strive to be ‘market movers’ in any space in which we play.” Phil Cook Because during an explosion in interest from fans and partners alike, Cook, the league’s first CMO, is ensuring the WNBA isn’t just riding a wave of growth but actively driving it. Cook and his team are creating a new marketing playbook for the WNBA and its rising stars, during a time of unprecedented attention on women’s basketball. While most leagues pay little attention to their players’ pasts once drafted,Cook and his team took a different strategic approach with their “Welcome to the W” campaign, as college stars including Caitlin Clark, Angel Reese and Cameron Brink segued from the NCAA to the WNBA. In leading efforts to bridge the players’ college and pro journeys, the campaign leaned heavily into the players’ college pasts, creating a narrative continuity helping grow the league’s fan-base on the players’ existing ones. This, as well as a differentiated commitment to social impact, a heightened focus on dimensionalizing player narratives, and creating a 24/7 content hub for the league amongst other efforts, are driving unprecedented numbers for the WNBA. Last year witnessed the largest rights deal in the league’s history, an aggregated $2.2B across ESPN, Amazon and NBCUniversal; sponsorship revenue and demand exploded, as attendance increased 48% and sellout games 242% YoY. Stefano Curti Because with a determination to “make a large company small again,” Curti is ensuring leaner teams and faster decision-making help transform Coty into a nimbler player across the global beauty category. As the leader of a transformation that’s revitalized brand icons like CoverGirl and Rimmel, Curti’s entrepreneurial approach is rooted in speed and connection. In order to mirror the approach of smaller and niche-beauty players, and nurture the brands’ internal “cool factor,” he and his team created an internal incubator, Agile Beauty, which operates like a startup within Coty. Since its inception, the incubator has developed trend-driven products in just eight months, an industry-best for a global beauty powerhouse. To these same ends, Curti and his team have built new advocacy and community programs, engaging influencers and beauty creators not only to amplify storytelling but to co-develop products. With a remit spanning Europe, North America, and high-growth markets like India, Latin America, and the Middle East, Curti and his team are expanding Coty’s global footprint while leveraging its dominance in prestige fragrance—a category he calls “the skincare of the mind”—to drive future innovation and consumer engagement. Coty reported 10% net revenue growth in 2024, outpacing the 9% global beauty market increase. Carmen DeRosas Because by challenging status quo and conventional industry norms, DeRosas is redefining what marketing is in the UAE’s financial services category, and helping lead the transformation of one of the oldest banking institutions in the country. Since arriving at Rakbank, DeRosas tells Forbes she has “implemented a culture of continuous experimentation…that continues to challenge and improve our models,” evidence of which can be seen in a near 60% reduction in agency costs and 50% increase in asset turnaround times during her tenure. Ensuring that marketing is a driver of the company’s innovation and transformation, has DeRosas and her team embracing a challenger brand ethos and shifting mindsets “from fear to exploration,” which she credits with helping drive “the step change we have created across all marketing disciplines, from transforming the way we show up, reshaping agency partnerships, launching campaigns that have elevated brand perception and performance, to delivering a 4x uplift in digital acquisition.” With industry expertise honed during time at PayPal and American Express, DeRosas’s remit includes overseeing the Rakbank brand, its insurance technology platform Protego, and family finance app Skiply. Since getting to Rakbank, DeRosas and her team have driven a major shift in marketing’s role at the bank—and their enhanced brand focus has contributed to a 13-point increase in employee engagement, reinforcing her belief that a strong, people-first culture is key to sustained innovation and growth. Rakbank had record-breaking financial performance last year, and a 16.4% increase in net profits YoY. Carole Diarra Because the “vision to see beyond traditional strategies and the agility to act on them in ways that drive real impact” is helping Diarra fuel the iconic brand’s transformation from its comfort-first origins to a broader fashion and lifestyle business. With a global remit, Diara and her team are redefining what UGG is, where it shows up, and how it connects with its audience. Under her marketing leadership, they’re doing this by focusing on a combination of “agile media thinking” that is inverting status-quo channel approaches, a media-mix strategy shift to social-first, real-time creative decision making, and liberating their marketing from the category’s traditional seasonal emphasis. An illustration of the latter and Diarra’s enhanced emphasis on consumer-led innovation is the brand’s “UGG Season” platform which, as Diarra shared with Forbes, “didn’t start from us but from our community (including Cardi B)...we didn’t create the movement; we recognized and amplified it, letting culture lead our strategy.” This entrepreneurial approach, one untethered to the past, is also evident in UGG’s unexpected collaborations with Paris Fashion Week, and fashion-forward brands including Sacai and Telfar. A core part of the Deckers’ portfolio, for Q3FY25, the UGG brand reported +16.1% increase in net sales YoY. Cristina Diezhandino Because Diezhandino’s marketing for Diageo’s 200 brands is rooted in a “mindset of possibility” and an approach that she told Forbes, values ”progress over perfection. It’s okay to fail as long as we learn.” Despite category headwinds created by a changing world and consumer attitudes and behaviors, Diezhandino realizes that what doesn’t change is the need to stay “centered around celebrations, culture and memorable moments” and that this in turn requires her marketing organization to “understand—and shape the future of—socializing better than anyone else.” To these ends, Diezhandino and her team have built a marketing organization thriving on “connected decisioning,” curiosity, agility, experimentation, reorganizing marketing into “agile brand communities” which allows them to better turn insight into action. To accelerate the growth of $100+ (USD) brands, Diezhandino created the Diageo Luxury Group, uniting its luxury portfolio. To ensure her organization has the tools to act fast in evolving markets, Diezhandino spearheaded initiatives including a Virtual Studio “revolutionizing how we create content”, a global partnerships lab, and Diageo’s largest consumer data initiative. With responsibility for marketing, innovation and digital transformation for the global portfolio, Diezhandino is thinking and doing differently to ensure Diageo’s place in socializing’s future. Brian Donnelly Because Donnelly understands that “speed is a competitive advantage” and, as he tells Forbes, while “there’s a comfort in the ‘tried and true,’ challenging norms, experimenting fearlessly, and pivoting quickly, allows us to adapt and refine strategies in real-time.” With P&L accountability for the 40-year-old genealogy brand’s global business operations, Donnelly’s remit includes oversight of marketing, growth, and business development across the 130 countries where they do business. Intent on “inspiring a culture of innovation across the business” Donnelly and his team identified a growth opportunity, creating a new market by leveraging their genetic testing expertise and applying it to the pet category for the first time. Focused on driving growth by marketing and raising awareness “of the emotional, cultural and personal benefits that come from discovering your roots,” Donnelly and his team are pushing boundaries and experimenting with the new as they reshape Ancestry’s brand, commerce, and customer engagement. Donnelly reports that brand health metrics are rising and that, in 2024, the company saw double-digit growth in DNA kit sales. As of May 1, Donnelly will become the Chief Commercial Officer at Myriad Genetics. Bené Eaton Because in leading marketing globally for this DTC healthcare brand, Eaton’s entrepreneurial approach balances boldness and precision, and as she told Forbes, “isn’t just about disrupting—but about building something meaningful and enduring.” With a remit spanning 34 countries, Eaton and her team lean into the company’s entrepreneurial DNA to fuel their own. For Eaton, entrepreneurial marketing “isn’t just about growth (but) about redefining how a brand can impact people, culture and the world.” To these ends, and as one example, Eaton and her team led Figs to become Team USA’s official Medical Team Outfitter, creating a global stage and moment celebrating the community in a never-been-done-before way. She says the effort drove “significant incremental revenue...but more than the numbers, this campaign redefined how healthcare professionals are perceived.” The LA fires, which devastated the company’s hometown, provide further illustration as Eaton and her team mobilized to quickly support over 1,500 displaced healthcare professionals. “This wasn’t just a crisis response—but testament to our entrepreneurial mindset: acting with urgency, empathy, and impact to show up for our community in moments that matter most.” Colin Fleming Because with a “stubborn intolerance of mediocrity,” Fleming focuses, as he tells Forbes on “what could be, and refusing to be discouraged by the status quo.” Insistent that “none of the Bs in ‘B2B’ should stand for boring,” Fleming and his team are proving that bold storytelling, culture-shaping campaigns, and a strong point of view will drive growth regardless of sector. With a remit leading ServiceNow’s end-to-end global marketing, planning and operations, Fleming has evolved company strategy from product-led to brand-led. As he and his team seek “exponential thinking and big, bold ideas that break the mold,” they’ve rolled out the company’s most comprehensive global campaign ever, high-profile and perception shifting partnerships, and “Project Marie Kondo,” which led to cutting 50% of their content creation to ensure focus on what “sparks joy” for customers. “This simplification” he told us, “frees our teams to concentrate on impact and alignment rather than volume.” For the 12 months ending as of the date of this writing, Service Now’s market capitalization was up 22%. (Disclosure: One of the editors working on this list owns stock in ServiceNow.) Adrian Fung Because Fung brings a “founder’s mentality” to the iconic ecommerce brand, focusing, as he told Forbes, on “treating every dollar like it’s your own, and finding scrappy ways to leverage existing assets, customers, partners.” For Fung, a global remit for marketing a brand and multi-category business like eBay’s, with some 130 million customers and over 2.1 billion listings, requires an approach he defines as “learning fast rather than failing fast.” And in order to leverage learnings to drive innovation at scale, Fung recognizes the need “to balance speed and agility with the complexity and scale of eBay’s (business). To do this, we identify small but high leverage opportunities that can be quickly tested and iterated upon to optimize impact.” One example: An initially small-scale test with Facebook Marketplace in Germany which enabled buyers to browse eBay listings directly on Marketplace, rolled out internationally. Recognizing “this type of innovation can’t be achieved from marketing alone - and requires an end-to-end approach” finds Fung breaking down silos and challenging how problems are solved across the business. As of this writing, eBay’s stock was up over 58% YoY. Arielle Gross Samuels Because with a global mandate across all marketing and communications, the former Blackstone CMO and 10-year Meta veteran, is looking to help redefine the company’s place in its category and is “building from zero to one.” In a category-atypical approach, Gross Samuels is using what she tells Forbes is “surround-sound, cross-channel storytelling as a strategic commercial lever.” To help lead the brand beyond its venture capital origins to that of a global investment and transformation company, Samuels and her team launched “Venture Beyond”, not just a campaign but an invitation to their ecosystem of founders, entrepreneurs, and business leaders. She credits the launch with “invigorating our ecosystem and expanding what’s possible. “ For the year ahead, among other things, Gross Samuels and her team are focused on “unveiling new strategic brand partnerships with major platforms, revitalizing our social strategy with franchised branded series, and convening first-of-their-kind forums to catalyze our community—all in service to ecosystem transformation.” By ensuring “we play our own game and operate as a category of one,” Gross Samuels and her team are continuing to help redefine what people know of and expect from General Catalyst. Gail Horwood Because Horwood doesn’t see constraint in the pharmaceutical category’s deeply regulated environment but a catalyst for integrating “now and next practices” redefining how the company markets to drive impact. To better connect with their multiple constituencies, Horwood and her team have championed and facilitated the “creative and innovative;” building Novartis’ Innovation and Content Labs, and establishing its Media Center of Excellence, leading them to explore non-traditional category channels and audiences. They’ve turned to gaming as a way to educate healthcare professionals and “set new standards for audience engagement in the pharma industry.” And while in many categories a Super Bowl ad is no proof of the entrepreneurial, in January, Horwood and her team broke company and category conventions with a campaign to raise awareness and drive screenings for breast cancer. The ad’s creative was bold by any measure, especially within the context of pharma, and is a case study proving that any category’s work can be emotionally resonant. As Horwood told Forbes, “we didn’t want to just show up; we wanted people to receive the message and take action.” A subsequent announcement of a broader partnership with the NFL “merges the power of sports, culture, and health advocacy in a way that has never been done before.” As of their Q4 reporting, Novartis’s stock was up over 15% YoY. Charisse Hughes Because Hughes is proving that legacy CPG brands can lead cultural conversations—and drive growth while doing it. Since joining Kellanova (formerly Kellogg Company), Hughes has transformed the company’s marketing approach, leaning into bold, unconventional collaborations and innovations that extend beyond the company’s broad portfolio of household names, including Kellogg’s Pringles, and Cheez-Its, themselves. As Hughes told Forbes, “in an era where traditional marketing strategies aren't enough, we have embraced unconventional, culturally resonant collaborations that push boundaries...(and) elevate our brands beyond transactional products to cultural icons.” To these ends, one example of the work Hughes and her team have done is the collaboration between Crocs and Pringles, which went beyond a mere licensing deal in order to create mutually inspired products for both brands. This included the insta-worthy Pringles-inspired slides and the Crush Boot which sold out in under two hours, driving earned media in publications like GQ, not typically known for paying attention to pantry brands. In August, Mars, Inc. offered to acquire Kellanova for $36 billion. If it closes, this will be the largest CPG deal in over a decade. As of this writing, the company’s stock is up over 51% YoY. Kerttu Inkeroinen Because Inkeroinen leads marketing for this six-year-old UK-based alcohol-free beer brand with a “Break Rules, Honor Traditions” mantra, which she says, “allows us to challenge category norms while respecting beer culture.” Despite having only a fraction of the marketing budget of her multinational competitors, Inkeroinen “approaches every decision with big budget energy,” telling Forbes she “sees opportunities where others see limitations and with the resilience—what we call sisu in Finnish—to push through.” And while some may consider process and entrepreneurial agility to be opposed, Inkeroinen doesn’t considering “a well-structured framework what enables fast, efficient scaling.” To these ends, she and her team introduced a cross-functional “gate process” to ensure rapid execution without quality compromises, and built a proprietary digital platform to, among other things, drive pint giveaways in pubs, an in-house innovation that she credits with “removing cost barriers and unlocking new distribution opportunities.” Inkeroinen leads marketing, communications, innovation, and e-commerce for the brand. Her entrepreneurial approach has helped Lucky Saint become what she says is the most loved and most Googled alcohol-free beer in the U.K. Marissa Jarrett Because for Jarratt “acting like an entrepreneur is a cornerstone of how I lead and inspire my team,” an approach driving how she has built the marketing organization for this global retail giant. Focused on ensuring 7-Eleven doesn’t just keep pace with cultural and consumer shifts but actively drives them while navigating market volatility and new resource constraints, Jarratt emphasizes agility, creativity, and resilience. With broad responsibilities in the U.S. and Canada across marketing, corporate communications, and sustainability, Jarratt and her teams navigated “over 220 reputation-critical issues, implementing a three-tier crisis management strategy,” introduced “Big Bite Hot Dog-Flavored Sparkling Water” on April Fool’s Day to recruit Gen Z customers and publicize the launch of their private label sparkling water brand. The creatively dissonant effort drove a nearly 10% month-over-month increase in store brand sales and a 12% increase across the category; expanded 7-Eleven’s in-house creative agency, producing campaigns faster and cheaper, all while also reducing plastic bag usage by 37%. Jarratt is intent on “steering the brand out of a challenging 2024” and will continue enhancing the retailer’s “ability to adapt and innovate, even in a resource-constrained environment. Nicolas Kettelhake Because in a digital world saturated with “perfect” images, Kettelhake is reinvigorating an 80-year-old analog brand, making what’s old new again by proving that imperfection sells. Kettelhake and his team market by counterprogramming and leaning away from—rather than into—digital cultural trends. Because Polaroid images can’t be retouched, Kettelhake and his team have delivered what he described to Forbes as “a counter to digitized, altered, ‘perfect’ photography, because Polaroid is one of one, and inherently imperfect due to the chemical development process.” Kettelhake ensures the brand’s claim to a positioning rooted in the tactile and imperfect not only drives communication but product innovation. To make a statement against the endlessly replicable nature of digital images, he and his team have elevated the craft of instant photography by appealing to high-end professional photographers, invited digitally-native consumers into the brand by becoming part of sub-cultures, and created a new membership program. By zigging while culture zags, Kettelhake’s integrated, multi-channel and cohort approach has sold-out both new products and film, and driven YoY double digit sell-through increase across the full business. Kettelhake left Polaroid as of April 1st. Drieke Leenknegt Because Leenknegt understands that in the ever-changing consumer landscape, today’s “marketing isn’t about incremental change—it’s about transformation.” Despite its globally iconic brand status, Leenknegt inherited a business facing years of declining revenue and a turnaround imperative. Her entrepreneurial approach to marketing has helped reverse Vans’ decline and position it for long-term growth. Since joining two years ago, Leenknegt has restructured the company’s global marketing team, going beyond necessary surface-level adjustments to deep, strategic reinvention that is connecting dots across marketing, product, and commerce. All of this is driving what she tells Forbes is “agility, alignment, and profitability, ensuring innovation is more than just an idea.” Leenknegt and her team are embracing and deploying an “always on marketing model...that balances reinvention with authenticity.” Illustration is found in their creation and launch of a new pinnacle segment, OTW by Vans, at Paris Fashion Week. Describing this as both a product and cultural innovation, Leenknegt credits the innovation with fueling extraordinary sell-through and, as being but one effort that is helping restore brand momentum. Diego Lomanto Because without the tens of billions of dollars raised by competitors like OpenAI and Anthropic, Lomanto leads marketing for this startup generative AI enterprise solution, certain that “winning in AI isn’t just about who builds the best model, but about who owns the conversation.” Given their relative resource constraints, Lomanto and his team approach owning the conversation by ensuring Writer is, as he told Forbes, “impossible to ignore to the folks we wanted to have a conversation with...that wherever AI decision-makers looked, they saw Writer, setting us apart in a highly competitive, scrutinizing and often hesitant market.” The brand’s outsized presence on stage, in headlines, and on billboards along Silicon Valley’s busiest highways was just one part of its scrappy reach and frequency strategy. Certain that “the entrepreneurial marketer knows the best marketing comes from customers who can’t stop talking about their ROI,” Lomanto created a program targeting analysts, a.k.a. the influencers of the AI category, marketing the brand as an ROI catalyst and movement, turning “our biggest successes—for companies like Salesforce and Uber—into our biggest marketing assets.” At the end of 2024, the company raised an additional $200 million, increasing its valuation to $1.9 billion. Victoria Lozano Because despite Crayola’s dominant market share, Lozano pushes the business to think and market like a challenger, redefining not just what Crayola sells, but repositioning the brand and business by repositioning creativity itself. Lozano and her team have redefined how the company creates commercial value. As Lozano told Forbes, “Crayola is a bigger brand than business,” and in order to capitalize on the former and overcome the latter, she and her team are shifting long-held but limiting parental perceptions about Crayola as just an arts-and-crafts brand by marketing “beyond the crayon,” embedding the brand deeper into family routines and educational systems. To these ends, Lozano launched Campaign for Creativity, an advocacy movement reframing creativity—and Crayola’s role in it—as a critical life skill; and built Crayola Studios, a content development and production division that creates programming across genres for kids and their parents. The studio already has some dozen partnerships, including those with parent company Hallmark, a BBC Kids partnership, and a brand partnership with audiobook platform Audible. Lozano’s entrepreneurial approach is reframing the brand, its scope, and creating new sources of revenue. Martina Luger Because as Luger leads marketing for this, U.K. based hospitality enterprise, she’s rejecting the category’s traditional price-based segmentation, and instead deploying a narrative-driven model to position and differentiate the company’s brands. With a portfolio including The Mondrian, Hoxton and SLS brands, Luger and her team focus on disruptive lifestyle strategies rooted in her conviction that safe ground never leads to innovation. As she told Forbes, the entrepreneurial marketer has to have “the courage to stand on the edge of a cliff because only at the edge do you get the most amazing views.” Luger and her team are “making the statement that our hotels are more than just transactional decisions,” an approach further illustrated by Ennismore’s “game-changing” loyalty program, “Dis-loyalty.” Luger shared that while “traditional loyalty models reward people for sticking to the familiar—we wanted to flip that idea on its head,” and with no points, tiers, or blackout dates, members get 20% off first-time stays, and 10% off return visits, part of what’s driving growth across her global remit for marketing 17 brands, and over 170 hotels in more than 35 countries with another 120+ in the pipeline. Astha Malik Because certain “there has never been a better time to be a better marketer,” Malik is unconstrained by the tried and true and untethered to industry standards and expectations. With a broad remit across this SaaS platform’s corporate strategy, global expansion, and growth initiatives redefining how brands connect with their audiences—and how Braze connects with its, Malik encourages innovation, as she told Forbes, by ensuring her teams are “comfortable with failure—because it’s not final.” Malik and her team created the company’s Innovation Lab, 427°, a consulting initiative providing clients agency like services during and post-sales in order to help them rethink customer connections at scale to provide clients, because Malik believes “the best marketing doesn’t just drive pipeline, it builds enduring and valuable relationships. The Lab, but one illustration of her entrepreneurial approach in action, has “accelerated sales cycles, improved satisfaction, and set us apart.” Malik remains intent on challenging assumptions about the CMO role, ensuring marketing always has a seat at the Board table, and “challenging everyday actions and standing out when others may prefer to just fit in.” For Q4 25, the company reported YoY revenue growth of 22%. Devika Mathrani Because in an increasingly competitive healthcare landscape, Mathrani is “shaping the future of health care and changing the conversation in the category” for one of the nation’s top 10 healthcare systems, by bringing unconventional strategies to a category not known for same. Mathrani and her team are challenged not just by their competitive set but also a glut of healthcare disinformation. When “alongside the rise of (public health) misinformation, we recognized the need to inform and empower consumers”, as Mathrani told Forbes, they launched a newsroom operation to “publish trusted information—helping people navigate their health proactively and reactively.” When New York City faced a critical blood-supply shortage, Mathrani and her team drove essential donations by turning donations into a limited-edition product drop, applying a scarcity marketing model common in footwear but not in healthcare. Partnering with renowned pastry chef Dominique Ansel, creator of the Cronut, donating blood became the only way to get Ansel’s “3 Lives Bar.” Thinking and acting outside category norms led to a 25,000 percent (not a typo) increase in traffic to the donation site, and a 40% increase in donations. Stephanie McCarty Because McCarty is challenging home-building category norms, transforming a traditionally rigid and slow-moving process in order to fundamentally reshape how buyers navigate one of the most significant purchases of their lives. With oversight of marketing for one of the nation’s largest homebuilders, McCarty told Forbes she is intent “not just on adapting to change but driving it, ensuring our marketing plays a critical role in our growth and shaping the future of the industry.” McCarty and her team have led the company to create a fully-digital shopping experience, an “unheard of” first for the homebuilding category. As she told Forbes, this consumer-centric innovation drove meaningfully higher conversion rates, exponentially reduced cancellations, and increased revenue. McCarty, whose remit includes overseeing marketing and consumer engagement across 21 markets, has also redefined how homebuilders connect with consumers, turning social media from a branding tool into a direct revenue driver, another category first. Despite an environment marked by significantly higher interest rates, as of this writing, the company’s stock was up over 7% YoY. Sarah Moore Because as Moore leads marketing for the culturally iconic restaurant chain, she does so with the conviction that entrepreneurial marketing “is not just the high-stakes journey of a disruptive startup—but about leading transformation when the odds are against you—when competition is fierce, behaviors are shifting, and a brand must evolve or fade.” With oversight of all marketing for the chain’s 660+ locations, including brand, culinary menu architecture, and pricing strategy, Moore and her team are driven by “bucking category norms...and the relentless pursuit of discomfort.” As rising egg prices became their own source of discomfort for customers nationally, Moore told Forbes that she and her team flipped the competitive script and, “instead of raising prices (like competitors), we launched a rewards promotion where members earned extra for egg-based dishes.” She credits the simple and counter-intuitive move with driving higher guest frequency and spend and adding 6 million new loyalty program members in just year one. Modernizing a brand that is literally rooted in the “old” is no small challenge. But Moore’s take on being an entrepreneurial CMO “isn’t just about building something new. It’s also about reinventing, reimaging, and revitalizing something that already exists.” Michael Moses Because in a landscape where “all the content in the world is the push of a button away,” Moses markets acutely aware that “launching every film is akin to launching a new business...every few weeks.” Over the past year ,Moses, who has been with Universal for 25 years, seven as global CMO, oversaw marketing for a portfolio including Wicked and The Fall Guy, and as he told Forbes, always with a “healthily skeptical eye on data because its proliferation is an alluring siren call that risks narrowcasting the audience and making all our approaches homogenized.” For “Twisters”, overcoming this siren call meant tapping into an overlooked Heartland audience through country music partnerships and broadening the film’s appeal without alienating traditional moviegoers. For “The Wild Robot”, Moses and his team took a slow-burn strategy—festival screenings, a dialogue-free trailer—helping make it 2024’s top original animated title and making “Wicked” a ubiquitous cultural presence. In 2024, Universal led the domestic box office, surpassing $1.9 billion in ticket sales and securing four of the year’s top 10 highest-grossing films. Nicole Parlapiano Because in leading marketing globally for this FOX owned ad-supported streamer, Parlapiano is “stripping fear from the equation and leaning into risk (to) drive business growth.” As Parlapiano sees it, marketing today requires not just doing differently but thinking dangerously. With this in mind, as she told Forbes, she looks to identify “marketers who have dangerous ideas,” and that while she has “done work that could fail, it’s better to throw your hat in the ring than to wait for perfection.” Along with a broad remit to grow Tubi’s brand and audience, Parlapiano works closely with the streamer’s B2B team in order to demonstrate how valuable Tubi’s viewers are to advertisers. To these ends, her creatively dissonant “Tubi Is More Popular Than” campaign did just this, reframing both brand and business. Also, Parlapiano and her team launched Stubios, a “first-to-market product” for aspiring filmmakers and their fans, that gives the camera to “anyone who has a story and puts the power to greenlight in the hands of the viewer.” The first class of Stubio projects goes live later this year. Over the past year, Tubi has seen monthly-average-user growth of 23% YoY. Lynn Pina Because Pina drives marketing for this travel medical insurance brand with what she describes as an “owner’s mindset.” As she told Forbes, “when you see yourself as an employee only, you can be passive, complacent, and easily defeated. With an owner’s mindset, I’m relentless about finding solutions and creative approaches to achieve the desired outcome.” For Pina, whose remit includes Marketing, Product and Customer Experience, driving growth with entrepreneurial marketing approach is about “striking the right balance between building and breaking,” a perspective that has served Pina and the company well, in the highly regulated category, and over the past year in particular. In just six months—rather than the usual 18-24—Pina and her team led the creation and launch of a new product and partnership, Globaline, which significantly expanded the GeoBlue’s portfolio and market reach. Doing so required Pina and her team to challenge assumptions, break down barriers, and build from scratch, all while working across two companies with two different cultures and competing priorities. Pina reports that the product launch reached 80% of its first-year goal within just six months. Surhabi Pokhyrial Because as digital has become 70% of the 186-year-old CPG company’s media mix, Pokhriyal works to “scale fast and scrap fast” in a landscape where “many new shiny things come and fizzle often.” For brands including household names like Arm & Hammer, Trojan and Waterpic, Pokhriyal tells Forbes that, over the past year, she and her teams have “started using social as the ‘third shelf’ and have partnered with some 4000 influencers in order to create “a virtuous cycle for social engagement drives online and in-store sales.” This, along with ensuring “’no-dead-end media’ and that over 90% of our media is shoppable, is how our teams truly scale fast and scrap fast when needed.” Knowing that today’s status quo can be disrupted in an instant, she and her team “keep raising the bar with readiness not just for the here and now, but for tomorrow.” Pokhriyal credits this approach—and a “healthy sense of paranoia”—with helping “drive outsized eCommerce growth versus CPG peers.” In the last year, Church & Dwight’s revenue growth surpassed its outlook and, according to sources, outperformed its competitors. Amanda Rubin Because since joining the world’s most profitable hedge-fund, Rubin is redefining what marketing means and does in a firm and industry that has long operated behind closed doors. As Rubin told Forbes, entrepreneurial marketing “requires not only showing others what needs to be done, but more importantly, what else is possible even when it deviates from the status quo.” Until Rubin, Citadel’s marketing status quo relied largely on earned media-driven awareness of the firm’s financial acumen, with little time given to its brand or that of its founder, Ken Griffin’s. Facing “a fierce war for talent and very public scrutiny”, Rubin built Citadel’s marketing function from the ground up to better position the company—and Griffin’s philanthropic efforts—among what she describes as a “complex ecosystem of audiences, from talent to commercial clients, regulators and policy-makers...none of their journeys are linear, and their perceptions have enduring impact on our commercial success.” By actively building a marketing narrative, making visible what had historically been opaque, and deploying a multi-faceted content strategy across dozens of new touchpoints and channels, Rubin and her team have helped drive a 50% YoY increase in talent applications, while concurrently tripling awareness of Griffin’s philanthropic initiatives. 1x1_John Schoolcraft Because Schoolcraft conceived and built a new-model approach to creating a category and driving growth for this oat-milk brand and company. Schoolcraft takes pains to make clear he is not a CMO and that Oatly doesn’t have a marketing department “at all” but a creative one, something he made a stipulation for joining the company in 2012. As he told Forbes, he believes “marketing departments are filters, and it is always better to work with makers and problem solvers and not approvers.” This perspective led Schoolcraft to build the “Oatly Department of Mind Control” (ODMC), which he describes as a team of creative problem solvers,” instead of a traditional marketing organization. “The ODMC doesn’t solve isolated marketing or brand problems, we understand everything is tied together, so look to solve business problems...(sitting) in on meetings from innovation to finance gives the creative department ownership and understanding of the business, which turns all of us into entrepreneurs.” While one might argue with his definitions, Schoolcraft’s approach is working. Despite slowing growth in the plant-based food category globally, 12+ years in, Oatly continues seeing double-digit sales increases YoY. Alex Schultz Because with an unusually broad remit for a CMO, including global oversight of all analytics and business, public affairs, brand and direct response consumer marketing across Meta and its brand portfolio, the analytically-driven Schultz marries the quantitative and qualitative helping disrupt and reinvent how the company drives business outcomes. While WhatsApp is dominant outside the U.S., in the U.S., it remains a challenger brand. Recognizing that the biggest brand-unlock for the messaging app would be product—not marketing—driven initially, Schultz and his team “deployed product changes to make sharing to WhatsApp easier” before launching the brand’s largest US campaign to date. This effort, “direct response ads using our platforms and others...(which) bent the curve on topline growth.” Identifying an internal lag-time stifling growth of the company’s burgeoning live-shopping ad business, where customers wanted to boost ad-spends but the internal ad-review period “meant the live video would be over by the time we approved the ads,” Schultz and his team brought the idea and insight needed to help the product team reimagine the review process, and leading to what he tells Forbes is “explosive growth of live shopping with business messaging.” At the end of 2024, the company reported revenues had increased 21.94% YoY. (Disclosure: One of the editors working on this list owns stock in Meta.) Geoff Seeley Because as PayPal’s business evolves, Seeley is helping drive “a new approach to product-led marketing that spins our consumer and merchant flywheel even faster.” Seeley’s role as marketing leader is to help conceive and realize new product innovation, and take these products to market across their 450 million customers, 35 million merchants, 200 markets, B2B and B2C, and family of brands, including its eponymous one, Venmo and Honey, In his first year since joining as Global CMO, Seeley drove what he describes as “one of the most significant strategic and executional transformations in our history.” Focused on, as he told Forbes, “revolutionizing global commerce again” Seeley and his team are “working back from (our) customers to create the next innovations.” Evidence of this and Seeley’s intent to catalyze growth by changing how people think about and use the company’s products is seen in the launch of PayPal’s largest-ever program, “Everywhere,” and its partnership with, among others, Apple Wallet, and in how he and his team are capitalizing on Venmo’s becoming a verb, and “subvert(ing) that soundbite to introduce people to a much wider world of Venmo.” As of this writing, the company’s stock is up more than 18% YoY. Peter Semple Because Semple “thinks of our brand, our experience and our proposition as ‘Always WIP’...obsessing about the context in which we operate and reflecting on how we might react. Our conviction to act is the entrepreneurial mindset in action.” With a remit for the Etsy-owned marketplace that includes oversight for brand marketing and communications, merchandising, media, seller growth, and an in-house creative studio, Semple tells Forbes he is “consistently iterating on the brand we present to the world, and the combination of channels and messages we leverage to bring that brand into peoples’ lives.” Focused on audience expansion, brand differentiation, and market share growth in the U.S. and Australia, Semple and his team are unafraid to broaden the brand’s platform and appeal beyond their traditional core demographic. Illustrations of their entrepreneurial approach in action includes expanding Depop’s advocacy programs across 100 U.S. college campuses, cultivating a new generation of engaged brand ambassadors and, also in the US, removing seller fees in order to further differentiate the brand and business, lowering barriers to entry, and leading to material YoY market share growth. In March, Semple was named interim CEO of the company. Jinal Shah Because Shah is driving growth for the buy-now-pay-later platform, by “challenging assumptions, moving with urgency, and transforming constraints into advantages.” Having led the company through multiple strategic evolutions since joining in 2021, Shah and her team are now stewarding Zip through what she describes as its hyper-growth phase with a certainty that “opportunity is created, not waited for.” Focused on “rewriting how people experience financial empowerment,” in the crowded and regulated industry, Shah and her organization are “embedding payment flexibility into everyday passions” including NASCAR, MLB, and concerts. To decrease the brand’s reliance on search networks Shah and her team built Commerce Media, a proprietary and brand-direct model, turning a profitability experiment into a fully independent business unit. Shah has also reframed customer experience, typically an “afterthought in fintech” into a competitive differentiator and, as she told us, “from an operations cost center to a brand accelerator.” Recognizing that “entrepreneurship is about building teams that can scale the mission,” in the past year, she and her teams helped Zip realize a 45% revenue increase YoY. Charlie Smith Because Smith is “pushing the boundaries of luxury fashion communication and perhaps even brand communication in general” for the LVMH-owned brand. In a category long reliant on exclusivity, polish, and reverence, Smith and his team are rewriting the rules—and the brand’s renown—by taking LOEWE in an unexpected and different direction, one where irreverence, lo-fi aesthetics, and surprising collaborations challenge convention, and transcending category constructs. For Smith and his team, challenging the status quo is rooted in what he told Forbes is their “collective willingness to embrace failure enabling us to push boundaries.” Over the past year, Smith’s How to Pronounce LOEWE campaign “tackled head-on that many don’t know how to pronounce our name, something other brands might have shied away from.” He and his team turned a might-have-been-traditional celebrity campaign with Daniel Craig into subversive storytelling, creating “a fresh context and a lot of conversation.” Similarly, LOEWE’s Suna Fujita collaboration reimagined the Japanese ceramist duo’s whimsical figures as an animated universe, pop-ups, and a children’s book, blending artistry with commerce in an entirely new way. Despite a challenging period for many luxury labels, in October, reports indicated LOEWE’s sales had increased 27.5% YoY. In March, long-time Creative Director Jonathan Anderson left the label, and Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez were appointed. John Solomon Because as Solomon leads global marketing for this wellness pioneer, “the biggest breakthroughs haven’t come from rigid planning; they’ve emerged from a willingness to seize unplanned, unbudgeted opportunities driving real consumer connection.” The private-equity backed company is expanding into new verticals, markets, and audiences, without a commensurate expansion in marketing resources, but for Solomon and his team, “with no roadmap and limited resources”, as he told Forbes, “proved that speed and ingenuity can outpace size and budget constraints.” By leaning into other brands’ reach to supplement their own, Solomon and his team forged relationships with Sephora, developing a co-brand product leading to a 50% increase in the vertical YoY; with United Airlines to drive trial in their lounges; and when faced with the challenge of excess inventory, partnered with Hollywood and sports powerhouse CAA, to “turn a potential problem into an opportunity,” executing Name, Image and Likeness deals with tier 1 college football programs, “to ensure Therabody was in the hands of the next generation of elite athletes—who eagerly shared their experience on social media.” Despite their flat marketing budget, Solomon reports their core wellness category grew 40% YoY. Marc Speichert Because Speichert, the first to have this title and combination of B2B and B2C responsibilities in the iconic brand’s corporate history, is reimagining where the brand plays and how commercial returns are driven. Recognizing that organizational structure either facilitates or limits growth, over the past year, Speichert has integrated teams once operating separately, telling Forbes he has optimized “end-to-end strategy and execution,” reimagining corporate structure with “mirror organizations...embedding subject matter experts within regions, allowing them to drive local agendas with autonomy, agility, and greater self-sufficiency.” Long synonymous with hotel luxury, for Speichert and his team, driving growth and innovating at scale, has led them to take the brand into new businesses and categories. This includes launching the first branded Yacht voyage in January, which he describes as “creating something entirely new that challenges industry norms.” At the same time, the brand’s ongoing relationship with HBO’s The White Lotus, was credited by Wallpaper as “achieving something few luxury brands manage: catapulting into mainstream awareness while maintaining exclusivity.” Speichert tells Forbes that these efforts and others are not only identifying and commercializing untapped “white space” but also leading the privately-owned company to record-breaking performance. Kate Trumbull Because, over the past year, in a category challenged by macro-economics and constrained consumer spending, Trumbull markets the iconic QSR brand determined to “get speeding tickets, not parking tickets,” as she told Forbes. Trumbull leads marketing for the brand and its 20,000 franchisees with an action-first approach believing “people will like you for what you say, but they’ll love you for what you do.” For Trumbull and her team, brand actions are redefining “value-driven initiatives beyond price (to) break through the sea of the same offers” that have historically driven the category by “turning consumer value into talk value.” Efforts have included countering shrinkflation with MOREflation, reimagining a traditional buy-one-get-one offer as a brand equity moment with their Emergency Pizza 2.0 campaign, and turning a basic $3 coupon on its head with their You Tip, We Tip driver-appreciation effort. With oversight of Domino’s marketing, product innovation, strategic partnerships and national sales, in over 90 global markets, and despite economic headwinds, Domino’s has posted three consecutive quarters of U.S. same-store sales and order growth. As of this writing, the company’s stock is up over 6% YoY. Sumit Virmani Because as he leads global marketing for the India-based IT services company, Virmani “values the entrepreneurial attitude over mere skills, celebrating risk-taking, experimentation and recognizing excellence through failures that teach, not just successes.” Despite competing against global companies that are better resourced and funded, it’s this approach to marketing that is driving how Virmani and his team create differentiated and deeper connections to the brand as a short-term and long-term growth lever. Evidence of the approach in action includes Infosys’s move into sonic branding, a strategy more typical for B2C marketers than B2B, where brand identity is typically limited to the visual. Certain that “B2B clients (also) value an emotive connection and there’s no reason for B2B to appeal only to the visual sense,” Virmani and his team launched of The Sound of Opportunity—a sonic signature, which was played more than 5 million times in its first six months. As AI continues shaping and reshaping the marketing landscape, Virmani is determined to ensure Infosys helps lead the way for its clients and prospective ones by investing “deeply” in its brand. Over the past five years, and according to Brand Finance, Infosys’s brand value has increased by 15% YoY, and the fastest-growing IT Services brand over the last 5 years. Marc Weinstock Because Weinstock markets the studio’s slate of films understanding that in today’s rapidly changing content landscape a “think-different mindset is crucial. If you can’t think outside the box and blaze a new trail, you’ll simply fall flat.” Over the past year, and for films and sequels including “Sonic the Hedgehog 3”, “A Quiet Place: Day One”, and “Gladiator 2”, Weinstock and his team were responsible not just for “creating or recreating a brand from the ground up nearly every four weeks” as he told Forbes but, more relevantly, for leading the studio to five #1 domestic openings and three franchise-best sequel performances, despite sequels typically underperforming the originals. For Weinstock, success requires not just overcoming competition—but inertia and staying home—and makes marketing innovation mission critical, leading Weinstock and his team to work “with key platforms in ways no one’s ever done.” Examples include partnering with Snapchat to “reach every one of their users at once,” and a “Mission Impossible” interstitial starring Tom Cruise in this year’s Super Bowl. In the midst of the parent company’s reorganizations and sale process, in 2024, Paramount’s filmed entertainment division revenues increased 67% YoY. Kate Wik Because when a brand is as defined in the public consciousness as Las Vegas, expanding perceptions required Wik to reinvent the traditional destination marketing playbook. With a remit to market and sell Vegas globally and, as Wik told Forbes, “in an increasingly noisy world, with an abundance of competition in every category” breaking through requires thinking entrepreneurially. To these ends, Wik and her team expanded on the city’s entertainment roots by focusing on two marquee events, Super Bowl LVIII and Formula 1. But, shifting perceptions for one of the most “branded” cities in the world, required going beyond “sponsorship” and doing things differently. Wik “challenged my teams and my partnerships with the NFL and Formula 1 to leverage their spotlights as a year-round marketing platform.” By thinking beyond the traditional window, she and her team helped reset the rules of destination marketing. “My product is Las Vegas,” Wik told Forbes, and the results of her repositioning it as “The Sports and Entertainment Capital of the World” are measured in broadened perceptions of a brand historically linked to “What Happens Here Stays Here,” and in billions of dollars in direct revenues. Edoardo Zegna Because in a marketing landscape evolving at warp speed, this fourth-generation leader of the Italian brand’s founding family says, “my goal is to make Zegna the slowest company in the world.” Zegna’s approach to driving the business is instead rooted in his belief that, as he told Forbes, “to build a product that lasts forever, you have to be slow; patience and time are indispensable ingredients to create a timeless brand.” This perspective finds the brand’s marketing not disrupting category convention so much as ignoring it. Describing his role at the 115-year-old company, not by his multi-hyphenate remit but as “the custodian of Zegna feelings”, he and his team see their work as he told another publication about creating “unscalable ideas and then figuring out a way to scale them.” All but singularly focused on giving space—often literal—to stories and the emotions they engender, Zegna and his team launched, among other platforms, Villa Zegna, a private-club pop-up bringing the brand’s heritage to life in key markets globally; turned a children’s book about the company’s origins into a week-long immersive experience in Milan, the first Zenga event with no clothes in it; and are creating Oasi Zegna (a Zegna Oasis) destinations around the world, as places to be slow and as metaphor for ZEGNA’s commitment to sustainability, craftsmanship, and lasting impact.

Title: Meta faces antitrust trial that could force it to break off Instagram, WhatsApp

Meta Platforms Inc. faces a historic antitrust trial Monday that could force the tech giant to break off Instagram and WhatsApp, startups it bought more than a decade ago that have since grown into social media powerhouses Meta Platforms Inc. faces a historic antitrust trial beginning Monday that could force the tech giant to break off Instagram and WhatsApp, startups it bought more than a decade ago that have since grown into social media powerhouses. The looming antitrust trial will be the first big test of President Donald Trump’s Federal Trade Commission’s ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta — then called Facebook — in 2020, during Trump's first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market. Meta, the FTC argues, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg's strategy, "expressed in 2008: ‘It is better to buy than compete.’ True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats." Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and “neutralize perceived competitive threats,” the FTC says in its complaint, just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers. “Unable to maintain its monopoly by fairly competing, the company’s executives addressed the existential threat by buying up new innovators that were succeeding where Facebook failed,” the FTC says. Facebook bought Instagram — then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following — in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal's value fell to $750 million after Facebook's stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012. Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller “acqui-hires” — a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion. WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta's competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple's messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp. “The FTC already has the difficult task, whether it’s looking at 10 years ago or five years ago or today, of trying to define what is the market we’re talking about in a sufficiently narrow way that it can show Meta has a ton of power in that market,” said Paul Swanson, an antitrust attorney for the law firm Holland & Hart. “And I do think that challenge has gotten harder as the years have gone by and we see more and more potential competitors in social media spaces.” Meta, meanwhile, says the FTC’s lawsuit “defies reality.” “The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others. More than 10 years after the FTC reviewed and cleared our acquisitions, the Commission’s action in this case sends the message that no deal is ever truly final. Regulators should be supporting American innovation, rather than seeking to break up a great American company and further advantaging China on critical issues like AI," the company said in a statement. In a filing last week, Meta also stressed that the FTC “must prove that Meta has monopoly power in its claimed relevant market now, not at some time in the past." This, experts say, could also prove challenging since more competitors have emerged in the social media space in the years since the company bought WhatsApp and Instagram. Meta's fate will be decided by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who late last year denied Meta's request for a summary judgment and ruled that the case must go to trial. Boasberg “seems to be skeptical” of the FTC's narrow market definition in his rulings to date, Swanson said. He added that the judge also said it is a “fact question," which means he is open to hearing what the FTC and its experts have to say to define that narrow market. While the FTC may face an uphill battle in proving its case, the stakes are high for Meta, whose advertising business could be cut in half if it's forced to spin off Instagram. “Instagram is now Meta’s biggest money maker in the U.S., its most lucrative market, where the app accounts for 50.5% of the company’s ad revenues in 2025. Instagram has also been picking up the slack for Facebook on the user front, particularly among young people, for a long time,” said Emarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg. “The trial also comes as Meta is trying to bring back OG Facebook in an effort to appeal to Gen Z and younger users as they join social media. Social media usage is far more fragmented today than it was in 2012 when Facebook acquired Instagram, and Facebook isn’t where the cool college kids hang out anymore. Meta needs Instagram to continue growing, especially as more advertisers think Instagram-first with their Meta budgets.” But Meta isn't the only technology company in the sights of federal antitrust regulators, Google and Amazon face their own cases. The remedy phase of Google's case is scheduled to begin on April 21. A federal judge declared the search giant an illegal monopoly last August. “A big theme here is we are applying 19th-century laws to 21st-century markets. And I think it’s an open question whether the judgment developments to antitrust law can keep up with markets as they are changing — these fluid and dynamic tech markets in particular,” Swanson said. “And this will be a case that speaks directly to that.” 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Intel Stock At $20: A Tempting Tech Bet?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. BARCELONA, SPAIN - MARCH 06: A logo sits illuminated at the Intel booth at Mobile Congress 2025 on ... More March 06, 2025 in Barcelona, Spain. (Photo by Eric Alonso/Getty Images) Intel stock (NASDAQ: INTC) has reached a critical support level that has held historical significance. This price range saw nearly ten years of consolidation from 2004 to 2014 before the stock began trending higher, indicating strong buying interest around current levels. This support seems solid, as shown by the stock’s ability to hold up following a sharp 30%+ decline in August 2024. While the length of this consolidation is unknown, Intel at $20 presents a compelling value case, though investors should remain mindful of associated risks. For those seeking gains with lower volatility than individual stocks, check out the High-Quality portfolio, which has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 with over 91% returns since inception. INTC Stock Price History Intel’s current valuation reflects its recent performance struggles. The company is facing negative revenue growth, while competitors AMD, QCOM, and NVDA are enjoying double-digit increases. With negative earnings, Intel trades at a Price to Sales ratio of just 1.8, versus 6.5 for AMD, 4.2 for QCOM, and 20.3 for Nvidia. This may make Intel more appealing as a long-term value play than a short-term growth bet. There are several potential catalysts that could unlock value for Intel: The biggest risk for investors buying at these levels is the potential for capital to be locked up if the stock remains in consolidation for an extended period. It may take time for catalysts to have an effect, requiring patience for meaningful returns. Not keen on the volatility of INTC? The Trefis High Quality Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 over the past four years. Why? HQ Portfolio stocks tend to deliver higher returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark, offering a smoother ride. Explore HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

The ongoing ambiguity has rattled markets, especially Big Tech firms like Apple and Nvidia, with experts warning of severe disruption to supply chains and investor confidence. | Photo Credit: NATHAN HOWARD/Reuters Tariff exemptions announced Friday on electronics like smartphones and laptops are only a temporary reprieve until the Trump administration develops a new tariff approach specific to the semiconductor industry, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday. “They're exempt from the reciprocal tariffs but they're included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,” Lutnick told ABC's “This Week” on Sunday. President Donald Trump added to the confusion hours later, declaring on social media that there was no “exception” at all because the goods are “just moving to a different" bucket and will still face a 20 per cent tariff as part of his administration's move to punish China for its role in fentanyl trafficking. Apple India produces $22 billion of iPhones in shift from China The Trump administration late Friday had said it would exclude electronics from broader so-called reciprocal tariffs, a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer devices that aren't usually made in the US The move was expected to benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, though the uncertainty of future tariffs may rein in an expected tech stock rally on Monday. US Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won't be subject to most of the tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere. Apple airlifts 600 tonnes of iPhones from India to beat Trump tariffs, sources say It's the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in its massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. Lutnick's comments Sunday made clear that more changes were on the way, including a policy specific to the computer chip industry. On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. In his post Sunday on TruthSocial, he promised the White House was “taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.” Some had assumed the exemption filed Friday night reflected the president's realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the US any time soon, if ever. The administration has predicted that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the US for the first time, but that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. Semiconductors from China under US scrutiny as Trump warns of fresh tariffs What's more, it would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the US, and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. The turmoil has battered the stocks of tech's “Magnificent Seven” -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the Magnificent Seven's combined market value had plunged by USD2.1 trillion, or 14 per cent, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. When Trump paused the tariffs outside of China on Wednesday, the lost value in those companies was pared to USD 644 billion, or a 4 per cent decline. An electronics exemption would fulfill the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech's hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden's administration. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the US during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump's first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move removes “a huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,” said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. Ives amended that note after Lutnick's comments Sunday, saying the confusing news out of the White House “is dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand.” Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment over the weekend.

Title: US stock futures rise amid temporary tariff exemptions for tech products | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Stock futures rose Sunday after a temporary reprieve from tariffs on electronic imports from China by the Trump administration. Dow futures were up 0.5%, or 212 points. The S&P 500 futures rose 0.75%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite futures gained 1.26%, as of 6:18 pm ET. The Trump administration late Friday exempted electronic imports from reciprocal tariffs; any of those goods manufactured in China — like computers, phones and semiconductors — would still be subject to the 20% tariff Trump previously imposed on Chinese goods. The gains come after stocks have seesawed wildly in recent days, as President Donald Trump has levied massive tariffs on US trading partners, then backed off many of those import taxes. Still, confusion about how permanent or temporary some tariff moves could be has stoked uncertainty among investors and kept stocks, the dollar and even US Treasuries under pressure. Tech giants like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA) rely on Chinese manufacturing, and the reciprocal tariffs would have made goods like iPhones and other consumer products more expensive. But Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday that the exemption was “not permanent.” Other administration officials said another slate of tariffs could be imposed after an investigation into the national security effects of semiconductor imports. Trump posted to his Truth Social platform that “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook’ for the unfair Trade Balances, and Non Monetary Tariff Barriers, that other Countries have used against us, especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst!” The back-and-forth on tariffs has caused many investors and others to hold off on major decisions until they get clarity. “Investors will not invest in the United States when Donald Trump is playing ‘red light, green light’ with tariffs and saying, ‘Oh, and for my special donors, you get a special exemption,’” said Massachusetts Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren on CNN’s “State of the Union.” Trump has imposed various tariffs in recent weeks, after repeatedly postponing tariffs on Canada, Mexico and automotive imports. A baseline tariff of 10% went into effect on all countries, and higher rates were imposed on roughly 60 countries deemed the “worst offenders,” including tariffs on Cambodia (49%), Vietnam (46%) and the European Union (20%). Stocks plunged on April 3 after the news, with two consecutive sessions of sell-offs that wiped nearly $6 trillion in market value and continued with another volatile day on Monday, April 7, as the tariff chaos continued.

WSB Now NASHVILLE, Tenn. — (AP) — Tariff exemptions announced Friday on electronics like smartphones and laptops are only a temporary reprieve until the Trump administration develops a new tariff approach specific to the semiconductor industry, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday. White House officials, including President Donald Trump himself, spent Sunday downplaying the significance of exemptions that lessen but won't eliminate the effect of U.S. tariffs on imports of popular consumer devices and their key components. “They’re exempt from the reciprocal tariffs but they’re included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,” Lutnick told ABC's “This Week” on Sunday.

Microsoft is reportedly planning another round of layoffs, expected to begin in May 2025. This strategic move aims to streamline the company's organisational structure by reducing middle management positions and non-technical roles. The goal is to improve efficiency and increase the ratio of engineers to non-engineers within project teams, aligning with broader industry trends seen in tech giants like Google and Amazon. Join TBC's WhatsApp Channel to Stay Updated! Microsoft seeks to reduce bureaucratic layers and enhance the "span of control" for managers, allowing each to oversee more employees. This shift is designed to cut overhead costs and prioritize hands-on technical contributions. The company aims to adjust the "PM ratio" (Product Manager to Engineer ratio) to ensure more engineers are involved in product development compared to managers. This is inspired by Amazon's "Builder Ratio," which emphasizes a higher proportion of engineers to non-builders. Similar restructuring efforts have been undertaken by Google and Amazon, focusing on reducing managerial levels and prioritizing technical talent. Google recently reduced vice president and manager roles by 10% as part of an efficiency drive. Middle Management and Non-Technical Roles:These positions are expected to be most affected by the layoffs. The exact number of jobs at risk is not yet confirmed, but it could significantly impact certain teams. Performance-Based Considerations:Employees with consecutive low performance ratings may also face scrutiny, although the current layoffs are more focused on restructuring rather than performance-based cuts. Microsoft's planned layoffs reflect a strategic effort to optimize its workforce and enhance operational efficiency. Prioritising technical talent and streamlining management, the company aims to maintain competitiveness in a rapidly evolving tech landscape. Join TBC's WhatsApp Channel to Stay Updated!

(NASDAQ: RKLB) between November 12, 2024 and February 25, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important April 28, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Rocket Lab securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Rocket Lab class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=36018 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 28, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Rocket Lab’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about Rocket Lab’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Rocket Lab class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=36018 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, April 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB) and reminds investors of the April 28, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Rocket Lab’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Full Content:
By Dustin Rowles | TV | April 13, 2025 Cold Open — It’s a Trump sketch with James Austin Johnson, here comparing himself to Jesus in an Easter sketch because he made the stock market die, then resurrected it, and then it went away again. It works better than usual because much of the cast is frozen behind him in their Jesus garb, and James Austin Johnson calls them out individually until they crack. Except for Emil Wakim: He keeps it stone-faced! They’ve done this before, but I’m a sucker for it. (Score: 6 out of 10) Jon Hamm Monologue — Hamm has some great energy tonight, talking about how he hasn’t hosted since 2010, but he has done something even more important: made 14 cameos. Cameos are even more critical for saving a meandering, flagging show, he says, right before Kieran Culkin walks out for a cameo and, uh, slyly references the Hammoconda. Hamm also insists that Mad Men is better than Succession (agree!) (Score: 6.5 out of 10) CTCBC News — A news channel devoted not to the stock market — because these Check-to-Check Business News viewers don’t invest in the stock market — but to the price of groceries, healthcare, and, uh, Funko Pops. Funny and very relatable. (Score: 7 out of 10) Please Don’t Destroy — A Please Don’t Destroy video this early in the show? It’s good, too. A room of detectives is talking about finding a missing girl, but one detective (Jon Hamm) is most excited about the pizza they’re ordering for the late night — at least until someone says Hawaiian. (Score: 6.5 out of 10) Guess the Correct Answer — It’s a password-style game, and Hamm plays an average guy who doesn’t really wanna play because he’s mostly afraid of saying something that will go viral and ruin his life and my god, that is exactly what he does. Thirty seconds of life-ruining madness. I’m going to make this the Mat sketch of the week, even though I suspect it’s funnier to me than to him. (Score: 7.5 out of 10) The White Potus — It’s The White Lotus, only with the Trump Administration. Some good cameos: ScarJo returns as Ivanka, and the return of Alex Moffat (as Eric Trump) and Beck Bennett, who has two cameos. Jon Hamm is RFK Jr., Chloe is a mash-up of Melania and Parker Posey, and Lizzo plays Belinda. Lots going on here (and I guarantee half the viewers didn’t even realize that Moffat and Beck Bennett left SNL several seasons ago). (Score: 7 out of 10) Weekend Update — The Hamm-hosted show is going so well that it doesn’t need “Update” to bail it out, which is good because the jokes are not great this week (watch here and here). The segments, however, are top-notch: Bowen Yang plays China’s trade representative, who clearly has a lot more tolerance for pain than America; Emil Wakim does a segment on how he’s not that proud to be an American, which involves some Uber Eats jokes; and Sarah Sherman plays Colin’s tax accountant, which — as always — is an excuse for her to make fun of Jost for three minutes. (Score: 6 out of 10) New Parents — A gay couple at a hangout arrives with a new baby, which they didn’t have the night before, and when people ask where they got the baby, they shut them down with variations on, “You can’t ask gay people that.” There are a couple of amusing moments, but it’s not the night’s best offering. (Watch Here) (Score: 4 out of 10) Medication Ad — It’s a medication ad that’s basically a parody of all the other medication ads. Clever, but not to the level of Jon Hamm’s John Ham.(Score: 5.5 out of 10) Icebreaker — A group of strangers play an icebreaker game where everyone says their name and one fact about themselves, and it kind of goes off the rails because one guy’s fact is that his mom killed his dad naked on TV. They can’t all be great! (Watch Here) (Score: 4 out of 10) Average Score: 6 out of 10: Solid episode that flags some after “Update.” Hamm, as always, is a great sport and embraces being the butt of the joke. The episode was more political than usual, too, because that’s how Hamm rolls. Comments require JavaScript to load.

Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that Merck’s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck’s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil’s growth in China. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Gardasil’s demand in China; notably, that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor, Zhifei. Such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Merck’s securities at artificially inflated prices. On February 4, 2025, before the market opened, Merck filed a current report on Form 8-K with the SEC. In the current report, Merck announced their fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 financial results, in which it stated that “GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 [s]ales [d]eclined 3% to $8.6 Billion.” In addition, the current report stated Merck’s “decision to temporarily pause shipments of GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 into China beginning February 2025 through at least mid-year.” On this news, Merck’s stock price fell $9.05 per share, or 9.1%, to close at $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class.

Title: Are Stocks And Yields Signaling Something Sinister?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/04/13/are-stocks-and-yields-signaling-something-sinister/
Time Published: 2025-04-13T12:18:17Z

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. President Trump mentioned bond yields when he paused some tariff increases last week. After the ... More pause, stock registered their third-largest one day gain since 1950. The causes of higher yields and the history of outsized one-day gains are examined. Updated, Apr. 14, 2025: This post has been adjusted to correct the date of Liberation Day, which was April 2, not April 4. Stocks began trading lower last week, continuing the selloff after President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcements on Wednesday, April 2, which sparked the stock plunge in the previous week. The S&P 500 reached bear market territory intraday on Monday, down 21% from the mid-February closing high, as concerns about negative economic consequences from the tariffs grew. On Wednesday, Trump announced a temporary reduction in the reciprocal tariff rates to 10% for 60 countries previously hit with higher tariffs. The tariff rate on China was increased to 125%. Stocks reacted with a record-setting one-day rally on Wednesday as the perceived risk of a global recession and trade war was reduced. Largest 1-Day S&P 500 Gains Since 1950 The easing in tariff worries sent stocks 5.7% higher last week. After this week’s rally, the S&P 500 sits 12.7% below its mid-February high. Though the Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed last week, the group remains in bear market territory at 22.5% below the mid-December all-time high. Market Performance Notably, in a change from earlier in the tariff-related stock weakness, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury rose instead of falling. For example, during the week of March 31, when the S&P 500 fell 9.1%, the 10-year yield fell from 4.2% to 4.0%. Last week, yields continued to rise even while stocks were soft in the first half of the trading week. This is important because lower yields can help the economy and are the typical bond reaction during worries about economic growth. In addition, the usual flight to U.S. Treasuries as safe assets helps diversified investors offset some of the stock losses during bear markets. Recall that bond prices rise when yields fall and vice versa. Trump even said the bond market was “getting a little queasy” when he paused the higher tariff rates for 90 days last Wednesday. Interestingly, the rise in yields did not come from higher inflation expectations. Instead, the 50 basis point (0.50%) increase in the 10-year Treasury yield from April 4 to April 11 was from an increase in the real yield demanded by investors. This means investors are demanding more compensation for owning U.S. Treasuries. Typically, this happens when expectations for economic growth increase since investors are less interested in safety and are offered attractive expected returns on risk assets like stocks during these periods. Given the likelihood that higher tariffs will effectively act as a tax increase, they should be a headwind to economic growth. So, the typical primary reason for higher real yields is not the most plausible. Instead, investors in the 10-year Treasury demanded higher yields to invest in U.S. debt for another reason. The drivers probably include several reasons, including increased perceived risk plus seasonal and bond market structural factors. 10-Year US Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition The financial market volatility surrounding the tariffs has likely pressured some common trades and arbitrages within the bond market. One way to see this risk is by looking at Treasury asset swaps in which one side pays the fixed coupon on the 10-year U.S. Treasury and receives the variable Secured Overnight Financing Rate. The volatility of the U.S. swap spreads around the tariff announcements suggests that some of these trades could have been liquidated and helped send yields higher. US Swap Spread Looking at a past period of financial stress, similar periods of rising Treasury yields can be seen as swap spreads become volatile. This chart shows swap spreads and the 10-year yield around the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank on Mar. 10, 2023. US Swap Spreads: Silicon Valley Bank Collapse Period There is also talk that some parties had highly leveraged basis trades in place and were forced to unwind them during the volatility, pushing yields higher. Basis trades attempt to profit from the difference between a futures price and a similar bond price. The recent decline in the U.S. dollar relative to other countries’ currencies could be evidence that other countries are selling some U.S. Treasuries. Investors from different countries might also be demanding a higher yield to compensate them for the falling value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies. US Dollar Weakness Seasonally, one could also expect some pressure on yields as tax payments are due on April 15. Both individual and corporate taxpayers could be liquidating or not demanding as many Treasury bonds to have cash available to make their tax payments. In addition, with the robust rally in risk assets last week, higher yields should be expected. In summary, it looks unlikely that the tariffs caused permanent damage to the status of the U.S. dollar and Treasuries as a safe haven. The primary focus will likely remain on tariffs, with markets watching for any changes in US policy and retaliation or concessions from other countries. Late last Friday, smartphones, computers, and other electronics were excluded from the tariffs, including those from China. Companies like Apple, which sources significant electronics from China, should see some relief. Since the consumer is the key to U.S. economic growth, Wednesday’s retail sales remains notable. The data will still be looked at skeptically since the full brunt of the tariffs will not be reflected in the March numbers. First quarter earnings season began slowly last week, with a few large banks reporting on Friday. The pace picks up slightly this week, with more banks and notable companies like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), American Express (AXP), and Netflix (NFLX) scheduled to report earnings. While the last quarter’s earnings always take a back seat to future guidance, this season's situation will be even more extreme, with investors trying to determine the upcoming earnings bite from the tariffs and any retaliation. S&P 500 Earnings Season The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), which is also called the fear gauge, can help illustrate the level of fear that gripped the markets around the tariff announcements. The VIX measures the expected volatility in the price of the S&P 500 over the next 30 days, using the implied volatility of options on stocks. Some market participants use volatility to measure risk since it is the only thing that can be easily measured. In reality, price volatility does not indicate risk for long-term investors. Still, the probability of a permanent capital loss is not easily measured, so volatility is used instead. Within the plumbing of financial markets, higher volatility tends to cause a reduction in liquidity across most assets as those parties typically providing liquidity reduce the size of their capital at risk. This lower liquidity can cause large swings to the downside and the upside. Volatility Risk Last Wednesday, the S&P 500 had its third-largest one-day gain since 1950. Some have posited that extreme one-day gains are associated with bear markets rather than a positive stock outlook. Using data from Strategas Research Partners, the shorter-term periods following these large jumps have indeed seen mixed results. For example, the S&P 500 was higher 58% of the time in the three months after the 25 most significant one-day gains since 1950. Things look significantly better when the investment horizon is lengthened to a year, with the S&P 500 higher almost 92% of the time. Frequency Of Positive S&P 500 Returns After Large 1-Day Gains Further bringing home the point, the range of returns for those shorter periods following the outsized one-day gains is quite sizable. If history is a guide, the risk versus reward for investors looking out a year looks appetizing. Range Of Returns Following Large 1-Day Gains It seems reasonable from the history of stock returns following the largest one-day gains and the unsettled tariff situation that investors should expect volatility to persist for some time. Stocks have provided the highest long-term annualized return of any asset class, but the price for that stellar history is periods of intense volatility and temporary steep declines. Stock’s dominance in growing wealth relative to other investments was achieved through world wars, trade wars, severe economic downturns, financial crises, and pandemics. So, there is no reason to believe that increased tariffs, a hotter trade war with China, or a recession will change the long-term positive outcome, though it can make the short-term uncomfortable.

Updated, Apr. 14, 2025: This post has been adjusted to correct the date of Liberation Day, which was April 2, not April 4. Stocks began trading lower last week, continuing the selloff after President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcements on Wednesday, April 2, which sparked the stock plunge in the previous week. The S&P 500 reached bear market territory intraday on Monday, down 21% from the mid-February closing high, as concerns about negative economic consequences from the tariffs grew. On Wednesday, Trump announced a temporary reduction in the reciprocal tariff rates to 10% for 60 countries previously hit with higher tariffs. The tariff rate on China was increased to 125%. Stocks reacted with a record-setting one-day rally on Wednesday as the perceived risk of a global recession and trade war was reduced. Largest 1-Day S&P 500 Gains Since 1950 The easing in tariff worries sent stocks 5.7% higher last week. After this week’s rally, the S&P 500 sits 12.7% below its mid-February high. Though the Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed last week, the group remains in bear market territory at 22.5% below the mid-December all-time high. Market Performance Notably, in a change from earlier in the tariff-related stock weakness, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury rose instead of falling. For example, during the week of March 31, when the S&P 500 fell 9.1%, the 10-year yield fell from 4.2% to 4.0%. Last week, yields continued to rise even while stocks were soft in the first half of the trading week. This is important because lower yields can help the economy and are the typical bond reaction during worries about economic growth. In addition, the usual flight to U.S. Treasuries as safe assets helps diversified investors offset some of the stock losses during bear markets. Recall that bond prices rise when yields fall and vice versa. Trump even said the bond market was “getting a little queasy” when he paused the higher tariff rates for 90 days last Wednesday. Interestingly, the rise in yields did not come from higher inflation expectations. Instead, the 50 basis point (0.50%) increase in the 10-year Treasury yield from April 4 to April 11 was from an increase in the real yield demanded by investors. This means investors are demanding more compensation for owning U.S. Treasuries. Typically, this happens when expectations for economic growth increase since investors are less interested in safety and are offered attractive expected returns on risk assets like stocks during these periods. Given the likelihood that higher tariffs will effectively act as a tax increase, they should be a headwind to economic growth. So, the typical primary reason for higher real yields is not the most plausible. Instead, investors in the 10-year Treasury demanded higher yields to invest in U.S. debt for another reason. The drivers probably include several reasons, including increased perceived risk plus seasonal and bond market structural factors. 10-Year US Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition The financial market volatility surrounding the tariffs has likely pressured some common trades and arbitrages within the bond market. One way to see this risk is by looking at Treasury asset swaps in which one side pays the fixed coupon on the 10-year U.S. Treasury and receives the variable Secured Overnight Financing Rate. The volatility of the U.S. swap spreads around the tariff announcements suggests that some of these trades could have been liquidated and helped send yields higher. US Swap Spread Looking at a past period of financial stress, similar periods of rising Treasury yields can be seen as swap spreads become volatile. This chart shows swap spreads and the 10-year yield around the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank on Mar. 10, 2023. US Swap Spreads: Silicon Valley Bank Collapse Period There is also talk that some parties had highly leveraged basis trades in place and were forced to unwind them during the volatility, pushing yields higher. Basis trades attempt to profit from the difference between a futures price and a similar bond price. The recent decline in the U.S. dollar relative to other countries’ currencies could be evidence that other countries are selling some U.S. Treasuries. Investors from different countries might also be demanding a higher yield to compensate them for the falling value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies. US Dollar Weakness Seasonally, one could also expect some pressure on yields as tax payments are due on April 15. Both individual and corporate taxpayers could be liquidating or not demanding as many Treasury bonds to have cash available to make their tax payments. In addition, with the robust rally in risk assets last week, higher yields should be expected. In summary, it looks unlikely that the tariffs caused permanent damage to the status of the U.S. dollar and Treasuries as a safe haven. The primary focus will likely remain on tariffs, with markets watching for any changes in US policy and retaliation or concessions from other countries. Late last Friday, smartphones, computers, and other electronics were excluded from the tariffs, including those from China. Companies like Apple, which sources significant electronics from China, should see some relief. Since the consumer is the key to U.S. economic growth, Wednesday’s retail sales remains notable. The data will still be looked at skeptically since the full brunt of the tariffs will not be reflected in the March numbers. First quarter earnings season began slowly last week, with a few large banks reporting on Friday. The pace picks up slightly this week, with more banks and notable companies like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), American Express (AXP), and Netflix (NFLX) scheduled to report earnings. While the last quarter’s earnings always take a back seat to future guidance, this season's situation will be even more extreme, with investors trying to determine the upcoming earnings bite from the tariffs and any retaliation. S&P 500 Earnings Season The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), which is also called the fear gauge, can help illustrate the level of fear that gripped the markets around the tariff announcements. The VIX measures the expected volatility in the price of the S&P 500 over the next 30 days, using the implied volatility of options on stocks. Some market participants use volatility to measure risk since it is the only thing that can be easily measured. In reality, price volatility does not indicate risk for long-term investors. Still, the probability of a permanent capital loss is not easily measured, so volatility is used instead. Within the plumbing of financial markets, higher volatility tends to cause a reduction in liquidity across most assets as those parties typically providing liquidity reduce the size of their capital at risk. This lower liquidity can cause large swings to the downside and the upside. Volatility Risk Last Wednesday, the S&P 500 had its third-largest one-day gain since 1950. Some have posited that extreme one-day gains are associated with bear markets rather than a positive stock outlook. Using data from Strategas Research Partners, the shorter-term periods following these large jumps have indeed seen mixed results. For example, the S&P 500 was higher 58% of the time in the three months after the 25 most significant one-day gains since 1950. Things look significantly better when the investment horizon is lengthened to a year, with the S&P 500 higher almost 92% of the time. Frequency Of Positive S&P 500 Returns After Large 1-Day Gains Further bringing home the point, the range of returns for those shorter periods following the outsized one-day gains is quite sizable. If history is a guide, the risk versus reward for investors looking out a year looks appetizing. Range Of Returns Following Large 1-Day Gains It seems reasonable from the history of stock returns following the largest one-day gains and the unsettled tariff situation that investors should expect volatility to persist for some time. Stocks have provided the highest long-term annualized return of any asset class, but the price for that stellar history is periods of intense volatility and temporary steep declines. Stock’s dominance in growing wealth relative to other investments was achieved through world wars, trade wars, severe economic downturns, financial crises, and pandemics. So, there is no reason to believe that increased tariffs, a hotter trade war with China, or a recession will change the long-term positive outcome, though it can make the short-term uncomfortable.

For example, the S&P 500 was higher 58% of the time in the three months after the 25 most significant one-day gains since 1950. Things look significantly better when the investment horizon is lengthened to a year, with the S&P 500 higher almost 92% of the time. Frequency Of Positive S&P 500 Returns After Large 1-Day Gains Further bringing home the point, the range of returns for those shorter periods following the outsized one-day gains is quite sizable. If history is a guide, the risk versus reward for investors looking out a year looks appetizing. Range Of Returns Following Large 1-Day Gains It seems reasonable from the history of stock returns following the largest one-day gains and the unsettled tariff situation that investors should expect volatility to persist for some time. Stocks have provided the highest long-term annualized return of any asset class, but the price for that stellar history is periods of intense volatility and temporary steep declines. Stock’s dominance in growing wealth relative to other investments was achieved through world wars, trade wars, severe economic downturns, financial crises, and pandemics. So, there is no reason to believe that increased tariffs, a hotter trade war with China, or a recession will change the long-term positive outcome, though it can make the short-term uncomfortable.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, April 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against AppLovin Corporation (“AppLovin” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: APP) and reminds investors of the May 5, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inglate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding AppLovin’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Full Content:
Netflix (NFLX) is scheduled to report first-quarter results after the closing bell Thursday, with analysts suggesting the streaming giant could be well-positioned to weather an uncertain macroeconomic environment. In a recent note to clients, JPMorgan called Netflix the “most resilient” company it tracks, given the streamer's strong subscriber base, with members watching an average of two hours of content per day. The bank holds an “overweight” rating and $1,025 price target for the stock. Morgan Stanley also named Netflix a "top pick," expecting the company could “demonstrate relative resilience in a weaker global macro.” All told, 15 of the 19 analysts covering Netflix tracked by Visible Alpha have "buy" or equivalent ratings for the stock, with the remainder issuing a "hold" rating. Their consensus price target of about $1,097 would suggest 12% upside, after the stock surged earlier this week following a report Netflix aims to double its revenue and join the $1 trillion market capitalization club by 2030. Netflix is expected to report first-quarter revenue of $10.5 billion, up 12% year-over-year, and net income of $2.47 billion, or $5.67 per share, rising from $2.33 billion, or $5.28 per share, a year earlier. Netflix shares have risen nearly 60% over the past 12 months, at $975.73 in Thursday afternoon trading. UPDATE—April 17, 2025: This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect more recent analyst estimates and share price values.

Title: Konstantinos Sinanas: The Greek engineer who brought Alexa’s voice to the Orion spacecraft
URL: https://en.protothema.gr/2025/04/13/konstantinos-sinanas-the-greek-engineer-who-brought-alexas-voice-to-the-orion-spacecraft/
Time Published: 2025-04-13T07:04:53Z
Full Content:
Konstantinos Sinanas, an acoustic and computer systems engineer who has worked for some of the largest tech companies in America—including Amazon, HP, Harman-Samsung, Synaptics, MeyerSound, and Crestron—is the Greek engineer who participated in the Artemis I – Callisto space program. The project was carried out in collaboration with NASA, Lockheed Martin, and Amazon, and he succeeded in realizing Jeff Bezos’s vision: enabling crews to give voice commands to Alexa and have them executed by the spacecraft‘s systems. “Many people tell me this project is an experience I’ll be able to share for the rest of my life. Science fiction became reality,” says the Greek Distinguished Technologist Konstantinos Sinanas in an interview with the Athens News Agency (APE), explaining that, “In the Artemis I – Callisto space program (a collaboration between NASA, Lockheed Martin, and Amazon), I was the Acoustic Design Lead for integrating Alexa into the Orion spacecraft. The project began during the pandemic, and there had been several failed attempts by other colleagues and teams before I took over. The pressure was immense—there was no room for failure, as it would affect not only me but also the future of Alexa, Amazon, Jeff Bezos personally, Lockheed, NASA, and the reputation of the United States in general.” There is no room for mistakes in space “In anything related to space, mistakes are not an option. Once the launch happens, you need to be 100% sure the systems will work. If there’s a problem, you can’t just ‘go and fix it.’ That’s why, beyond exhaustive system simulations, I insisted on on-site tests at the Orion mockup in Houston. Even though that caused a lot of friction and difficulties, I was certain it was the only way to succeed—and in the end, we did,” Mr. Sinanas emphasizes. Speaking about the field he has served for decades, he explained that he works on the research and development of microphones and micro-speakers—whether embedded in devices or as peripherals (wired/wireless headsets, speakers, microphones, etc.)—covering both consumer and professional audio products, including mobile phones, laptops, and smart devices. At the same time, he designs and equips audio labs and studios and conducts acoustic studies for spaces and installations. 15 Years in America’s Leading Tech Companies “In recent years, Konstantinos Sinanas worked at HP as a Distinguished Technologist at the R&D center, focusing on audio hardware and software, acoustics, innovation, and artificial intelligence. In addition to his main responsibilities, I also had the role of ambassador for international standards and specifications, mentor, and HP representative in global technology forums,” he notes. He explains that over the 15 years he worked in the U.S., he collaborated closely with companies such as “Microsoft, Intel, AMD, NVIDIA, Texas Instruments, Cirrus Logic, Qualcomm, Realtek, Dolby, DTS, Waves, and other HW/SW suppliers in the U.S., Europe, and Asia to create new HP technologies, applications, and products. This gave me the opportunity to work with the entire group of tech giants in Silicon Valley and to gain knowledge and connections I never imagined possible—even though I already had experience with major projects through Harman, with companies such as Google, Apple, JBL, AKG, Huawei, Lenovo, Dell, Asus, Oculus, Bloomberg, LG, and many others.” The Financial Crisis Pushed Him to America “Although I had a successful career in Greece as an educator and engineer, since 2007 I had started to see that the future of the country—especially for those who wanted to grow professionally and financially—was looking bleak. After much thought, sacrifices, and taking a big risk, I made the decision to move to the U.S. in 2010, along with my wife. We have lived in Astoria (New York), Edgewater with Crestron, Los Angeles with Harman-Samsung, Irvine, Orange County with Synaptics, Berkeley with MeyerSound, Santa Clara with Amazon, and in Houston, Texas, with HP,” he notes. When asked whether there’s a secret to success, Konstantinos Sinanas replies, “There are many—not ‘secrets,’ but talents, capabilities, and skills one must possess to build a successful career. It takes a combination of talent, specialized knowledge, flexibility, and continuous development. From crafting the right resume and handling interviews, to managing relationships with colleagues, partners, and the company. Consistency, productivity, integrity, and effectiveness are essential to surviving in the competitive tech space—especially in the U.S.” The Tech Sector Is Facing a Crisis in the U.S. Commenting on the current state of the tech industry in the U.S., he clarified, “Over the past two or three years, the tech sector has been facing a crisis due to poor policy and corporate strategic decisions. This has led to mass layoffs, downsizing, or closure of companies, with serious social consequences. Unfortunately, the reforms now being implemented should have happened a decade ago. Although they may seem strict or confusing to many, they are necessary to avoid worse outcomes for the future of the U.S.” What Comes Next? A Return to Greece As for his future plans? Konstantinos Sinanas answers spontaneously, without a second thought:“My goal is to return permanently to Greece and offer everything I gained abroad—knowledge, experience, innovation, and connections—into education, production, and research. Important efforts are being made, but I believe we still have a long way to go for our country to move forward. I hope that my wife and I will succeed in settling permanently in our homeland.” Explore related questions

April 12, 2025 21:30 ET | Source: Pomerantz LLP Pomerantz LLP NEW YORK, April 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB). Such investors are advised to contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980, (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. The class action concerns whether Rocket Lab and certain of its officers and/or directors have engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful business practices. You have until April 28, 2025 to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class if you purchased or otherwise acquired Rocket Lab securities during the Class Period. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. [Click here for information about joining the class action] On February 25, 2025, Bleeker Street Research (“Bleeker Street”) published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” Following publication of the Bleeker Street report, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21 per share, or 9.83%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025. Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, Pomerantz pioneered the field of securities class actions. Today, more than 85 years later, Pomerantz continues in the tradition he established, fighting for the rights of the victims of securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty, and corporate misconduct. The Firm has recovered numerous multimillion-dollar damages awards on behalf of class members. See www.pomlaw.com. Attorney advertising. Prior results do not guarantee similar outcomes.

Title: Trump administration says it will exclude some electronics from tariffs
URL: https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/04/12/trump-administration-says-it-will-exclude-some-electronics-from-tariffs/
Time Published: 2025-04-12T22:26:14Z
Full Content:
The Trump administration late Friday said they would exclude electronics like smartphones and laptops from reciprocal tariffs, a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer electronics that aren’t usually made in the U.S. It would also benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia and sets the stage for a likely tech stock rally on Monday. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won’t be subject to the current 145% tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere. It’s the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in their massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. The exemption seemed to reflect the president’s realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon, if ever, despite the administration’s predictions that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time. But that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. What’s more, It would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. Trump’s decision to exempt the iPhone and other popular electronics made in China mirrors the similar relief that he gave those products during the trade war of his first term in the White House. But Trump began his second term seemingly determined to impose the tariffs more broad this time, triggering a meltdown in the market values of Apple and other technology powerhouses. The turmoil battered the stocks of tech’s “Magnificent Seven” — Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point earlier this week, the combined Magnificent Seven’s combined market value had plunged by $2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. Some of the losses eased this past Wednesday when Trump paused the tariffs outside of China, paring the lost value in the Magnificent Seven to $644 billion, or a 4% decline, from April 2. Now, the stage is set for another tech rally Monday when trading resumes in the U.S. stock market, with Apple likely leading the way because the iPhones made in China remain the company’s biggest money maker. The electronics exemption also should relieve consumer worries that the China tariffs would result in hefty price hikes on smartphones and other devices that have become essential tools of modern living, It’s the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech’s hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden’s administration’s and help propel an already booming industry to even greater heights. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump’s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move takes off “a huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,” said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment Saturday. Nvidia declined to comment. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday.

Title: Bonds Break, Bullion Breaks Out

Skip to comments. Posted on 04/12/2025 6:02:10 AM PDT by delta7 Global markets have reached a day of reckoning. This has been decades in the making. Now, massive changes are sweeping the world. No, what we’re seeing in the markets is not “normal.” Instead, this is the: Moment precious metal investors have been waiting for Birth of a multipolar world order (U.S. is no longer the sole superpower) Start of a very uncertain period for bonds and fiat currency Peak of globalization In short, you no longer have the luxury of relying on the old rules, the old way of thinking. It’s time for a new playbook. Bond Outlook: Murky Since the early 1980s until recently, U.S. Treasury Bonds have been the perfect compliment to stocks. When stocks were doing poorly, bonds did well. And vice versa. Hence why the 60/40 (60% stocks, 40% bonds) was such a popular portfolio model. This relationship is breaking down. As U.S. stocks have been crashing, the value of bonds is also falling. This can be seen in the chart below, which shows the U.S. 10-year Treasury Bond yield (as the value of the bond falls, the yield rises). This chart shows the yield on the 10-year bond year-to-date. See that big spike in yields over the last week? That’s a worrying sign. Investors are selling bonds when they “should” be buying. Scott Bessent’s Treasury Department has about $9 trillion worth of treasuries maturing over the next year. Those bonds and bills will need to be refinanced. If rates are high when these new treasury securities are issued, the government’s interest costs will soar even higher (already over $1 trillion/year). At some point, the Fed will have to get involved. Emergency rate cuts and eventually a massive new round of QE (money printing to buy treasuries) seem inevitable. Who else is going to buy $9 trillion worth of treasuries over the next year? Eventually the Fed may even have to begin “yield curve control”, which means pegging the yield on treasuries at artificially low levels. For example, during and after WW2, when the U.S. was heavily indebted, the Fed froze the 10-year yield at 2.5%, even as inflation raged as high as 14%. The goal was to dramatically lower U.S. debt-to-gdp levels by encouraging inflation and capping yields. Bond holders and savers got hosed. This is known as financial repression. And it could happen again. Yield curve control and financial repression are probably some years out. But I much prefer to keep the “safe” part of my portfolio in gold and silver instead of government bonds. The upside potential is far higher, and taxes can be deferred for decades (until you decide to sell). Gold and Silver: Just Getting Started Rick Rule famously says, “I don’t own gold because I think it’s going to $3,500. I own it because I’m afraid it’s going to $10,000.” This is an excellent way to look at our current situation. This move in gold, which just surpassed $3,200/oz, is a flashing warning signal. The global debt-based monetary system is on the verge of breaking down. And instead of rushing into treasuries as a safe haven, the world’s central banks are increasingly turning to gold. If you want an idea of just how high gold could potentially go, be sure to read Jim Rickards’ $27,000 Gold if you haven’t yet. This is not an arbitrary price target, but the result of Jim’s careful calculation. Of course, Jim doesn’t guarantee we get there, but it should give you an idea of what’s possible. My message here is that if you’re just now thinking about starting a position in gold, you’re not too late. Interest in precious metal miners is just now picking up. One of the largest gold miners, Newmont (NEM), which we highlighted as a buy last week at around $45, soared to $55 today. And don’t get me started about silver, which is still about 35% below its 2011 high of $49.50. Once we break through silver’s $35/oz level, it’ll be off to the races. I’m a buyer of silver here.

It’s time for a new playbook. Bond Outlook: Murky Since the early 1980s until recently, U.S. Treasury Bonds have been the perfect compliment to stocks. When stocks were doing poorly, bonds did well. And vice versa. Hence why the 60/40 (60% stocks, 40% bonds) was such a popular portfolio model. This relationship is breaking down. As U.S. stocks have been crashing, the value of bonds is also falling. This can be seen in the chart below, which shows the U.S. 10-year Treasury Bond yield (as the value of the bond falls, the yield rises). This chart shows the yield on the 10-year bond year-to-date. See that big spike in yields over the last week? That’s a worrying sign. Investors are selling bonds when they “should” be buying. Scott Bessent’s Treasury Department has about $9 trillion worth of treasuries maturing over the next year. Those bonds and bills will need to be refinanced. If rates are high when these new treasury securities are issued, the government’s interest costs will soar even higher (already over $1 trillion/year). At some point, the Fed will have to get involved. Emergency rate cuts and eventually a massive new round of QE (money printing to buy treasuries) seem inevitable. Who else is going to buy $9 trillion worth of treasuries over the next year? Eventually the Fed may even have to begin “yield curve control”, which means pegging the yield on treasuries at artificially low levels. For example, during and after WW2, when the U.S. was heavily indebted, the Fed froze the 10-year yield at 2.5%, even as inflation raged as high as 14%. The goal was to dramatically lower U.S. debt-to-gdp levels by encouraging inflation and capping yields. Bond holders and savers got hosed. This is known as financial repression. And it could happen again. Yield curve control and financial repression are probably some years out. But I much prefer to keep the “safe” part of my portfolio in gold and silver instead of government bonds. The upside potential is far higher, and taxes can be deferred for decades (until you decide to sell). Gold and Silver: Just Getting Started Rick Rule famously says, “I don’t own gold because I think it’s going to $3,500. I own it because I’m afraid it’s going to $10,000.” This is an excellent way to look at our current situation. This move in gold, which just surpassed $3,200/oz, is a flashing warning signal. The global debt-based monetary system is on the verge of breaking down. And instead of rushing into treasuries as a safe haven, the world’s central banks are increasingly turning to gold. If you want an idea of just how high gold could potentially go, be sure to read Jim Rickards’ $27,000 Gold if you haven’t yet. This is not an arbitrary price target, but the result of Jim’s careful calculation. Of course, Jim doesn’t guarantee we get there, but it should give you an idea of what’s possible. My message here is that if you’re just now thinking about starting a position in gold, you’re not too late. Interest in precious metal miners is just now picking up. One of the largest gold miners, Newmont (NEM), which we highlighted as a buy last week at around $45, soared to $55 today. And don’t get me started about silver, which is still about 35% below its 2011 high of $49.50. Once we break through silver’s $35/oz level, it’ll be off to the races. I’m a buyer of silver here. And gold miners still haven’t caught up with the spot price of bullion, so I will look to add there on dips. The vast majority of investors still have almost no exposure to gold, silver, and miners. This will change over the coming years. My advice is to get positioned for the shift now. You are not too late.

When stocks were doing poorly, bonds did well. And vice versa. Hence why the 60/40 (60% stocks, 40% bonds) was such a popular portfolio model. This relationship is breaking down. As U.S. stocks have been crashing, the value of bonds is also falling. This can be seen in the chart below, which shows the U.S. 10-year Treasury Bond yield (as the value of the bond falls, the yield rises). This chart shows the yield on the 10-year bond year-to-date. See that big spike in yields over the last week? That’s a worrying sign. Investors are selling bonds when they “should” be buying. Scott Bessent’s Treasury Department has about $9 trillion worth of treasuries maturing over the next year. Those bonds and bills will need to be refinanced. If rates are high when these new treasury securities are issued, the government’s interest costs will soar even higher (already over $1 trillion/year). At some point, the Fed will have to get involved. Emergency rate cuts and eventually a massive new round of QE (money printing to buy treasuries) seem inevitable. Who else is going to buy $9 trillion worth of treasuries over the next year? Eventually the Fed may even have to begin “yield curve control”, which means pegging the yield on treasuries at artificially low levels. For example, during and after WW2, when the U.S. was heavily indebted, the Fed froze the 10-year yield at 2.5%, even as inflation raged as high as 14%. The goal was to dramatically lower U.S. debt-to-gdp levels by encouraging inflation and capping yields. Bond holders and savers got hosed. This is known as financial repression. And it could happen again. Yield curve control and financial repression are probably some years out. But I much prefer to keep the “safe” part of my portfolio in gold and silver instead of government bonds. The upside potential is far higher, and taxes can be deferred for decades (until you decide to sell). Gold and Silver: Just Getting Started Rick Rule famously says, “I don’t own gold because I think it’s going to $3,500. I own it because I’m afraid it’s going to $10,000.” This is an excellent way to look at our current situation. This move in gold, which just surpassed $3,200/oz, is a flashing warning signal. The global debt-based monetary system is on the verge of breaking down. And instead of rushing into treasuries as a safe haven, the world’s central banks are increasingly turning to gold. If you want an idea of just how high gold could potentially go, be sure to read Jim Rickards’ $27,000 Gold if you haven’t yet. This is not an arbitrary price target, but the result of Jim’s careful calculation. Of course, Jim doesn’t guarantee we get there, but it should give you an idea of what’s possible. My message here is that if you’re just now thinking about starting a position in gold, you’re not too late. Interest in precious metal miners is just now picking up. One of the largest gold miners, Newmont (NEM), which we highlighted as a buy last week at around $45, soared to $55 today. And don’t get me started about silver, which is still about 35% below its 2011 high of $49.50. Once we break through silver’s $35/oz level, it’ll be off to the races. I’m a buyer of silver here. And gold miners still haven’t caught up with the spot price of bullion, so I will look to add there on dips. The vast majority of investors still have almost no exposure to gold, silver, and miners. This will change over the coming years. My advice is to get positioned for the shift now. You are not too late.

That’s a worrying sign. Investors are selling bonds when they “should” be buying. Scott Bessent’s Treasury Department has about $9 trillion worth of treasuries maturing over the next year. Those bonds and bills will need to be refinanced. If rates are high when these new treasury securities are issued, the government’s interest costs will soar even higher (already over $1 trillion/year). At some point, the Fed will have to get involved. Emergency rate cuts and eventually a massive new round of QE (money printing to buy treasuries) seem inevitable. Who else is going to buy $9 trillion worth of treasuries over the next year? Eventually the Fed may even have to begin “yield curve control”, which means pegging the yield on treasuries at artificially low levels. For example, during and after WW2, when the U.S. was heavily indebted, the Fed froze the 10-year yield at 2.5%, even as inflation raged as high as 14%. The goal was to dramatically lower U.S. debt-to-gdp levels by encouraging inflation and capping yields. Bond holders and savers got hosed. This is known as financial repression. And it could happen again. Yield curve control and financial repression are probably some years out. But I much prefer to keep the “safe” part of my portfolio in gold and silver instead of government bonds. The upside potential is far higher, and taxes can be deferred for decades (until you decide to sell).

Emergency rate cuts and eventually a massive new round of QE (money printing to buy treasuries) seem inevitable. Who else is going to buy $9 trillion worth of treasuries over the next year? Eventually the Fed may even have to begin “yield curve control”, which means pegging the yield on treasuries at artificially low levels. For example, during and after WW2, when the U.S. was heavily indebted, the Fed froze the 10-year yield at 2.5%, even as inflation raged as high as 14%. The goal was to dramatically lower U.S. debt-to-gdp levels by encouraging inflation and capping yields. Bond holders and savers got hosed. This is known as financial repression. And it could happen again. Yield curve control and financial repression are probably some years out. But I much prefer to keep the “safe” part of my portfolio in gold and silver instead of government bonds. The upside potential is far higher, and taxes can be deferred for decades (until you decide to sell). Gold and Silver: Just Getting Started Rick Rule famously says, “I don’t own gold because I think it’s going to $3,500. I own it because I’m afraid it’s going to $10,000.” This is an excellent way to look at our current situation. This move in gold, which just surpassed $3,200/oz, is a flashing warning signal. The global debt-based monetary system is on the verge of breaking down. And instead of rushing into treasuries as a safe haven, the world’s central banks are increasingly turning to gold. If you want an idea of just how high gold could potentially go, be sure to read Jim Rickards’ $27,000 Gold if you haven’t yet. This is not an arbitrary price target, but the result of Jim’s careful calculation. Of course, Jim doesn’t guarantee we get there, but it should give you an idea of what’s possible. My message here is that if you’re just now thinking about starting a position in gold, you’re not too late. Interest in precious metal miners is just now picking up. One of the largest gold miners, Newmont (NEM), which we highlighted as a buy last week at around $45, soared to $55 today. And don’t get me started about silver, which is still about 35% below its 2011 high of $49.50. Once we break through silver’s $35/oz level, it’ll be off to the races. I’m a buyer of silver here. And gold miners still haven’t caught up with the spot price of bullion, so I will look to add there on dips. The vast majority of investors still have almost no exposure to gold, silver, and miners. This will change over the coming years. My advice is to get positioned for the shift now. You are not too late.

But I much prefer to keep the “safe” part of my portfolio in gold and silver instead of government bonds. The upside potential is far higher, and taxes can be deferred for decades (until you decide to sell). Gold and Silver: Just Getting Started Rick Rule famously says, “I don’t own gold because I think it’s going to $3,500. I own it because I’m afraid it’s going to $10,000.” This is an excellent way to look at our current situation. This move in gold, which just surpassed $3,200/oz, is a flashing warning signal. The global debt-based monetary system is on the verge of breaking down. And instead of rushing into treasuries as a safe haven, the world’s central banks are increasingly turning to gold. If you want an idea of just how high gold could potentially go, be sure to read Jim Rickards’ $27,000 Gold if you haven’t yet. This is not an arbitrary price target, but the result of Jim’s careful calculation. Of course, Jim doesn’t guarantee we get there, but it should give you an idea of what’s possible. My message here is that if you’re just now thinking about starting a position in gold, you’re not too late. Interest in precious metal miners is just now picking up. One of the largest gold miners, Newmont (NEM), which we highlighted as a buy last week at around $45, soared to $55 today. And don’t get me started about silver, which is still about 35% below its 2011 high of $49.50. Once we break through silver’s $35/oz level, it’ll be off to the races. I’m a buyer of silver here. And gold miners still haven’t caught up with the spot price of bullion, so I will look to add there on dips. The vast majority of investors still have almost no exposure to gold, silver, and miners. This will change over the coming years. My advice is to get positioned for the shift now. You are not too late.

This is important because, for every basis point (0.01%) decrease in the interest rate, the cost of servicing the debt falls by $1 billion per day. Instead, because Congress can't control themselves and spending, money is flowing into precious metals. Not good, as those are not productive uses of capital. Solution: restore confidence in the dollar, which means Congress has got to stop bingeing on debt spending.

This move in gold, which just surpassed $3,200/oz, is a flashing warning signal. The global debt-based monetary system is on the verge of breaking down. And instead of rushing into treasuries as a safe haven, the world’s central banks are increasingly turning to gold. If you want an idea of just how high gold could potentially go, be sure to read Jim Rickards’ $27,000 Gold if you haven’t yet. This is not an arbitrary price target, but the result of Jim’s careful calculation. Of course, Jim doesn’t guarantee we get there, but it should give you an idea of what’s possible. My message here is that if you’re just now thinking about starting a position in gold, you’re not too late. Interest in precious metal miners is just now picking up. One of the largest gold miners, Newmont (NEM), which we highlighted as a buy last week at around $45, soared to $55 today. And don’t get me started about silver, which is still about 35% below its 2011 high of $49.50. Once we break through silver’s $35/oz level, it’ll be off to the races. I’m a buyer of silver here. And gold miners still haven’t caught up with the spot price of bullion, so I will look to add there on dips. The vast majority of investors still have almost no exposure to gold, silver, and miners. This will change over the coming years. My advice is to get positioned for the shift now. You are not too late.

Normally, risk in the equities markets drives dollars into Treasuries. The result is normally a downward move in interest rates. This is important because, for every basis point (0.01%) decrease in the interest rate, the cost of servicing the debt falls by $1 billion per day. Instead, because Congress can't control themselves and spending, money is flowing into precious metals. Not good, as those are not productive uses of capital. Solution: restore confidence in the dollar, which means Congress has got to stop bingeing on debt spending. Elon is doing that, but the GOP has failed miserably in educating the public what's going on. And to those idiots who thought a smaller gov't didn't mean firing public employees, grow up. The GOP should be tarred and feathered for the piss-poor job they've done explaining how short run pinches now means no amputations in the long run. 20 posted on 04/12/2025 7:17:34 AM PDT by econjack [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-29 next last Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

Interest in precious metal miners is just now picking up. One of the largest gold miners, Newmont (NEM), which we highlighted as a buy last week at around $45, soared to $55 today. And don’t get me started about silver, which is still about 35% below its 2011 high of $49.50. Once we break through silver’s $35/oz level, it’ll be off to the races. I’m a buyer of silver here. And gold miners still haven’t caught up with the spot price of bullion, so I will look to add there on dips. The vast majority of investors still have almost no exposure to gold, silver, and miners.

Normally, risk in the equities markets drives dollars into Treasuries. The result is normally a downward move in interest rates. This is important because, for every basis point (0.01%) decrease in the interest rate, the cost of servicing the debt falls by $1 billion per day. Instead, because Congress can't control themselves and spending, money is flowing into precious metals. Not good, as those are not productive uses of capital. Solution: restore confidence in the dollar, which means Congress has got to stop bingeing on debt spending. Elon is doing that, but the GOP has failed miserably in educating the public what's going on. And to those idiots who thought a smaller gov't didn't mean firing public employees, grow up. The GOP should be tarred and feathered for the piss-poor job they've done explaining how short run pinches now means no amputations in the long run. 20 posted on 04/12/2025 7:17:34 AM PDT by econjack [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-29 next last Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

April 11, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, April 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, is investigating potential claims against CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD) on behalf of long-term stockholders following a class action complaint that was filed against CrowdStrike on July 30, 2024 with a Class Period from November 29, 2023 to July 29, 2024. Our investigation concerns whether the board of directors of CrowdStrike have breached their fiduciary duties to the company. CrowdStrike is a global cybersecurity company that provides software that helps prevent data breaches. According to the complaint, CrowdStrike’s main product is the Falcon software platform, which purportedly uses artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to detect, prevent, and respond to security breach threats. The CrowdStrike class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) CrowdStrike had instituted deficient controls in its procedure for updating Falcon and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (ii) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of CrowdStrike’s customers; and (iii) such outages could pose, and in fact ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to CrowdStrike. The CrowdStrike class action lawsuit further alleges that on July 19, 2024, news broke that a flawed Falcon content update caused major worldwide technology outages for millions of devices running Microsoft Windows. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell more than 11%, according to the complaint. Then, on July 22, 2024, the CrowdStrike class action lawsuit further alleges that Congress called on CrowdStrike CEO, defendant George Kurtz, to testify regarding the crisis and CrowdStrike’s stock rating was downgraded by analysts such as Guggenheim and BTIG. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell more than 13%, according to the complaint. Finally, on July 29, 2024, news outlets reported that Delta Air Lines had hired prominent attorney David Boies to seek damages from CrowdStrike following the software outage, according to the complaint. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell nearly 10%, according to the CrowdStrike class action lawsuit.
