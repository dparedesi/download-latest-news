ByBrett Owens ByBrett Owens, Contributor. Dark orange glowing wireframe bull on stock market diagram background Let‚Äôs invest like private equity pros without needing seven figures. Yes, that‚Äôs right‚ÄîPE-style starting for as little as $8. Plus, yields up to nearly 13%. No special access or options trades needed. Just a few clicks through our brokerage accounts buying regular ol‚Äô tickers. The sneaky dividend-dishing subjects? Meet business development companies (BDCs), publicly-traded firms that lend to small businesses. BDCs were invented by Congress years ago to create a new type of lender to small businesses. They were also given the same mandate as real estate investment trusts (REITs): Return at least 90% of taxable income back to shareholders in the form of dividends. And man, do they pay or what? BDC Yields Let‚Äôs dive into three compelling BDCs that not only dish big dividends but also trade for less than the sum of their parts. BlackRock TCP Capital Corp. (TCPC) is a middle-market lender that favors middle-market companies with enterprise values of between $100 million and $1.5 billion. It has a fairly diverse portfolio of 146 companies across several ‚Äúless-cyclical‚Äù industries. TCPC‚Äôs investment mix is heaviest in first-lien debt, at 83% of the portfolio; second-lien debt is another 7%, and 10% of its deals (at fair value) are in equity. The vast majority of its debt (94%) is floating-rate in nature, which is typical for many BDCs. That has its upsides and downsides. In a normal rising-rate environment (think 2015-19, not 2022-23), rising rates are generally good for BDCs that work heavily with floating-rate debt. The potential for declining rates (or actually declining rates)? Not so good. Also, as one might have guessed, TCPC has a connection to BlackRock (BLK)‚Äîspecifically, it‚Äôs externally managed by an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of BlackRock (BLK). This connection allows it to access BlackRock‚Äôs many resources, which in theory should make it a particularly competitive BDC. TCPC Total Returns I warned in November 2024 that BlackRock TCPC keeping its base dividend flat for a fifth consecutive quarter raised ‚Äúa little concern that TCPC‚Äôs dividend might be plateauing.‚Äù Three months later, the BDC pulled the rug out from under its investors with a drastic dividend cut. That‚Äôs despite a practice of pairing its base dividend with special dividends as profits allow. BlackRock TCPC‚Äôs declines have opened up a generous 13% discount to NAV. And even with the reduced 25-cent-per-share base dividend (and an already announced 4-cent special dividend for Q1), the stock still yields a sky-high 13%. But TCPC hasn‚Äôt exactly fixed what got it here. The dividend is more affordable, and the company‚Äôs adviser is waiving a third of its fee through Q3. But it‚Äôs still thick in non-accruals (loans that are delinquent for a prolonged period, usually 90 days), which even after improving this past quarter sit at an elevated 12.6% and 4.4% of the portfolio at cost and at fair value, respectively. Crescent Capital BDC (CCAP) is another BDC that‚Äôs paired with (and enjoys the resources of) a larger investment company. Crescent Capital BDC is tied to global credit investment firm Crescent Capital Group, which itself specializes in below-investment-grade credit strategies. CCAP currently invests in 191 portfolio companies, with a penchant for private middle market companies. It‚Äôs predominantly U.S.-focused, though it does have 9% portfolio exposure to Europe and a thin 2% exposure to Australian companies. It‚Äôs similar to TCPC in that it primarily deals in first-lien debt (91%), and the vast majority (97%) is floating-rate in nature. The last time I looked at CCAP, I mentioned that it has quite the oddball dividend history: I‚Äôm afraid the dividend picture hasn‚Äôt become any less complicated since then. Crescent Capital has kept up with its 42-cent-per-share base dividend. But the action in its special dividends has changed. The variable supplemental dividends, which had been around for six quarters, disappeared at the start of this year. At the same time, CCAP announced 5-cent specials for the first, second, and third quarters‚Äîbut they‚Äôre related to undistributed taxable income. So while it looks like CCAP‚Äôs variable supplemental has just gotten a little smaller, in reality, it‚Äôs not paying any supplementals (or, at least, it hasn‚Äôt for the past two quarters). Those supplementals might not return for some time, either. Wall Street is increasingly worried about rate compression among BDCs, for one. CCAP itself, meanwhile, is running into increasing credit issues, a spate of new non-accruals, and the winding-down of the Logan joint venture, which was providing CCAP with some cash flows. At least investors are being realistic about Crescent Capital‚Äôs dimming prospects of late, driving shares down to a wild 23% discount to NAV. This normally defensively positioned BDC hardly looks like the pinnacle of health right now, but a discount that deep (plus an 11% yield on the base dividend alone) could attract some bargain hunters. I‚Äôll start with PennantPark Floating Rate Capital (PFLT), which targets midsized companies that are ‚Äúprofitable, growing and cash-flowing,‚Äù with a specific focus on firms that generate $10 million to $50 million in annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). Currently, PFLT‚Äôs portfolio is 190 companies wide, and those 190 companies are supported by roughly 110 private equity sponsors. And while some BDCs are happy to invest in a wide variety of companies, ‚Äúvalue-added‚Äù BDCs that lend expertise tend to be more selective. In this case, PennantPark Floating Rate‚Äôs interests lie in five primary categories: health care, software and technology, consumer, business services and government services. Most important, however, is what gives PennantPark Floating Rate Capital its name. While BDCs often deal with floating-rate first-lien debt, PFLT takes it to the max: About 90% of the portfolio is first-lien debt, virtually all of which is floating-rate in nature. (The remaining 10% is split 80/20 between equity co-investments and joint venture equity.) As I mentioned before, the Fed‚Äôs flattening and eventual reduction in interest rates took a toll on many BDCs. PFLT Total Returns PFLT trades at a 6% discount to NAV; that‚Äôs nice, but it almost feels like an optimistic valuation given the uncertainty facing the rate environment and PennantPark right now. On the upside, PFLT is actually a monthly dividend payer, and a generous one, too, at nearly 12%. On the downside, coverage of that dividend is getting awfully tight. In fiscal 2024 (its year ends in September), PFLT paid $1.23 per share on net interest income of $1.27 per share (a 97% NII payout ratio), generated from profits of $1.18 per share. It‚Äôs expected to earn $1.21 per share and $1.18 per share over the next two years, and we can reasonably expect NII to be proportional. That‚Äôs OK (not great) if all goes well, but a lot hinges on what the Federal Reserve does next‚Äîan open question. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Farewell to the 'Mad Men' era: Advertising's biggest bash of the year will showcase the industry's seismic changes
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/cannes-lions-2025-what-to-expect-amid-agency-upheaval-ai-2025-6
Time Published: 2025-06-15T14:00:01Z
Full Content:
Advertising executives descending on the French Riviera this week for the annual Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity will raise their glasses of ros√© to toast the twilight of Madison Avenue's glory days. Tom Denford, CEO of the agency search consultancy ID Comms, told me this year's Cannes Lions would be "like a requiem" for the traditional agency business. But that doesn't mean there won't be action. What began as an awards event in the 1950s to celebrate the best ads of the year ‚Äî affectionately known as "The Work" ‚Äî has morphed into a sprawling showcase of tech, entertainment, influencers, and every intermediary you can imagine. In recent years, Cannes has featured huge beach takeovers and custom-made event structures from the likes of Amazon, Google, and Meta. The agencies and marketers in attendance are grappling with multiple tectonic shifts all happening at once ‚Äî from the rise of artificial intelligence to the decline of linear TV, and seemingly never-ending economic uncertainty that makes marketers nervous about long-term budget planning. WPP Media recently cut its 2025 global ad spending growth forecast to 6% from 7.7%, citing "disruptions to global trade and continued deglobalization." While Agencyland's creative class may be nostalgic for the era of showstopping Don Draper-esque pitches, and when cinematic ads won the biggest awards, the industry has shifted its offerings to service clients' changing needs. Retail media isn't the sexy pursuit many executive creative directors dreamed about breaking into the industry for, but it's having a moment. According to the World Advertising Research Center, spending on commerce websites, apps, and in-store displays is projected to overtake linear TV ad spending by 2026. Cannes Lions has introduced a dedicated subcategory for retail media in both its Media and Creative Commerce Lions awards this year. Albertsons is among the companies making its festival debut this week. The supermarket chain is bringing a grocery store activation to the beach and a team of seven people from its Media Collection retail media division. Jen Saenz, Albertsons' EVP and chief commercial officer, said the aim is to showcase what's unique about the grocer's offering for advertisers: "Not just transactions, but brand stories." There have been multiple changes of the guard at the largest ad agency holding companies. Omnicom and IPG are awaiting the closing of their gigantic merger that would create the world's largest advertising agency company by revenue, usurping Publicis, which had only recently toppled WPP's crown. Two of the industry's most high-profile execs ‚Äî Mark Read, CEO of WPP, and famed ad man David Droga, from Accenture Song ‚Äî have announced their coming departures. Layoffs have been a sad constant for the rank and file as agencies consolidate. When I asked one ad agency veteran how they envisaged the scene at Cannes this year, they responded: "Type into ChatGPT: Agency exec sitting on corner of the Croisette with cardboard sign around neck saying: Will do creative or plan media for food.'" New independent agencies and big consulting firms are gaining on the traditional holding companies. Industry analyst Brian Wieser recently estimated that the "big six" agency holding companies now have a 30% share of the total US ad agency industry, down from a peak of around 40% in 2015. It's a trend that will be on full display at Cannes Lions next week. Stagwell, the agency group led by former Microsoft strategist and advisor to the Clintons, Mark Penn, is back again with its huge "Sports Beach" activation. It will feature sessions from famed athletes like former world tennis No. 1 Billie Jean King and former NBA legend Carmelo Anthony, as well as activities like a swim club and pickleball tournaments. Accenture Song has a catamaran docked in the harbor to host meetings and has execs speaking onstage at the Palais, where the main conference takes place. Brian Morrissey, the former editor in chief of marketing and media trade publication Digiday, who now writes the media newsletter The Rebooting, has invented a new parlor game for Cannes. He's going to ask everyone he meets to name their favorite ad campaign of the past 12 months. His guess is that most attendees will struggle to instantly conjure one up, despite the fact that advertising is their profession. Morrissey said it's a reflection of the fading relevance in culture of mass media and the 30-second ad spot, as consumer media habits evolve and marketing budgets shift to precision-targeting and performance-marketing. "All the action has moved to the data side of advertising," Morrissey said. (Disclosure: I previously worked for Morrissey at Digiday.) Cannes will remain a decadent affair in 2025, much to the chagrin of the many colleagues back at home who didn't get a golden ticket. (The most expensive pass stretches to more than $12,000 this year ‚Äî and that's before factoring in travel and accommodation.) Set on the iconic Croisette promenade with its opulent hotels and stunning sea views, some lucky VIPs will be treated to yacht excursions and performances from musical acts including Cardi B, Ludacris, Lola Young, and Diplo. The real A-Listers at Cannes Lions, though, are the chief marketing officers with budgets to spend. Cannes Lions CEO Simon Cook said that more than 350 brands attended last year, and that's expected to rise this year. David Jones, CEO of the Brandtech Group, has some handy advice for marketers who will undoubtedly receive numerous AI sales pitches this coming week. "When someone shows you something great, ask for a login; ask if you can make content and produce it and publish it now to TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube," Jones said. "If you can, they have a platform, and if you can't, they have a demo." Where Big Tech secrets go public ‚Äî unfiltered in your inbox weekly.

Larry Ellison's net worth rose by $66.8 billion to hit its level of $258.8 billion last week, compared to its $192 billion levels mentioned in the World's Billionaires List for 2025.

Title: Real-Life N.Y.C. Matchmaker Critiques Dakota Johnson's 'Materialists' (Exclusive)
URL: https://people.com/real-life-matchmaker-reacts-materialists-portrayal-exclusive-11753402
Time Published: 2025-06-15T13:14:48Z
Full Content:
Atsushi Nishijima/A24 In Materialists, Dakota Johnson plays Lucy, a successful Manhattan matchmaker to the wealthy who's become cynical about true love and marriage in her own life. A love triangle soon forms, with Pedro Pascal and Chris Evans up for grabs, but the film stays mostly interested in analyzing matchmaking and modern dating: Can one find a lasting connection by checking boxes and aligning algorithms? Maria Avgitidis, a fourth-generation professional matchmaker based in New York City, saw Materialists ‚Äî and she has strong views on its portrayal of her industry. "I don't see myself in this," Avgitidis tells PEOPLE. "I was trying to warn some matchmakers: 'I know you're about to throw a whole movie screening for this. Tread carefully.' I don't know what else to tell you." Writer-director Celine Song, who earned an Oscar nomination for her 2023 romantic drama Past Lives, got the inspiration for Materialists from the six months she spent 10 years ago working at Tawkify, a large-scale matchmaking service. "I feel like I learned more in those six months about people than I learned from any other period of my life," Song said in notes shared with press, comparing the work she did at the time to being a "stock market trader." Jolene Siana; Macmillan "The things that are in the movie came from the truth I learned: that there is a very funny, very dark objectification of each other's humanity, and therefore a very real commodification of each other, as we go through this thing that we call dating,‚Äù she added. "But it's supposed to be in pursuit of love." Avgitidis runs a boutique matchmaking company called Agape that takes on about 15 clients at any given time, and she estimates to have secured "thousands" of marriages over the course of her career. Here, Avgitidis ‚Äî also the author of the new book Ask a Matchmaker: Matchmaker Maria's No-Nonsense Guide to Finding Love ‚Äî breaks down some of the things Materialists gets right and wrong about real-life matchmaking. Warning: Materialist spoilers ahead! Atsushi Nishijima PEOPLE: Dakota Johnson's character Lucy says early in the film that she makes $80,000 per year as a New York City matchmaker. Does that sound right? MARIA AVGITIDIS: Yeah, that's pretty accurate as it pertains to employees of a matchmaking service. Lucy is shown handing out business cards to strangers, hoping to find more clients to set up. Is that a common tactic? Maybe that happened before 2008, but... I let people come to me. There is a stigma with matchmakers that only desperate people will use them, and that's not true. I have always taken the inbound marketing approach. Even before social media, I was out at bars and I would use the Foursquare app and I called myself Matchmaker Maria, so people knew "there's a matchmaker in the room, let me go talk to her." But that chasing someone down on the street, that's not something that I've ever done. I do know certain matchmakers do it. And they do it on LinkedIn. Is the matchmaking service's office setup realistic? Do colleagues celebrate a successful coupling with cake and a party? That's movie world. My office was in the Empire State Building on the 59th floor for years. We left it during the pandemic. None of our clients now want to meet us in the office; they'll want to meet us out or mostly over Zoom. [Lucy is] at a public cafe. That's crazy to have those really personal conversations at a public cafe. That's not something I would do in 2025. When she gets the cake, that to me is so hilarious because between my matchmaking and my dating advice, I have thousands of weddings under my belt, and it's like you're celebrating your ninth wedding, which I think is amazing. But I've never thought to get a cake. In my office, they do a little shimmy dance and then we go back to the next client. Do you often get invited to clients' weddings, like Lucy does in the film? She's even shown having a one-on-one with a bride-to-be having cold feet. I'm so far away from that first date to when they finally get married. Some of them even kind of forget how they met. I've been invited to weddings. I've attended maybe two. But I'm not saving anyone's day. I'm not in the wedding party. I acknowledge that I'm extremely far away from the day they go down the aisle. I am not even part of that conversation. I've been invited to many weddings. I used to hang the wedding invitations in my office. But I've only been to two because I felt like I had a connection with that person that would warrant me to go. Does there ever become blurred lines where clients become friends? It's always professional. I also have to respect my own boundaries ‚Äî I have other people that need me in my personal time, despite me being a professional in the personal space. Still, I've set up, I think, now over 7,000 first dates. I am stressed out most nights between 7 and 9 p.m. because I think about, "Oh my God, my client's on a date right now." Are the types of clients shown in the film similar to who you have worked with? It was 50% accurate, in the sense that there are people that have extreme dating fatigue and they're just like, "Look, I've waited this long, just find me the person," so they'll come with those lists. But then there's the other clients. Like 80% of my clients are busy New Yorkers who just don't have time to participate in modern dating on apps. So a lot of my clients might work at Goldman or BlackRock or they might be entrepreneurs or business owners or exactly like Pedro Pascal's character. They're just doing stuff and they're not online and they're the kind of people that would hire us, just like they would hire a personal trainer or a personal chef, they're also going to hire a matchmaker to help them with this. Atsushi Nishijima/A24 In the film, one of Lucy's clients is sexually assaulted while on an arranged first date. When Lucy finds out, her boss makes it seem like this is somewhat of a common occurrence. Does this happen often? I've never had that happen. I've had to fire clients for being bad on dates two times in my 17-year career, but they were able to admit, "You know what, Maria? Yeah, that was really inappropriate behavior." But it was not sexual assault. I did ask three colleagues, "Have you ever heard this happening to another person?" They're like, "No." I'm sure it happens. In dating, it happens. I want to believe that there's no assault or abuse in this. People are their own people. I understand what the employer's trying to say, but at the same time it was just kind of presented as a normal thing. I just want you to know that if that had actually happened, it would be‚Äî The industry has a monthly call as part of our trade association. This would be a thing that we would be discussing and having presentations over of how do we prevent this from happening again and what can we do to be a strong resource for the person who got assaulted? They would talk about the lawyers. This would be a thing. And I'm pretty sure at our next trade association meeting in July, this is what's going to be talked about. Could a matchmaking service be held liable, with lawyers getting involved like in the movie? I don't blame Lucy for that woman getting assaulted. Even in a matchmaking contract, if that happened, I'm not liable because you also have to take some personal responsibility of what happens on a date. You still have to show up to the date location that we told you and then you have to run home like you're Cinderella. I don't want anyone making out or having sex on a first date because that would make me a wildly different service. So this is a communication that you have to have with as a client and a potential match. "Here's how it works: You're going on the date, the following morning, 8 a.m. there's a feedback email in your inbox. You have to tell us how it went and I'm going to hear from both parties so I can know what to do next." I think my brain melted, that [the sexual assault storyline] was the main plot point of the movie. I'm like, "Oh, this is not a romantic comedy." I was like, "This needs a trigger warning." For me, watching this as a matchmaker employer, I was just thinking about the liability. I went home thinking, "Do I need to get liability insurance? What is this?" After Lucy learns about the assault, she gets emotional and runs to the bathroom with her notebook and looks at what she jotted down about the man. What did you make of that scene? It looks like there's only three sentences written. I remember thinking these are really superficial things to write about someone, like their age, what age range they want to date in. I don't know if she even wrote down his religion or any values or interests. Just two sentences were scribbled out. When we meet matches for our clients, that's at least a one-hour conversation, and we write essays. We ask questions to get to know our client in a more granular level because at the end of the day when we set up our clients, yes, the numbers are there ‚Äî that's the easy s---. That's the quantifiable stuff. That's the drop-down menu that you selected. The vetting process as a matchmaker is a hard one. We want to make sure that you align on your communication patterns, on your values, on your long-term goals. When I saw those three sentences, my immediate thought as a person who employs matchmakers was, "This is a fireable offense." Like, immediate fireable offense. I've fired employees for less. There is this sort of accountability that happens with a matchmaker. So I see that paper, I see that she's only written three sentences, and my thought as an employer is, "You didn't get to know the person you set your client up with." That scene was, I think, the most pivotal. I was just like, "Wow, you didn't do your job. You set up this person with a stranger." Atsushi Nishijima/A24 What are Lucy's other fireable offenses that wouldn't fly in the real world? Perhaps personally seeking out the former client who was assaulted to speak about it? There's another one. Now you've gotten lawyers involved and you've decided to put on a trench coat‚Äî that was the dumbest thing by the way. She'll have a trench coat on, so now I can stalk you in the West Village or wherever that was. She's stalking her and she's running over to her, and I'm just like, oh my God. The lawsuit! Lucy is depicted as cynical, becoming jaded and rethinking her future as a matchmaker. Does that happen frequently with people getting into this line of work? If you're not a matchmaker for at least 18 months, you're not a matchmaker because there is burnout in this industry, and you will see that 18-month mark is a real thing. You need emotional bandwidth to deal with people's personal pickiness, personal wish list, personal delusion. I mean, that's all of us. We all have it. It's easy to take people's money; it's really hard to service them. Look, there are people who quit. There have been moments, especially in the last three months for me, where I'm like, "This client is driving me crazy. He's become so picky. He's hired four other services at the same time and I just don't know how I'm going to meet this expectation." Is it typical for a matchmaker to be so concerned with numbers and compatibility probabilities? I would think they're passionate about the concept of true love. I believe that a lot of matchmakers, if not almost all matchmakers I've ever met, really do believe in love. They're at that wedding [at the end] and she goes on this monologue about how in two years they'll be resentful of each other and eventually they'll divorce. I'm like, you're in the wrong industry, babe. Go become a life coach. You have to meet people where they're at. All you can do is cheerlead for them throughout the way. That's it. All you can do is root for them. You can't make promises that you're going to get married. It's not possible to do that. That was insane that she was doing that. All you can do is hope that they have a better dating experience with you than they have had on their own. What's something you want moviegoers who see Materialists to know about matchmaking? I've always said that should you decide you want to hire a matchmaker, just remember that your first match has to be with your matchmaker and that there are different matchmakers for different kinds of people. Most matchmakers have their own niche. Ask them about their methodology of how they find matches. It can't just be off the street as a matchmaker. I'm a fourth-generation matchmaker, and the one thing that really great matchmakers know how to do is build community, because that's what's going to find the matches, right? I didn't realize [Materialists] was going to talk so much about matchmaking, but if they were, it would've been nice to see the matchmaker as the community-builder, because that is what my grandmother and great-grandmother and great-great-grandmother were. They were community builders in war-torn countries who still were able to match people. Even now people are experiencing dating fatigue. A matchmaker is still there to build the community for you to gain access to. That's what it is. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity. Materialists is in theaters now.

The fund has been one of the great investment success stories, cracking $70 billion in assets under management in just 341 days, faster than any of the thousands of funds in the ETF industry's 32-year history. IBIT's popularity reflects not only of the $11.6 trillion asset management giant's brand strength but also the growing embrace by once crypto shy investment advisors and other institutions. "The fact that you have advisors and institutions adopting it (crypto ETFs) this quickly is a good sign," Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas told Decrypt. "These are bigger fish that don't bite quickly. Usually, it takes years for them to get interested in an ETF, because it means liquidity. These are some of the hardest investors to attract." Balchunas added: "Advisors and institutions, they're just more sophisticated." Nice look at the breakdown of holders of the spot bitcoin ETFs via 13F filings. Advisor has surged up the list now #1 by a mile. These 13F filers make up 20% of total assets, but IMO that is likely to rise to 35-40% as more adoption comes (esp from wirehouses) via @JSeyff pic.twitter.com/JgxM4zmaex ‚Äî Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) June 4, 2025 A Bloomberg Intelligence report earlier this month found that investment advisors filing 13-F reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission hold about 20% of the spot Bitcoin ETF shares‚Äìroughly $21 billion of the asset‚Äîand Balchunas says the percentage is likely to double in the next year. Advisor' holdings in the asset, which have grown dramatically, rank number one "by a mile," with hedge fund managers and brokerages falling in behind, Balchunas noted in a June 9 X post. Balchunas said that roughly 1,200 13-F filers held IBIT shares. "That's insane," he told Decrypt. The growth has come as the Trump administration has loosened regulation and introduced more crypto friendly policies, sparking sizable price gains in BTC and major altcoins. Bitcoin was recently trading near $105,000, a 12% gain year-to-date that has far outstripped equity indexes and most other risk-on assets‚Äìa reality not lost on investors whose appetite for digital assets and products based on them has mushroomed. Financial advisor interest in crypto ETFs, as a result, has heated up. A study of financial advisors released in January by crypto-focused asset manager Bitwise and financial services data provider VettaFi found that nearly one in five advisors were planning to allocate crypto to investor accounts in 2025, double the percentage in the previous year, and that nearly all of the 400 advisors surveyed said they had received a question about crypto over that period. Ric Edelman, a long-time financial advisor and founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, a trade group, told Decrypt that the friendlier political environment for digital assets and advisors' determination to learn more about them are behind the trend. "You can't recommend something you don't know anything about," Edelman said. "Advisors are racing to increase their knowledge so they can provide reasonable advice to the client that's in the client's best interest. Simultaneously, firms recognize that this is a huge opportunity to increase their AUM, because clients are going to buy Bitcoin‚Äîand if they're not going to be able to buy it from the firm, they're going to go buy it somewhere else." At a conference last week, Edelman called for advisors to allot a minimum of 10% in digital assets for cautious portfolios and as much as 40% for more enterprising accounts, a departure from traditional 60-40 splits in stocks and bonds, and an increase from his previous recommendation that investors should allocate single digits to crypto. "The allocation model you're familiar with‚Äîstocks and bonds‚Äîmust now be replaced by one featuring stocks, crypto, and bonds," Edelman told an audience of independent financial advisors at the VISION event in Arlington, Texas. Edelman told Decrypt that IBIT's ranking for AUM well atop the other 10 funds in the spot Bitcoin category stems from brand recognition. "When institutional investors engage for the first time, it is the path of least resistance for approval by the board and the C-suite," he said. "If you're going to engage in an investment in a new asset class that most have limited experience or knowledge about, you can diffuse some of the concerns by choosing one of the best known brands, and that's BlackRock. BlackRock is the beneficiary of its brand." ETF.com Senior Analyst Sumit Roy also expects the momentum of crypto funds to grow as investors seek exposure to digital assets without the risk and responsibility of holding them directly. "More adventurous investors have been able to get exposure through crypto trading platforms like Coinbase and OTC vehicles like GBTC (prior to its ETF conversion) for a long time," Roy said. "Advisors and institutions have been much slower to adopt crypto given the risks and lack of regulatory protections." "Now with regulated ETFs," he added, "those professionals are entering the space and I'd expect them to continue to march slowly into these funds."

Title: Concentrated Stock Positions: Compounding Versus Risk

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger used concentrated stock positions to compound wealth. The methods ... More behind the strategy are examined along with data on the risks. (Photo credit should read JOHANNES EISELE/AFP via Getty Images) Charlie‚Äôs portfolio was concentrated in very few securities and therefore his record was much more volatile but it was based on the same discount-from-value approach. He was willing to accept greater peaks and valleys of performance, and he happens to be a fellow whose whole psyche goes toward concentration, with the results shown. ‚Äì Warren Buffett discussing Charlie Munger‚Äôs investment process in Damn Right! by Janet Lowe Berkshire Hathaway‚Äôs (BRK/A, BRK/B) Warren Buffett and his late partner Charlie Munger are considered the greatest investment duo of all time. Munger‚Äôs investment strategy tended to be very concentrated, with the Daily Journal Corporation (DJCO) portfolio that he controlled typically having only four or five central holdings. Even Berkshire‚Äôs $259 billion publicly traded stock portfolio consists of only 36 stocks, with 71% of the portfolio value in the top five holdings. A study by Antti Petajisto examined the long-term performance of concentrated stock positions, noting that these positions tend to underperform and add risk to portfolios. This article will discuss the evidence and its implications for taxes, taking into account this information. In addition, some solutions will be reviewed. Some stock market math is needed to help put the underperformance data in its proper context. According to a paper by Hendrik Bessembinder recently examining the returns on 29,078 US stocks from 1926 through 2023, over half of all stocks, 51.6% to be precise, had negative cumulative returns. How can there be all these losing stocks when the S&P 500 has an annualized return of 9.8% from 1928 to 2023? The complex answer is that stock returns have strong positive skewness. However, a simple example of long-term positive compound returns provides a more easily digestible answer. Take a portfolio of just two stocks selling for $100 per share. The first stock grows at a 9.8% annualized rate, while the second stock declines at a 9.8% annualized rate over thirty years. One would think that our total portfolio would stagnate during that period, as the losses in one stock would offset the gains in the other, but compound returns make our intuition incorrect. The exponential return on our positively performing company outweighs that of the loser. This portfolio grew to be worth $1,657, representing a 7.3% annualized rate of return. In other words, the highest-performing stocks in the S&P 500 more than compensate for the losers over time. The Magic Of Compounding When examining concentrated, non-diversified portfolios, the median return should be the primary focus in assessing the risk of potential outcomes. The ten-year median return on an individual US stock was -7.9% or -0.82% per year relative to the overall market. Interestingly, for stocks that were in the top 20% of performers in the previous five years, the ten-year median relative return was a dismal -17.8% or -1.94% per year. The mean return in both cases is positive because the smaller subset of fabulously performing stocks dominates the return across a diversified portfolio. 10-Year Single Stock Return: 1926-2022 Risk to us is 1) the risk of permanent loss of capital, or 2) the risk of inadequate return. ‚Äì Charlie Munger Petajisto found that the return volatility of portfolios with a single holding of up to 10% was little different from a diversified portfolio. He noted that volatility increases begin to become meaningful at individual holding weights of 10-20%. Once a single holding reaches 30% or more, diversification is of little help in controlling volatility. While academics and some practitioners define stock risk as volatility, it is only one measure of risk among others. Volatility measures how much the price of a stock fluctuates over time, which is only meaningful if one needs to sell or becomes uncomfortable with that price movement. Volatility is typically used as a measure of risk precisely because it is easily measurable. Munger was comfortable with the added volatility of holding a small number of stocks because he didn‚Äôt believe volatility was meaningful for the long-term investor. His focus was on permanent loss of capital and a reasonable return on his investment. Sit on your ass investing. You‚Äôre paying less to brokers, you‚Äôre listening to less nonsense, and if it works, the tax system gives you an extra one, two, or three percentage points per annum. ‚Äì Charlie Munger While the case for some concentration in holdings can be made for highly skilled investors with a high tolerance for volatility, taxes have a significant impact on the added reason for retaining these outsized holdings. Unrealized capital gains on stocks are akin to an interest-free loan from the government, so the longer an investor can utilize the Internal Revenue Service‚Äôs share of the gain to compound wealth, the better. Since the point of this exercise is to look at holdings that grew into concentrated holdings, the calculation around short-term capital gains isn‚Äôt relevant. However, the higher tax rate on short-term gains makes avoidance generally the best policy if possible. Many assumptions must be made to illustrate the additional return required to offset the tax payment for taking a taxable long-term capital gain on a stock; however, the following examples will provide a reasonable model for decision-making. In this example, the stock is now worth $100,000 and has a tax basis of $65,000, and the investor‚Äôs long-term capital gains rate is 28.8%. Depending on how long you hold the new investment you buy with what remains of the sale proceeds after paying the tax, the latest investment needs to outperform your previous by 3.6% annualized for three years or 1.1% for ten years to make up for the tax payment. Breakeven Excess Annualized Return With the same assumptions as before, but the stock is now worth $100,000 and has a tax basis of $20,000, the new investment purchase must outperform your previous by 9.1% annualized for three years or 2.7% for ten years to make up for the tax payment. Massive winners lead to a larger tax hurdle for sale despite possible forward-looking underperformance. Low-Basis Stock: Breakeven Excess Annual Return While the variables make a difference, and there are cases where it would be appropriate, short-term capital gains should generally be avoided if the goal is to maximize after-tax wealth. Even long-term gains retain a significant hurdle for deciding to exit a winning investment in a taxable account. The conclusion is that investors owning companies that are expected to be excellent long-term should be willing to tolerate short-term underperformance to utilize the power of compound returns and maximize after-tax wealth. We expect to hold these securities for a long time. In fact, when we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever. We are just the opposite of those who hurry to sell and book profits when companies perform well but who tenaciously hang on to businesses that disappoint. ‚Äì Warren Buffett Even Warren Buffett‚Äôs tolerance for concentrated positions has its limits, as demonstrated by Berkshire Hathaway‚Äôs history of owning Apple (AAPL). Berkshire Hathaway began amassing a position in the first quarter of 2016. By the third quarter of 2023, Apple had grown to account for 52% of Berkshire‚Äôs publicly traded stock portfolio, with a value of nearly $157 billion. During this period, Apple achieved a total return of 613.8%, or 28.9% annualized, compared to the S&P 500‚Äôs total return of 141.72%, or 12.1% annualized. Apple (AAPL) Stock Price Berkshire began to trim its position in the fourth quarter of 2023 and sold a sizable stake over four straight quarters. As of the end of the first quarter of 2025, Apple remains Berkshire‚Äôs largest publicly traded stock holding at 26% of the portfolio, with the stake worth about $67 billion. Percent Of Berkshire's $259 billion 13F Portfolio: 1Q 2025 At the 2024 annual meeting, one of the most significant disclosures was that Berkshire Hathaway sold nearly $20 billion of its massive stake in Apple (AAPL) during the first quarter of the year. Despite selling about 13% of its stake that quarter, Buffett said it‚Äôs likely that Apple will remain the largest common stock holding at the end of the year. Buffett noted that Berkshire‚Äôs holdings in American Express (AXP) and Coca-Cola (KO) were ‚Äúwonderful‚Äù businesses but said that Apple is an even better one. Apple sold for as low as 10 times earnings in 2016, but by the fourth quarter of 2023, when Berkshire began to sell in earnest, the valuation had blossomed to 30 times earnings. Buffett has never given a definitive answer regarding the trimming of Apple. Still, one can surmise that risk management, combined with the higher valuation, making the pace of past gains unlikely to be replicated, likely led to the sales despite the enormous tax bill. The ingredients of Warren‚Äôs and Charlie‚Äôs great investment performance are simple: (a) a lot of investments in which they did decently, (b) a relatively small number of big winners that they invested in heavily and held for decades, and (c) relatively few big losers. ‚Äì Howard Marks Buffett and Munger certainly utilized the power of compound returns by allowing winners to run and selling the losers over a long period, assisting in maximizing after-tax wealth. This strategy wasn‚Äôt always set in stone, as the Apple investment shows. Investors need to be mindful of the additional risk that comes with successful concentrated positions, weighing it against the tax costs, and consider the fundamental valuation of the business. The data show that extreme upside winners tend to face some headwinds, so the probabilities need to be considered when examining possible future outcomes. Harvesting capital losses to offset realized gains from trimming concentrated positions is an effective tool used by Warren Buffett and intelligent wealth managers. Beyond the scope of this article, there are more innovative strategies available to qualified high-net-worth investors that can be potent ways to diversify concentrated stock positions in a tax-efficient manner.

More behind the strategy are examined along with data on the risks. (Photo credit should read JOHANNES EISELE/AFP via Getty Images) Charlie‚Äôs portfolio was concentrated in very few securities and therefore his record was much more volatile but it was based on the same discount-from-value approach. He was willing to accept greater peaks and valleys of performance, and he happens to be a fellow whose whole psyche goes toward concentration, with the results shown. ‚Äì Warren Buffett discussing Charlie Munger‚Äôs investment process in Damn Right! by Janet Lowe Berkshire Hathaway‚Äôs (BRK/A, BRK/B) Warren Buffett and his late partner Charlie Munger are considered the greatest investment duo of all time. Munger‚Äôs investment strategy tended to be very concentrated, with the Daily Journal Corporation (DJCO) portfolio that he controlled typically having only four or five central holdings. Even Berkshire‚Äôs $259 billion publicly traded stock portfolio consists of only 36 stocks, with 71% of the portfolio value in the top five holdings.

Are you ready for AR? Meta, Google, Snap and more are gearing up to compete with Apple and deliver frames-based communications devices ‚Äì complete with AI integration When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here‚Äôs how it works. What‚Äôs next in the world of intelligent wearables? A few years ago, smart glasses were still a punchline to a joke about tech overreach, with much-vaunted concepts like Google Glass confined to developers and ambitious enterprise clients. What do smart glasses offer to the rest of us, apart from one more reason to be suspicious of those wearing sunglasses indoors or when it's overcast? Spectacles AR glasses from Snap This summer‚Äôs announcement of Android XR as a new force in wearable operating systems won‚Äôt come to consumers until early next year. XR is designed to work via audio or with internal lens displays, and it‚Äôs the latter that‚Äôll generate the most buzz when the first devices arrive in 2026. Viture Pro XR Glasses It‚Äôs not to be confused with conventional XR glasses, as above, which achieve extended reality by projecting a tiny display onto the back of frames that create what are effectively giant wearable screens. The proximity to the eye creates a vast digital canvas that feels a few feet away. Whilst these are good for air travel, for example, allowing you to watch movies and even work, these kinds of XR glasses aren‚Äôt designed to use whilst wandering around. To handle the processing, most smart glasses have a separate pack to handle graphics, seen here with the RayNeo Air 3S Some commentators have speculated that the transparency and layering elements of Apple‚Äôs new Liquid Glass design approach ‚Äì itself derived from the boundary-less interface of the Apple Vision Pro ‚Äì is opening up their OS to the potential of a glasses-powered interface. Given that Google is busy developing its Vision OS-style platform, it seems more than likely that the search giant will also have its own hardware to accompany it, as well as licensing the tech to others ‚Äì it recently announcing a tie-in with American eyewear brand Warby Parker. Smart glasses from Even Realities Glasses come in many formats, some of which follow the Google extended and augmented reality approach, while others just serve as a portal for interaction with a smart agent. Others promise to enhance hearing and fitness tracking or simply provide a way to make calls and listen to music. We‚Äôve taken stock of what‚Äôs new and next in the world of smart glasses. Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses Right now, Ray-Ban‚Äôs Meta glasses are dipping in price as the companies gear up to launch a new iteration. Currently on their second generation and sold via high profile ads featuring Chrises Pratt and Hemsworth, Ray-Ban originally teamed up with Meta AI to embed the tech giant‚Äôs chatbot into the frames back in 2023. Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses Today you can choose between Wayfarer and Skyler frames, along with a variety of tints and finishes (including prescription lenses). Audio is conducted via open air speakers built into the arms, and the 12MP camera can be used alongside the Meta AI app in your smartphone. The AI responds to spoken queries and identifies songs, as well as record video and messages and other potentially socially divisive activities. Receive our daily digest of inspiration, escapism and design stories from around the world direct to your inbox. Ray-Ban.com Spectacles AR glasses from Snap Snap Inc, the makers of Snapchat, are currently trialling their fifth generation Spectacles, augmented reality glasses that overlay a graphical image over the real world whilst still (just about) providing a regular sunglasses-like appearance that doesn‚Äôt conceal your eyes. Next up are ‚ÄòSpecs‚Äô, the sixth-generation iteration of the tech, due in 2026. This time the frames will smaller and slimmer, with deeper AI-integration (using both OpenAI and Google Gemini) to allow for realtime queries about your surroundings. Spectacles.com RayNeo Air 3S Think of RayNeo‚Äôs Air 3s XR Glasses are personal screens - effectively a projector you wear on your eyes. They come complete with inbuilt Google TV, immersive sound and connectivity for everything from your mobile and PC to the Nintendo Switch. RayNeo.com Viture Pro XR Glasses Viture‚Äôs Pro XR Glasses come with Harman audio, jet black lenses that let no light escape from the internal microLED screens and promised single cable connection to anything. Details of Viture's Pro XR Glasses Users can expect a display that equates to a 135‚Äù TV at a distance of 3m, with fast refresh rates for smooth motion in games and inbuilt lens correction to help the shortsighted. Aimed primarily at gaming and media consumption, the company‚Äôs newest glasses weigh in at 78g, although they‚Äôre still pretty chunky. Pro.Viture.com Project Aura One Pro by Xreal (left), alongside the Air 2 Ultra (right) With the first product due next year, Project Aura is being touted as the first glasses-style application of Android XR. Xreal will be selling several Project Aura models, including the high-end One Pro models that combine elements like prescription lenses and Bose sound with the ins and outs of the XR OS. These will supplement existing wearable display models like Xreal's Air 2 Ultra. Xreal's Beam Pro is a spatial computing AR companion device designed to enhance Google apps The Aura glasses get UI elements that pop up persistently within your physical space, similar in concept to the Vision Pro, only without the all-encompassing design of Apple‚Äôs product. Project Aura will also require a separate box to handle the processing power. Xreal.com Samsung's Project Moohan Android XR headset Before Xreal, Samsung hopes to get its Project Moohan headset to market. Clearly very derivative of the Vision Pro, this device was first shown at MWC 2025 and will no doubt lose the codename when it finally arrives. Unlike the Apple device, Samsung has opted not to integrate a screen to show the user‚Äôs eyes, so wearers will be completely incognito. Samsung.com Smart glasses by Even Realities A new brand from China, Even Realties is branching out with its own dedicated OS and projector system, throwing up info like translation and navigation details onto the lens. Notes and AI-driven suggestions can also be projected onto the lens, appearing as if the text was around two metres from your eyeball. A mock-up of the projector system developed by Even Realities Available in two models, the G1A and G1B, the glasses can be specified with prescription lenses and have a far slimmer profile than other approaches. The proprietary software works in part with a tilt of the head and can even be used as a discrete teleprompter device. EvenRealities.com OCOSense by Emteq Labs Still in early development, UK-based start-up Emteq Labs is developing the OCOSense platform, a sensor-driven, frames-mounted set-up that uses a pair of smart glasses to track, amongst other things, facial expressions and emotional responses using Optomyography, a high-volume sensor system that measures muscular response across the face. The first version of the OCOSense glasses Capable of making 6,000 readings a second, this data is spliced with ChatGPT-interpreted inputs on things like environment and even food. A suggested application is monitoring physical and mental fitness as well as diet. EmteqLabs.com Nuance Audio Glasses The smart thing about the new Nuance Audio Glasses, recently launched in the US by EssilorLuxottica (and also available in select outlets in the UK), is that they have an integrated hearing solution. Eschewing all the AI assistance and other OS complexities, Nuance focuses on a single, solvable issue ‚Äì how to improve your hearing in noisy and crowded environments. Paired with a dedicated app that allows you to fine tune the onboard mics and noise cancelling, the glasses are a subtle way to counter the 50% of people who have some form of hearing loss over the age of 55.

Title: Rajrishi Singhal: What markets demand needn‚Äôt be what society wants

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Apple‚Äôs highly anticipated developer conference this year has not only disappointed reviewers and equity markets, but also raised many disturbing questions. One, it has raised anxieties over the future viability of the iPhone manufacturer. More importantly, it highlights the divergence between what is good for society versus what is good for the stock market, belying the benign and popular perception of the role that equity markets play in society. Apple‚Äôs developer conferences, called WWDC25 this year, are usually a marquee event in the tech world, providing independent developers and tech analysts an inkling of the company‚Äôs progress with hardware and software. At WWDC25 on 9 June, Apple executives were able to share only a limited future path for the company, especially on its progress with artificial intelligence (AI). Apple‚Äôs senior executives told the gathering that the promise made last year about upgrading Apple Intelligence, with voice assistant Siri as its centrepiece, would take some more time to accomplish. Also Read: China plus one: Apple and India might need to woo not just Trump but Xi too This left many analysts and developers cold. Even the stock market expressed its displeasure: Apple‚Äôs common stock has tanked almost 25% from its 52-week high. The market‚Äôs disapproval, interestingly, is not limited to Apple‚Äôs slow progress in integrating AI, but also centres around the company‚Äôs data privacy policies. The market‚Äôs unhappiness seems to stem from the company‚Äôs reluctance to use a customer‚Äôs individual usage data or information as an input for training personalized AI models. Apple instead prefers to use insights based on aggregate consumer preferences, unlike competitors like Microsoft and Google. It would then appear that the market is rewarding companies that will profit from scraping individual data, rather than businesses which have red lines on using personal data. Also Read: Apple‚Äôs Hotel California trap: It can check out but not leave China The market‚Äôs simple logic is that companies using personal data for their AI engines can unlock new revenue sources by offering consumers hyper-personalized offerings. Plus, there is the subscription angle. For example, individual subscription rates for Microsoft‚Äôs Copilot Pro are expected to be around $20 every month, its key selling point being its ability to unlock AI features in all Microsoft 365 products, such as Word or PowerPoint, allowing customers to generate drafts, summarize content or analyse data at a faster rate. Google AI Pro will also be available to customers at the same rate, but a turbo-charged version called Google AI Ultra will be available for $250 per month. When this columnist asked Google‚Äôs Gemini how Apple‚Äôs future AI plans can make money for the company, one part of the AI engine‚Äôs reply stood out: ‚ÄúApple‚Äôs strong stance on privacy (‚Äòintelligence without surveillance‚Äô) is a powerful differentiator in an era of increasing data concerns. This can foster greater trust and loyalty among its user base, leading to continued purchases of Apple products and services over competitors. While not a direct revenue stream, it‚Äôs a critical factor in sustaining its high-margin business model." Also Read: Dave Lee: Apple must make peace with developers for AI success Yet, the stock market did not seem impressed. Clearly, for market operators, short-term corporate profits have greater primacy over privacy concerns. Even if we were to disregard the normative issues of morality or ethics for a moment, the stock market‚Äôs responses are visibly out of sync with society‚Äôs needs or concerns. There is a reason for this: the stock market is focused on the limited constituency it serves. Its behaviour aligns almost perfectly with the objectives set out by institutional investors or companies looking to raise money. In the not-too-distant past, the market was bestowing the Apple stock with a premium too because the company had plugs and ports that differed from other manufacturers, guaranteeing the company exclusive, high-margin revenues, even if that meant consumer discomfort or the exercise of near-monopolistic power. Also Read: Big Tech in the dock: The EU could force Meta and Apple to change their coercive ways The statement that the market‚Äôs singular focus on corporate bottom-lines and their impact on share prices does not necessarily align with what could be good for broader society might seem like belabouring a truism; but the need to reiterate this has arisen in the face of a growing tendency to conflate a stock market‚Äôs signals with the desires or ambitions of society on the whole. One good example of the market-versus-society divergence is the premium that US equity markets placed on companies setting up manufacturing bases in China. This was happening at a time when the US political class and civil society were bemoaning the absence of democracy and human rights in the North Asian country, even while hoping that closer integration with the global economy would discipline its regime. Reality has turned out otherwise, but stock markets continued to glorify companies that moved production to China.

This was used by many politicians as well as Indian fund managers aligned with the ruling party‚Äôs political ideology to indicate the economy‚Äôs recovery and society‚Äôs triumph over the virus. Planners and policymakers must realize that a healthy society‚Äôs needs, desires and ambitions extend far beyond quarterly earnings and the oscillation of benchmark indices.

by Tom Johnson on Jun 15, 2025 categories: ai ‚Ä¢ ai-book-club ‚Ä¢ podcasts Here‚Äôs a recording of the AI Book Club: A Human in the Loop meeting, held June 15, 2025: If you just want the audio, here it is: Listen here: Here are some of the high-level topics we discussed during the book club. (These are pulled and summarized from the transcript using AI.) Here are some discussion questions I prepared for the book club. We didn‚Äôt discuss many of these, but they nonetheless reflect some of the themes and issues that stood out to me. AGI by 2029? Do you really think that by 2029 we‚Äôll reach AGI? That‚Äôs really close ‚Äì just 4 years away. If it happens, how will that change our profession? Accelerating returns cycle? How do some of the information assets we produce create accelerating returns? AI leads to producing more content with greater depth and accuracy. This information then leads to more abundant and rapid use of the technology, as it helps AI tools more quickly implement APIs and other tools/assets, which in turn leads to the development of more technologies. Is this a virtuous cycle of technological advancement? Discuss unprovable futurism? Is there merit in getting so invested or antagonistic in a futurist position that seems so far-fetched as to be unprovable? For example, nanobots rearranging our molecular DNA to create immune responses from virus-type nanobots, or grey-goo scenarios. If something isn‚Äôt provable, is it worth truly discussing? Or, due to the Law of Accelerating Returns (LOAR), will these scenarios become near-immediate realities much faster than we realize, catching us unprepared? LOAR and AI? I‚Äôm most persuaded by the Law of Accelerating Returns (LOAR). I think there‚Äôs merit to this idea. I had a discussion this morning about how AI is similar to the dot-com boom/hype of the early 2000s. The dot-com boom did lead to a crash, but the internet eventually turned out to be deeply transformative. AI isn‚Äôt just potentially similar; it can build on the existing innovation of the web to accelerate even faster, as the web enables better information sharing and distribution. Additionally, the web itself (all the content) provided much of the data needed to train and power LLMs. So I can see a case where these technologies build on each other and, in so doing, accelerate faster and faster. Do you agree with this assessment? Radical life extension? Are we on the verge of radical life extension? If we can just hold out another 10-15 years, will we hit a point of ‚Äúlongevity escape velocity‚Äù with our health? What would that mean? Could a technical writer be 250 years old? Singularity, new identity? If we hit a point of the singularity, we will no longer be ‚Äútech writers‚Äù because we‚Äôll have so much knowledge at our disposal that we could be engineers, doctors, or rocket scientists, etc? The infusion of this knowledge will allow us to transcend this role and move into any other. Do we need to start thinking beyond our current identity to be more ambitious in what we want to undertake? Your singularity age? How old will you be when the singularity (predicted in 2045) takes place? What will society be like when this happens? What if it only partially happens? Acceleration already here? In what sense are we already seeing this rate of acceleration taking place? I feel like every day someone is sharing some new AI-related tool, link, or news with me. It‚Äôs certainly coming at an accelerated pace. Will this pace keep up? Workplace acceleration impact? What happens when acceleration starts to become more apparent in the workplace? Technical writers (TWs) will be bombarded with documentation requests, potentially just requests to review documents engineers have already written, etc. TWs will either use AI to keep up or start outsourcing the documentation work to those using AI to build. How are you / will you deal with acceleration? AI divide growing? Do you see a growing divide between those who can access and use AI tools versus those who don‚Äôt have access to them, or who have access but don‚Äôt know how to use them successfully? For example, if users have access to the top tiers of Gemini, Claude, or ChatGPT in their work (tiers costing $200+/month), will this separation start to create a divide between the AI-haves and AI-have-nots? What could you do with access to a top-tier model? What if a model is released at $5,000 a month, such as a powerful agentic model that lets you accomplish all your work while you sleep, or which reduces your existing workload by half, freeing up more of your time to pursue or accelerate other work? Perhaps we‚Äôll start to see more acceleration in individuals, widening the divide. This is a new type of technological divide: not just people who have computers and know how to use them, but people who can access and successfully use advanced AI models. Merging with AI? Kurzweil has said that in many ways, we‚Äôre already merging with AI. We carry smartphones in our pockets, and the documents we produce are collaborations with AI (helping us brainstorm, refine our thoughts, articulate our ideas, etc.). As others incorporate these human/machine collaborative products, the AI-based content proliferates and becomes embedded into even more parts of society. As a result, the distinction between human and machine is blurring. Will our close relationship with smartphones, all of which now offer AI in our pockets, accelerate our convergence with AI? AI catastrophe risk? It seems that AI advancements present many new and novel ways for humanity to destroy itself. The grey-goo scenario, where nanobots out of control consume the biosphere in a matter of days, or where rogue actors bioengineer toxins (perhaps tailored to specific DNA profiles) present new avenues for annihilation. We‚Äôre lucky that so far, nuclear winter hasn‚Äôt happened. But what are the chances that some AI-engineered catastrophe won‚Äôt occur, given its increased accessibility and the variety of available scenarios that could lead to many possible attack vectors? Complexity brakes and self-driving cars. Critics mention possible ‚Äúcomplexity brakes‚Äù interfering with the projected timeline. I think self-driving cars are a good example. A lot of people anticipated that we would have fully autonomous vehicles several years ago, but it didn‚Äôt really happen. Only in controlled areas in select cities do we see AVs like Waymo operating. Autonomous driving turned out to be much harder than anything anticipated (for example, Elon keeps saying Tesla Robotaxis are just around the corner). It‚Äôs probably the same with many of Kurzweil‚Äôs predictions. The Law of Accelerating Returns (LOAR) will hit many complexity snags that slow acceleration down. Figuratively speaking, maybe accelerating a technology from 0 to 70 mph is somewhat easy, then from 70 - 90 mph much harder, and then from 90-95 mph the most difficult, and 95-100 almost impossible. I‚Äôm not sure if the LOAR curve is always exponential. Brain-cloud interface? Connecting our brains to the cloud reminds me of a Black Mirror episode, specifically Season 7, episode 1: ‚ÄúCommon People.‚Äù A woman has part of her brain removed due to a tumor, but a cloud service can provide similar functionality, connected to online services that stream data to her brain. It‚Äôs a pretty compelling episode. Of course, as with nearly every Black Mirror episode, the plot goes dark when the company starts showing ads and upselling services through the person (taking over their brain), and then amplifying her sensory experiences for even more upselling. But the larger point of this episode is to contemplate our merging with AI. Is it likely that an AI service, running on massive cloud computing, could provide a service that in some way connects to a biological component in a human? Utopian or dystopian? Kurzweil‚Äôs vision of the future is a techno-utopian one, where technology eliminates disease, economic hardship, and more. It‚Äôs an era of abundance and opportunity. In contrast, many others perceive the future as much more dystopian and see many concerns about bleak futures. Do you perceive a techno-utopian future or techno-dystopian future, and why? Hollywood romanticizes the dystopian future for a more compelling storyline, but Kurzweil‚Äôs evidence showing advancements during the past 200 years presents a compelling case for continued and accelerating improvements (we live longer, have greater wealth, etc.). Are we overlooking these improvements? If we were to teleport back in time, would our current progress be much more apparent to us? Book‚Äôs overall effect? Overall, this book is a refreshing argument in favor of techno-utopianism at a time when we‚Äôre seeing more anti-AI books come out. It makes me think we‚Äôre only going to see more acceleration, technological innovation, and advancements in the years to come. More readily available expert knowledge will be available. I think we‚Äôll see a growing divide between those who can harness AI for their work and those who can‚Äôt. So it makes me want to double down on my AI learning and incorporation, as I think this will position me to ride the wave and learn to navigate what‚Äôs to come. What was the overall effect of this book on your perspective? For notes summarizing the book, along with discussion questions, see this Google Doc. The Google Doc organizes information into various tabs (Book summary, Discussion questions, etc.) that appear on the left. I uploaded the summary and discussion questions into NotebookLM and created a ‚ÄúDeep Dive‚Äù podcast from it. You can listen here: Listen here: Here‚Äôs a transcript of the meeting, with the conversation made more readable through AI: Tom: This is a recording of the AI book club, ‚ÄúA Human in the Loop.‚Äù Specifically, we are discussing Ray Kurzweil‚Äôs The Singularity is Nearer. This is a discussion among around five people for about an hour where we talk about different topics. A lot of us are tech writers, and some of us are in other roles, but this is basically a recording of a book club discussion. It‚Äôs not super focused thematically; it‚Äôs a lot of different perspectives, takeaways, and thoughts on Kurzweil‚Äôs book. So, enjoy. Tom: Well, let me just go ahead and kick things off here. Welcome to this AI book club. We‚Äôll be talking about Ray Kurzweil‚Äôs The Singularity is Nearer. And like the other book club sessions, this is being recorded, and I‚Äôll distribute it afterwards. So just make sure you don‚Äôt say anything you don‚Äôt want to be heard by other people. That usually doesn‚Äôt happen. We have about four people today. Last time, we had probably two or three times that. Unfortunately, I have a bad track record of picking holidays for this. I try to just do a regular, predictable cadence‚Äîthe third Sunday of the month‚Äîand already I‚Äôve hit Easter and Father‚Äôs Day. So anyway, Happy Father‚Äôs Day to anybody who‚Äôs a father out there. Nathan: And you‚Äôre a father. Tom: Yeah, I am. Happy Father‚Äôs Day to you. I‚Äôve got plans right after this, going to a baseball game with my kids. I don‚Äôt even really watch baseball, but it‚Äôs kind of fun to go with my kids to a sporting event. So anyway, all right, let‚Äôs get into this book. I did share a document. If you didn‚Äôt see it, let me just share my screen real quick so you know where all these notes go. I usually provide a notes document right before the book club, and the notes document just has‚Äîyou can find the link right next to the book in the schedule. And this time, I created a few different things. First of all, I just drafted a big summary because I wanted to make sure I was understanding things. If you‚Äôve never used Gemini Deep Research, or even ChatGPT‚Äôs deep research capabilities, it‚Äôs probably highly similar. It‚Äôs great, and it does a nice job of just summarizing all the main things. And with a book like this that‚Äôs so popular, there‚Äôs a lot of information online, so you could probably have more confidence in its accuracy. But I mean, if you‚Äôve read the book too, you would know what‚Äôs on target and what‚Äôs not, and it surprisingly looks good to me. I also added some discussion questions and invited people to add to them if they wanted. These are kind of long and different thoughts, and we can hit them or not. I don‚Äôt think anybody added one, but maybe I‚Äôm wrong. And then finally, I just added this this morning, but if you haven‚Äôt played around with NotebookLM, this is a tremendous amount of fun. It‚Äôs notebooklm.google.com. You just upload‚Äîin this example, I uploaded the book summary into it‚Äîand it generated a 28-minute podcast. And then I just downloaded and uploaded this. But it‚Äôs a good way to sort of ramp up on any subject. Now, as people pointed out last time, none of these resources are really what people want, which is they want to know what others think about the book. What do you make of it? Do you agree? Did you like the book? How do you see this sort of applying and playing out in your life or not? So, why don‚Äôt we jump into that high-level topic? What did you think of the book? Did you enjoy it? Did you have strong reactions against it? What was your general reception? Mette: I can start with the opening shot. Tom: Go for it. Mette: I liked the book. I didn‚Äôt like it as much as the last book by Mustafa Suleyman. I thought he was more‚Äîhe talked more to an audience that was here and now. It seemed that‚Äîand I don‚Äôt know how to really pronounce his name, Ray Kurzweil, is that his name? Tom: I actually don‚Äôt know either. Kurzweil is my understanding. Mette: Yeah. His book was really centered on maybe not the people right now on Earth, but people maybe, I don‚Äôt know, 20, 30 years from now, or 50 years. So I kept on finding myself going, ‚ÄúOkay, buddy, what about us now?‚Äù He seemed to do a lot of‚Äîhis argument often was, ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs all the wonderful things that AI is going to do for humanity. Oh, but it‚Äôs not going to be so great in the short term.‚Äù And I found that to be a continuing theme. Maybe I was in a pessimistic mood. But that said, he could certainly crunch the numbers, and I found that interesting. I don‚Äôt know where he got all that information. It‚Äôs a whole lot of research he did, certainly very optimistic research. I found the most interesting part of the book to be the bio part because that‚Äôs something Suleyman didn‚Äôt really go into in great detail, but he went into it in a lot of detail. I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúOh, okay, that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going to happen.‚Äù Okay. So, what astounded me was that it was all going to be happening pretty much in the 2030s by his predictions. And then on several occasions, he pointed out that he‚Äôs always been kind of correct on his predictions. Tom: Yeah, I, wow, you brought up so many great points here. Let‚Äôs jump into some of these. The first one you mentioned about the audience: who is he really talking to? And you‚Äôre right that he seems to be addressing more of a future audience or not really talking to the people here and now. And yet, his AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) prediction is supposed to land around 2029, which is four years away. I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúOh my god, that‚Äôs, you know, really just a stone‚Äôs throw away.‚Äù Mette: Yeah. Tom: But I mean, there‚Äôs definitely an element of science fiction, it feels, especially when you get into Epoch 6 where the universe wakes up and so on. It‚Äôs like, very creative and imaginative, and it‚Äôs kind of like, wow, I mean, who knows what that time will look like? But you also brought up the Law of Accelerating Returns, and I agree. I‚Äôm kind of taken by that as well. And this whole topic of acceleration is one that I find probably most applicable and most immediate. I know critics have said that he mostly cherry-picks examples from technology as proof, and we don‚Äôt really have that same kind of Law of Accelerating Returns in biology and other domains, or even just like airplane travel. So people say we‚Äôre hitting complexity brakes in those other areas. But I mean, do you‚Äîthis is a question I asked my colleagues the other day‚Äîdo you feel like things are accelerating in your own work? Mette: Yes. Tom: In what ways? Mette: The expectations that are placed on me as a technical writer. It‚Äôs, you know, my company is kind but firm. It‚Äôs like, if you‚Äôre not using AI to show us how you can be twice as efficient or more, then, gee, there might be a different future for you that doesn‚Äôt include us. Tom: Wow. Mette: So I mean, it‚Äôs very subtle, but it‚Äôs there. And they‚Äôve really gotten on the AI bandwagon. So I feel it every day, definitely. Of course, you know, just on my cell phone, I notice all sorts of things. So just apart from work, I see it happening every single day. Tom: It‚Äôs interesting to hear feedback from people in other companies about AI momentum and pressure and encouragement. So yeah, that‚Äôs really, really fascinating. Do you feel like the work itself has doubled yet? Like if you‚Äôre being asked to do twice as much, do you also have twice as many doc requests and projects and things to do as before? Mette: Yeah, and that‚Äôs probably because we laid off 40% of our department. Tom: Oh, okay. Mette: Because of AI. Tom: Because of AI, initially? Wow. Wow, you‚Äôre really in the‚Äîyou‚Äôre right in this stuff. That‚Äôs crazy. Okay. Wow. So they really, they really doubled down on people being twice as productive by laying off‚Äî Mette: They really have. Tom: Wow, that‚Äôs a trend that I don‚Äôt think has really caught on. I mean, I don‚Äôt see massive companies laying off half their staff and telling them to just use AI to pick up the slack, but I see it here and there and wonder how much speed it will pick up. Anybody else have any thoughts? Nathan? Nathan: I think, just about companies and the choices they might make, I think AI gives them almost an excuse to shrink their workforce, right? I mean, so whether or not AI is actually making gains in any productivity for a company‚Äôs workers, a company can use that as an excuse to shrink their workforce. And there is, you know, I mean, there‚Äôs a benefit to the hype of AI, you know, in the way that those companies have said it needs to be regulated, it‚Äôs going to get out of control. I mean, there‚Äôs some marketing angle to that, I would say. So, you know, for friends of mine who have been laid off for reasons of AI, I definitely sympathize with all those folks, and I think in some cases it‚Äôs definitely true, but in some cases as well, there might be some, you know, kind of marketing spin to workforce reductions underneath this AI era. So I just wanted to throw that out there. Tom: That‚Äôs a really good point. And I think another point on understanding why companies might be using AI as an excuse to lay people off is also just to justify the massive capital expenditure on all the AI infrastructure and tooling and resources. I mean, you can‚Äôt spend billions of dollars and not have a return on investment. So maybe the quickest way to show that is by saying we were able to cut our workforce in half. You have to satisfy Wall Street. Nathan: True. Tom: Anybody else have‚Äîgo ahead, Liam. Liam: Yeah, well, nice to meet y‚Äôall. I work at AWS, and obviously, whatever I share is basically my perspective; working there has nothing to do with my actual work. But we do a lot of work with GenAI, and I think what I was surprised by was how little the phrase ‚ÄúGenAI,‚Äù like generative artificial intelligence, was brought up. Ray talks about AI a lot, or AI superintelligence, or artificial general intelligence like you said, Tom. For me, when I think about where it goes in my work, how I feel like things are accelerating‚ÄîI‚Äôm in sales, and so we‚Äôre working with a lot of SMB companies. I‚Äôm not a technical writer, but I thought what y‚Äôall were talking about was fascinating, so I wanted to join. We‚Äôre trying to sell the future, kind of. And so there are expectations put on us about what level of adoption and usage customers should be using GenAI for, whether that‚Äôs a concrete manufacturer or a digitally native business. And it feels like whether it‚Äôs Azure, GCP, Oracle, or AWS, a lot of people are guessing about what level of adoption will be like in day-to-day business. And I would say for me, what‚Äôs accelerating is that we‚Äôre not seeing agents do my day-to-day work, even though we see Service Now commercials or Salesforce commercials show that. We‚Äôre still seeing a lot of manual tasks done by individuals like myself and still trying to find ways, like, how do we move this from‚Äîinterestingly, it‚Äôs commercialized so people use it day-to-day, but it‚Äôs not in the actual business. Like, it‚Äôs not seeing real business value being driven, at least when I‚Äôm working with my customers, other than like chatbots and intelligent document processing, which might have been started 5-10 years ago and is not a GenAI topic. It‚Äôs something that can be structured and responsive. Suparna: Hey, oh, go ahead. Tom: Super‚ÄîI was just going to ask a follow-up question to Liam, really, but totally okay if you can‚Äôt answer. I was just wondering if you could give an example of one of those manual tasks that hasn‚Äôt yet been‚Ä¶ that you haven‚Äôt been able to transition to AI? Liam: Yeah, great question. I think the phrase wouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äúcan‚Äôt transition to AI.‚Äù I think what I‚Äôm seeing right now is, is the organization investing in doing that? So, for example, Salesforce is a great tool to track how you interact well with your customers. And so we use that to track who our customers are and how we interact with them, whether we had a meeting, like a billion other organizations do. And that could be a very agentic thing, I believe, where I have a meeting on my calendar, and let‚Äôs say a live meeting assistant takes the notes and then imports that into Salesforce, and then identifies the notes and then gives suggestions, writes emails for next steps, sends it out, sends the new meeting invite, or submits a ticket for a special request to meet with a technical advisor, like a solutions architect, about Amazon Rekognition to be able to recognize images on documents. Rekognition is an AWS AI tool, which you probably know. And so it‚Äôs not that it can‚Äôt be done; we‚Äôre just seeing a lot of these businesses that I‚Äôm working with are not implementing it at the speed at which I think a lot of leadership in the tech world think they would have by this time. Tom: Speaking of agents and how much can be automated and accelerated, I was playing around with something the other day called Jules. I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôve heard of this, but this is one of these agents that is somewhat experimental, I think. It‚Äôs an experimental coding agent that helps you fix bugs, add documentation, and so on. It integrates with GitHub. This is a Google experimental agent. And I was really trying to make it work. I was like, ‚ÄúOh, this looks awesome.‚Äù You give it some tasks and it just goes to work, and you come back later and it‚Äôs all done. But it was really hard to figure out what tasks to give it that it would be successful with. What I wanted it to do, basically, is first just to check all the links of something and make sure all the links were valid. And instead, it built me a link parser out of Python. You know, I was like, ‚ÄúWhoa, that wasn‚Äôt what I expected.‚Äù And then I thought, ‚ÄúOkay, let me just update the information on this page. I know that‚Äôs somewhat outdated.‚Äù And I wanted it to go out and get all the information necessary and pull it down and unpack it and update the topic. But it‚Äôs a lot harder to pull that off. I think there‚Äôs so much glue between the tasks we do. I feel like I have to set up AI so that it will be successful‚Äîgive it all the info it needs, give it a very concrete task, give it access to a specific page, tell it what to do. And setting all that up, it‚Äôs hard, right? That‚Äôs all the meta-information between tasks that AI can‚Äôt really do‚Äîall that context, even prioritizing what page, where to start. So I don‚Äôt know, the agent thing is, I think, definitely the next level of AI. The ability for these tools to just update pages across a doc set in a very autonomous way is pretty amazing, but still hard to implement. Suparna, have you done anything‚Äîhave you made progress with agents and getting significantly long tasks going with them? Suparna: I haven‚Äôt, no. I used to work as a software engineer, and I‚Äôm currently laid off, with some thoughts of going into something slightly different. I am volunteering in literacy right now, and the only way that I‚Äôm using AI is‚ÄîI used to try to take articles, for example, from BBC Features, and try to summarize them in ESL-friendly language. And then I think I heard from one of the tech-savvy staff members, he was like, ‚ÄúYou should be doing this with AI.‚Äù And then I finally started just feeding those articles into ChatGPT, with a slight worry about, ‚ÄúIs this ethical for me to do this?‚Äù But it‚Äôs actually been really great using that because the ways in which the summaries have been generated allow me to focus on interacting with the content more and thinking about how the people I‚Äôm doing the article with can engage with the content. So I‚Äôm focusing more on discussion questions, which also could be generated by the chatbot, but I think I‚Äôm enjoying the questions that I think of and that they think of more. So I guess I kind of save that pleasure for myself. And so that‚Äôs the only way I‚Äôm really using it in a context that is more of a public setting, since I‚Äôm not working right now. Tom: Yeah, well, that‚Äôs cool. That sounds like a worthwhile use. I‚Äôm just thinking back to the whole acceleration topic and how this might fit in. Let‚Äôs say you have 30 different articles that you‚Äôre trying to make more readable or more understandable. If you used an agent and you gave it the task of going through each one of these articles and applying certain style rules, it would probably do a decent job at it, and you could review it at the end. This speaks to this larger goal that many tech writers have, where you might have a whole doc set and you want to make sure that your style guide rules apply to every one of the 100 pages in the doc set, as well as other rules. And you give it this task, and then in the morning, you come back and you review the changes and you hit accept or reject. That kind of acceleration could be interesting. I haven‚Äôt achieved anything like that, but I think that is the promise. And I think many people do think that agents will be a key ingredient in the acceleration equation. But Kurzweil doesn‚Äôt really talk about agents so much, unless I missed that part. He‚Äôs very high-level. Nathan: I‚Äôm searching a PDF of the book right now, and the word ‚Äúagent‚Äù only appears a few times in the body of the book and a few more times in the endnotes. So yeah, it does appear. Tom: I think at a more high level, what he says is that one innovation gives rise to another. He says we‚Äôre now using‚Äîlike, before we had computers, people had to develop computers. But now computers are being used to develop more computer chips. So one invention leads to another. And I see this pretty regularly. I was thinking about just all the docs we produce or the information we produce will then accelerate the creation of other tools and APIs, which will then create more innovation. It does seem commonsensical or logical that things would accelerate because the tools we‚Äôre creating can be used to create more things more quickly. I was trying to think of an example of this. Nathan: How about in the book? Yeah, sure. Or elsewhere outside of it? Tom: Could you even say something that creates code automatically leads to greater creations? Nathan: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, that‚Äôs a great example. The Cursor AI code editor and just the whole integration now making it faster to create additional code. Tom: Yeah, good example. All right, any other themes? Maybe we should move off of acceleration unless people have any more thoughts on that. Mette: Towards the end of the book, he was talking about the Asilomar conference and how they came up with sort of some guideline bylaws by which humanity could use AI. And I guess my thought was, are we really dependent on this one thing to keep everything in check? Otherwise, bad actors are going to intervene. There‚Äôs so much vulnerability there. When I read that part, I was like, ‚ÄúOkay, that sounds great.‚Äù He read some of the bylaws, and I thought, ‚ÄúSounds really great.‚Äù You know, why aren‚Äôt we hearing about this more? What‚Äôs going to happen? Because if they‚Äôre not followed, there are some really bad things that can happen. Tom: I think that is a major criticism Kurzweil has received‚Äîthat he‚Äôs very much a techno-utopian optimist. And especially in contrast to the last book we read with Suleyman‚ÄîSuleyman devoted half of the book to containment strategies and theories. Mette: I know. Tom: And Kurzweil basically just says, ‚ÄúWell, the way to get past these problems is just to build better defense.‚Äù He doesn‚Äôt want to slow down the rate of development or put a bunch of regulation on it. He just wants to build better defensive mechanisms and that requires all of the man-made democratic tools that humanity has in terms of governance, which is threatened by AI, you know, according to Suleyman. So I‚Äôm like, okay, you‚Äôre placing greater weight on a foundation that is kind of crumbling. I don‚Äôt know. Yeah, it really perplexes me, the just variety of attitudes around AI. I also listened to a podcast, This Week in Tech with Leo Laporte. He‚Äôs very much embracing AI. He really wants to accelerate things. I can‚Äôt help but think, is Kurzweil really so fully embracing of AI because he wants things to move faster to achieve the whole longevity escape velocity? Like, does he want things to get in motion before he has to, you know, take his exit off this planet? Because he‚Äôs‚ÄîI don‚Äôt know how old he is, but he‚Äôs been around since going to MIT in 1965. Nathan: So he‚Äôs getting up there. And I know there was a documentary on him, I don‚Äôt know, 10 or 15 years ago, that detailed some of his kind of vitamin life extension regimen, which he is on that train for sure. And he really does want to‚Äîand I can understand this‚Äîhe wants to get to the next paradigm of life extension. And speaking of Father‚Äôs Day, I know he‚Äôs had a preoccupation with kind of reviving the image of his dad, who is deceased. He brings it up maybe once or twice in this book, and he definitely has elsewhere. But I feel like that really deep psychological thing that human beings have, and Ray Kurzweil in particular has, is kind of informing this techno-optimism. And, you know, I don‚Äôt know that Ray Kurzweil is looking at it from maybe just an average person‚Äôs perspective in terms of workers‚Äô rights and environmental wellness and, you know, those sorts of things. He‚Äôs very much in his kind of ivory tower, it seems like, dreaming up these phases, kind of beyond the edge of reality. So he‚Äôs definitely an optimist. I want to be an optimist. Tom: I would love that. That sounds great. Mette: He certainly seems to be relegating all these threats to just, ‚ÄúOh, details to be worked out.‚Äù Tom: Yeah, yeah, for sure. Go ahead. Liam: Yeah, just on‚ÄîI totally agree with y‚Äôall. I was speaking to someone because I didn‚Äôt know who Ray Kurzweil was, and they were like, ‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôre reading that book?‚Äù I was like, ‚ÄúOh, is he actually a famous person?‚Äù When I was like 50 pages in, it was my perception, like, this guy‚Äôs kind of a wild writer. Like, some of these predictions are pretty nuts. Meta‚Äîand I might be pronouncing that wrong, so please‚Ä¶ Mette: Meta. Liam: One thing that stood out to me on page 421, on the very last chapter before the 200-page appendix, which was nuts, Tom‚ÄîI was very afraid you assigned a 600-page book‚Äîhe says at the very end of 421, talking about being cautiously optimistic, he says at the very end, ‚ÄúWe should thus focus work towards a world where the powers of AI are broadly distributed so that it reflects the values of humanity as a whole.‚Äù And I like that he compared that to when we had 64,000 active nuclear warheads, and now we have 9,000. How he practiced nuclear fallout drills, and then we didn‚Äôt have a nuclear fallout, and then how maybe as a world, or the way we use nukes, is actually more reflective of our values of peace than we actually think. I‚Äôm coming up with these ideas on the fly. But just how AI could, if broadly distributed instead of just kept in the hands of the few, if it‚Äôs put in the hands of the many, it will reflect the values of humanity as a whole, is something as a concept I can definitely get behind. Tom: Yeah, that‚Äôs a great debate that has opened up, right? Do you open source and broadly distribute this technology so that everybody has access and you get maybe more checks and balances? Or does it become a tool within the hands of the elite that they keep out of bad actors‚Äô hands, or they try to? Nathan: I have a question or kind of a thought forming on that. ‚ÄúWe should thus work toward a world where the powers of AI are broadly distributed so that its effects reflect the values of humanity as a whole.‚Äù I think that sounds great, and I would not argue for the techno-elite to only have AI. But if we think about another technology that is broadly distributed, so let‚Äôs just say the internet. Does that reflect the values of humanity as a whole? I don‚Äôt know. Tom: Good comparison. Mette: I‚Äôm sorry, could you repeat that? It‚Äôs a good comparison. Nathan: Yeah, and I mean, maybe it‚Äôs a glass-half-empty, glass-half-full kind of conversation, but I use the internet all the time. I love it, of course. But it does seem to reflect not values or virtues, but whatever the opposite of that is, you know, some really kind of negative traits of humanity. And in a lot of ways, it‚Äôs very corrosive to democracy; it‚Äôs very corrosive to mental health. Mette: Yes. And you know, that‚Äôs really, I would think even kind of beyond a debate. So, but he doesn‚Äôt bring that up. When he does all his comparisons, he really doesn‚Äôt bring up the internet, but it‚Äôs a really good one because it was all wonderful, especially in the beginning. And I‚Äôm old, so I remember the beginning. And you know, more recently, we‚Äôve seen the corrosive effects of the internet, particularly on really young people, children who grew up with it, and, you know, cyberbullying, all this stuff that is having a pretty great effect on society. And that‚Äôs worrying and something that he doesn‚Äôt seem to be dealing with. That‚Äôs his ‚Äúdetails.‚Äù Tom: I agree, that‚Äôs a great analogy. I mean, if you think about the truly transformative things that have been rolled out and unleashed, as you pointed out, the internet was believed to be a democratizing force that would lead to things like the Arab Spring and awareness and just greater collaboration and knowledge sharing, breaking down the walls between countries and cultures. And yeah, and now it‚Äôs like people are realizing that that was kind of a dream and the reality is much more corrosive and toxic and polarizing and radicalizing and fragmenting. Yeah, not what people had hoped. I think that‚Äôs totally right on. Nathan: I, just in trying to be critical of my own thoughts, I do recognize that this conversation is made possible by the internet, and I think it‚Äôs very awesome. It‚Äôs very cool. And so maybe if it‚Äôs a question of optimism or pessimism, the answer is ‚Äúyes,‚Äù you know? It‚Äôs both of these things, right? We can have billionaires basically censoring huge chunks of the internet to fit their kind of personal narratives, right? And we can have an Arab Spring. And, you know, maybe‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know. But if AI is, you know, if we can make an analogy between AI and a broadly distributed technology like the internet, there is an optimistic world and a pessimistic world, and they‚Äôre happening at the exact same time. Mette: Or the better angels of our nature and the more evil demons of our nature are all together. Tom: He does spend a lot of time trying to make the case that technology has pretty much improved our lives, even if we don‚Äôt recognize it at the time. Go back a hundred years, and you might be surprised at the level of poverty and disease and so on. But I wanted to make a comment about the growing divide because this is also something that I‚Äôve been thinking about. Yes, a lot of these technologies are being broadly distributed for $20 a month‚Äîwhich maybe that‚Äôs prohibitive, maybe it‚Äôs not. People can get access to a lot of these tools and have an immense amount of knowledge in their pocket. But we‚Äôve also seen a tier of tools that cost $200 a month where you can get a lot more power. And what if we just turned up the dial a little bit and said, ‚ÄúOkay, well, for $500 a month, now you‚Äôve really got the AI that is game-changing.‚Äù Suddenly, you‚Äôve got a group of people who have access to game-changing AI that they then use to maybe cut their workday in half and take another job or just do three times as much. For example, I would like to take and implement one of these AI agents on my API doc course to continuously update it and make it accurate and current in every way on a continual basis. And that becomes a little asset that I can also sell if people want to download the PDF and whatever. You know, like, what if AI enabled just the automation of little side businesses like that and larger ones? You get this growing divide between, yeah, people can access AI, but they get the cheap, crappy, free version. If you really want to have an impact, you‚Äôre going to have to have some money. I don‚Äôt know. Nathan: That‚Äôs a really interesting idea. I wonder, like, why wouldn‚Äôt that happen, you know what I mean? For any company who‚Äôs monetizing AI, why wouldn‚Äôt they do that? I mean, yeah, obviously the $200 a month version, that‚Äôs for content creators, for people who have monetized their YouTube channel. It‚Äôs pretty much what you describe. And then, yeah, why wouldn‚Äôt the more luxury brands of AI kind of come out of that? And then, yeah, what about, you know, $2,000 a month? It seems like that‚Äôs the road we‚Äôre on. Tom: I mean, if you paid $2,000 a month for an AI and it did something that gave you a return on the investment of $4,000, I mean, that would be pretty impressive. I don‚Äôt really know how that would play out, right? But you know, give it a couple of years and maybe we‚Äôll figure out how. You could sketch this out. Like, I can think of one thing I want to do. I want to create a whole course on how to use AI for tech docs, something that I keep thinking I should do, but it‚Äôs a lot of time. It‚Äôs a lot of time outside of work that I don‚Äôt really have. So, but let‚Äôs say I figure‚Ä¶ anyway, I‚Äôm sort of getting off track. But what capabilities will evolve? And this book also made me think that there‚Äôs probably going to be a growing divide between people who can use AI to expand and augment their capabilities versus people who have rejected it. I think you mentioned, Mette, that the message among some employees is that they have to start using AI to double their productivity or find a different company. And yeah, I can see that same sentiment expanding. It‚Äôs like, you want to have the tech writers and the other workers who have figured out how to augment their capabilities five times or more. And all the people who haven‚Äôt are going to be turning to other sorts of lines of work. This growing divide. Mette: Yes, yeah, yeah. Tom: Reading these last two books really makes me feel a sense of urgency to up my skills and knowledge about AI. And even though I am experimenting and using AI heavily and I‚Äôm leading initiatives at my work, like the education initiative for tech writers and AI and so on, I still feel like there‚Äôs just so much I don‚Äôt know and I still feel behind, you know? Mette: And every week it feels like there‚Äôs something new. Tom: Yeah, yeah, people are always sharing new tools. They‚Äôre like, ‚ÄúCheck this out, Tom.‚Äù You know, I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúOh my gosh, I, you know, this new paper, this, that.‚Äù And yeah, that pace of acceleration is really rotating fast. The wheel is going faster. And maybe I have to figure out how to leverage the AI tools to keep up. Or maybe that‚Äôs just part of the new reality, is like, there‚Äôs new stuff every day, you will never absorb it. I don‚Äôt know. Nathan: I think that that‚Äôs true. And I honestly think that that‚Äôs been true for a long time. You know, I remember being a kid and going into the bookstore and then just really being blown away by how many books there are. There‚Äôs not enough time to read. It‚Äôs a thing I struggle with. And, like I said at the beginning, you know, how many book clubs I would love to join. There is always going to be more to know and more to learn. But it has been that way for a really long time. I mean, whenever the printing press came out, right? And now, just in this realm of AI, I mean, we could have GenAI write a book for us right now, you know? And there‚Äôs some kind of‚Ä¶ the graph of that is‚Ä¶ I mean, there‚Äôs just so much content now, you know, more than there are hours of human existence available to consume that content. So I just want to say, I think you‚Äôre doing a great job, Tom. Tom: Well, the scenario that you‚Äôre describing is what Kurzweil is trying to say is that next epoch where biology and machine merge, and you‚Äôll be able to process every book in the bookstore, right? This is where when our brains basically take on these computer-like capabilities through nanobots that are rearranging molecules‚Äîwho knows what‚Äôs happening‚Äîbut then, yeah, his argument is that you will be able to consume a library in a day or an hour or whatever, and you‚Äôll be super intelligent. What are your thoughts on that? I mean, this feels very science-fictiony because I don‚Äôt work in biology. I haven‚Äôt seen, I‚Äôve never experienced Neuralink. I don‚Äôt really see how we‚Äôre going to have this merger between machine and biology. But what are your thoughts on that? Mette: That was the most optimistic part of the book. You know, we don‚Äôt know a lot about the human body. We know even less about the human brain specifically. And we‚Äôre already making these predictions. I don‚Äôt know, I just think there‚Äôs a lot of surprises out there. I kind of had the same reaction as you. For that kind of certainty that Kurzweil seems to have, I don‚Äôt know. Nathan: Yeah, I mean, they haven‚Äôt been able to tame the issues of fully automated driving yet. Mette: They don‚Äôt have an air traffic control system that is running on AI. They barely have one that‚Äôs working off computer software, really. Nathan: It‚Äôs a great point. Liam: I would say, I read an article or a post, like, ‚ÄúThere will be two people in the coming age.‚Äù How much validity this has, who knows. ‚ÄúOne will be the builders and one will be the learners,‚Äù like those who build the software and those who learn about it. And I think that‚Äôs one of the first things that drew me to this book club. Hey, I don‚Äôt think I was built to be a builder. I‚Äôm intellectually curious and I love to read. I‚Äôm clearly not a technical writer, however, I really enjoy the gift of learning. And so I think there will be a lot of good that will come out of just people that learn and don‚Äôt build, because you‚Äôre always going to have people that need to run the ship, and so they need to run the business or make the decisions. And Meta, I agree with you about the cars. I thought his examples about Waymo from Google DeepMind and their ability to simulate 20 million miles from their actual car driving were interesting. And I liked his point at the end of the book that talks about Neuralink. I don‚Äôt understand what the back-and-forth between him and Cassandra was in the very last chapter. I don‚Äôt know who Cassandra is. But he says, ‚ÄúHey, what if regulatory policy prevents us from the Neuralink happening for our neocortex for 10 years?‚Äù And that kind of feels like what‚Äôs happened a little bit for Waymo, from the tiny bit that I know of it. It probably drives a lot safer than I drive. And if regulation opens up for just allowing that, we‚Äôd probably not have 40,000 deaths a year on the roads. But regulation is such a huge part of it as well. Tom: Interesting comments about the builder versus learner. That‚Äôs a point I was thinking about in other contexts. And I think that the promise of this massive merger of machine and biology and this ability to learn at such faster, accelerated scales means that you basically will be able to perform both roles. ‚ÄúBuilder‚Äù won‚Äôt just be the super-detailed engineer-type roles. I mean, we‚Äôve seen this now with ‚Äúvibe coding,‚Äù where if you just can describe something, the application or whatever‚ÄîGemini, whatever you‚Äôre using‚Äîwill try to build it. And it‚Äôs certainly interesting. I was vibe coding something‚ÄîI‚Äôm not an engineer‚Äîand I was just like, I don‚Äôt even understand what this Go code is doing, but it seems to be working for a very small, little, tiny use case. I realize that if I had more engineering knowledge, I‚Äôd be a lot more dangerous. But yeah, this idea that whatever our role is‚Äîtech writer, salesperson, whatever role you have‚Äîthe tools could easily allow us to expand beyond what these roles are. If you can consume a library in a day, I mean, then you could be a rocket scientist or a surgeon or whatever. You would have that knowledge that other roles have, perhaps. So I think maybe‚ÄîI mean, this is the optimistic side‚Äîbut in 2029, when AGI is here, maybe tech writers won‚Äôt exist, but you can do many other roles very capably. I don‚Äôt know. Liam: The concept of‚Ä¶ please, go ahead. I‚Äôm going to say what I thought so I don‚Äôt forget it. Just the augmentation and what that brought, and the lack of learning. Like, we need to learn less for each role. Before, you needed someone who could build shoes as a cobbler, and now you just need someone to be able to run a conveyor belt and pull the shoes down. So just the concept of augmentation, Tom. But Nathan, pass it to you, please. Nathan: Oh, I was going to ask about AGI. So, you know, that‚Äôs a really important milestone on the Law of Accelerating Returns roadmap, as is the merging of biology with nanobots. I wondered about the AGI thing because I‚Äôve heard it said by kind of contemporary or present-day technologists like Sam Altman, he says, ‚ÄúBy one measure, we already have AGI.‚Äù And my understanding is that AGI just means that the AI can perform basically as well as a human in any number of tasks. Is there a hard test for that? Because I feel like we could probably say that with most human tasks right now. Or the point Sam Altman was making is that the goalposts kind of keep getting shifted for AGI. Because if we were to show ChatGPT in its current state to someone from five years ago, it would completely blow their mind, right? It blew my mind two years ago when I asked it to describe a technical procedure in the style of Edgar Allan Poe, and it did it like that. Wow. And now that seems a bit quaint. But yeah, in this conversation, is there any way to kind of refine my understanding of AGI? Would anybody push back on us having AGI right now? Tom: I think the nuances that you‚Äôre bringing up are right on target. And yeah, Kurzweil doesn‚Äôt really get into AGI and define it, and it‚Äôs a subject that is highly contentious and variable depending on who‚Äôs talking. Like you said, the goalpost keeps shifting, and how do you define it? I mean, right now you could ask an AI tool pretty much anything you want, and it‚Äôs probably going to be fairly smart and capable. But what I don‚Äôt see happening is, let‚Äôs say that the AI takes over the controls at my computer, and now I want it to figure out what it should work on, evaluate the bugs in my queue, figure out which ones it should prioritize, who it should contact, whether there‚Äôs enough information to be actionable. Like, there‚Äôs a ton of contextual information that it would need to absorb to do the task of a human in that sense. That makes sense. So anyway, I don‚Äôt know, does anybody have any other thoughts on AGI? Liam? Liam: I would say the Turing test‚ÄîI think I first heard of the Turing test when I watched The Imitation Game with Benedict Cumberbatch a few years ago. And then the example of AlphaGo beating the world leader in Go, and then IBM Watson beating Jeopardy, but then Watson showing the three levels of its guesses. It‚Äôs like, its first guess was ‚Äúthe European Union,‚Äù like ‚ÄúWhat is the Parliament?‚Äù and then it guessed ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs suffrage‚Äù and then ‚ÄúAfrican safari.‚Äù And so what I found fascinating was Ray Kurzweil‚Äôs commenting on this‚Äîand this was kind of‚Ä¶ it comes from the Ship of Theseus, the Greek philosophy of, as I remove one plank, when does it become a new ship? And so, AGI being‚ÄîWatson thinks totally different. And if we make a brain out of brain matter or silicon, it doesn‚Äôt really matter if it has consciousness. That stuff I got a little bit lost in, just the philosophical part of it. But I would say the Turing test comes back to what you said, Tom, about setting AI up. When you were talking about Jules, like setting AI up to do something that has context and can prioritize and doing that in ways that are contextual to human interactions or to everyday tasks. The reason I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs passed the Turing test is because AGI might‚ÄîI mean, AGI has to be really general. It has to be able to talk about the Renaissance and then also empathize with a child who stubs their toe, or be able to discuss with a human something irrational but really important to their mind. Because the reason economics is not an exact science is because humans are irrational. And so I think there is a bunch of stuff that wouldn‚Äôt really make sense to a robot, that wouldn‚Äôt make sense, that could pass the Turing test. So while it might be super intelligent, human-level at building code or creating APIs, it might be really hard to create a therapist AI that helps with a teenage girl or boy that is struggling with bullying or social media issues and with self-image in middle school. And so AI‚Äôs ability to‚Äîand by the way, this confused me‚ÄîAI‚Äôs ability to deceive a human that it is a human, I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs there yet for all the niche parameters. Tom: Yeah, and it seems like a lot of the AI tools are becoming more specialized. Like, you might have a medical AI and you might have a coding AI. We already have that with things like Codex and other things. And yeah, whereas AGI is supposed to operate across domains and be able to absorb this context. I don‚Äôt know how a tool can really pull in all the context that it would need to have awareness. Like, it would have to consume my whole bug queue, all my documentation, all my Gmail, understand who‚Äôs around me, where I am organizationally, and what the releases are coming up just to even operate in a documentation role, let alone, I don‚Äôt know, build rapport with colleagues and so on. Nathan: I feel like that piece, you know, I‚Äôve heard it suggested by some journalists that AI can synthesize different news articles, but it can‚Äôt actually go out there in the world and start talking to people. And to your point about context, I mean, that‚Äôs kind of it, right? It‚Äôs going and just kind of finding out little bits of information about who knows what or who‚Äôs on vacation and who else you have to ask. You know, those kinds of details escape AI right now. But even if it was able to say, ‚ÄúHey Tom, I need to find out X. Where do I go to find that?‚Äù That would, I guess, be a start. But yeah, right now it‚Äôs like an artificial general sophist or something like that, you know, almost pretending that it‚Äôs smart. Tom: Well, hey, before we wrap this up, I wanted to promote the next book just to put it on your radar. So this next book is‚Äî Nathan: Perfect. Wait, what, I missed that. Tom: Oh, the next book. I bought it because I was worried I wasn‚Äôt going to have enough time. Nathan: Oh, you held it up. Got it. Okay. Tom: Yeah, so we‚Äôve got Supremacy: AI, ChatGPT, and the Race That Will Change the World by Parmy Olson. I thought this might be interesting because there does seem to be a tangible sense of the race toward AGI, to build it first. I mean, I‚Äôve heard this in many different contexts where people really want to have their workers double down and move towards this. And I thought it might be interesting to see what this book is about. So I haven‚Äôt read it, but it does seem to get decent reviews. Nathan: It did get an Editor‚Äôs Pick, whatever that‚ÄîI don‚Äôt know how that‚Äôs decided. Financial Times Business Book of the Year 2024. Tom: So it can‚Äôt be that bad with 739 reviews. Nathan: Was it decided by AI? Was it a pick by AI? Tom: I don‚Äôt know. We‚Äôll find out. But usually when books have hundreds of reviews, they‚Äôre going to be substantial. And even this book that we read, despite its flaws, it was thought-provoking and interesting. And gosh, it gave me a lot to think about, and for that, I thought it was worthwhile. But thank you so much for coming to this. I appreciate it. This is kind of nice to have a smaller group today. You‚Äôre able to get to know each other a little more, and you all are very sharp and insightful. So I appreciate your comments and thoughts. Nathan: Yeah, thank you. It‚Äôs been great. Appreciate it. Liam: These are really fun. Suparna: Thanks, everyone. This is great. Tom: Thank you. Have a good rest of your weekend, and I‚Äôll see you next month. All: Bye-bye.

Title: Why Apple is 2025‚Äôs worst-performing Big Tech stock

On 9 June, at Apple Inc.‚Äôs Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), chief executive Tim Cook and his top brass unveiled a slew of updates, including a new ‚Äòliquid glass‚Äô design and enhancements to Apple Intelligence. But analysts, developers and investors were left underwhelmed. The announcements felt incremental, many of the features already exist in rival products. Some had hoped Apple would use the event to mount a dramatic AI comeback. That didn‚Äôt happen. Its shares slipped about 1.5% on the Nasdaq post-keynote. Apple‚Äôs troubles didn‚Äôt begin with WWDC. The event merely spotlighted its deeper struggle to keep pace with competitors. Its share price has dropped nearly 20% so far this year, the steepest decline among the five big tech firms, including Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Google. Read this | Apple opens its trillion-dollar app empire to AI devs at WWDC 2025‚ÄîIndia stands to gain big That drop reflects a mix of investor concerns: sluggish iPhone sales; declining market share in China, one of its biggest markets; rising regulatory scrutiny of its high-margin services business; its faltering AI ambitions; and renewed criticism from US president Donald Trump over its global outsourcing amid tariff threats. In the past six years, about 52% of Apple‚Äôs revenue has come from the iPhone. But the device is in a rut. Growth has been flat for two years, dragging down overall revenue. In the December 2024 quarter, iPhone sales slipped 0.8% year-on-year. In the March quarter, they rose just 1.9%. Earlier growth in iPhones was driven by customers upgrading their phones. They are less willing to do that now. The China challengeChina has long been crucial to Apple‚Äîas a major consumer market and a manufacturing base. Today, it poses a twin threat. Apple‚Äôs deep integration with Chinese supply chains makes it hard to relocate production without disruption. This makes it vulnerable to tariff threats from the Trump administration. It is moving some production to India, but tariff-related risks remain. Read this | No change to Apple's India iPhone plan for now amid Trump's strictures Apple is also facing weakening demand in China. The iPhone's share in the Chinese smartphone market fell to 15% in Q1 of 2025, against 21% in Q4 of 2023. Chinese brands such as Huawei and Xiaomi have gained share, a trend expected to continue. Only 21% of Chinese consumers would choose an iPhone for their next purchase, down from 29% a year ago, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence survey. Apple's position in the country is also complicated by the Chinese government's ban on foreign technology in some workplaces and broader geopolitical tensions. Services face headwindsApple's sluggish iPhone sales have recently been offset by its services business. The division‚Äôs revenues jumped from $46 billion in 2019 to $96 billion in 2024, with its revenue share increasing from 17% to 24%. Profit margins of its services division are double those of its hardware business. However, the practices that drive its services business are under regulatory pressure globally. The fees Apple collects from app developers, and the payments it gets from Google to be the default search engine on its devices (estimated at $20 billion a year), are facing legal challenges. In the US, an antitrust lawsuit from the Department of Justice and 16 states has alleged that Apple stifles competition in cloud gaming, messaging and digital wallets. In Europe, the Digital Markets Act allowed third-party app downloads and alternative payment systems. Following backlash against its App Store commissions of 30%, Apple cut commissions in some categories, but also introduced new fees, angering developers. AI laggardAI is dominated by startups such as OpenAI and Anthropic, which have raised billions. Even traditional competitors like Microsoft, Samsung and other tech companies have integrated AI features into their products, but Apple's progress remains slow. The company lost its position as the world's most valuable company to Microsoft, partly due to concerns about its AI strategy. User and investor disappointment with Apple‚Äôs AI ambitions goes beyond WWDC. The upgraded Siri assistant faced delays due to bugs and performance issues. Apple Intelligence features are limited to newer devices only. The company relies on external partners like OpenAI rather than developing integrated AI solutions internally. AI is connected to Apple's other challenges. iPhone sales have stagnated partly because Apple has failed to create compelling AI features.

Title: Obituary: Carmencita Hederman, former lord mayor of Dublin, city councillor, senator and environmental campaigner

Carmencita Hederman Former lord mayor of Dublin, city councillor, senator and environmental campaigner Carmencita Hederman has died at the age of 85. Her 25 years as an elected representative began when she won a seat as an independent member of Dublin City Council in 1974. She used the soundtrack from the Georges Bizet opera Carmen in her campaign and topped the poll in the Pembroke electoral area. She was born Carmencita Cruess-Callaghan on October 23, 1939, into a family in Blackrock, Co Dublin, headed by bacteriological chemist Dr George Cruess-Callaghan and his wife Ita. Carmencita later studied at Trinity College Dublin. Archbishop of Dublin John Charles McQuaid had banned members of his Catholic congregation from attending TCD, but gave Carmencita a dispensation to enrol as a student there. French and Italian were among the subjects she took and she went on to acquire a Master‚Äôs degree in July 1969. Earlier, in St Patrick‚Äôs Church, Blackrock, on June 26, 1962, she married William (Billy) Hederman, a respected doctor and surgeon from Croom, Co Limerick, who served as president of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) in 1990-92. The couple bought a house on Leeson Street while on honeymoon. In April 1968, when a draft city development plan proposed rezoning the area into office blocks, a letter of opposition she wrote to The Irish Times galvanised her neighbours and a group called Upper Leeson Street Area Residents Association was formed, which successfully campaigned to keep the zone for residential-use only. ‚ÄãOn June 22, 1987, she was elected lord mayor of Dublin, succeeding Bertie Ahern. Hederman garnered support from a ‚Äúrainbow coalition‚Äù of Fine Gael, Labour, Workers‚Äô Party, Progressive Democrats and three Independents, including the late Tony Gregory, and won by a single vote over Fianna F√°il‚Äôs Ned Brennan, who was tipped as the favourite. The first woman to hold the post in 30 years, during her 12 months in office she played a leading role in Dublin‚Äôs millennium celebrations of 1988, marking the takeover of the city by the Irish from the Vikings. She was a strong opponent of what she called ‚Äúdestructive dual carriageways‚Äù in the city centre and their effect on inner-city communities. In August 1989, she was elected as an Independent member of Seanad √âireann on the Dublin University Panel along with Shane Ross and David Norris. She found it a difficult place to make significant progress on issues and did not stand in the next general election. Hederman was very interested in running as an Independent candidate for president of Ireland in 1990. Securing a nomination requires the support of at least four local councils or 20 members of the Oireachtas. She discussed the matter at an early stage with then-Fine Gael leader Alan Dukes, who was prepared to consider nominating her if she joined the party and ran as a Fine Gael candidate. ‚ÄúShe would have liked to be a candidate, but she wasn‚Äôt prepared to adopt the party label,‚Äù he said last week. The party later nominated Austin Currie and the successful candidate was Mary Robinson. More recently, in light of events in Gaza, she supported the successful campaign for TCD to divest from Israeli organisations and academic institutions and companies operating in Occupied Palestine and on the United Nations‚Äô blacklist. She was a mother of five children and grandmother of nine. Her daughter, Wendy, was elected to Dublin City Council as a Progressive Democrat candidate for the Pembroke area in 2004. She was involved in key local issues, but retired from politics in 2007. Predeceased by her husband Billy in 2016, Carmencita Hederman passed away peacefully at the Royal Hospital, Donnybrook, on May 31.

Title: $298 mln Ethereum liquidated across 80K traders: Yet BlackRock keeps buying

With Open Interest at $35B, is this the beginning of ETH‚Äôs stealth rally? Ethereum [ETH]‚Äôs market performance took a sharp hit on the 13th of June, plunging by 9% and liquidating $298 million across 80,000 traders. While panic gripped much of the market, opportunistic investors saw value in the decline, scooping up ETH under the $2,500 mark. The asset dropped from $2,771 to a low of $2,443 before stabilizing near $2,509. Trade war anxieties fueled the broader sell-off, but a closer look reveals bullish undercurrents. Open Interest surged to $35.22 billion in just 24 hours, with top exchanges like CME, Binance, Gate, and Bitget each seeing an average of $4 billion in ETH exposure. This coincided with a modest recovery of ETH‚Äôs price to $2,538.66 at press time, up 0.37% according to CoinMarketCap. Moreover, amidst heightened market volatility, a major Ethereum whale has signaled strong bullish conviction by opening a substantial $16.6 million long position. Despite these mixed signals, BlackRock, currently the largest asset manager globally with $73 billion in crypto exposure, has consistently bought Ethereum daily for over two weeks. This follows BlackRock‚Äôs announcement about its goal to significantly expand influence across both public and private markets, with a plan to boost revenue from $20 billion in 2023 to over $35 billion by 2030. If realized, this growth could further solidify BlackRock‚Äôs role in shaping institutional investment trends across traditional and crypto assets alike. This pattern of strategic buying from deep-pocketed entities suggests a long-term outlook that sees current price levels as an opportunity rather than a risk. Remarking on the same, Jeremy noted, ‚ÄúBlackRock has been buying Ethereum every single day for the past two weeks. They‚Äôve now accumulated $570M worth of $ETH. Smart money isn‚Äôt slowing down, they‚Äôre doubling down.‚Äù As optimism continues to build around Ethereum, institutional accumulation has become increasingly evident. Data from Arkham Intelligence reveals that BlackRock now holds over 1.5 million ETH, valued at approximately $3.83 billion, cementing its position as a dominant force in the Ethereum market. In fact, SharpLink Gaming also recently purchased 176,271 ETH worth $463 million, positioning itself as the top publicly listed Ethereum holder. Additionally, ETH ETFs also saw inflows surging until June, and thus, the question arises: Is Ethereum poised for another rally? Well, technical indicators like RSI and MACD are both below neutral levels, which points to lingering bearish pressure. However, Lookonchain data revealed that whale accumulation of ETH, which points to growing bullish momentum ahead. Source: Lookonchain/X In conclusion, IntoTheBlock data further confirmed the upcoming bullish move as over 77% of ETH holders are currently in profit, which may reflect strong holder confidence and hint at potential upward momentum in the near term.

A 60-YEAR-OLD FATHER was ‚Äúsavagely‚Äù beaten in front of his terrified family when three machine gun-armed intruders forced entry into their home in Shankill, Dublin, on Wednesday, garda√≠ have alleged. Two 17-year-old boys, who cannot be named for legal reasons, and Sean Doran, 26, of Earl Street South and widower Gregory Dunne, 60, from Oliver Bond Flats, both in Dublin 8, were charged with aggravated burglary at a residence in Shanganagh Cliffs, Shankill, Co Dublin and unlawful possession of a Czechoslovakian-made 9mm Skorpian machine pistol. Both charges carry maximum life sentences. Dublin District Court heard the Garda ballistics section stated the gun was ‚Äúcapable of full automatic firing‚Äù. Mr Doran has an additional charge of assault causing harm to the 60-year-old homeowner, who suffered lacerations from blows to his face and head. Evidence stated that he, his wife, aged 63, and their 35-year-old son were in ‚Äúgrave fear‚Äù they would not remain in the house, had moved to a hotel, and were not called to give evidence in the bail hearing. It follows arrests by Gardai from the Dublin Metropolitan East Crime Functioning Area, covering D√∫n Laoghaire, Shankill, Cabinteely, Blackrock and Dundrum. Judge Michele Finan refused bail when they appeared at Dublin District Court on Saturday. They will appear again next week. Each accused separately faced lengthy bail hearings where gardai cited the seriousness of the case, maintaining all four acted in joint enterprise. Concerns were raised about alleged threats and violence used during the incident. One officer submitted it was necessary to refuse bail to preserve the integrity of the proceedings. Garda witnesses stated that the two masked teens in puffer jackets travelled to the location on an e-bike while Mr Doran came in a 2007-reg Honda Accord car driven by Mr Dunne. Garda Liam Carroll alleged that one of the teenagers had a black face cover and approached the house, removed the gun from the front of his trousers and ‚Äúpointed‚Äù at the family through the window. Advertisement Garda Carroll alleged the boys forced their way in the front door while Mr Doran came through a rear entrance before the homeowner was savagely beaten. Detective Garda Michael Murphy told the court that Mr Doran delivered punches and kicks to the man‚Äôs head and face, and there were bloodstains on the accused‚Äôs footwear. He agreed with defence counsel Sam Friel, instructed by solicitor Niall O‚ÄôConnor, that the blood has yet to be analysed. The barrister proposed setting bail with conditions telling the judge his client was about to set up a business and could work from home. Detective Garda Darragh Phelan, the second teenager, used boxer shorts as a balaclava and left with the gun on an e-bike. A civilian witness was said to have observed the youth discarding it before he allegedly drove onto the M50, where he crashed between Junction 12 and 13. Gardai responded to a call from the couple‚Äôs son, who was in a state of distress, saying, ‚ÄúA number of males were attacking his parents‚Äô home, and one had a gun; the male pointed the gun and directed it them‚Äù. The judge was told that the commotion could be heard over the phone line. The car was stopped close to the house, and armed support officers arrived and removed the two men and the boy who was allegedly first to brandish the gun. Garda Aidan Myers agreed with solicitor Yvonne Bambury that her client, Mr Dunne, drove to the house but did not go inside, but the officer added that it was a joint enterprise. The court heard Mr Dunne, a father of two adult children, lost his partner of 40 years in 2021. Solicitor Aoife McTaggart pleaded with the judge to note that the Children Act stated that juvenile detention should be a last resort. She said they were supported in court by visibly upset family members. The solicitor stressed that they adored the boys who would abide by a range of strict conditions. However, while stressing that the four, who had yet to enter pleas, had a presumption of innocence, Judge Finan denied all of the bail applications. The boys will appear at the Children‚Äôs Court on Monday, and the adult co-defendants will face their next hearings at Cloverhill District Court on Thursday. Judge Finan said directions from the Director of Public Prosecutions must be obtained.

Title: 6 Great Vanguard Index Funds For A Buy-And-Hold Portfolio
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/6-best-vanguard-index-funds-for-buy-hold-portfolio/
Time Published: 2025-06-14T15:00:00Z

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. A buy-and-hold portfolio built with Vanguard funds can be cost-efficient, diversified and ... More profitable. Trying to predict where the market‚Äôs headed amid geopolitical unrest and ever-changing tariff policies can be exhausting. Fortunately, you don't have to predict the future to make money investing. A diversified buy-and-hold portfolio plus a good dose of patience can help you reach your wealth goals without timing the market. Vanguard funds are good candidates for buy-and-hold portfolios because they cover popular market segments, and many have low expense ratios. Whether you want a simple two-fund portfolio or something more complex, one or more of the six funds on this list can provide the diversified exposure you need. The table below introduces six Vanguard funds for the buy-and-hold investor. The first two funds, VTI and VOO, provide overlapping exposure to domestic stocks. Most investors will choose one of them as a core, anchor position. The other four funds provide complementary exposure for a well-diversified portfolio. Some of these funds are also available as Vanguard mutual funds, which you may have access to in your 401(k). The Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF represents the entire U.S. stock market, from small to large companies. The fund uses a sampling approach to replicate market returns. This helps keep costs lower versus owning every stock available. Even so, VTI holds more than 3,500 stocks and provides exposure to all economic sectors. VTI is an efficient pick for whole market exposure with its low expense ratio and low tracking error. Tracking error is the performance difference between the fund and its underlying index. VTI‚Äôs tracking error on a NAV basis has historically been one or two basis points. As a core stock holding, you could weight VTI as high as 90%‚Äîassuming you can handle risk and you‚Äôre not investing in other stock funds. More conservative investors would allocate 40% to 80% to VTI, depending on what else is in the portfolio. VTI's average annual return over the past 10 years is 12.14%. The fund does pay quarterly dividends with a 30-day SEC yield of 1.24%. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF invests in the S&P 500, which includes the largest and most successful U.S. public companies. This fund is a popular choice for novice and experienced investors. According to ETF Database, VOO is the largest U.S. ETF as measured by assets under management. Compared to VTI, VOO is more heavily concentrated on big tech stocks. You‚Äôd choose VOO as your core holding if you believe those mega-cap companies will continue their historic growth trajectories. In June 2024, a Morgan Stanley report noted that the Magnificent Seven stocks drove more than half of the S&P 500's 26.3% gain in 2023. Those stocks‚ÄîAlphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla‚Äîhave been less dominant in 2025, but it's hard to count them out. VOO allocation guidelines are the same as VTI‚Äôs. Your exposure can range from 40% to 90%, depending on the rest of your portfolio and your risk tolerance. VOO has returned 12.81% annually on average over the past decade. The fund pays quarterly dividends, with a 30-day SEC yield of 1.24%. Vanguard Small-Cap Value ETF invests in more than 800 domestic small-cap companies. Industrials and financials are the top sectors in the portfolio, followed by consumer discretionary and real estate. Small caps suit a buy-and-hold portfolio because they have good growth potential and some volatility. Longer holding periods smooth out the rough edges and average to positive returns. Small-cap returns have outperformed large caps in multi-year cycles, but not since 2011. Analysts from investment firm Wellington Management and Chartered Financial Analyst Daniel Fang believe small caps will take the lead again soon. An 8% to 10% small-cap allocation is an appropriate starting point for buy-and-hold investors. Remember to consider the small-cap exposure you already have in a total market fund like VTI. VBR has delivered an average annual return of 7.84% since May 2015. The fund pays quarterly dividends with a 30-day SEC yield of 2.1%. The Vanguard Total International Stock ETF invests in more than 8,000 foreign large-cap companies. The fund tracks the FTSE Global Call Cap ex US Index, which includes stocks from emerging and developed markets. Investing outside the U.S. can provide access to lower valuations and potentially higher growth potential. There can be more volatility, too, which underscores the importance of diversification and long holding periods. Buying and holding a broad international fund like VXUS checks both boxes. Charles Schwab recommends an international stock allocation of 5% to 40%, but many investors will opt for 10% to 20%. The David Swensen Portfolio uses a 15% allocation. Swensen formerly managed Yale University‚Äôs endowment fund, famously growing it from $1 billion to $31 billion. VXUS has produced an average annual return of 5.6% since May of 2015. The Vanguard Real Estate Fund offers growth and income potential through its real estate investment trusts (REIT) holdings. The fund tracks the MSCI US Investable Market Real Estate 25/50 index. The index includes about 150 small, mid and large-cap REITs, and the top holding comprises less than 7% of the portfolio. REITs often pay high dividend yields because they distribute 90% of their income to shareholders. A related perk is that REITs do not pay corporate taxes on the distributed income. So REIT investors sidestep the double taxation that occurs with non-REIT companies‚Äîwhen profits are taxed at the corporate level and again with shareholder dividends. A REIT fund also provides access to the real estate market, which typically doesn‚Äôt move in lockstep with stocks. This provides a nice diversification benefit, alongside good returns. The FTSE Nareit All REIT index produced a pretax average annual return of 11.1% between 1972 and 2024, according to data provided by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (Nareit). A Morningstar analysis concludes that a portfolio with 51% stocks, 34% bonds and 15% REITs outperformed a 60-40 split between stocks and bonds more than half the time between 1976 and 2022. A typical REIT allocation would be 5% to 15%. VNQ pays quarterly distributions. The total distributions over the past 12 months were $3.63, which equates to a yield of about 4%. The Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF invests in investment-grade, intermediate-term U.S. bonds. Tax-exempt bonds and TIPS are excluded. Treasury bonds comprise nearly half of the portfolio, with government mortgage-backed securities and corporate bonds making up another 44%. Bonds provide income and relative price stability, two traits that complement stocks. Your allocation to this fund should depend on your risk tolerance. If you don‚Äôt like risk, opt for higher bond exposure‚Äîsay, 50% of your portfolio. If you are comfortable with the volatile nature of stocks, your bond exposure could be as low as 10%. BND pays monthly distributions with a 30-day SEC yield of 4.47%. Bottom Line A buy-and-hold portfolio built with Vanguard funds can be cost-efficient, diversified and profitable. Start by setting target allocations for different asset types‚Äîfrom large caps to REITs and bonds‚Äîbased on your risk tolerance. Then plug matching funds into your allocation formula and wait for your returns to build over time.

Title: 3 ‚ÄòSecret‚Äô Income Plays Throwing Off Huge 7.5%+ Dividend Yields

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Saving money concept Man hand putting Row and coin Write Finance Saving money concept Man hand ... More putting Row and coin Write Finance I‚Äôm just going to come out and say it: If you want to be financially independent (and who doesn‚Äôt?), you must own closed-end funds (CEFs). For those ‚Äúin the know‚Äù about CEFs, the reason is simple: massive yields. As I write, closed-end funds yield 9.1% on average. And game-changing dividends like that are only one way CEFs reward us‚Äîand I‚Äôd argue they‚Äôre not even the best one! The best-in-class CEFs out there‚Äîand here I‚Äôd definitely include the three we‚Äôre going to get into below‚Äîalso offer strong total returns, with price gains and dividends combining to hand us overall returns of 10%+ yearly. And with CEFs, we get a solid indication of when those returns may start to build. It‚Äôs an easy-to-find indicator called the discount to net asset value (NAV). This discount stems from a key difference between CEFs and ETFs: CEFs can‚Äôt issue new shares to new investors post-IPO, so their market prices are often different (and regularly lower) than their per-share portfolio values (their NAV, in other words). So if, say, you buy a CEF with a 10% discount, you‚Äôre buying its portfolio for 10% less than you could if you bought its holdings on the open market. This sets up a nice ‚Äúrinse-and-repeat‚Äù cycle for us: We buy a discounted CEF, collect its huge income stream, then sell at a premium down the road. Of course, these kinds of opportunities don‚Äôt tend to last, and in the last year we‚Äôve seen more CEFs trade at smaller discounts as investors start to clue in. But investors are focusing very tightly on quality here, given recent uncertainty. That‚Äôs got them zeroing in on only those CEFs with strong track records. There are, however, some gems that have been left behind. Let‚Äôs look at three. First up is the Eaton Vance Tax-Advantaged Global Dividend Opportunities Fund (ETO), which should attract a fat premium given the interest in global stocks these days. Yet ETO, with a mix of American mega-caps like NVIDIA (NVDA) and foreign powerhouses like AstraZeneca (AZN), trades at a fat 8.7% discount today. That‚Äôs despite its generous 7.9% dividend, which should be getting more attention. So, by the way, should the fund‚Äôs performance. ETO Total Returns Beyond the discount and dividend, ETO‚Äôs 12.3% annualized return on NAV (orange line above) should also be a shiny lure for investors. But as you can see, ETO‚Äôs market price‚Äìbased total return (in purple) has lagged, inflating its discount from where it was a half-decade ago. That‚Äôs clearly an error on the market‚Äôs part, and it makes ETO well worth a look today. We‚Äôll find an even bigger discrepancy with the Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Buy-Write Income Fund (ETB), a 9.1%-yielder holding S&P 500 mainstays like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), NVIDIA (NVDA), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A). This high-powered roster should put ETB on investors‚Äô radar, yet the gap between its total NAV return (in orange below) and total price return (in purple) is huge. ETB Total Returns With a 11.3% annualized return over the last half-decade (based on NAV), ETB‚Äôs managers have clearly done their job. Yet investors have taken little notice, causing its market price‚Äìbased return to lag, and its discount to widen to 7.8%. Completing the picture is the fact that ETB has averaged a 1.7% premium in the last decade. That gives it plenty of upside as its overdone discount flips to the fund‚Äôs ‚Äúnormal‚Äù premium. Finally, consider the John Hancock Financial Opportunities Fund (BTO), which subscribers to my CEF Insider service might remember. We‚Äôve held BTO twice in the past and have booked nice double-digit total returns both times. BTO, which yields 7.5%, focuses on the financial sector, mainly banking firms, with M&T Bank (MTB), Mississippi-based Renasant Corp. (RNST) and US Bancorp (USB) all top holdings. BTO Total Returns These stocks have given BTO a sprightly 18.4% annualized return on NAV (in purple above) in the last five years. Yet its NAV return is only slightly ahead of its market price‚Äìbased return (in purple). This shows that investors are hesitant to sharply bid up the fund. This is an interesting chart: BTO is priced at a 5.5% premium currently, which sounds pricey but is actually a deal given the fund‚Äôs long-term trend, which includes a premium that‚Äôs hit double digits several times in the last decade. Investors have picked up on this, which is why BTO‚Äôs pricing went from around par earlier this year to today‚Äôs premium. Expect that premium to keep growing, especially if the stock market keeps rising, as well. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Saving money concept Man hand putting Row and coin Write Finance Saving money concept Man hand ... More putting Row and coin Write Finance I‚Äôm just going to come out and say it: If you want to be financially independent (and who doesn‚Äôt?), you must own closed-end funds (CEFs). For those ‚Äúin the know‚Äù about CEFs, the reason is simple: massive yields. As I write, closed-end funds yield 9.1% on average. And game-changing dividends like that are only one way CEFs reward us‚Äîand I‚Äôd argue they‚Äôre not even the best one! The best-in-class CEFs out there‚Äîand here I‚Äôd definitely include the three we‚Äôre going to get into below‚Äîalso offer strong total returns, with price gains and dividends combining to hand us overall returns of 10%+ yearly. And with CEFs, we get a solid indication of when those returns may start to build. It‚Äôs an easy-to-find indicator called the discount to net asset value (NAV). This discount stems from a key difference between CEFs and ETFs: CEFs can‚Äôt issue new shares to new investors post-IPO, so their market prices are often different (and regularly lower) than their per-share portfolio values (their NAV, in other words). So if, say, you buy a CEF with a 10% discount, you‚Äôre buying its portfolio for 10% less than you could if you bought its holdings on the open market. This sets up a nice ‚Äúrinse-and-repeat‚Äù cycle for us: We buy a discounted CEF, collect its huge income stream, then sell at a premium down the road. Of course, these kinds of opportunities don‚Äôt tend to last, and in the last year we‚Äôve seen more CEFs trade at smaller discounts as investors start to clue in. But investors are focusing very tightly on quality here, given recent uncertainty. That‚Äôs got them zeroing in on only those CEFs with strong track records. There are, however, some gems that have been left behind. Let‚Äôs look at three. First up is the Eaton Vance Tax-Advantaged Global Dividend Opportunities Fund (ETO), which should attract a fat premium given the interest in global stocks these days. Yet ETO, with a mix of American mega-caps like NVIDIA (NVDA) and foreign powerhouses like AstraZeneca (AZN), trades at a fat 8.7% discount today.

Title: 8,000 Bitcoins awaken after 5 years ‚Äì Whale strategy or ETF play?

BlackRock or Strategy ‚Äì Who‚Äôs quietly reshaping the market? Bitcoin [BTC] has once again captured global attention, not just for its impressive price performance, but also for an unexpected on-chain development. So, besides Bitcoin holding steady above the historic $100K threshold, trading at $105,049.81 at press time following a 0.38% daily gain per CoinMarketCap, it‚Äôs a recent whale-sized transaction that‚Äôs stirring market gossip. Close to 8,000 Bitcoin (worth over $841M), inactive for the last five years, were recently transferred, as noted by CryptoQuant analyst J.A. Maartunn. Institutions reportedly moved the coins from Coinbase Custody, a digital asset storage service offered by Coinbase for institutional investors. As expected, this transfer has fueled a fresh wave of speculation in the market, with some predicting that high-net-worth entities are strategically accumulating Bitcoin or preparing for upcoming spot ETF allocations. Talking of its impact on Bitcoin‚Äôs price, if investors perceive the transfer as a precursor to a sell-off, it could trigger short-term bearish sentiment and price volatility. But if the move is linked to institutional repositioning or upcoming spot Bitcoin ETF allocations, it may reinforce bullish momentum. Alternatively, if it‚Äôs merely an internal custodial shift, the market may remain unaffected. Needless to say, when institutions shift long-dormant coins stored in top-tier custody platforms, it often points towards a strategic move, not a routine transfer. Some speculators suspect that giants like BlackRock, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), or another major financial entity could be behind the transaction. Moreover, with spot Bitcoin ETFs drawing growing attention and capital, this activity may signal either final accumulation before ETF allocations or the start of a broader distribution strategy. Remarking on the same, Maartunn said, ‚ÄúTheir buying spree might be done for this week.‚Äù This coincided with a sudden wave of geopolitical tension that erupted when Israel struck Iran, triggering risk-off sentiment across global markets, and Bitcoin didn‚Äôt escape the impact. On the 12th of June, BTC briefly dropped to $102,000, extending its weekly losses to 7% as panic gripped both the crypto and traditional financial sectors. U.S. stock markets followed the same downward path, while investors drove gold prices past $3,400 in a rush for safe-haven assets. This sharp divergence drew attention from long-time Bitcoin skeptic Peter Schiff, who argued the price movement signaled a ‚Äúmajor top‚Äù for BTC. In conclusion, although views remain divided, the market‚Äôs reaction highlights how macroeconomic events continue to shape Bitcoin‚Äôs short-term direction.

Title: 5 Stocks To Buy As The Stock Market Nears All-Time Highs
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/5-best-stocks-buy-stock-market-near-all-time-highs/
Time Published: 2025-06-14T13:00:00Z

ByJason Kirsch ByJason Kirsch, Contributor. These five companies have strong competitive positions and compelling growth prospects. The stock market's remarkable recovery from earlier 2025 volatility has investors questioning whether it's still a good time to buy. The S&P 500 hit 6,000 for the first time since February following strong economic data. Subsequently, it fell to a low of 4,910 in April due to Tariff concerns and investor pessimism as Trump rolled out his new economic plans. In May, it bounced back, and despite ongoing Tariff concerns, the S&P 500 closed out the Month with a gain of more than 6%, its best monthly performance since November 2023. Current market conditions present both opportunities and challenges for investors. While some analysts worry about overvaluation, earnings estimates have been revised to 7% growth for 2025, suggesting markets are no longer priced for an adverse outcome. The recent recovery from the spring market correction demonstrates the resilience of quality companies with strong fundamentals. The methodology for selecting these five stocks focused on companies with compelling growth prospects, strong competitive positions and the ability to thrive in various market conditions. I analyzed quantitative metrics, including revenue growth, profit margins and valuation ratios, while also considering qualitative factors such as market leadership, innovation capabilities and long-term strategic positioning. These selections represent diverse sectors that are well-positioned to benefit from current economic trends. Tesla remains the world's leading electric vehicle manufacturer, with expanding operations in energy storage, solar panels and autonomous driving technology. The company has successfully scaled production across multiple global facilities while maintaining industry-leading margins. Despite recent volatility stemming from tensions around Elon Musk‚Äôs involvement in the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which temporarily cut $152 billion from Tesla's market capitalization, the underlying business fundamentals remain strong, with growing EV adoption worldwide. Tesla's market leadership in the rapidly expanding electric vehicle (EV) sector positions it perfectly for long-term growth. The company's vertical integration strategy, from battery production to charging infrastructure, creates substantial competitive advantages. Recent developments in autonomous driving technology and energy storage solutions provide multiple revenue streams beyond traditional automotive sales. The temporary price decline from Elon Musk‚Äôs entanglement with politics and perhaps declining mental stability creates an attractive entry point for long-term investors. Tesla's global expansion, particularly in emerging markets, combined with decreasing battery costs and improving production efficiency, suggests strong earnings growth potential. The company's innovation pipeline, which includes robotaxi services and energy grid solutions, offers significant upside beyond its current valuations. Microsoft stands as one of the world's most valuable companies, dominating cloud computing through Azure, productivity software via Office 365 and emerging AI technologies. The company has successfully transitioned from traditional software licensing to subscription-based services, creating predictable recurring revenue streams. Microsoft shares advanced significantly in early May, with AI developments reigniting investor interest. Microsoft's diversified business model provides stability and growth across multiple technology sectors. The company's leadership in cloud computing continues to expand as enterprises accelerate their digital transformation initiatives. Azure's growth trajectory, combined with Microsoft's early integration of AI across its product suite, positions the company perfectly for the next wave of technology. Microsoft recently secured a significant deal to bring 1 million Copilot users on board from a single enterprise client, potentially generating over $350 million annually. This adds momentum to its AI strategy, following strong Q3 earnings and record-high share prices. With Azure growth holding steady and demand for AI-integrated tools on the rise, the deal reinforces Microsoft‚Äôs position as a market leader. At the same time, the stock trades at a premium, continued execution in cloud and AI could justify the valuation, and support further upside. Palantir specializes in big data analytics and artificial intelligence platforms, serving government agencies and commercial enterprises. The stock has surged nearly 75% this year, leading the Nasdaq 100's constituents so far in 2025, driven by expanding federal government contracts and growing commercial adoption. The company's unique position in data integration and analysis creates substantial competitive moats. Palantir's government contracts provide stable, long-term revenue streams with high switching costs due to the mission-critical nature of their platforms. The company's work for the federal government has grown substantially, creating predictable cash flows that support aggressive growth investments. The expanding commercial segment demonstrates Palantir's ability to monetize its technology beyond government applications. The company's AI and machine learning capabilities position it perfectly for the current technology cycle. As organizations increasingly rely on data-driven decision making, Palantir's platforms become essential infrastructure. The high barriers to entry in this specialized market, combined with strong customer retention rates, suggest sustainable competitive advantages that justify premium valuations. Johnson & Johnson represents one of the world's largest healthcare conglomerates, with diversified operations spanning pharmaceuticals, medical devices and consumer products. The company sustains a broad economic moat through outstanding cash flow generation, a growing research pipeline, and multiple revenue sources. Recent strategic acquisitions, including the $14.6 billion purchase of Intra-Cellular, a biopharmaceutical business, demonstrate ongoing portfolio optimization. Johnson & Johnson's defensive characteristics make it an ideal holding during market volatility, while its pharmaceutical pipeline provides significant growth potential. The company's consistent dividend payments, supported by strong cash flows, offer income stability that's particularly attractive in uncertain economic environments. J&J's global reach and diversified product portfolio provide resilience against regional economic downturns. The healthcare sector's demographic tailwinds, driven by aging populations worldwide, create sustained demand for Johnson & Johnson's products and services. The company's strong research and development capabilities, combined with strategic acquisitions, continuously refresh its product pipeline. J&J's excellent credit rating and financial flexibility enable continued investment in growth opportunities while maintaining shareholder returns. HIMS & Hers operates a direct-to-consumer telemedicine platform, offering personalized healthcare solutions that include treatments for hair loss, sexual wellness, mental health and skincare. The company reported a significant increase in net income for the fourth quarter, generating $26 million in net income, up from $5 million in the same period last year. The platform's subscription-based model creates recurring revenue streams with high customer lifetime value. The digital healthcare revolution accelerated by the pandemic has created permanent behavioral changes in how consumers access healthcare services. HIMS capitalizes on this trend by offering convenient and affordable alternatives to traditional healthcare delivery. The company's direct-to-consumer model eliminates intermediaries, improving margins while reducing costs for patients. HIMS addresses large, underserved markets where traditional healthcare often fails to provide adequate solutions. The company's focus on stigmatized conditions creates intense customer loyalty and reduces price sensitivity. Expanding product offerings and geographic reach provide multiple growth vectors, while the subscription model ensures predictable revenue growth. The digital-first approach positions HIMS perfectly for the future of personalized healthcare delivery. Bottom Line These five stocks represent compelling opportunities as markets near all-time highs, each offering unique advantages for different investor profiles. Tesla provides exposure to the electric vehicle (EV) revolution, Microsoft offers stability with AI growth, Palantir captures the data analytics boom, Johnson & Johnson delivers defensive income with growth potential, and HIMS capitalizes on the digital healthcare transformation. While market timing remains uncertain, these quality companies with strong competitive positions and compelling growth prospects offer attractive risk-adjusted returns for long-term investors navigating today's elevated market levels.

June 14, 2025 08:48 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, June 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company‚Äôs senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance‚Äôs Medicaid members. What‚Äôs more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance‚Äôs rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now ‚Äúexpecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid‚Äù and that it was ‚Äúseeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.‚Äù On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that its missed consensus earnings per share (‚ÄúEPS‚Äù) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, ‚Äúdue to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.‚Äù On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Manage your account ... In the sweltering Las Vegas valley, air conditioning isn't just a luxury; it's a means of survival. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine living in Vegas and not having air conditioning,‚Äù local Kaili Bach shared with 8 News Now. Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 ‚Äî and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how I'm 49 years old and have nothing saved for retirement ‚Äî what should I do? Don't panic. Here are 6 of the easiest ways you can catch up (and fast) Nervous about the stock market in 2025? Find out how you can access this $1B private real estate fund (with as little as $10) So when AC units go on the fritz, residents are likely sweating the cost of a new unit or potential repairs just as much as they‚Äôre sweating the heat. And this summer, staying cool could cost more than ever. A nationwide refrigerant shortage, sparked by new federal environmental mandates, is reportedly sending shockwaves through the HVAC industry and straight into consumers‚Äô wallets. The Environmental Protection Agency recently rolled out new standards requiring AC systems to use more eco-friendly refrigerants, and the shift is creating a domino effect of higher prices, compatibility issues and supply snags. ‚ÄúThe mandate is calling for a lower GWP, which is a Global Warming Potential refrigerant. That‚Äôs what the 454B is,‚Äù James Langley, owner of the HVAC company We Care Air, told 8 News Now. ‚ÄúFor us, our install guys have to use different installation tools and adjust our pricing. Prices of units have gone up by 30% to 40%.‚Äù And that‚Äôs not all, as it‚Äôs not just the refrigerant that‚Äôs in short supply ‚Äî it's the containers it comes in that are also scarce. ‚ÄúIt seems like they don‚Äôt have enough cylinders made to keep up with the demand of refrigerant that‚Äôs needed on all the new units,‚Äù Langley added. For homeowners with older AC units, the problem is even worse. The new refrigerant isn‚Äôt compatible with many legacy systems, which leaves fewer options for consumers and plenty of opportunity for price gouging. ‚ÄúPeople are taking advantage of the situation,‚Äù Langley warned. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs say I came to your home and your compressor is out. We can change that compressor, but now there are those who will charge you double because your only alternative is to get a whole new system, which is even more.‚Äù The new refrigerant rules ‚Äî combined with ongoing trade tensions with China, a big supplier of HVAC inventory ‚Äî are adding fuel to the fire. Langley‚Äôs advice? If your AC is still going strong, hold off on upgrading your unit, as Langley is more concerned about those who may experience AC issues in the months ahead.

Dave Ramsey says this 7-step plan ‚Äòworks every single time‚Äô to kill debt, get rich in America ‚Äî and that ‚Äòanyone‚Äô can do it If your AC unit is working overtime, your wallet might be in for a shock this summer. With AC unit prices surging under the new mandatory refrigerant rules, homeowners may need to get strategic. Here‚Äôs how to stay cool and save some money at the same time. The Inflation Reduction Act is pumping out hefty HVAC tax credits for 2025. Air source heat pumps are quickly becoming the go-to upgrade for savvy homeowners, delivering both heating and cooling in one energy-efficient system. Federal tax credits have been updated with new eligibility rules, making it the perfect time to cash in while cutting your utility bills. Make sure to check and see if you can get a rebate for replacing an old AC unit or installing new technology. You can either get the money back as a rebate or a tax credit. Don‚Äôt let sticker shock force you into an immediate decision. HVAC repairs and replacements can vary, so always get at least a couple of quotes to stay competitive. Many utility companies offer free or low-cost home energy assessments that pinpoint where your system (or insulation, windows and potentially more) is underperforming. Schedule your annual tune-up, which can catch issues early, extend the life of your system and reduce energy waste. Think of it as an oil change for your AC, which is essential and often overlooked. A smart thermostat (like a Nest or Ecobee) adjusts to your habits and slashes energy use. Some utility companies even offer rebates just for installing one. Beyond federal tax credits and rebates, some local power companies and municipal utilities offer their own incentives. You might get cash back for installing high-efficiency AC units, insulation or smart controls like the thermostats mentioned above. To find out what may be available in your area, check the Department of Energy‚Äôs website. Even if you‚Äôre not a professional, there are a few easy maintenance tasks you can take on yourself, like checking the owner‚Äôs manual, keeping the air filters clean or replacing them regularly, and making sure the area around your AC unit is clear of debris so that air can circulate. With smart planning and some well-researched upgrades, you can cool your home without scorching your savings. Claim every credit and rebate that you can, and don‚Äôt overpay in a panic. Your future self (and your utility bill) will likely thank you.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / JUNE 14 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE‚Äôs theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR‚Äôs proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 ‚Äì Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI ‚Äì We attended both Nvidia Corp.‚Äôs GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.‚Äôs investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs‚Äô iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom‚Äôs first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 ‚Äì Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade ‚Äì Sell, hold or double down? ‚Äì Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood‚Äôs ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 ‚Äì Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack ‚Äì It‚Äôs been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we‚Äôve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike‚Äôs earnings print highlights the company‚Äôs impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we‚Äôll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike‚Äôs path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 ‚Äì The unplanned genius of Broadcom‚Äôs route to AI dominance ‚Äì Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn‚Äôt simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom‚Äôs Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 ‚Äì Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off ‚Äì The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed ‚Äì i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 ‚Äì $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft‚Äôs AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We‚Äôll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 ‚Äì Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty ‚Äì As an American, you can‚Äôt help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it‚Äôs a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers‚Ä¶even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel‚Äôs business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel‚Äôs strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 ‚Äì Slicing the Gordian Knot ‚Äì A leap to real time systems of truth ‚Äì In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 ‚Äì Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 ‚Äì Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true ‚Äì ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 ‚Äì 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish ‚Äì According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 ‚Äì Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps ‚Äì We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise‚Äôs operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business ‚Äì e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today‚Äôs data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business‚Äô operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today‚Äôs application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we‚Äôve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 ‚Äì Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions ‚Äì Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR‚Äôs Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 ‚Äì David vs Goliath reimagined ‚Äì OpenAI‚Äôs approach to AI supervision ‚Äì Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI‚Äôs superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI‚Äôs unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We‚Äôll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI‚Äôs characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we‚Äôll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI‚Äôs lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 ‚Äì Moving beyond separation of compute & storage‚Ä¶Journey to the 6th data platform ‚Äì We believe today‚Äôs so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today‚Äôs generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 ‚Äì re:Invent ‚Äô23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS ‚Äì Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon‚Äôs powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ‚Äô23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We‚Äôll review Amazon‚Äôs strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we‚Äôll provide commentary on the chess moves it‚Äôs making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We‚Äôll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 ‚Äì The OpenAI meltdown‚Ä¶Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy ‚Äì Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don‚Äôt quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it‚Äôs more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we‚Äôll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 ‚Äì The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 ‚Äì Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we‚Äôre seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we‚Äôll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 ‚Äì IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity ‚Äì With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 ‚Äì i.e. watsonx. IBM‚Äôs deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM‚Äôs research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We‚Äôll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 ‚Äì The Gen AI power law ‚Äì How data diversity influences adoption ‚Äì Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta‚Äôs Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure‚Äôs AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 ‚Äì AI revenue riddle ‚Äì Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? ‚Äì In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, ‚ÄúYou can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.‚Äù This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow‚Äôs statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990‚Äôs. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics‚Ä¶yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what‚Äôs happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 ‚Äì From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption ‚Äì MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he‚Äôd be disappointed if AI didn‚Äôt lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR‚Äôs Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 ‚Äì Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform ‚Äì In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we‚Äôve used the metaphor ‚ÄúUber for everyone‚Äù to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 ‚Äì Lower for longer‚Ä¶Tech spending remains tepid ‚Äì We‚Äôre getting used to the phrase, ‚Äúhigher for longer,‚Äù referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed‚Äôs tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it‚Äôs a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We‚Äôll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 ‚Äì Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in ‚Äì In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE‚Äôs Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research‚Äôs Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR‚Äôs recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 ‚Äì Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone‚Ä¶how the future of data apps will evolve ‚Äì The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about ‚ÄúUber for all.‚Äù We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 ‚Äì Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next ‚Äì George Kurtz is pumped up‚Ä¶and why not? CrowdStrike‚Äôs business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company‚Äôs products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We‚Äôll review the company‚Äôs recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we‚Äôll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 ‚Äì Copilot or competitor ‚Äì How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath‚Äôs Northstar ‚Äì UiPath‚Äôs recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We‚Äôll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate‚Äôs impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we‚Äôll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 ‚Äì Google goes all in on the AI cloud ‚Äì At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google‚Äôs messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company‚Äôs focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we‚Äôve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google‚Äôs kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We‚Äôll share ETR data that positions Google‚Äôs AI relative to other leaders and we‚Äôll contrast Google‚Äôs data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 ‚Äì Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft‚Ä¶Why Google may not be Next ‚Äì Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake‚Äôs recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company‚Äôs traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake‚Äôs aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 ‚Äì VMware‚Äôs Future ‚Äì Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom‚Äôs Wing ‚Äì The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom‚Äôs acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom‚Äôs rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We‚Äôll share current ETR survey data to place VMware‚Äôs position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week‚Äôs VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 ‚Äì Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance ‚Äì The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they‚Äôre spending more on AI this year, they‚Äôre doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we‚Äôll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 ‚Äì Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven ‚Äì After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôre pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI‚Äôs rising tide. We‚Äôll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 ‚Äì What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares ‚Äì Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft‚Äôs Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we‚Äôve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS‚Äô big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We‚Äôll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 ‚Äì AI gives cyber attackers the advantage‚Ä¶for now ‚Äì Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 ‚Äì AI meets cloud security ‚Äì and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 ‚Äì AI won‚Äôt be a winner takes all market ‚Äì The AI heard ‚Äôround the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that‚Äôs going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 ‚Äì Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack ‚Äì The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it‚Äôs unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data ‚Äì e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week‚Äôs research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance‚Ä¶and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 ‚Äì Connecting the Dots on Snowflake‚Äôs Data Cloud Ambitions ‚Äì Over the past several months we‚Äôve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week‚Äôs Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of ‚ÄúAll Data / All Workloads‚Äù and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake‚Äôs core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn‚Äôt mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week‚Äôs Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake‚Äôs high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we‚Äôll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 ‚Äì HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits ‚Äì HPE‚Äôs announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE‚Äôs LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company‚Äôs recent Discover conference and we‚Äôll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today‚Äôs public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 ‚Äì Uber‚Äôs architecture represents the future of data apps‚Ä¶meet its architects ‚Äì Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company‚Äôs mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company‚Äôs productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you‚Äôd find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber‚Äôs technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber‚Äôs groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We‚Äôll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 ‚Äì Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps‚Ä¶here‚Äôs our take ‚Äì Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we‚Äôll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 ‚Äì Cisco needs to simplify‚Ä¶Here‚Äôs how ‚Äì With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco‚Äôs portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco‚Äôs challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company‚Äôs mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco‚Äôs business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 ‚Äì The future of AI is real time data‚Ä¶Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines ‚Äì The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company‚Äôs value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia‚Äôs momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we‚Äôll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 ‚Äì The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud ‚Äì AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week‚Äôs post. Look past the buzz and you‚Äôll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it‚Äôs a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we‚Äôll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud‚Ä¶what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware‚Äôs future evolves. We‚Äôll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We‚Äôll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 ‚Äì Searching for gold in enterprise AI ‚Äì The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week‚Äôs Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 ‚Äì Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation ‚Äì While we‚Äôve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don‚Äôt see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We‚Äôll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we‚Äôll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 ‚Äì Don‚Äôt be fooled by slowing cloud growth‚Ä¶cost optimization is a feature not a bug ‚Äì The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don‚Äôt kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We‚Äôll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 ‚Äì RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 ‚Äì The narrative from security vendors is organizations don‚Äôt spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe‚Ä¶but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can‚Äôt hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires‚Ä¶but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week‚Äôs episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we‚Äôre excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we‚Äôll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We‚Äôll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto‚Äôs threat intelligence and response division. As well, we‚Äôll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 ‚Äì RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI ‚Äì In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We‚Äôll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we‚Äôll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 ‚Äì Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day ‚Äì On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE‚Äôs culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll share our takeaways from HPE‚Äôs event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri‚Äôs quarterly all-hands meeting. We‚Äôll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We‚Äôll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE‚Äôs market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 ‚Äì Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft ‚Äì A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week‚Äôs guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we‚Äôll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 ‚Äì Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? ‚Äì The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 ‚Äì GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms ‚Äì The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 ‚Äì Databricks faces critical strategic decisions‚Ä¶here‚Äôs why ‚Äì When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We‚Äôll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We‚Äôll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 ‚Äì MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech ‚Äì While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We‚Äôll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We‚Äôll close with the key innovation areas we‚Äôll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 ‚Äì MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business ‚Äì The world‚Äôs leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It‚Äôs become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We‚Äôll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they‚Äôre faring in the telecomms vertical. And we‚Äôll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 ‚Äì Google‚Äôs Point of View on Confidential Computing ‚Äì Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it‚Äôs just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we‚Äôll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let‚Äôs summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 ‚Äì Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 ‚Äì The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won‚Äôt abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what‚Äôs happening in cloud markets ‚Äì not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we‚Äôll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 ‚Äì Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 ‚Äì Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security ‚Äì lots to talk about there ‚Äì generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 ‚Äì ChatGPT Won‚Äôt Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage ‚Äì OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don‚Äôt believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company‚Äôs early entry into the space may not confer ‚Äúgame over‚Äù advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 ‚Äì Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps ‚Äì Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we‚Äôll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 ‚Äì CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization ‚Äì Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it‚Äôs to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data ‚Äúright‚Äù is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 ‚Äì AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive ‚Äì A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We‚Äôll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 ‚Äì Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions ‚Äì Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year‚Äôs enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 ‚Äì How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity ‚Äì Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week‚Äôs cybersecurity update. We‚Äôll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 ‚Äì Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean ‚Äì While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we‚Äôve previously reported, the CISO‚Äôs budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We‚Äôll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren‚Äôt as much. We‚Äôll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 ‚Äì re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud ‚Äì The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives ‚Äì i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud ‚Äì compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier‚Äôs annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We‚Äôll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we‚Äôll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 ‚Äì Snowflake caught in the storm clouds ‚Äì A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we‚Äôve stressed many times, the company‚Äôs management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn‚Äôt matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 ‚Äì Cloudflare‚Äôs Supercloud‚Ä¶What Multi Cloud Could Have Been ‚Äì Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine‚Äì allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company‚Äôs future. In this post, we‚Äôll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We‚Äôll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we‚Äôll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 ‚Äì Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy ‚Äì Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you‚Äôre cruising along thinking‚Ä¶ok that was weird but it‚Äôs clear sailing now‚Ä¶only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations ‚Äì including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll review the implications of this week‚Äôs earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform‚Äôs growth accelerated. We‚Äôll explain why GCP‚Äôs growth is still not fast enough. We‚Äôll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 ‚Äì Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data ‚Äì The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It‚Äôs understandable why there‚Äôs so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we‚Äôre going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 ‚Äì CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next ‚Äì This past week, we saw two of the ‚ÄúBig 3‚Äù cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today‚Äôs cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We‚Äôll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors ‚Äì Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 ‚Äì Analyst Take on Dell ‚Äì Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 ‚Äì Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend ‚Äì Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that‚Äôs clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations‚Ä¶but these levels are still well above historical norms ‚Äì so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good ‚Äì at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs‚Ä¶and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 ‚Äì As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch ‚Äì Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not‚Ä¶ the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there‚Äôs no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it‚Äôs becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can‚Äôt hide behind the macro. Which is why it‚Äôs important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum ‚Äì and relative high spending velocity on their platforms ‚Äì albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 ‚Äì UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course ‚Äì Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath‚Äôs customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company‚Äôs prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 ‚Äì How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform ‚Äì In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike‚Äôs user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 ‚Äì We Have the Data‚Ä¶What Private Tech Companies Don‚Äôt Tell you About Their Business ‚Äì The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there‚Äôs lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn‚Äôt as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you‚Äôre an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we‚Äôve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It‚Äôs called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they‚Äôre able to capture. We‚Äôve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we‚Äôre going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 ‚Äì VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey ‚Äì While the precise direction of VMware‚Äôs future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We‚Äôll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we‚Äôll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 ‚Äì What Black Hat ‚Äô22 tells us about securing the Supercloud ‚Äì Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE‚Äôs supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It‚Äôs a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they‚Äôve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We‚Äôll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We‚Äôll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 ‚Äì Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others ‚Äì At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake‚Äôs Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 ‚Äì What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 ‚Äì The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network‚Ä¶essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner ‚Äì what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud‚Ä¶sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth ‚Äì i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience ‚Äì is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 ‚Äì How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s ‚Äì AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the ‚Äúfree safety‚Äù in the equation ‚Äì i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We‚Äôll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS‚Äô secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 ‚Äì AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity ‚Äì After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we‚Äôll share our view of what‚Äôs changed since our last cyber update in May, we‚Äôll look at the macro environment, how it‚Äôs impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week‚Äôs AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 ‚Äì Amping it up with Frank Slootman ‚Äì Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don‚Äôt need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It‚Äôs called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I‚Äôve read it several times and if you haven‚Äôt picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank‚Äôs philosophy. You‚Äôll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 ‚Äì Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud ‚Äì As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 ‚Äì H1 of ‚Äò22 was ugly‚Ä¶H2 could be worse‚Ä¶Here‚Äôs why we‚Äôre still optimistic ‚Äì After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 ‚Äì Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns ‚Äì Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop‚Äôs relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake‚Äôs Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 ‚Äì Snowflake Summit 2022‚Ä¶All About Apps & Monetization ‚Äì Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop‚Äôs relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake‚Äôs Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 ‚Äì How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard ‚Äì When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW‚Äôs stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli‚Äôs leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they‚Äôd repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn‚Äôt really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman‚Äôs track record of execution‚Ä¶and data. Good bets; but folks really didn‚Äôt appreciate that Snowflake wasn‚Äôt just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud‚Ä¶and we‚Äôve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we‚Äôll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company‚Äôs CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building ‚Äì i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar‚Äôs Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 ‚Äì MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones ‚Äì Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company‚Äôs business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 ‚Äì Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast ‚Äì In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty‚Ä¶nope‚Ä¶they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that‚Äôs inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom‚Äôs planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 ‚Äì Supercloud is becoming a thing ‚Äì Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We‚Äôve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we‚Äôve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we‚Äôve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we‚Äôve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept‚Äôs technical and business feasibility. We‚Äôll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they‚Äôre at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 ‚Äì Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? ‚Äì Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late‚Ä¶Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta‚Äôs performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company‚Äôs stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November‚Ä¶Meanwhile CyberArk‚Äôs recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal ‚Äì In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a ‚Äúgolf clap‚Äù in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World‚Ä¶ and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We‚Äôll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth‚Äôs orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe ‚Äì Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation‚Ä¶the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba‚Äôs cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we‚Äôve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We‚Äôre seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers‚Äô workloads live ‚Äì in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week‚Äôs Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We‚Äôll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what‚Äôs happening in the ‚Äúhybrid zone‚Äù of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter ‚Äì The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely ‚Äî software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we‚Äôve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we‚Äôve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 ‚Äì Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh ‚Äì The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today‚Äôs Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 ‚Äì Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think ‚Äì The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta‚Äôs response have been harsh and the impact on Okta‚Äôs value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company‚Äôs market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta‚Äôs claim that the customer technical impact was ‚Äúnear zero,‚Äù may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta‚Äôs public statements. Okta‚Äôs product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week‚Äôs Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we‚Äôll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 ‚Äì New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending ‚Äì Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we‚Äôre seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We‚Äôll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 ‚Äì Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy ‚Äì There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we‚Äôre talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government‚Äôs track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today‚Äôs policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week‚Äôs Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments‚Äô antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 ‚Äì Snowflake‚Äôs Wild Ride ‚Äì Snowflake‚Ä¶they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That‚Äôs the nature of the business isn‚Äôt it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there‚Äôs no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake‚Äôs stock since its IPO, why it‚Äôs behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 ‚Äì Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle ‚Äì Intel‚Äôs future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company‚Äôs future is in serious jeopardy. It‚Äôs the same story we‚Äôve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel‚Äôs efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today‚Äôs leading foundries and design shops. Intel‚Äôs best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck ‚Äì perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll update you on our latest assessment of Intel‚Äôs competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company‚Äôs February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 ‚Äì RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here‚Äôs What‚Äôs New ‚Äì In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 ‚Äì Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising ‚Äì The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We‚Äôll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 ‚Äì The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes ‚Äì The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS‚Äô dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled ‚ÄúKubernetes.‚Äù In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We‚Äôll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we‚Äôll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 ‚Äì What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond ‚Äì We‚Äôve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won‚Äôt be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don‚Äôt see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 ‚Äì Securing Snowflake ‚Äì The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would ‚Äúchase the chips‚Äù in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds ‚Äì and at the edge ‚Äì practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 ‚Äì Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 ‚Äì The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it‚Äôs had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we‚Äôve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what‚Äôs ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We‚Äôll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 ‚Äì Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse ‚Äì When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It‚Äôs easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it‚Äôs very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 ‚Äì Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management ‚Äì In the 2010‚Äôs, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We‚Äôve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we‚Äôve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 ‚Äì Grading our 2021 Predictions ‚Äì Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we‚Äôll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 ‚Äì Why Oracle‚Äôs Stock is Surging to an All time High ‚Äì On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle‚Äôs success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world‚Äôs most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they‚Äôre convinced Oracle‚Äôs cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll review Oracle‚Äôs most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company‚Äôs cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 ‚Äì Rise of the Supercloud ‚Äì Last week‚Äôs AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world‚Äôs most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it‚Äôs clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS‚Äô cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds‚Äì that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 ‚Äì Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary ‚Äì Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there‚Äôs a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon‚Äôs ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We‚Äôll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 ‚Äì AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum ‚Äì Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers‚Ä¶the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It‚Äôs unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don‚Äôt run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We‚Äôll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 ‚Äì Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability ‚Äì Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye ‚Äì or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called ‚Äúmodern tech stack.‚Äù Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 ‚Äì What Could Disrupt Amazon? ‚Äì Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T ‚Äì off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm ‚Äì The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley ‚Äì broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon ‚Äì has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today‚Äôs trillionaire companies. And we‚Äôll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 ‚Äì Data Mesh‚Ä¶A New Paradigm for Data Management ‚Äì Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it‚Äôs an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it‚Äôs a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 ‚Äì The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real ‚Äì It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We‚Äôve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there‚Äôs little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there‚Äôs a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It‚Äôs unlikely they can buy all that ‚Äì so they‚Äôre going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest ‚Äì between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 ‚Äì The Future of the Semiconductor Industry ‚Äì Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence‚Ä¶these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we‚Äôve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 ‚Äì UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV ‚Äì UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra‚Ä¶creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known‚Ä¶the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week‚Ä¶with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It‚Äôs also ‚ÄúFast Forwarding‚Äù as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 ‚Äì CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 ‚Äì Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR‚Äôs macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 ‚Äì How Cisco can win cloud‚Äôs ‚ÄòGame of Thrones‚Äô ‚Äì Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It‚Äôs doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco‚Äôs dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco‚Äôs portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 ‚Äì The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler ‚Äì Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital ‚Äì i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors‚Äô minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it‚Äôs our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 ‚Äì Thinking Outside the Box‚Ä¶AWS Signals a New Era for Storage ‚Äì By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS‚Äô Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day ‚Äì a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service ‚Äì and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 ‚Äì Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market ‚Äì Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren‚Äôt in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 ‚Äì Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try‚Ä¶ ‚Äì Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta‚Äôs market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 ‚Äì Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s ‚Äì Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 ‚Äì Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 ‚Äì Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year‚Äôs contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we‚Äôll share some takeaways from ETR‚Äôs latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / JUNE 14 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE‚Äôs theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR‚Äôs proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 ‚Äì Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI ‚Äì We attended both Nvidia Corp.‚Äôs GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.‚Äôs investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs‚Äô iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom‚Äôs first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 ‚Äì Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade ‚Äì Sell, hold or double down? ‚Äì Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood‚Äôs ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 ‚Äì Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack ‚Äì It‚Äôs been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we‚Äôve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike‚Äôs earnings print highlights the company‚Äôs impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we‚Äôll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike‚Äôs path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 ‚Äì The unplanned genius of Broadcom‚Äôs route to AI dominance ‚Äì Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn‚Äôt simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom‚Äôs Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 ‚Äì Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off ‚Äì The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed ‚Äì i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 ‚Äì $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft‚Äôs AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We‚Äôll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 ‚Äì Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty ‚Äì As an American, you can‚Äôt help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it‚Äôs a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers‚Ä¶even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel‚Äôs business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel‚Äôs strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 ‚Äì Slicing the Gordian Knot ‚Äì A leap to real time systems of truth ‚Äì In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 ‚Äì Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 ‚Äì Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true ‚Äì ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 ‚Äì 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish ‚Äì According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 ‚Äì Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps ‚Äì We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise‚Äôs operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business ‚Äì e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today‚Äôs data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business‚Äô operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today‚Äôs application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we‚Äôve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 ‚Äì Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions ‚Äì Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR‚Äôs Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 ‚Äì David vs Goliath reimagined ‚Äì OpenAI‚Äôs approach to AI supervision ‚Äì Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI‚Äôs superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI‚Äôs unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We‚Äôll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI‚Äôs characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we‚Äôll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI‚Äôs lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 ‚Äì Moving beyond separation of compute & storage‚Ä¶Journey to the 6th data platform ‚Äì We believe today‚Äôs so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today‚Äôs generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 ‚Äì re:Invent ‚Äô23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS ‚Äì Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon‚Äôs powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ‚Äô23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We‚Äôll review Amazon‚Äôs strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we‚Äôll provide commentary on the chess moves it‚Äôs making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We‚Äôll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 ‚Äì The OpenAI meltdown‚Ä¶Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy ‚Äì Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don‚Äôt quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it‚Äôs more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we‚Äôll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 ‚Äì The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 ‚Äì Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we‚Äôre seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we‚Äôll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 ‚Äì IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity ‚Äì With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 ‚Äì i.e. watsonx. IBM‚Äôs deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM‚Äôs research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We‚Äôll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 ‚Äì The Gen AI power law ‚Äì How data diversity influences adoption ‚Äì Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta‚Äôs Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure‚Äôs AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 ‚Äì AI revenue riddle ‚Äì Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? ‚Äì In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, ‚ÄúYou can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.‚Äù This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow‚Äôs statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990‚Äôs. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics‚Ä¶yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what‚Äôs happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 ‚Äì From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption ‚Äì MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he‚Äôd be disappointed if AI didn‚Äôt lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR‚Äôs Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 ‚Äì Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform ‚Äì In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we‚Äôve used the metaphor ‚ÄúUber for everyone‚Äù to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 ‚Äì Lower for longer‚Ä¶Tech spending remains tepid ‚Äì We‚Äôre getting used to the phrase, ‚Äúhigher for longer,‚Äù referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed‚Äôs tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it‚Äôs a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We‚Äôll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 ‚Äì Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in ‚Äì In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE‚Äôs Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research‚Äôs Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR‚Äôs recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 ‚Äì Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone‚Ä¶how the future of data apps will evolve ‚Äì The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about ‚ÄúUber for all.‚Äù We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 ‚Äì Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next ‚Äì George Kurtz is pumped up‚Ä¶and why not? CrowdStrike‚Äôs business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company‚Äôs products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We‚Äôll review the company‚Äôs recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we‚Äôll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 ‚Äì Copilot or competitor ‚Äì How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath‚Äôs Northstar ‚Äì UiPath‚Äôs recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We‚Äôll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate‚Äôs impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we‚Äôll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 ‚Äì Google goes all in on the AI cloud ‚Äì At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google‚Äôs messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company‚Äôs focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we‚Äôve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google‚Äôs kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We‚Äôll share ETR data that positions Google‚Äôs AI relative to other leaders and we‚Äôll contrast Google‚Äôs data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 ‚Äì Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft‚Ä¶Why Google may not be Next ‚Äì Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake‚Äôs recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company‚Äôs traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake‚Äôs aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 ‚Äì VMware‚Äôs Future ‚Äì Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom‚Äôs Wing ‚Äì The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom‚Äôs acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom‚Äôs rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We‚Äôll share current ETR survey data to place VMware‚Äôs position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week‚Äôs VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 ‚Äì Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance ‚Äì The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they‚Äôre spending more on AI this year, they‚Äôre doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we‚Äôll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 ‚Äì Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven ‚Äì After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôre pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI‚Äôs rising tide. We‚Äôll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 ‚Äì What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares ‚Äì Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft‚Äôs Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we‚Äôve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS‚Äô big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We‚Äôll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 ‚Äì AI gives cyber attackers the advantage‚Ä¶for now ‚Äì Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 ‚Äì AI meets cloud security ‚Äì and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 ‚Äì AI won‚Äôt be a winner takes all market ‚Äì The AI heard ‚Äôround the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that‚Äôs going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 ‚Äì Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack ‚Äì The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it‚Äôs unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data ‚Äì e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week‚Äôs research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance‚Ä¶and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 ‚Äì Connecting the Dots on Snowflake‚Äôs Data Cloud Ambitions ‚Äì Over the past several months we‚Äôve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week‚Äôs Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of ‚ÄúAll Data / All Workloads‚Äù and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake‚Äôs core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn‚Äôt mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week‚Äôs Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake‚Äôs high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we‚Äôll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 ‚Äì HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits ‚Äì HPE‚Äôs announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE‚Äôs LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company‚Äôs recent Discover conference and we‚Äôll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today‚Äôs public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 ‚Äì Uber‚Äôs architecture represents the future of data apps‚Ä¶meet its architects ‚Äì Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company‚Äôs mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company‚Äôs productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you‚Äôd find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber‚Äôs technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber‚Äôs groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We‚Äôll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 ‚Äì Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps‚Ä¶here‚Äôs our take ‚Äì Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we‚Äôll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 ‚Äì Cisco needs to simplify‚Ä¶Here‚Äôs how ‚Äì With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco‚Äôs portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco‚Äôs challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company‚Äôs mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco‚Äôs business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 ‚Äì The future of AI is real time data‚Ä¶Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines ‚Äì The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company‚Äôs value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia‚Äôs momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we‚Äôll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 ‚Äì The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud ‚Äì AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week‚Äôs post. Look past the buzz and you‚Äôll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it‚Äôs a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we‚Äôll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud‚Ä¶what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware‚Äôs future evolves. We‚Äôll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We‚Äôll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 ‚Äì Searching for gold in enterprise AI ‚Äì The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week‚Äôs Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 ‚Äì Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation ‚Äì While we‚Äôve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don‚Äôt see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We‚Äôll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we‚Äôll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 ‚Äì Don‚Äôt be fooled by slowing cloud growth‚Ä¶cost optimization is a feature not a bug ‚Äì The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don‚Äôt kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We‚Äôll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 ‚Äì RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 ‚Äì The narrative from security vendors is organizations don‚Äôt spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe‚Ä¶but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can‚Äôt hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires‚Ä¶but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week‚Äôs episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we‚Äôre excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we‚Äôll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We‚Äôll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto‚Äôs threat intelligence and response division. As well, we‚Äôll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 ‚Äì RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI ‚Äì In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We‚Äôll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we‚Äôll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 ‚Äì Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day ‚Äì On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE‚Äôs culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll share our takeaways from HPE‚Äôs event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri‚Äôs quarterly all-hands meeting. We‚Äôll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We‚Äôll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE‚Äôs market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 ‚Äì Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft ‚Äì A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week‚Äôs guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we‚Äôll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 ‚Äì Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? ‚Äì The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Episode 170 ‚Äì Databricks faces critical strategic decisions‚Ä¶here‚Äôs why ‚Äì When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We‚Äôll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We‚Äôll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 ‚Äì MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech ‚Äì While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We‚Äôll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We‚Äôll close with the key innovation areas we‚Äôll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 ‚Äì MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business ‚Äì The world‚Äôs leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It‚Äôs become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We‚Äôll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they‚Äôre faring in the telecomms vertical. And we‚Äôll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 ‚Äì Google‚Äôs Point of View on Confidential Computing ‚Äì Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it‚Äôs just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we‚Äôll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let‚Äôs summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 ‚Äì Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 ‚Äì The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won‚Äôt abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what‚Äôs happening in cloud markets ‚Äì not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we‚Äôll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last.

Episode 165 ‚Äì Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 ‚Äì Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security ‚Äì lots to talk about there ‚Äì generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 ‚Äì ChatGPT Won‚Äôt Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage ‚Äì OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don‚Äôt believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company‚Äôs early entry into the space may not confer ‚Äúgame over‚Äù advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 ‚Äì Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps ‚Äì Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we‚Äôll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 ‚Äì CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization ‚Äì Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it‚Äôs to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data ‚Äúright‚Äù is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 ‚Äì AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive ‚Äì A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We‚Äôll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 ‚Äì Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions ‚Äì Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year‚Äôs enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 ‚Äì How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity ‚Äì Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week‚Äôs cybersecurity update. We‚Äôll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 ‚Äì Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean ‚Äì While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we‚Äôve previously reported, the CISO‚Äôs budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We‚Äôll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren‚Äôt as much. We‚Äôll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 ‚Äì re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud ‚Äì The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives ‚Äì i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud ‚Äì compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier‚Äôs annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We‚Äôll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we‚Äôll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 ‚Äì Snowflake caught in the storm clouds ‚Äì A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we‚Äôve stressed many times, the company‚Äôs management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn‚Äôt matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 ‚Äì Cloudflare‚Äôs Supercloud‚Ä¶What Multi Cloud Could Have Been ‚Äì Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine‚Äì allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company‚Äôs future. In this post, we‚Äôll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We‚Äôll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we‚Äôll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 ‚Äì Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy ‚Äì Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you‚Äôre cruising along thinking‚Ä¶ok that was weird but it‚Äôs clear sailing now‚Ä¶only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations ‚Äì including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll review the implications of this week‚Äôs earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform‚Äôs growth accelerated. We‚Äôll explain why GCP‚Äôs growth is still not fast enough. We‚Äôll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 ‚Äì Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data ‚Äì The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It‚Äôs understandable why there‚Äôs so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we‚Äôre going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 ‚Äì CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next ‚Äì This past week, we saw two of the ‚ÄúBig 3‚Äù cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today‚Äôs cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We‚Äôll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors ‚Äì Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 ‚Äì Analyst Take on Dell ‚Äì Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 ‚Äì Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend ‚Äì Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that‚Äôs clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations‚Ä¶but these levels are still well above historical norms ‚Äì so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good ‚Äì at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs‚Ä¶and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 ‚Äì As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch ‚Äì Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not‚Ä¶ the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there‚Äôs no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it‚Äôs becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can‚Äôt hide behind the macro. Which is why it‚Äôs important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum ‚Äì and relative high spending velocity on their platforms ‚Äì albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 ‚Äì UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course ‚Äì Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath‚Äôs customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company‚Äôs prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 ‚Äì How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform ‚Äì In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike‚Äôs user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 ‚Äì We Have the Data‚Ä¶What Private Tech Companies Don‚Äôt Tell you About Their Business ‚Äì The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there‚Äôs lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn‚Äôt as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you‚Äôre an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we‚Äôve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It‚Äôs called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they‚Äôre able to capture. We‚Äôve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we‚Äôre going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 ‚Äì VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey ‚Äì While the precise direction of VMware‚Äôs future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We‚Äôll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we‚Äôll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 ‚Äì What Black Hat ‚Äô22 tells us about securing the Supercloud ‚Äì Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE‚Äôs supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It‚Äôs a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they‚Äôve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We‚Äôll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We‚Äôll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 ‚Äì Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others ‚Äì At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake‚Äôs Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 ‚Äì What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 ‚Äì The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network‚Ä¶essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner ‚Äì what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud‚Ä¶sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth ‚Äì i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience ‚Äì is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 ‚Äì How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s ‚Äì AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the ‚Äúfree safety‚Äù in the equation ‚Äì i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We‚Äôll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS‚Äô secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 ‚Äì AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity ‚Äì After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we‚Äôll share our view of what‚Äôs changed since our last cyber update in May, we‚Äôll look at the macro environment, how it‚Äôs impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week‚Äôs AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 ‚Äì Amping it up with Frank Slootman ‚Äì Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don‚Äôt need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It‚Äôs called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I‚Äôve read it several times and if you haven‚Äôt picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank‚Äôs philosophy. You‚Äôll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 ‚Äì Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud ‚Äì As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 ‚Äì H1 of ‚Äò22 was ugly‚Ä¶H2 could be worse‚Ä¶Here‚Äôs why we‚Äôre still optimistic ‚Äì After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 ‚Äì Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns ‚Äì Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop‚Äôs relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake‚Äôs Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 ‚Äì Snowflake Summit 2022‚Ä¶All About Apps & Monetization ‚Äì Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop‚Äôs relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake‚Äôs Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 ‚Äì How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard ‚Äì When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW‚Äôs stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli‚Äôs leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they‚Äôd repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn‚Äôt really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman‚Äôs track record of execution‚Ä¶and data. Good bets; but folks really didn‚Äôt appreciate that Snowflake wasn‚Äôt just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud‚Ä¶and we‚Äôve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we‚Äôll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company‚Äôs CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building ‚Äì i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar‚Äôs Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 ‚Äì MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones ‚Äì Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company‚Äôs business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 ‚Äì Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast ‚Äì In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty‚Ä¶nope‚Ä¶they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that‚Äôs inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom‚Äôs planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 ‚Äì Supercloud is becoming a thing ‚Äì Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We‚Äôve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we‚Äôve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we‚Äôve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we‚Äôve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept‚Äôs technical and business feasibility. We‚Äôll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they‚Äôre at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 ‚Äì Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? ‚Äì Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late‚Ä¶Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta‚Äôs performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company‚Äôs stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November‚Ä¶Meanwhile CyberArk‚Äôs recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal ‚Äì In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a ‚Äúgolf clap‚Äù in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World‚Ä¶ and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We‚Äôll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth‚Äôs orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe ‚Äì Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation‚Ä¶the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba‚Äôs cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we‚Äôve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We‚Äôre seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers‚Äô workloads live ‚Äì in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week‚Äôs Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We‚Äôll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what‚Äôs happening in the ‚Äúhybrid zone‚Äù of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter ‚Äì The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely ‚Äî software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we‚Äôve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we‚Äôve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 ‚Äì Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh ‚Äì The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today‚Äôs Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 ‚Äì Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think ‚Äì The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta‚Äôs response have been harsh and the impact on Okta‚Äôs value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company‚Äôs market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta‚Äôs claim that the customer technical impact was ‚Äúnear zero,‚Äù may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta‚Äôs public statements. Okta‚Äôs product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week‚Äôs Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we‚Äôll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 ‚Äì New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending ‚Äì Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we‚Äôre seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We‚Äôll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 ‚Äì Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy ‚Äì There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we‚Äôre talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government‚Äôs track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today‚Äôs policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week‚Äôs Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments‚Äô antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 ‚Äì Snowflake‚Äôs Wild Ride ‚Äì Snowflake‚Ä¶they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That‚Äôs the nature of the business isn‚Äôt it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there‚Äôs no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake‚Äôs stock since its IPO, why it‚Äôs behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 ‚Äì Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle ‚Äì Intel‚Äôs future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company‚Äôs future is in serious jeopardy. It‚Äôs the same story we‚Äôve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel‚Äôs efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today‚Äôs leading foundries and design shops. Intel‚Äôs best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck ‚Äì perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll update you on our latest assessment of Intel‚Äôs competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company‚Äôs February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 ‚Äì RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here‚Äôs What‚Äôs New ‚Äì In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 ‚Äì Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising ‚Äì The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We‚Äôll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 ‚Äì The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes ‚Äì The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS‚Äô dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled ‚ÄúKubernetes.‚Äù In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We‚Äôll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we‚Äôll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 ‚Äì What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond ‚Äì We‚Äôve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won‚Äôt be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don‚Äôt see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 ‚Äì Securing Snowflake ‚Äì The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would ‚Äúchase the chips‚Äù in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds ‚Äì and at the edge ‚Äì practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 ‚Äì Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 ‚Äì The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it‚Äôs had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we‚Äôve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what‚Äôs ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We‚Äôll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 ‚Äì Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse ‚Äì When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It‚Äôs easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it‚Äôs very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 ‚Äì Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management ‚Äì In the 2010‚Äôs, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We‚Äôve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we‚Äôve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 ‚Äì Grading our 2021 Predictions ‚Äì Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we‚Äôll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 ‚Äì Why Oracle‚Äôs Stock is Surging to an All time High ‚Äì On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle‚Äôs success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world‚Äôs most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they‚Äôre convinced Oracle‚Äôs cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll review Oracle‚Äôs most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company‚Äôs cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 ‚Äì Rise of the Supercloud ‚Äì Last week‚Äôs AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world‚Äôs most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it‚Äôs clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS‚Äô cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds‚Äì that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 ‚Äì Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary ‚Äì Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there‚Äôs a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon‚Äôs ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We‚Äôll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 ‚Äì AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum ‚Äì Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers‚Ä¶the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It‚Äôs unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don‚Äôt run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We‚Äôll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 ‚Äì Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability ‚Äì Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye ‚Äì or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called ‚Äúmodern tech stack.‚Äù Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 ‚Äì What Could Disrupt Amazon? ‚Äì Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T ‚Äì off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm ‚Äì The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley ‚Äì broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon ‚Äì has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today‚Äôs trillionaire companies. And we‚Äôll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 ‚Äì Data Mesh‚Ä¶A New Paradigm for Data Management ‚Äì Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it‚Äôs an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it‚Äôs a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 ‚Äì The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real ‚Äì It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We‚Äôve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there‚Äôs little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there‚Äôs a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It‚Äôs unlikely they can buy all that ‚Äì so they‚Äôre going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest ‚Äì between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 ‚Äì The Future of the Semiconductor Industry ‚Äì Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence‚Ä¶these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we‚Äôve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 ‚Äì UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV ‚Äì UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra‚Ä¶creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known‚Ä¶the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week‚Ä¶with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It‚Äôs also ‚ÄúFast Forwarding‚Äù as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 ‚Äì CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 ‚Äì Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR‚Äôs macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 ‚Äì How Cisco can win cloud‚Äôs ‚ÄòGame of Thrones‚Äô ‚Äì Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It‚Äôs doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco‚Äôs dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco‚Äôs portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 ‚Äì The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler ‚Äì Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital ‚Äì i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors‚Äô minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it‚Äôs our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 ‚Äì Thinking Outside the Box‚Ä¶AWS Signals a New Era for Storage ‚Äì By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS‚Äô Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day ‚Äì a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service ‚Äì and share some new data on how we see the market evolving.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / JUNE 14 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE‚Äôs theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR‚Äôs proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 ‚Äì Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI ‚Äì We attended both Nvidia Corp.‚Äôs GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.‚Äôs investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs‚Äô iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom‚Äôs first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 ‚Äì Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade ‚Äì Sell, hold or double down? ‚Äì Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood‚Äôs ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 ‚Äì Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack ‚Äì It‚Äôs been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we‚Äôve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike‚Äôs earnings print highlights the company‚Äôs impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we‚Äôll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike‚Äôs path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 ‚Äì The unplanned genius of Broadcom‚Äôs route to AI dominance ‚Äì Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn‚Äôt simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom‚Äôs Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 ‚Äì Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off ‚Äì The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed ‚Äì i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 ‚Äì $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft‚Äôs AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We‚Äôll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 ‚Äì Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty ‚Äì As an American, you can‚Äôt help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it‚Äôs a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers‚Ä¶even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel‚Äôs business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel‚Äôs strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 ‚Äì Slicing the Gordian Knot ‚Äì A leap to real time systems of truth ‚Äì In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 ‚Äì Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 ‚Äì Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true ‚Äì ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 ‚Äì 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish ‚Äì According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 ‚Äì Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps ‚Äì We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise‚Äôs operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business ‚Äì e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today‚Äôs data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business‚Äô operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today‚Äôs application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we‚Äôve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 ‚Äì Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions ‚Äì Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR‚Äôs Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 ‚Äì David vs Goliath reimagined ‚Äì OpenAI‚Äôs approach to AI supervision ‚Äì Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI‚Äôs superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI‚Äôs unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We‚Äôll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI‚Äôs characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we‚Äôll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI‚Äôs lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 ‚Äì Moving beyond separation of compute & storage‚Ä¶Journey to the 6th data platform ‚Äì We believe today‚Äôs so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today‚Äôs generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 ‚Äì re:Invent ‚Äô23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS ‚Äì Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon‚Äôs powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ‚Äô23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We‚Äôll review Amazon‚Äôs strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we‚Äôll provide commentary on the chess moves it‚Äôs making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We‚Äôll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 ‚Äì The OpenAI meltdown‚Ä¶Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy ‚Äì Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don‚Äôt quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it‚Äôs more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we‚Äôll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 ‚Äì The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 ‚Äì Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we‚Äôre seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we‚Äôll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 ‚Äì IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity ‚Äì With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 ‚Äì i.e. watsonx. IBM‚Äôs deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM‚Äôs research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We‚Äôll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 ‚Äì The Gen AI power law ‚Äì How data diversity influences adoption ‚Äì Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta‚Äôs Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure‚Äôs AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 ‚Äì AI revenue riddle ‚Äì Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? ‚Äì In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, ‚ÄúYou can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.‚Äù This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow‚Äôs statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990‚Äôs. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics‚Ä¶yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what‚Äôs happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 ‚Äì From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption ‚Äì MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he‚Äôd be disappointed if AI didn‚Äôt lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR‚Äôs Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 ‚Äì Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform ‚Äì In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we‚Äôve used the metaphor ‚ÄúUber for everyone‚Äù to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 ‚Äì Lower for longer‚Ä¶Tech spending remains tepid ‚Äì We‚Äôre getting used to the phrase, ‚Äúhigher for longer,‚Äù referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed‚Äôs tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it‚Äôs a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We‚Äôll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 ‚Äì Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in ‚Äì In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE‚Äôs Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research‚Äôs Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR‚Äôs recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk.

In June, we put forth our scenario about ‚ÄúUber for all.‚Äù We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 ‚Äì Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next ‚Äì George Kurtz is pumped up‚Ä¶and why not? CrowdStrike‚Äôs business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company‚Äôs products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We‚Äôll review the company‚Äôs recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we‚Äôll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 ‚Äì Copilot or competitor ‚Äì How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath‚Äôs Northstar ‚Äì UiPath‚Äôs recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We‚Äôll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate‚Äôs impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we‚Äôll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 ‚Äì Google goes all in on the AI cloud ‚Äì At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google‚Äôs messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company‚Äôs focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we‚Äôve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google‚Äôs kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We‚Äôll share ETR data that positions Google‚Äôs AI relative to other leaders and we‚Äôll contrast Google‚Äôs data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 ‚Äì Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft‚Ä¶Why Google may not be Next ‚Äì Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake‚Äôs recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company‚Äôs traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake‚Äôs aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 ‚Äì VMware‚Äôs Future ‚Äì Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom‚Äôs Wing ‚Äì The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom‚Äôs acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom‚Äôs rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We‚Äôll share current ETR survey data to place VMware‚Äôs position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week‚Äôs VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 ‚Äì Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance ‚Äì The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they‚Äôre spending more on AI this year, they‚Äôre doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we‚Äôll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 ‚Äì Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven ‚Äì After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôre pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI‚Äôs rising tide. We‚Äôll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 ‚Äì What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares ‚Äì Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft‚Äôs Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we‚Äôve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS‚Äô big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We‚Äôll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 ‚Äì AI gives cyber attackers the advantage‚Ä¶for now ‚Äì Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 ‚Äì AI meets cloud security ‚Äì and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 ‚Äì AI won‚Äôt be a winner takes all market ‚Äì The AI heard ‚Äôround the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that‚Äôs going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 ‚Äì Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack ‚Äì The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it‚Äôs unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data ‚Äì e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week‚Äôs research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance‚Ä¶and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 ‚Äì Connecting the Dots on Snowflake‚Äôs Data Cloud Ambitions ‚Äì Over the past several months we‚Äôve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week‚Äôs Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of ‚ÄúAll Data / All Workloads‚Äù and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake‚Äôs core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn‚Äôt mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week‚Äôs Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake‚Äôs high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we‚Äôll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 ‚Äì HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits ‚Äì HPE‚Äôs announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE‚Äôs LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company‚Äôs recent Discover conference and we‚Äôll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today‚Äôs public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 ‚Äì Uber‚Äôs architecture represents the future of data apps‚Ä¶meet its architects ‚Äì Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company‚Äôs mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company‚Äôs productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you‚Äôd find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber‚Äôs technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber‚Äôs groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We‚Äôll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 ‚Äì Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps‚Ä¶here‚Äôs our take ‚Äì Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we‚Äôll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 ‚Äì Cisco needs to simplify‚Ä¶Here‚Äôs how ‚Äì With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco‚Äôs portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco‚Äôs challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company‚Äôs mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco‚Äôs business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 ‚Äì The future of AI is real time data‚Ä¶Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines ‚Äì The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company‚Äôs value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia‚Äôs momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we‚Äôll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 ‚Äì The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud ‚Äì AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week‚Äôs post. Look past the buzz and you‚Äôll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it‚Äôs a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we‚Äôll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud‚Ä¶what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware‚Äôs future evolves. We‚Äôll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We‚Äôll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 ‚Äì Searching for gold in enterprise AI ‚Äì The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week‚Äôs Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 ‚Äì Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation ‚Äì While we‚Äôve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don‚Äôt see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We‚Äôll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we‚Äôll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 ‚Äì Don‚Äôt be fooled by slowing cloud growth‚Ä¶cost optimization is a feature not a bug ‚Äì The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don‚Äôt kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We‚Äôll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 ‚Äì RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 ‚Äì The narrative from security vendors is organizations don‚Äôt spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe‚Ä¶but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can‚Äôt hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires‚Ä¶but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week‚Äôs episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we‚Äôre excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we‚Äôll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We‚Äôll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto‚Äôs threat intelligence and response division. As well, we‚Äôll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 ‚Äì RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI ‚Äì In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We‚Äôll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we‚Äôll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 ‚Äì Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day ‚Äì On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE‚Äôs culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll share our takeaways from HPE‚Äôs event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri‚Äôs quarterly all-hands meeting. We‚Äôll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We‚Äôll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE‚Äôs market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 ‚Äì Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft ‚Äì A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week‚Äôs guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we‚Äôll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 ‚Äì Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? ‚Äì The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Episode 170 ‚Äì Databricks faces critical strategic decisions‚Ä¶here‚Äôs why ‚Äì When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We‚Äôll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We‚Äôll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 ‚Äì MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech ‚Äì While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We‚Äôll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We‚Äôll close with the key innovation areas we‚Äôll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 ‚Äì MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business ‚Äì The world‚Äôs leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It‚Äôs become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We‚Äôll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they‚Äôre faring in the telecomms vertical. And we‚Äôll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 ‚Äì Google‚Äôs Point of View on Confidential Computing ‚Äì Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it‚Äôs just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we‚Äôll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let‚Äôs summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 ‚Äì Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 ‚Äì The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won‚Äôt abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what‚Äôs happening in cloud markets ‚Äì not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we‚Äôll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 ‚Äì Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 ‚Äì Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security ‚Äì lots to talk about there ‚Äì generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 ‚Äì ChatGPT Won‚Äôt Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage ‚Äì OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don‚Äôt believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company‚Äôs early entry into the space may not confer ‚Äúgame over‚Äù advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 ‚Äì Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps ‚Äì Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we‚Äôll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 ‚Äì CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization ‚Äì Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it‚Äôs to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data ‚Äúright‚Äù is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 ‚Äì AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive ‚Äì A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We‚Äôll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 ‚Äì Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions ‚Äì Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year‚Äôs enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 ‚Äì How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity ‚Äì Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week‚Äôs cybersecurity update. We‚Äôll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 ‚Äì Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean ‚Äì While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we‚Äôve previously reported, the CISO‚Äôs budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We‚Äôll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren‚Äôt as much. We‚Äôll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 ‚Äì re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud ‚Äì The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives ‚Äì i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud ‚Äì compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier‚Äôs annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We‚Äôll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we‚Äôll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 ‚Äì Snowflake caught in the storm clouds ‚Äì A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we‚Äôve stressed many times, the company‚Äôs management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn‚Äôt matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 ‚Äì Cloudflare‚Äôs Supercloud‚Ä¶What Multi Cloud Could Have Been ‚Äì Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine‚Äì allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company‚Äôs future. In this post, we‚Äôll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We‚Äôll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we‚Äôll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 ‚Äì Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy ‚Äì Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you‚Äôre cruising along thinking‚Ä¶ok that was weird but it‚Äôs clear sailing now‚Ä¶only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations ‚Äì including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll review the implications of this week‚Äôs earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform‚Äôs growth accelerated. We‚Äôll explain why GCP‚Äôs growth is still not fast enough. We‚Äôll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 ‚Äì Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data ‚Äì The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It‚Äôs understandable why there‚Äôs so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we‚Äôre going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 ‚Äì CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next ‚Äì This past week, we saw two of the ‚ÄúBig 3‚Äù cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today‚Äôs cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We‚Äôll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors ‚Äì Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 ‚Äì Analyst Take on Dell ‚Äì Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 ‚Äì Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend ‚Äì Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that‚Äôs clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations‚Ä¶but these levels are still well above historical norms ‚Äì so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good ‚Äì at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs‚Ä¶and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 ‚Äì As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch ‚Äì Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not‚Ä¶ the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there‚Äôs no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it‚Äôs becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can‚Äôt hide behind the macro. Which is why it‚Äôs important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum ‚Äì and relative high spending velocity on their platforms ‚Äì albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 ‚Äì UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course ‚Äì Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath‚Äôs customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company‚Äôs prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 ‚Äì How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform ‚Äì In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike‚Äôs user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 ‚Äì We Have the Data‚Ä¶What Private Tech Companies Don‚Äôt Tell you About Their Business ‚Äì The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there‚Äôs lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn‚Äôt as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you‚Äôre an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we‚Äôve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It‚Äôs called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they‚Äôre able to capture. We‚Äôve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we‚Äôre going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 ‚Äì VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey ‚Äì While the precise direction of VMware‚Äôs future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We‚Äôll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we‚Äôll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 ‚Äì What Black Hat ‚Äô22 tells us about securing the Supercloud ‚Äì Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE‚Äôs supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It‚Äôs a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they‚Äôve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We‚Äôll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We‚Äôll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 ‚Äì Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others ‚Äì At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake‚Äôs Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 ‚Äì What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 ‚Äì The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network‚Ä¶essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner ‚Äì what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud‚Ä¶sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth ‚Äì i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience ‚Äì is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 ‚Äì How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s ‚Äì AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the ‚Äúfree safety‚Äù in the equation ‚Äì i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We‚Äôll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS‚Äô secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 ‚Äì AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity ‚Äì After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we‚Äôll share our view of what‚Äôs changed since our last cyber update in May, we‚Äôll look at the macro environment, how it‚Äôs impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week‚Äôs AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 ‚Äì Amping it up with Frank Slootman ‚Äì Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don‚Äôt need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It‚Äôs called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I‚Äôve read it several times and if you haven‚Äôt picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank‚Äôs philosophy. You‚Äôll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 ‚Äì Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud ‚Äì As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 ‚Äì H1 of ‚Äò22 was ugly‚Ä¶H2 could be worse‚Ä¶Here‚Äôs why we‚Äôre still optimistic ‚Äì After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 ‚Äì Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns ‚Äì Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop‚Äôs relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake‚Äôs Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 ‚Äì Snowflake Summit 2022‚Ä¶All About Apps & Monetization ‚Äì Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop‚Äôs relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake‚Äôs Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 ‚Äì How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard ‚Äì When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW‚Äôs stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli‚Äôs leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they‚Äôd repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn‚Äôt really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman‚Äôs track record of execution‚Ä¶and data. Good bets; but folks really didn‚Äôt appreciate that Snowflake wasn‚Äôt just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud‚Ä¶and we‚Äôve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we‚Äôll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company‚Äôs CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building ‚Äì i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar‚Äôs Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 ‚Äì MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones ‚Äì Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company‚Äôs business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 ‚Äì Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast ‚Äì In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty‚Ä¶nope‚Ä¶they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that‚Äôs inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom‚Äôs planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 ‚Äì Supercloud is becoming a thing ‚Äì Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We‚Äôve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we‚Äôve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we‚Äôve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we‚Äôve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept‚Äôs technical and business feasibility. We‚Äôll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they‚Äôre at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 ‚Äì Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? ‚Äì Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late‚Ä¶Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta‚Äôs performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company‚Äôs stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November‚Ä¶Meanwhile CyberArk‚Äôs recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal ‚Äì In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a ‚Äúgolf clap‚Äù in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World‚Ä¶ and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We‚Äôll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth‚Äôs orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe ‚Äì Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation‚Ä¶the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba‚Äôs cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we‚Äôve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We‚Äôre seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers‚Äô workloads live ‚Äì in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week‚Äôs Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We‚Äôll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what‚Äôs happening in the ‚Äúhybrid zone‚Äù of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter ‚Äì The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely ‚Äî software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we‚Äôve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we‚Äôve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 ‚Äì Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh ‚Äì The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today‚Äôs Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 ‚Äì Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think ‚Äì The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta‚Äôs response have been harsh and the impact on Okta‚Äôs value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company‚Äôs market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta‚Äôs claim that the customer technical impact was ‚Äúnear zero,‚Äù may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta‚Äôs public statements. Okta‚Äôs product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week‚Äôs Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we‚Äôll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 ‚Äì New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending ‚Äì Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we‚Äôre seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We‚Äôll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 ‚Äì Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy ‚Äì There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we‚Äôre talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government‚Äôs track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today‚Äôs policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week‚Äôs Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments‚Äô antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 ‚Äì Snowflake‚Äôs Wild Ride ‚Äì Snowflake‚Ä¶they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That‚Äôs the nature of the business isn‚Äôt it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there‚Äôs no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake‚Äôs stock since its IPO, why it‚Äôs behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 ‚Äì Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle ‚Äì Intel‚Äôs future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company‚Äôs future is in serious jeopardy. It‚Äôs the same story we‚Äôve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel‚Äôs efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today‚Äôs leading foundries and design shops. Intel‚Äôs best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck ‚Äì perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll update you on our latest assessment of Intel‚Äôs competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company‚Äôs February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 ‚Äì RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here‚Äôs What‚Äôs New ‚Äì In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 ‚Äì Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising ‚Äì The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We‚Äôll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 ‚Äì The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes ‚Äì The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS‚Äô dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled ‚ÄúKubernetes.‚Äù In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We‚Äôll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we‚Äôll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 ‚Äì What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond ‚Äì We‚Äôve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won‚Äôt be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don‚Äôt see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 ‚Äì Securing Snowflake ‚Äì The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would ‚Äúchase the chips‚Äù in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds ‚Äì and at the edge ‚Äì practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 ‚Äì Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 ‚Äì The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it‚Äôs had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we‚Äôve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what‚Äôs ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We‚Äôll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 ‚Äì Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse ‚Äì When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It‚Äôs easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it‚Äôs very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 ‚Äì Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management ‚Äì In the 2010‚Äôs, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We‚Äôve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we‚Äôve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 ‚Äì Grading our 2021 Predictions ‚Äì Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we‚Äôll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 ‚Äì Why Oracle‚Äôs Stock is Surging to an All time High ‚Äì On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle‚Äôs success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world‚Äôs most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they‚Äôre convinced Oracle‚Äôs cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll review Oracle‚Äôs most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company‚Äôs cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 ‚Äì Rise of the Supercloud ‚Äì Last week‚Äôs AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world‚Äôs most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it‚Äôs clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS‚Äô cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds‚Äì that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 ‚Äì Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary ‚Äì Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there‚Äôs a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon‚Äôs ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We‚Äôll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 ‚Äì AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum ‚Äì Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers‚Ä¶the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It‚Äôs unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don‚Äôt run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We‚Äôll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 ‚Äì Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability ‚Äì Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye ‚Äì or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called ‚Äúmodern tech stack.‚Äù Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 ‚Äì What Could Disrupt Amazon? ‚Äì Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T ‚Äì off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm ‚Äì The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley ‚Äì broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon ‚Äì has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today‚Äôs trillionaire companies. And we‚Äôll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 ‚Äì Data Mesh‚Ä¶A New Paradigm for Data Management ‚Äì Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it‚Äôs an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it‚Äôs a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 ‚Äì The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real ‚Äì It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We‚Äôve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there‚Äôs little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there‚Äôs a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It‚Äôs unlikely they can buy all that ‚Äì so they‚Äôre going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest ‚Äì between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 ‚Äì The Future of the Semiconductor Industry ‚Äì Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence‚Ä¶these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we‚Äôve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 ‚Äì UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV ‚Äì UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra‚Ä¶creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known‚Ä¶the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week‚Ä¶with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It‚Äôs also ‚ÄúFast Forwarding‚Äù as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 ‚Äì CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 ‚Äì Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade.

Episode 100 ‚Äì How Cisco can win cloud‚Äôs ‚ÄòGame of Thrones‚Äô ‚Äì Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It‚Äôs doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco‚Äôs dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco‚Äôs portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 ‚Äì The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler ‚Äì Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital ‚Äì i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors‚Äô minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it‚Äôs our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 ‚Äì Thinking Outside the Box‚Ä¶AWS Signals a New Era for Storage ‚Äì By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS‚Äô Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day ‚Äì a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service ‚Äì and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 ‚Äì Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market ‚Äì Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren‚Äôt in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 ‚Äì Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try‚Ä¶ ‚Äì Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta‚Äôs market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 ‚Äì Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 ‚Äì Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year‚Äôs contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR.

Title: After a week with the Nintendo Switch 2, these are the 4 things I love and 3 I don‚Äôt

With no major Nintendo games releasing for a while and better and cheaper ways of playing indie titles, my original Switch had been gathering dust for months; I‚Äôd largely pivoted to spending my fleeting gaming hours on my PC rig, a Steam Deck OLED, and testing out a few exciting new Android handhelds. But then it went on sale, and I got an email from a retailer to say they had limited stock, and, well‚Ä¶ here we are. I‚Äôve owned Nintendo home consoles and handhelds stretching back to the Super Nintendo, so I‚Äôve seen the many, many ups and downs of the Kyoto innovators‚Äô weirdest and most wonderful hardware launches. But in all that time, there was one thing missing: ‚Äú2‚Äù. The Switch 2 represents the first ever numbered console follow-up from Nintendo, and it‚Äôs hardly surprising considering the Switch‚Äôs overwhelming sales figures and general popularity. Nevertheless, I was curious to see if it could earn that sequel status, so I kept my impromptu pre-order. After a week of playing around with the Switch 2, I can confirm that the unique home-handheld hybrid setup hasn‚Äôt lost the sauce, and there are plenty of upgrades to get excited about. However, it‚Äôs not the perfect successor I was hoping it would be, either. Put simply, the performance bump over the original Switch is the single biggest reason to buy the Switch 2. In handheld mode, the Switch 2 can run games in 1080p at 120fps. In docked mode, you‚Äôll get up to 4K at 60fps, with some games confirmed to benefit from NVIDIA‚Äôs Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) upscaling tech for improved performance. What that means is even uber-demanding titles like Cyberpunk 2077 are now possible to play on a Nintendo console. Meanwhile, first-party games like Mario Kart World and the superbly-named Donkey Kong Bananza ‚Äî launching in July ‚Äî can up the size of their worlds, increase the number of particles and other bits on screen, and generally look far more visually and technically impressive than any Nintendo game to date. Perhaps the most underrated upgrade is the eShop experience, which is now fluid and doesn‚Äôt take an age to load when you‚Äôre simply trying to check the latest (usually very stingy) batch of game sale prices. There‚Äôs a significant hit to battery life compared to the original Switch (I‚Äôve been getting 3-4 hours on a single charge; not terrible but not great), and I think the lack of variable refresh rate support when docked is a strange omission (it‚Äôs there in handheld), but the fact that we‚Äôre in the ballpark of PS4-like performance and visual clarity from a Nintendo console is an obvious win. Thanks to a combo of hardware compatibility and an emulation layer, the Switch 2 can play most of the Switch 1‚Äôs vast library of games. That‚Äôs already great, and a huge improvement over other Nintendo console generation leaps, where backwards compatibility was the exception rather than the rule. It‚Äôs also compatible with Switch 1 accessories, so you can keep using your Nintendo Switch Pro Controller, and even pair the original Joy-Cons to keep up with your exercises in Ring Fit (sorry, Labo fans, you‚Äôre out). But the real reason backwards compatibility is such a big win builds on everything I said about the performance gap. Thanks to some timely updates, and in some cases even without patches, there are many games that now run significantly better on Switch 2. The best example of this is Pok√©mon Scarlet and Violet, the best-selling Pok√©mon games of all time and the only entry in the long-running series I had yet to play because it was genuinely unplayable for me on Switch 1. The textures are still a bit gnarly, but the vomit-inducing frame rate drops, razor edges on objects, painful load times, and awful pop-in are long gone when you click the same cartridge into a Switch 2 ‚Äî it‚Äôs a revelation (check out an hour of it here if you don‚Äôt believe me). Of course, Nintendo being Nintendo, it couldn‚Äôt stop itself from making the improvements slightly consumer-unfriendly and overcomplicated, so some performance upgrades are gated behind paid Nintendo Switch 2 Editions, such as is the case with the Switch‚Äôs two The Legend of Zelda classics, Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom (and yes, I know you get both ‚Äúfree‚Äù with Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack, but you still pay for that!). Nevertheless, the fact that exploring Hyrule in HDR at a steady frame rate is even possible in the first place is something to cherish. Hands up, I was wrong on this one. The decision to shift from a gorgeous OLED on the Switch OLED refresh back to an LCD panel like the launch Switch 1 was the primary reason I wasn‚Äôt going to buy the Switch 2. I knew it‚Äôd be better than that horrible display on the first Switch ‚Äî LCD has come a long way in recent years ‚Äî but as someone who bought both a Switch and a Steam Deck twice over to get an OLED screen on their respective model refreshes, I was sure the Switch 2 couldn‚Äôt pull this off and I‚Äôd be better served waiting for the inevitable Switch 2 OLED. And to be honest, I‚Äôll still probably buy that when it happens ‚Äî OLED blacks can‚Äôt be matched even by the Switch 2‚Äôs excellent LCD ‚Äî but the larger, more vibrant, higher refresh rate, HDR, and VRR-enabled 1080p screen is shockingly nice. If you‚Äôre holding out for the same reason I was going to, then I‚Äôd encourage you to find a demo model in a store (or hope one of your friends snagged one of the rare launch units), and give it a look ‚Äî it‚Äôs far better than you think it‚Äôll be. There was a bit of buzz pre-launch, accusing Nintendo of playing it safe with the Switch 2, and there‚Äôs some validity in that, frankly. If the console were to be rebranded as the long-rumored but never-to-materialize Switch Pro, I don‚Äôt think anyone would have questioned the nomenclature; it‚Äôs essentially a beefed-up Switch with some extra features. Those wanting to see the wild creativity of the Nintendo that brought us a cube-shaped console with a random hand grip, the Wiimote, a dual-screened handheld with a stylus, or the many, many bizarre accessories of past decades, spanning the ungainly Power Glove all the way to the Labo VR box, will come away sorely disappointed with a console that is far more in line with an Xbox or PlayStation generational shift than any previous Nintendo evolution. But ‚Äòkeep it simple, stupid,‚Äô is a saying for a reason. Perhaps burned by the aggressively misjudged Wii to Wii U transition (and paying for it in sales), the Switch 2 is an exercise in being smart enough not to mess with a successful formula. All the core tenets of the Switch 1 are preserved, with tweaks made where it counts that go beyond a mere performance boost. The UI is slightly cleaner and smoother, but immediately recognizable. The Joy-Cons now snap into place via magnets, and while you might get a nasty pinch if you‚Äôre not careful, it‚Äôs safer than shoving a Switch 1 Joy-Con back on the wrong way (ask me how I know this). Handheld mode is much improved with the larger display, and you no longer have to do battle with a dangling cable when you need a charge, thanks to the top USB-C port. Other additions like GameShare (sharing a game with someone to play together with one copy) and the Switch 2 Camera setup also make this a more socially friendly console, an area in which Nintendo has historically struggled, particularly in the online space. Seeing someone‚Äôs reactions in a little bubble next to their racer in Mario Kart World, even if it‚Äôs at a slideshow-like refresh rate, is a very Nintendo take on modern gaming essentials. So no, the Switch 2 isn‚Äôt a moonshot project, but it‚Äôs all the better for it. Mostly‚Ä¶ The Switch 2 is a big boy compared to the Switch 1, but it‚Äôs still nowhere close to the size or weight of the beefy Steam Deck. So why can I not use it in handheld mode for as long as Valve‚Äôs behemoth? The answer is ergonomics. I have an inflammatory disease that manifests as fairly consistent aches in my hands, but I can play on the Steam Deck for hours without any issues because the weight distribution and curved design mold to my palms and grip. This wasn‚Äôt the case with the original Switch, and it‚Äôs even worse with the Switch 2. The new Joy-Cons have more features and look nicer than ever, but the harder edges are more uncomfortable to hold. People swore by Hori Split Pad Pro replacements for a reason on Switch 1, and I can see the same thing happening again here. Beyond ergonomics and my tolerance, the Switch 2 Joy-Cons still feel underbaked. Teardowns have revealed that the Switch 2 Joy-Con joysticks are based on the same potentiometer tech as the original Joy-Cons. You know, the ones that consistently succumbed to stick drift. Hall effect and Tunneling Magnetoresistance (TMR) are table stakes on the best controllers now, and it‚Äôs baffling that Nintendo didn‚Äôt take greater measures to fix one of the biggest pain points of the Switch 1. Instead, that time perhaps went into making the Switch 2 Joy-Cons usable as a mouse ‚Äî time poorly spent if so, while they do technically work for games like Civilization VII or even shooters like Fortnite, there‚Äôs a good reason mouse companies don‚Äôt make products that look like this: they‚Äôre painfully uncomfortable after about 10 minutes of use. The Switch 2 dock equally feels like Nintendo could‚Äôve done so much more. Docking the console doesn‚Äôt offer any additional peace of mind over the original Switch and dock combo regarding potential screen damage; it still has solid plastic on either side, which necessitates real care when you‚Äôre reengaging the device to switch between handheld and home modes. And while the Switch 2 itself got a second USB-C port, the dock still has a whopping zero. It‚Äôs two USB-A ports all over again, so charging controllers will require one of those USB-A-to-USB-C cables many of us have been trying to eliminate from our gadget lives. Where Nintendon‚Äôt, others will. dbrand kindly sent me over its KillSwitch case, which immediately solved my Joy-Con woes by adding rubberized, textured ergonomic casing, and improves the dock experience via an adapter so you can dock the Switch 2 externally. The Ultra bundle I received also has the idiot-proof Prism 2.0 screen protectors, which I highly recommend for your Switch 2 (or really any gadget dbrand makes them for). I‚Äôm also holding out hope that there‚Äôs a Hori Split Pad Pro or an equivalent made for Switch 2 to permanently fix the Joy-Cons and give them more reliable sticks and better grips as standard. If you can actually find one to buy, the Switch 2 itself isn‚Äôt cheap. I‚Äôd say that $449 is a fair price for a modern console, especially when you consider that it‚Äôs a hybrid system that can cover portable and TV play, and that the Steam Deck OLED is another $100 on top at its minimum entry. But the Switch 2 ecosystem is expensive, more so than the Deck and even more so than a traditional console from Microsoft or Sony. $80 games are apparently the new norm, so asking that for Mario Kart World stings, but it‚Äôs not beyond expectation, especially when the cost of game development is at an all-time high. However, Nintendo has a knack for rarely ever reducing the price of its games. $80 now may drop to $60-$70, but based on recent history, you shouldn‚Äôt ever expect to see Steam sale or even PSN/Xbox sale level of price drops on first-party Nintendo games. I‚Äôm still yet to pick up 2019‚Äôs Fire Emblem: Three Houses, despite loving the series, because it‚Äôs always stuck at MSRP, and I can get 2-3 games from my wishlist elsewhere for that price. Likewise, third-party games and indies do go on sale more often, but the sticker price is typically higher than in other ecosystems (and this may get worse if Nintendo doesn‚Äôt fix another issue I‚Äôll get to in a moment). Then there are the extras that come with any console, but still add up. 256GB base storage is a big leap from the 32GB of the original Switch and even the 64GB of the OLED model, but you‚Äôll still likely need more room for all your games before long, and the Switch 2 is only compatible with microSD Express cards, which start at around $50-60 for a 128GB card, and rise in cost from there for more storage. A Switch Online account is required for online play, and the Expansion Pack is needed for some emulation and additional perks. The USB-C camera is $54.99, and if you want a Pro controller with a capture button, that‚Äôll be a hefty $85 add-on. Overall, the Switch 2, even when you factor in the extras, isn‚Äôt exorbitantly expensive, but with more competition in the handheld space in particular from the Steam Deck and the first wave of Steam OS machines, Xbox‚Äôs ambitions to fix Windows for portable play, more and more breakout titles coming to mobile (e.g. Balatro), and the ever-increasing number of ultra-affordable retro handhelds, Nintendo isn‚Äôt the only game in town anymore if you want to play on the go. Okay, so this is confusing, so bear with me. In its infinite wisdom, Nintendo decided to make the act of buying games more complicated than it needed to be with the introduction of Game-Key Cards. When you buy one of these boxed Game-Key Card games from a retail store, you get a regular Nintendo Switch 2 cartridge, but the game isn‚Äôt stored on the cartridge, only an access key. Instead, when you put the cartridge into your console, it‚Äôll trigger the system to download the title. To Nintendo‚Äôs credit, the packaging for Game-Key Card games has clear branding to differentiate them from a native Switch 2 game that is stored on the cartridge. There are also upsides to this approach, such as cheaper production costs for indie studios who don‚Äôt have to buy larger storage cartridges. On the consumer end, you can also share and sell Game-Key Cards (Nintendo did an awful job at communicating this at launch, with this huge detail only coming out of an interview), which you can‚Äôt do with previous digital-centric brick-and-mortar store purchases, which had a single-use game code. But if only it were that simple. For starters, Game-Key Cards are no better than code slips for game preservation. If game publishers or Nintendo take the necessary servers offline, that key won‚Äôt do anything. And the silly part is, even though Game-Key Cards exist, there were still two Nintendo Switch 2 launch games ‚Äî Civilization VII and Split Fiction ‚Äî that had a slip in the box, not a cartridge! Even my Switch 2 and Mario Kart World bundle came with a code for the racer, not a Game-Key Card. More alarming is the number of Game-Key Card games vs. actual cartridges, with the former outnumbering the latter ‚Äî there‚Äôs a handy list on reddit that is keeping track of each release. Reports are circulating that the number of Game-Key Card games is so high because Nintendo has only supplied 64GB Switch 2 cartridges for companies that want to offer the full physical game, as opposed to the Switch 1, which had a range, reportedly with multiple options and going as low as 4GB. With a suggested $16 cost price of each 64GB full cartridge for Switch 2, it‚Äôs easy to see why publishers and indie developers have opted to save money per sale by buying cheaper Game-Key Cards that require only storage enough for an activation. The real disadvantage here plays into the Switch‚Äôs very purpose ‚Äî a simple, plug-and-play handheld that doesn‚Äôt require jumping through any hoops. That paradigm continues to be unraveled by confusing initiatives like the Game-Key Cards, and, to a lesser extent, Switch 2 Editions. Here‚Äôs hoping Nintendo fixes this dumb issue and offers more card sizes soon. When the dust settles and the restocks start hitting, I can safely recommend the Nintendo Switch 2 if you want to play the very best Nintendo can offer in the best possible way. Personally, I‚Äôm excited enough to play Metroid Prime 4: Beyond on a platform that can hit 4K at 60fps on my TV that I could justify it to myself. That said, if there‚Äôs nothing on the horizon from Nintendo‚Äôs first-party game slate that catches your eye, you might want to hold off, either until something does pop up that‚Äôs Switch 2-only, or plays so poorly on the original Switch that it comes time to upgrade. But Nintendo consoles live and die by Nintendo‚Äôs own games, and if you‚Äôre looking instead for a handheld for a far broader experience of AAA and indies, I would recommend at least considering options like the Steam Deck ($549 at Manufacturer site), other Steam OS handhelds like the Lenovo Legion Go S ($499.99 at Manufacturer site), and perhaps even waiting to see what comes of the Xbox Ally devices. We‚Äôre no longer in a world where handhelds without a Nintendo sticker are a niche curiosity, and while the cost of entry is slightly higher elsewhere, the long-term costs are often a lot lower, and the plug-and-play advantage Nintendo previously had isn‚Äôt quite as secure as it once was. There‚Äôs also the lingering possibility of a Switch 2 OLED, which I‚Äôd guess is inevitable, but I doubt we‚Äôll see it for at least 3-5 years. In the meantime, you could be enjoying playing on a console that does almost everything you‚Äôd want from a Switch successor. It‚Äôs not as exciting or as innovative as you might want or expect from the big N, but even when Nintendo plays it safe, there‚Äôs still a unique magic to be found.

Despite the rising fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD), data from Polymarket offers a contrasting perspective, suggesting several altcoin ETFs remain poised for potential approval. In response to ongoing regulatory scrutiny, major asset managers Bitwise, Canary, and Grayscale have taken a proactive step by amending their Solana [SOL] ETF filings to include staking. This feature would allow funds to earn rewards by staking the Solana held in custody. These updated S-1 filings aim to address the SEC‚Äôs concerns, but according to a source cited by Reuters, the agency appears to be in no rush to greenlight the launches. Remarking on this, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart said, ‚ÄúI think there needs to be a back and forth with the SEC and issuers to iron out details, so I doubt it. If anyone remembers the Bitcoin ETF launch, there were *A LOT* of filings over the preceding couple months before launch.‚Äù While the spotlight remains on the growing number of amended Solana ETF filings, it‚Äôs worth recalling that the journey for spot crypto ETFs in the U.S. has been long and hard fought. Spot Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs gained approval only in January 2024, more than ten years after Gemini‚Äôs Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss submitted the original application back in 2013. In the case of Solana, VanEck was the first U.S.-based firm to propose a spot ETF in mid-2024, and interestingly, one of the last to revise its S-1 filing to incorporate staking provisions. Interestingly, BlackRock is absent in the Solana ETF race, and this silence raises questions about the firm‚Äôs intentions in the altcoin ETF space. Expressing on the matter, Seyffart noted, ‚ÄúThey haven‚Äôt yet. But I would not be surprised if they were to eventually do that. But right now it doesn‚Äôt seem like they will be in the first wave (whenever these launch).‚Äù Despite the SEC‚Äôs apparent lack of urgency around altcoin ETF approvals, market sentiment remains strikingly optimistic. According to Polymarket data, the odds of a Solana ETF being approved in 2025 stood at 91% at the time of reporting. This bullish outlook appears to be mirrored in Solana‚Äôs performance, with the token trading at $146.40 following a modest 0.92% daily increase, as per CoinMarketCap. While delays may suggest caution, they don‚Äôt necessarily signal denial. As ETF analyst James Seyffart had aptly noted, ‚ÄúDelays on spot crypto ETFs are expected. A bunch of XRP ETPs have dates in next few days. If we‚Äôre gonna see early approvals from the SEC on any of these assets ‚Äî i wouldn‚Äôt expect to see them until late June or early July at absolute earliest. More likely to be in early 4Q.‚Äù This shows that the lack of movement doesn‚Äôt equate to rejection, leaving the door open for approval despite regulatory hesitations.

Title: A YOLO stock trade and a frugal lifestyle: One millennial's unorthodox ‚Äî and risky ‚Äî path to being done with retirement saving by 35
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/coast-fire-financial-independence-retire-early-stock-market-asts-investing-2025-6
Time Published: 2025-06-14T09:40:01Z
Full Content:
In January, 35-year-old Corey Forsythe stopped making automatic monthly contributions to his retirement account. After eight years of saving and investing, he said he hit $1.125 million across his investments in index funds, stocks, and a 401(k) retirement account. By his calculation, it was enough to fund $120,000 a year in retirement starting at age 60. Forsythe, a pharmacist, has reached Coast FIRE, a subcategory of the FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) movement, meaning that he's saved enough for retirement and can now let his investments grow on their own while he focuses solely on covering his other expenses. "Coast FIRE always reminded me of when, in pharmacy school, I would try as hard as I could at the beginning of the semester so that by the time the final exam came around, I only needed to get above a 20% or 30% on the test," Forsythe said. "That's how I view Coast FIRE, try really hard and invest as much as possible so that later on you can coast and enjoy your life while you're still young enough to." At the beginning of his Coast FIRE journey, Forsythe aimed to invest $500,000 of his earned income relatively early in his career, which he broke down into a 70/20/10 split. He would allocate 70% of that $500,000 to a mutual fund tracking the broader stock market, 20% of it to an individual stock pick, and keep the remaining 10% in a cash emergency fund. After reaching his $1.125 million Coast FIRE goal in January, Forsythe has been putting his extra money into a savings account to build up his cash reserves. His total holdings across accounts have grown to surpass $2 million, documents viewed by Business Insider showed. While Forsythe certainly followed conventional Coast FIRE tactics such as living frugally and investing regularly, a key part of his success can be attributed to a single so-called YOLO bet ‚Äî defined as an aggressive, high-risk strategy where an investor dedicates a large chunk of their portfolio to a single trade. Forsythe made his YOLO bet on AST SpaceMobile (ASTS), which he first came across on the Reddit forum r/WallStreetBets in 2022. The stock has a niche following on Reddit and X, dubbed the "SpaceMob", which Forsythe has been monitoring along with company news and earnings reports over the last few years. Combining insights from the online community and his own research, Forythe said he built the confidence to buy 35,000 shares of the stock at $2.88 apiece in 2024. It amounted to a roughly $100,000 wager on ASTS at a time when sentiment was overwhelmingly bearish. The stock is now trading around $39, bringing Forsythe's ASTS holding to more than $1.2 million ‚Äî and he says he hasn't sold any yet. He acknowledges the investment was a massive risk ‚Äî and that other people shouldn't treat his good fortune as a replicable model ‚Äî but it did work out well for him. Another unconventional strategy Forsythe employed was not prioritizing paying down his student-loan debt right away. "I have a lot of friends who are still trying to pay off their loans as fast as possible, even going as far as still living at home," Forsythe told BI. "After paying them off, their net worth was zero." To Forsythe, it didn't make sense to forgo stock-market returns to pay off his loans faster, particularly when early investing years are key to harnessing the power of compounding. Forsythe's strategy has been to pay off the minimum required balance while still prioritizing investing in the stock market. He's enrolled in the Pay As You Earn repayment plan, which requires him to pay 10% of his discretionary income monthly, which comes out to around $950. After 20 years of qualifying payments, his remaining student loans will be forgiven. Coast FIRE wasn't just the product of a risky, well-timed stock bet. Forsythe lived extremely frugally after graduating from pharmacy school. "I kept living like a college student," Forsythe said. "Keeping fixed costs under control is, in my opinion, one of the most underrated FIRE tools." Being a single person with a six-figure pharmacist income definitely made budgeting more straightforward for Forsythe. His monthly budget hovered around $3,000. Other than student loan repayments, Forsythe's biggest monthly expense was his $750 mortgage payment; he had snagged a 625-square-foot condo during the pandemic and locked in a low mortgage rate. Forsythe credits his low housing costs as one of the biggest factors that allowed him to invest aggressively in his brokerage account tracking the stock market. During his high-saving years, he invested between $42,000 to $50,000 annually. "All of the money that I'm earning now, I can just put away, use for travel, go to concerts. I've started to live life a lot more instead of being frugal my whole life," Forsythe said. "It's allowed me to have less stress at work because all I need to do is cover my living expenses."

Title: Trump's tariffs and tax bill look like a 'Greek tragedy' that could tank the economy and stocks, former IMF official warns

Full Content:
Like a protagonist in a Greek tragedy, President Donald Trump is exhibiting a concerning level of hubris in his handling of the US economy, former IMF official Desmond Lachman worries. Despite warnings from credible sources ‚Äî like Fed Chair Jerome Powell, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink ‚Äî about what tariffs would mean for inflation and growth, and what his tax cut bill would mean for bond yields and the US dollar, Trump is doubling down on these policies, Lachman said in a June 10 post for the American Enterprise Institute, where he is a senior fellow. Unless Trump changes course, Lachman said, he could end up reigniting inflation, pushing up long-term bond yields, further tanking the US dollar, and sending the US economy into recession. "To Trump, these warnings are like water off a duck's back. Instead of dialing back his tariff policy, Trump has recently raised the import tariff on all aluminum and steel imports to a staggering 50%," Lachman wrote. He continued: "At the same time, instead of coming up with belt-tightening revenue and spending measures to address the country's gaping budget deficit of 6.25% of GDP, Trump is making every effort to secure the passage of his budget-busting One Big Beautiful Bill." So far, inflation has been tame and the labor market has held up as businesses have started to digest tariffs. But Lachman said the US economy is not out of the woods yet. Since businesses stockpiled inventory to prepare for Trump's tariffs, their effects won't start to show up until the second half of the year, he told Business Insider on Friday. "The fact that you're not seeing it in the May, June, July data, it doesn't mean anything," Lachman said. Here's the US trade deficit showing a surge in foreign goods buying from US businesses in late 2024 and early 2025. But tariffs aren't the only inflationary factor potentially at play. Lachman said that if you add the implications of Trump's tax bill on the value of the US dollar as the the national debt and budget deficit grow, consumers could end up paying even higher prices. With the dollar's value down 10%, for example, it means foreign goods are more expensive in addition to the 10% tariffs, or more, already being paid. In an inflationary environment ‚Äî and with no indication that the US government is looking to reduce its debt and budget deficit ‚Äî foreign investors have started to flee, and could continue to do so. That could send long-term Treasury rates soaring, Lachman said, slowing the US economy as the cost of lending follows suit. All of this puts US stocks in danger with valuations elevated, Lachman said. For example, here's the Shiller cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P 500, which measures current stock prices against a rolling average of earnings over the last 10 years. "Start with the fact that the stock market has got very high valuations, and then overlay that with the likelihood that you could have either a bond or a dollar crisis, and it would seem to me that stocks don't do very well," he said. The myth probably most associated with hubris and its sometimes disastrous consequences is the tale of Icarus. Looking to escape from a labyrinth, his father builds him wings made of wax. Icarus succeeds in getting off the ground, but in the end ignores his father's warnings and flies too close to the sun, melting his wings. Trump having imposed steep universal tariffs without sparking inflation or a recession has so far defied conventional wisdom and warnings from top economists. But with Trump's tax bill on the way, will his wings, along with the US economy and stock market, soon start to melt? Where Big Tech secrets go public ‚Äî unfiltered in your inbox weekly.

BlackRock faces legal action in Tennessee for allegedly misleading investors with conflicting ESG promises. ESG activism, driven by financial elites, prioritizes political agendas over shareholder returns, harming pension funds and taxpayers. Mentions of ESG buzzwords like "climate change" have plummeted since 2022 as skepticism grows. Conservative states push back, banning ESG considerations in public investments, while blue states defend the framework. Critics warn ESG operates as a "social credit" system, eroding free-market principles under the guise of sustainability.

Critics warn ESG operates as a "social credit" system, eroding free-market principles under the guise of sustainability. In a landmark lawsuit filed Monday in Tennessee, asset management titan BlackRock stands accused of violating consumer protection laws by peddling contradictory Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) strategies √¢¬Ä¬î√Ç one promising robust financial returns, the other a climate-focused overhaul of capitalism. The case, the first of its kind, underscores a growing backlash against ESG√¢¬Ä¬ôs opaque metrics, which critics argue prioritize progressive activism over fiduciary duty.

Yet internal documents reveal the firm√¢¬Ä¬ôs continued investments in fossil fuels √¢¬Ä¬î $310 billion as of 2023 √¢¬Ä¬î while publicly pressuring companies to divest. Luke Lloyd, an investment strategist at Strategic Wealth Partners, bluntly summarized the contradiction: "ESG is driven by financial interests, not environmental concerns. It√¢¬Ä¬ôs a marketing ploy." The fallout isn√¢¬Ä¬ôt theoretical. Pension funds, reliant on steady returns, face heightened risk as ESG policies artificially depress energy stock values. As the International Energy Agency notes, global oil demand may still grow for decades √¢¬Ä¬î rendering BlackRock√¢¬Ä¬ôs anti-fossil fuel posturing economically reckless.

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis barred state pension funds from using ESG criteria, while Texas blacklisted 10 financial firms, including BlackRock, for "boycotting" fossil fuels.

Title: ‚ÄòIt horrifies me, but I had actually developed a corporate strut‚Äô: Fintan Drury on Anglo, Paddy Power and Gaza
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/life-style/people/2025/06/14/it-horrifies-me-but-when-i-looked-back-i-had-actually-developed-a-corporate-strut-fintan-drury-on-anglo-israel-and-paddy-power/
Time Published: 2025-06-14T05:00:00Z
Full Content:
Fintan Drury was marching in support of Palestine with one of his daughters last year, feeling the same distrust he felt during his 1980s stint as a presenter of RT√â‚Äôs Morning Ireland. ‚ÄúI just sort of thought, well, I don‚Äôt believe what we‚Äôre being fed. I just don‚Äôt believe it.‚Äù As Israel‚Äôs onslaught on Gaza intensified, his participation in marches became more regular, and so did the sense that he could do something else to counter the official line coming from Israel. He rejects as ‚Äúpatent nonsense‚Äù any perception that the conflict began with the Hamas attacks of October 7th, 2023. ‚ÄúI thought there was more I could do if I got up off my ass and used my curious mind and my journalistic training.‚Äù This was the catalyst for writing Catastrophe: Nakba II, his sober yet devastating account of Israel‚Äôs treatment of Palestinians over decades. He says the subject is too important not to actively promote the book and that means being ‚Äúquizzed‚Äù by journalists, though he seems keen throughout our conversation to avoid coming across as egotistic ‚Äì something that will not surprise readers of his 2021 memoir See-Saw, which dwells on the perils of ego. ‚ÄúSorry, it sounds sort of pompous,‚Äù he apologises soon after explaining how he was counselled to exhume his reporting skills in 2016. That year Drury wrote a series of articles for The Irish Times from his time as a volunteer at a Syrian refugee camp in Athens. It came after a long spell in the higher echelons of Irish corporate life during which he was, on occasion, the story. Indeed, so much of his career was spent in business that when he identifies journalism as the thing he was ‚Äúbest at‚Äù, the self-criticism is implied. Catastrophe opens with a note acknowledging that most books on Palestine and Israel are by authors with more extensive experience of the Middle East. Many are by ‚Äúabsolutely brilliant minds‚Äù, he says, but can be academic and dense. His aim, when he began working on it ‚Äúin a serious way‚Äù in April 2024, was to provide an accessible narrative ‚Äúso even the people who are out marching and protesting and wearing their keffiyehs ‚Äì the people who are instinctively pro-Palestine ‚Äì can better understand why they‚Äôre protesting‚Äù. His research, which saw him travel to the West Bank, Jordan and Lebanon last July, helped confirm his own ‚Äúgut‚Äù feeling, though he didn‚Äôt know then how extreme the situation would become. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt honestly believe at that time that it could be as bad as it is now. And it was bad then. Really, really bad.‚Äù Israel‚Äôs aggression escalated while he was in the region, obliging him to call off one trip to southern Lebanon after a phone call with a contact in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil). He was advised that an elevated security threat meant it would no longer be able to dedicate a minder. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bit like swimming when you‚Äôre told not to, and the coastguard getting called out. You‚Äôre putting other people at risk. I‚Äôm a grandfather. I wasn‚Äôt trying to be a hero; that wasn‚Äôt my mission, so I didn‚Äôt go.‚Äù He has been heartened by the ‚Äúvery positive‚Äù public reaction. At the Listowel Literary Festival, interest in Catastrophe was such that his talk was moved to a bigger room, though when someone asked him about solutions, he said he wasn‚Äôt the right person to offer them. ‚ÄúIt is multifaceted, and it will ebb and flow and change,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBut the fundamental of the story is pretty clear to me and to a great many others who are there and studying it and observing it for decades. This is a genocide. All bets are off now. This is not right.‚Äù [ Britain and allies sanction two Israeli ministers as Gazan authorities say gunfire kills dozens at food aid siteOpens in new window ] Authors often have more than one reason for writing a particular book and in his case there were several. Apart from the conflict itself, and the time being right for him to embark upon the project, he sees parallels with Ireland‚Äôs colonisation that intersect with his own family story. Drury‚Äôs maternal grandfather Joseph Connolly was a leader of the Irish Volunteers in Belfast who was imprisoned by the British in 1916 and resumed his republican activities in the city after his release. When it became too dangerous to stay, he fled with his wife and young family to Dublin. Connolly, who went on to serve twice as a minister under √âamon de Valera, died when Drury was two, but he knew his grandmother well, he says. ‚ÄúMy grandparents were displaced people. They were refugees from Belfast. Is that relevant? Absolutely, it‚Äôs relevant. Because it‚Äôs in your history. You understand that Catholics and nationalists who weren‚Äôt able to get out continued to suffer.‚Äù Catastrophe ‚Äì the Nakba of the subtitle refers, in the first instance, to the mass displacement of Palestinians in the 1948 Arab-Israeli war ‚Äì is dedicated to the memory of his Belfast-born mother R√≥is√≠n Drury, n√©e Connolly. Their discussions about how the plight of Jewish people was shamefully ignored in the 1930s and 1940s would sometimes end with her relief that modern communications meant nothing like the Holocaust could ever happen again. There will be no credible basis for anyone to claim they did not understand what Israel was doing in Gaza or that they ‚Äúsomehow missed it‚Äù, he writes. The book documents an ‚Äúinstitutionalised bias‚Äù in the West towards Israel as the ‚Äúupholder of Western values‚Äù in the Middle East, with Drury despairing at both ‚Äústaggering‚Äù international inertia and ‚Äúchilling‚Äù sponsorship of Israel‚Äôs campaign. He witnessed what he calls the ‚Äúwarped‚Äù US policy first hand when he reported for RT√â on Ronald Reagan‚Äôs 1984 re-election and believes Democrats as well as Republicans have abandoned Palestinians. While Israel‚Äôs prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu found it easy to ‚Äúplay‚Äù the US in a presidential election year, he says the young mothers he met in Lebanon were livid that such a ‚Äúwarmonger‚Äù, as one described him, was permitted to address Congress. Ireland should be doing more, too, he concludes. ‚ÄúI think Ireland has done many things really well, I really do, but has Ireland done enough? Time will tell, but right now I don‚Äôt think so.‚Äù Drury (67) was born in Dublin and raised in Clonskeagh, then a ‚Äúsleepy part of south Dublin‚Äù. He attended Blackrock College and later UCD ‚Äì its relocation to Belfield was an early taste of the city‚Äôs encroachment on the fields of his youth. From 1981 to 1988 he was a newsman, joining RT√â despite being told in a screen test that his head was ‚Äúshaped like a shovel‚Äù. He reported from Belfast and overseas before becoming the co-presenter of Radio 1‚Äôs then fledgling Morning Ireland in 1985. But after just two-and-half years he grew restless and left broadcasting at age 29. It wasn‚Äôt his plan to go into business, yet that‚Äôs what he did, founding the public relations firm Drury Communications before selling it to its management a decade later to concentrate on his eponymous sports consultancy, which in 2004 rebranded as Platinum One. He became chairman of RT√â in mid-2005 but resigned after six months when a perceived conflict of interest arose ‚Äì over golf. The then government was flirting with adding the 2006 Ryder Cup, which was being held in Co Kildare, to its list of free-to-air television events, but Drury was an adviser to its organisers. Relinquishing the role was ‚Äúthe right thing‚Äù, he says. Does this all seem like a long time ago? ‚ÄúIt was a long time ago,‚Äù he says, laughing. It was that exact Celtic Tiger era, I say. ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù These were hubristic times, as Drury outlines in See-Saw, which is laced with mea culpas about a ‚Äúsense of impregnability‚Äù borne of live news presenting and his PR and sports management success. It underpinned decisions that led, he writes, ‚Äúto a decade of stress that was degenerative of body and soul‚Äù. I had actually developed a corporate strut. When that becomes part of your way, you don‚Äôt lose the capacity or the facility to make good judgments, but that capacity is dimmed or diminished After Anglo Irish Bank supremo Se√°n FitzPatrick persuaded him to join the Anglo board, he served as non-executive director for six years until May 2008, leaving six months before the bank failed. FitzPatrick‚Äôs post-collapse recollection that Drury brought him and then taoiseach Brian Cowen together for a July 2008 meeting and round of golf did no one any favours, with Drury and Cowen, his friend, still being asked about it at an Oireachtas inquiry seven years later. (No banking was discussed that day, they said.) FitzPatrick‚Äôs distraction-creating move convinced Drury of FitzPatrick‚Äôs ‚Äúutter selfishness‚Äù, he notes in the memoir. Cowen, meanwhile, remains a friend and was one of the early readers of Catastrophe. [ Fintan Drury: Brian Cowen put country first, party secondOpens in new window ] I ask him about his realisation that when FitzPatrick said he wanted board members who would ‚Äúnever be afraid‚Äù of expressing their opinion, he was flattering his ego. ‚ÄúYeah, and men, in particular, we‚Äôre more susceptible to that,‚Äù he says. He mentions his use of the phrase ‚Äúcorporate strut‚Äù, which he suspects he acquired in those Anglo days. ‚ÄúIt horrifies me, and it would have horrified me before ‚Äì it wasn‚Äôt a conscious thing ‚Äì but when I looked back on it, I had actually developed a corporate strut. When that becomes part of your way, you don‚Äôt lose the capacity or the facility to make good judgments, but that capacity is dimmed or diminished.‚Äù He also regrets that ‚Äúthe blinkers were on‚Äù during his tenure as Paddy Power chairman, when he says his old curiosity was subsumed by passive subscription to corporate Ireland, blinding him to the societal consequences of gambling. Efforts to regulate the industry are ‚Äúnowhere near tough enough‚Äù, he says. ‚ÄúI was a good chairman in the sense that I helped the company grow.

He wrote me a prescription; he said ‚ÄúYou are depressedI'm glad you came to see me to get this off your chestCome back and see me later, next patient pleaseSend in another victim of industrial disease‚ÄùIndustrial Disease, Dire Straits Since the start of 2023, more than half-a-million tech workers have been laid off. This isn‚Äôt the impact of COVID, this isn‚Äôt a sudden realization that tech workers are under-performing, this isn‚Äôt (much) a wave of AI making tech workers more efficient, and the other usual shibboleths like ‚Äúit was overhiring during the pandemic‚Äù or ‚Äúit‚Äôs a wave of H1B workers‚Äù or ‚Äúall knowledge worker jobs are being replaced by LLMs‚Äù are only vaguely correct. You could make a pretty reasonable case that it was the end of Zero Interest Rate Policy (ZIRP) and the corresponding impact of cost of capital - that the cost of borrowing went up, thus venture capital became a less attractive investment class than other areas, so less money went to building new companies and it was harder for existing firms to borrow, as investors went elsewhere for better returns. That is correct - and it would have had its impact - though that impact would have basically been the slowdown of new venture backed firms, not layoffs at the Big Tech Giants - and that did in fact happen. (There is definitely a knock-on effect at the Big Tech Giants where a lack of tech startups does bad things to the large parts of the ecosystem - but that effect is not as immediate as it was back in in the 2000 dot com crash.) But there‚Äôs a much more immediate bottom line reason. Section 174 of the Internal Revenue Code governs the tax treatment of research and development (R&D) expenditures. For roughly 70 years, American companies could deduct 100% of ‚Äúqualified research and development spending‚Äù in the year they incurred the costs, and this was generally interpreted pretty liberally. Salaries, software, contractor payments‚Ä¶ if it contributed to creating or improving a product, it could be deducted ‚Äúoff the top‚Äù of a firm‚Äôs taxable income. The deduction was originally codified by Section 174 of the IRS Code of 1954, and under the provision, R&D flourished in the U.S. It gave us the dominance of Bell Labs, Microsoft, Apple, Google, Facebook - pretty much all the US technology booms you‚Äôve lived through unless you‚Äôre quire venerable. So the way these regs are written: These expenditures must be for activities intended to discover information that eliminates uncertainty about the development or improvement of a product. (Kind of open-ended.) Prior to 2022, taxpayers could immediately deduct R&D expenditures in the year they were incurred, providing a significant tax benefit for businesses investing in innovation. Alternatively, taxpayers could capitalize these costs and amortize them over a period (e.g., at least 60 months) if they chose to defer the deduction. But it was pretty rare to do this, because you could directly manage your R&D payroll costs versus income to mitigate the tax hit. And societally, we accepted that - we were investing in growing the American economy. But, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 amended Section 174, effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2021. Starting in 2022, R&D expenditures must be capitalized and amortized over 5 years for domestic research (and 15 years for foreign research‚Ä¶ which is pretty untenable.) This change eliminated the option to immediately deduct R&D costs, increasing tax liability for companies with significant research budgets in the short term. Even more annoying, amortization begins at the midpoint of the taxable year in which the expenses are incurred, using a straight-line method. The short version is: this rule change has increased taxable income for businesses in the short term, as they can no longer deduct R&D costs immediately. Now, there is actually a category of tax law which you can still use (IRS Section 41 Research and Development Tax Credits) which are different - if you think I‚Äôm about to advocate tax reform, yes, but I‚Äôm always doing that and I feel like I‚Äôm talking to a brick wall. But it‚Äôs not as broadly useful, and it‚Äôs not a simple recategorization, or we‚Äôd all have done it. Anyway, let me see if I can summarize how it works today. A U.S. company incurs $1 million in domestic R&D (Section 174) expenses in 2025 and let‚Äôs assume they can‚Äôt reasonably reclassify any of it under Section 41. Under Section 174, it must capitalize these costs and amortize them over 5 years. Amortization begins mid-year, so in 2025, the company can deduct $100,000 (1/10th of $1 million, since you only get to count half the first year. The remaining $900,000 is deducted evenly over the next 4.5 years ($200,000 per year). These are basically ‚Äútax credits‚Äù. So in some respects, they may be long term beneficial - but they are a short term drag, which is why you see layoffs at the moment. Also they create a lot more compliance paperwork (and potentially you‚Äôll see companies change hands just for their accumulated tax credits, which is a little‚Ä¶ unhelpful.) And of course, this hit the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù of companies focused on building tomorrow‚Äôs products in some pretty obvious ways. The inability to immediately deduct R&D costs reduced cash flow, particularly for cash-strapped startups and small tech firms reliant on R&D. Companies had to either take out high-interest loans - since of course, interest rates have recently gone up, cut costs, or face bankruptcy. Many chose layoffs to free up cash to cover these tax liabilities. For instance, a small company might lay off a software engineer earning $200,000 to cover a $189,000 tax bill. Now, you might think the 15-year amortization period for foreign R&E expenditures would make hiring non-U.S. engineers less tax-advantageous and help bring jobs back to the US, but this mostly did not actually work out this way. You see, larger companies responded by offshoring R&D to countries with more favorable tax regimes, leading to U.S. job losses. For example, Google reportedly shifted some work to Germany, and Microsoft moved a bunch of research work to China - both because pay rates were better and because the local subsidiary company in that jurisdiction operated under the national laws for that nation, which ‚Ä¶ were not the US tax laws. They were much more like the previous US tax laws, because the rest of the world had realized ‚Äúhey, we also want to encourage people to invest in R&D and grow the next trillion dollar company here!‚Äù And this new tax ruling doesn‚Äôt precisely say ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt want to do that‚Äù but it does say ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt want you to be quick about it‚Äù - which everyone who believes in the Amazing Growth Story thinks is anathema to their strategy. Anyway, the impact of this tax strategy turned out to be: layoffs of U.S.-based engineers while companies restructured operations abroad. Now back in 2017, when Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), the signature legislative achievement of President Donald Trump‚Äôs first term, it slashed the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, which looked like a massive revenue loss ‚Äúon paper‚Äù for the federal government. So in order to make the 2017 bill comply with Senate budget rules, lawmakers had to offset the cost‚Ä¶ therefore, they put in a future tax hike (well, several) that wouldn‚Äôt kick in right away, wouldn‚Äôt provoke immediate backlash from businesses, and could, in theory, be quietly repealed later. The delayed change to Section 174, from immediate expensing of R&D to ‚Äúmandatory amortization‚Äù, meaning that companies must spread the deduction out in smaller chunks over five or even 15-year periods‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs one of them, as I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve figured out. The delayyed start meant that it would not begin affecting the budget until 2022, but it helped the TCJA appear ‚Äúdeficit neutral‚Äù over the 10-year window used for legislative ‚Äúscoring‚Äù. The delay wasn‚Äôt legally required, mind you, it was a way to game the system. These kind of political tactics are commononplace in tax legislation. Phase-ins and or delayed-start provisions let lawmakers game how the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) - Congress‚Äô nonpartisan analyst of how bills impact budgets and deficits - ‚Äúgrades‚Äù legislation, because it kicks the costs down the road, outside the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù forecasting windows. Those of you who play table-top games or RPGs would call this a way to ‚Äúcheese the system‚Äù or the traditional euphemism used to be something along the lines of ‚Äúrobbing Peter to pay Paul‚Äù. Many businesses expected Congress to repeal or delay the Section 174 changes before they took effect in 2022, as there definitely was bipartisan support for immediate expensing. However, inaction led to a ‚Äúshock‚Äù when 2022 tax bills arrived in 2023, forcing rapid cost-cutting, including layoffs. Small software firms, in particular, faced ‚Äúextinction-level‚Äù tax bills, with some reporting taxable income tripling overnight, prompting layoffs or salary cuts. And bigger firms - Amazon, Meta/Facebook, Alphabet/Google, etc, Microsoft, Salesforce, etc - have had widespread layoffs in the US and have moved jobs overseas. Twilio cut 22% of its domestic workforce in 2023. Shopify cut 30% (they‚Äôre based in Canada, but much of their R&D was in the US - guess what, it isn‚Äôt anymore). Coinbase cut 36% of their team and there are still a heck of a lot of crypto bros, so I think they are probably not in a doomsday situation. Now, I don‚Äôt want to say this was the only thing in 2023 that did this. There was a lot of economic turmoil on the horizon then: rising interest rates, reduced venture capital funding, supply chain problems, and post-pandemic over-hiring corrections, all amplifying financial pressures at the time. Companies like Meta announced layoffs during their ‚ÄúYear of Efficiency‚Äù in 2023, partly due to these tax changes and corresponding changes in ad spending. While not the sole cause, the Section 174 change drove (or accelerated) layoffs that otherwise would probably have been unnecessary. Congress has made noise previously about a bipartisan reversal of this tax code change, and I rather hope they do - it would be a welcome boost to many sectors of the American economy, from manufacturing to pharmaceutical to technology to education to electrnics to scientific research and consulting. Don‚Äôt think of this as just a problem for the tech space. I mean, the tech sector is ridiculously dominant for the S&P 500, the ‚ÄúMagnificent Seven‚Äù are a third of the value of the S&P 500. (That‚Äôs Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, and Tesla.) But if this does get repealed - it will be very good for those seven stocks - this is not an official stock tip, shush, you SEC guys. Throughout the 2010s, a broad swath of startups, direct-to-consumer brands, and internet-first firms‚Ä¶ heck, basically every company that you would recognize from Instagram or Facebook ads‚Ä¶ built their growth models around a kind of synthetic carefully engineered break-even. Lot of online firms, a lot of handheld or wearable tech firms, personal entertainment devices, ride-hailing firms, anything self-driving, all the recent buzzy things. The tax code allowed them to spend aggressively on product and engineering, then write it all off as R&D, keeping their taxable income close to zero by design. It worked because taxable income and actual cash flow were often not quite the same thing under what‚Äôs known as GAAP accounting practices. Basically, as long as spending counted as R&D, companies could report losses to investors while owing almost nothing to the IRS. In short, it costs a lot to invent - and market - the future. Building a better tomorrow can be expensive! Investors generally bought into this, gave them another round of venture capital, and let them defer a public offering. (This is actually another problem with this model - companies have stayed private far too long - but I‚Äôll address that at some other point.) But the Section 174 tax change absolutely cratered that model. Once those same expenses had to be spread out, or amortized, over multiple years, suddenly you couldn‚Äôt write these off - basically, the tax shield vanished or the accounting rules changed, depending on how politely you want to phrase it. But the mechanics of it are the same: companies that were still burning cash suddenly looked profitable on paper, triggering real tax bills on imaginary gains. (If this reminds you of some of the past economic crises - it should - this is one of the things that burned people back in the dotcom crash of 2000 amongst other mark-to-market problems in 2008, though the 2008 crisis mostly wasn‚Äôt this.) The logic that once fueled a generation of digital-first research-focused growth ran straight into a IRS-shaped brick wall and put a mighty dent in the work force. If you were already public and profitable - well, your management team wasn‚Äôt going let you suddenly become unprofitable just because of a tax law change, so the answer was ‚Äúcut expenses‚Äù and that mostly became ‚Äúslow CapEx on data centers - servers are expensive - and lay off employees‚Äù so as to preserve profit margins and keep the stock price high. After all, reasoned management, if we had to put up with these crazy new rules, we basically just had to bank up R&D credits for a few years and then we were back to par. It was a couple of years of drag on the economy - and a particularly bad time to fall behind on technology leadership or a chance to reshore manufacturing or stabilize the American economy. One suspects that the current administration, if they had noticed that, might have kicked out a repeal or other clever plan as part of their new budget package (what‚Äôs currently being bundled together under the slightly goofy name of the Big Beautiful Bill) to juice economic recovery. So it wasn‚Äôt just tech experiencing effects. From 1954 until 2022, the U.S. tax code had encouraged businesses of all stripes to behave at least a little bit like we think of tech companies behaving, by which I mean ‚Äúinvesting in R&D‚Äù and more generally ‚Äúinvesting in software‚Äù for the latter half of that. From retail to logistics, healthcare to media, if firms built internal tools, customized a software stack, or invested in business intelligence and data-driven product development, they could expense those costs - and the IRS generally agreed, which is slightly miraculous. The write-off incentivized in-house builds and fast growth well outside what people generally call the ‚Äútech sector‚Äù. For comparison, check the OECD research showing that immediate deductions foster innovation more than spread-out ones. And American companies loved that logic and invested according to it. According to government data, U.S. businesses reported about $500 billion in R&D expenditures in 2019 alone, and almost half of that came from industries outside traditional tech. The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that this sector, the broader digital economy, accounts for another 10% of GDP. Probably 20% if you count Big Tech. And there‚Äôs a secondary market - all the people who support and are downstream from those workers and those industries (see below); we‚Äôre actually introducing relatively-avoidable friction into about a quarter of the American economy here with this particular tax change. The result? A tax policy aimed at raising short-term revenue basically defined the growth engine for a huge chunk of American companies. But when that rug got pulled out, it also yanked out the incentive for hiring American engineers or investing in American-made tech and digital products. It made building tech companies in America suddenly not economically viable, and the last time we did this with a stupid policy change (Fed policy tightening ‚Äúto defeat the Wealth Effect‚Äù and cool down speculative fervor ‚Ä¶ yup, it sure did! Lots of wealth went away, was that a good idea?) caused the big Dot Com Crash in 2000. It would probably be a good idea to put this tax credit back in place (or some facsimile thereof) before it continues to strip jobs out of the American economy - let alone all the folks (realtors, contractors, restaurants, nannies, tutors, personal trainers, et al) that are one step downstream from the tech sector jobs. Thanks for reading! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. This entire tech-layoff wave is about more than AI or plummeting demand. It‚Äôs the delayed bomb Congress planted in Section 174 (a stealth tax that reclassified every developer‚Äôs salary as R&D amortized over years, not the quick write-off it used to be). People inside big firms are collateral damage in a tax strategy. The policy also shoved engineers‚Äô families onto the payroll chopping block. Until lawmakers reverse course, U.S. tech is bleeding talent - nail in coffin for innovation here while other countries scoop up the scraps. This needs to be shouted from every rooftop. Everyone needs to write, call, and email their representatives and senators to address this issue. No posts Ready for more?

If you were already public and profitable - well, your management team wasn‚Äôt going let you suddenly become unprofitable just because of a tax law change, so the answer was ‚Äúcut expenses‚Äù and that mostly became ‚Äúslow CapEx on data centers - servers are expensive - and lay off employees‚Äù so as to preserve profit margins and keep the stock price high. After all, reasoned management, if we had to put up with these crazy new rules, we basically just had to bank up R&D credits for a few years and then we were back to par. It was a couple of years of drag on the economy - and a particularly bad time to fall behind on technology leadership or a chance to reshore manufacturing or stabilize the American economy. One suspects that the current administration, if they had noticed that, might have kicked out a repeal or other clever plan as part of their new budget package (what‚Äôs currently being bundled together under the slightly goofy name of the Big Beautiful Bill) to juice economic recovery. So it wasn‚Äôt just tech experiencing effects. From 1954 until 2022, the U.S. tax code had encouraged businesses of all stripes to behave at least a little bit like we think of tech companies behaving, by which I mean ‚Äúinvesting in R&D‚Äù and more generally ‚Äúinvesting in software‚Äù for the latter half of that. From retail to logistics, healthcare to media, if firms built internal tools, customized a software stack, or invested in business intelligence and data-driven product development, they could expense those costs - and the IRS generally agreed, which is slightly miraculous. The write-off incentivized in-house builds and fast growth well outside what people generally call the ‚Äútech sector‚Äù. For comparison, check the OECD research showing that immediate deductions foster innovation more than spread-out ones. And American companies loved that logic and invested according to it. According to government data, U.S. businesses reported about $500 billion in R&D expenditures in 2019 alone, and almost half of that came from industries outside traditional tech. The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that this sector, the broader digital economy, accounts for another 10% of GDP. Probably 20% if you count Big Tech. And there‚Äôs a secondary market - all the people who support and are downstream from those workers and those industries (see below); we‚Äôre actually introducing relatively-avoidable friction into about a quarter of the American economy here with this particular tax change. The result? A tax policy aimed at raising short-term revenue basically defined the growth engine for a huge chunk of American companies. But when that rug got pulled out, it also yanked out the incentive for hiring American engineers or investing in American-made tech and digital products. It made building tech companies in America suddenly not economically viable, and the last time we did this with a stupid policy change (Fed policy tightening ‚Äúto defeat the Wealth Effect‚Äù and cool down speculative fervor ‚Ä¶ yup, it sure did! Lots of wealth went away, was that a good idea?) caused the big Dot Com Crash in 2000. It would probably be a good idea to put this tax credit back in place (or some facsimile thereof) before it continues to strip jobs out of the American economy - let alone all the folks (realtors, contractors, restaurants, nannies, tutors, personal trainers, et al) that are one step downstream from the tech sector jobs. Thanks for reading! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. This entire tech-layoff wave is about more than AI or plummeting demand. It‚Äôs the delayed bomb Congress planted in Section 174 (a stealth tax that reclassified every developer‚Äôs salary as R&D amortized over years, not the quick write-off it used to be). People inside big firms are collateral damage in a tax strategy. The policy also shoved engineers‚Äô families onto the payroll chopping block. Until lawmakers reverse course, U.S. tech is bleeding talent - nail in coffin for innovation here while other countries scoop up the scraps. This needs to be shouted from every rooftop. Everyone needs to write, call, and email their representatives and senators to address this issue. No posts Ready for more?

Title: Musk Pins Teslas Comeback on Robotaxis After Retreat From Feud

Tesla Inc. already had a lot riding on its highly anticipated robotaxi launch long before Elon Musk decided to swing a wrecking ball through his alliance with President Donald Trump ‚Äî and the company‚Äôs share price. Now investors are looking for a win that can help repair the brand damage and shift Tesla back into growth mode. Musk said Tesla would start the new self-driving car service in Austin as soon as June 22, as part of the EV maker's big bet on artificial intelligence and autonomous driving. While Tesla gave the city an outline of its tentative plans, the company hadn‚Äôt disclosed a launch date ‚Äî either publicly or directly to Austin officials ‚Äî until late on Tuesday, when Musk warned the service‚Äôs debut could shift because it was ‚Äúsuper paranoid about safety.‚ÄùThe proclamation came as part of an all-night series of social media messages by Musk, which included a near-apology that ‚ÄúI regret some of my posts‚Äù about the president, which ‚Äúwent too far.‚Äù The comments helped push shares up about 3% Wednesday by investors who have been urging Musk to refocus on his business empire. The billionaire has said the rollout would start slowly, with 10 to 20 vehicles, and a testing area verified by Bloomberg News suggests the initial contours of the debut resemble more of a souped-up demo than a full-fledged launch. That may not matter to Tesla‚Äôs biggest fans, or the stock price. Investors generally have been willing to give Musk the benefit of the doubt in the short term as they believe in his long-term vision. For the moment, Tesla sales are tumbling around the world, its stock is down around 20% this year and analysts have lowered their expectations for the company‚Äôs performance. While Musk tries to undo some of the damage from his meltdown with Trump, the immediate impact to Tesla's shares and Musk's own wealth shows just how delicate the whole balance is. The government has outsized influence over his businesses, from billion-dollar contracts to the regulatory environment for autonomous vehicles and Tesla‚Äôs robotaxi network. ‚ÄúHe needs to dial down the rhetoric and the drama and get back to the business of Optimus and robotaxi and Full Self Driving,‚Äù Nancy Tengler, CEO and chief investment officer of Laffer Tengler Investments, told Bloomberg Television. ‚ÄúThat is what people own the stock for ‚Äî and for his brilliance and genius of course ‚Äî but not for the histrionics.‚Äù Musk has promised to establish a ride-hailing network that is part ‚ÄúAirbnb, part Uber.‚Äù The company wants the fleet to built on its Full Self-Driving technology and eventually feature both purpose-built Cybercabs without pedals or steering wheels, as well as Teslas owned by the company and individual drivers. Musk predicts hundreds of thousands of the vehicles on the road by late 2026. The robotaxi launch is the first step in showing investors he can deliver. Tesla will be the fourth robotaxi service to launch in Austin in the past several years. While Tesla can operate its standard consumer models in Texas with no driver, it needs federal exemptions to use the Cybercab in its fleet. In other states, including California, Tesla faces a patchwork of regulations. Representatives for Tesla and Musk did not respond to requests for comment. Testing Grounds There have been signs of the company‚Äôs preparation in Austin. Model Y vehicles with manufacturer‚Äôs plates have become a frequent sight around town in the south and southeast portions of the city that are studded with residential neighborhoods and retail shopping centers and a few minutes drive from downtown. In some cases, the vehicles drive around in what appear to be circular routes. The initial operation area will likely cover only a few square miles, according to a person familiar with the plan who was not authorized to speak publicly on it. The zone could change before launch or be amended quickly after the service begins. The rules governing driverless vehicles in Texas are notably light. While rideshare companies with human drivers must obtain a license to operate in Texas, a legal loophole means robotaxis like those operated by Tesla don‚Äôt need the same approvals, according to the Texas Department of Licensing and Registration. That makes the state a popular choice for companies in the early stages of autonomous service. Waymo, the driverless-rideshare business owned by Google parent Alphabet Inc., currently has about 100 robotaxis in Austin in partnership with Uber and plans to ramp up to hundreds over time. Volkswagen ADMT and Amazon.com Inc.‚Äôs Zoox are testing their vehicles there. A number of autonomous trucking companies are also testing elsewhere in the state. Tesla has embraced a different approach to autonomy, favoring a camera-only system rather than a combination of lidar, radar and pre-mapping that competitors use. Musk has long claimed such an approach will allow the company to scale up sooner than rivals including Waymo, which he considers too expensive. According to some estimates, Tesla‚Äôs system of sensors costs about $400 per vehicle; Waymo‚Äôs fleet, which totals 1,500 vehicles in California, Arizona and Texas, runs roughly $12,650 per car. Critics have said Tesla‚Äôs vision-only system is riskier as it‚Äôs more limited in certain conditions with less visibility, such as sun glare, fog or dust. Regardless of the vehicles‚Äô specifications, autonomous vehicle testing in Austin and elsewhere has brought challenges. General Motors Co.‚Äôs now-defunct Cruise dragged a person along a street in San Francisco in a gruesome incident that left the pedestrian in critical condition. Driverless rideshare cars have caused viral traffic jams in Austin and last week, Waymo drove into a flooded area following a storm. ‚ÄúSafety is our highest priority at Waymo, both for people who choose to ride with us and those with whom we share the streets. We remain committed to improving road safety through our ongoing learnings and experience,‚Äù a Waymo spokesperson said. In preparation for its launch, Tesla has been in touch with Austin city officials and first responders to discuss safety expectations, according to emails seen by Bloomberg News that date back to at least May 2024. Tesla has said robotaxis will be remotely monitored initially. But several key aspects of Tesla‚Äôs plan are yet to be finalized with the city‚Äôs autonomous vehicle working group, which communicates with AV companies operating in Austin. Tesla has only shown officials a draft of an expected first responder guide, and an emergency training is still outstanding, according to Andre Jordan, division chief of homeland security and special operations for the Austin Fire Department, and a member of the city‚Äôs working group. ‚ÄúAutonomous vehicles are required to follow the law, but what happens when the law and directions of first responders conflict? It‚Äôs a complicated world,‚Äù said Jordan. Brand Damage It‚Äôs also a complicated moment for Musk to pitch Tesla as a trusted brand to take passengers, many of whom aren‚Äôt accustomed to riding in self-driving cars, where they need to go. Thanks to months wading through the political fracas in Washington, the billionaire and his cars have never been more polarizing. Although Musk has sought to dial down the hostility with the president, the billionaire‚Äôs public spat with Trump threatens to alienate even more customers. ‚ÄúTesla at this moment is a brand with all sorts of mixed associations,‚Äù said Tim Calkins, a marketing professor at Northwestern University‚Äôs Kellogg School of Management. ‚ÄúIf people have negative feelings about Elon Musk and they spill onto robotaxi, I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll be eager to take a ride. There‚Äôs lots of alternatives.‚Äù Driverless vehicles require an extra element of trust and critics will be ready to amplify any mishaps, said Mike Paul, president of crisis consultancy Reputation Doctor LLC. ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre starting from a deficit currently, from a trust in branding perspective, with all things Elon,‚Äù Paul said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs going to be very difficult to show success.‚Äù Musk has been building expectations for this launch for years. While some investors are willing to lend him some leniency on timing and the exact details, many want concrete signs of progress. Baird analyst Ben Kallo downgraded Tesla to neutral, citing, in part, overhyped expectations from Musk around the robotaxi launch and intensifying competition in the space. Kallo also said that Musk's deteriorating relationship with Trump has led to more uncertainty. ‚ÄúThe valuation has gotten ahead of itself around the robotaxi,‚Äù Kallo told Bloomberg Television. ‚ÄúI do think the rollout will take longer. At first it will require more people, so people in control centers making sure that the cars do not get into accidents something like that.‚Äù For that reason, Kallo said there will likely be some short-term pain. ‚ÄúRolling this out will be very difficult.‚Äù With assistance from Raeedah Wahid and Edward Ludlow. ¬©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Œî The company is reorganizing Amazon Health Services into six units, CNBC reported Friday (June 13), citing its interview with Neil Lindsay, senior vice president of Amazon Health Services. ‚ÄúOur leadership team has been focused on simplifying our structure to move faster and continue to innovate effectively,‚Äù Lindsay told CNBC. ‚ÄúOne of the problems we‚Äôre trying to solve is the fragmented experience for patients and customers that‚Äôs common in healthcare.‚Äù Some of the new units will be headed by longtime Amazon leaders, while others will be led by executives from Amazon‚Äôs primary care chain, One Medical, according to the report. The changes do not include broad layoffs, the report said. The restructuring follows the departure of some health leaders in 2025, including the chief medical officer of Amazon Pharmacy, the CEO of One Medical and the chief medical officer of Amazon, per the report. Lindsay said that the departures were part of the natural evolution of the business and that the organization has ‚Äúno shortage of depth of talent,‚Äù according to the report. The six new divisions of Amazon Health Services include One Medical Clinical Care Delivery; One Medical Clinical Operations and Performance; AHS Strategic Growth and Network Development; AHS Store, Tech and Marketing; AHS Compliance; and AHS Pharmacy Services, per the report. Both Amazon and its rival Walmart are competing for not only retail dollars but also other infrastructure of daily living, including healthcare, media and cloud services, PYMNTS reported in May.

Title: XRP Rocket Flight In View As Circle‚Äôs USDC Stablecoin Goes Live On XRPL

Stablecoin issuer Circle is strengthening ties with Ripple by launching its U.S. dollar-pegged USDC stablecoin on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). Following the launch of USDC on the XRPL, market participants‚Äô anticipation of a strong XRP price rally is heightened. According to the June 12 announcement, developers and institutions will now be able to easily mint and redeem USDC tokens on the XRP Ledger following the unexpected integration. The integration makes it easy to access USDC liquidity and benefit from the XRPL‚Äôs fast and secure network. USDC is currently the industry‚Äôs second-largest stablecoin with a market cap of $61 billion, trailing only Tether‚Äôs USDT. This latest development marks another milestone in USDC‚Äôs expansion across multiple blockchains, bringing its coverage to 22 chains, including Solana, Ethereum, and recently, Sam Altman‚Äôs World Chain. Notably, Ripple also joined the stablecoin gold rush, with the rollout of its own highly regulated RLUSD stablecoin last December. The token, which rivals USDC and USDT, currently has a paltry market cap of $412 million. USDC issuer Circle made its trading debut on the New York Stock Exchange last week, but nothing could have braced Wall Street for the company‚Äôs dynamite initial public offering (IPO). The IPO, which raised $1.1 billion for the firm and early shareholders, surpassed the initial performance of major publicly traded tech companies such as Meta, Robinhood, and Airbnb upon their respective listings. Crypto commentators pointed to the market‚Äôs fundamental belief that the GENIUS Act ‚Äî the landmark U.S. stablecoin legislation ‚Äî will pass as a key driver for the success of Circle‚Äôs IPO. Before the IPO, it was rumored that Ripple had attempted to acquire Circle for at least $5 billion, but the bid was rejected as too low. However, as ZyCrypto covered recently, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse disregarded claims that it planned to acquire Circle.

Title: Nintendo Switch 2 review: A fun console with tons of potential, but where are the exclusive games?
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/nintendo-switch-2-review
Time Published: 2025-06-13T21:07:18Z
Full Content:
Compared to other Nintendo consoles, the Switch 2 is an outlier. It's the first Nintendo system that feels like a direct, no-frills upgrade to its predecessor. It looks similar, it doesn't require new controllers, and it even plays 99% of the original Switch's library. It's a sequel, which is rare for such an innovation-focused company. This lack of innovation gives the Switch 2 its greatest strengths and worst flaws. On the one hand, the system carries over everything I loved about the original console, including its massive library and iconic blend of handheld and TV gaming. But on the other hand, it offers what ultimately amounts to a similar gaming experience at jacked-up prices. I've spent more than a week with the Nintendo Switch 2, playing a variety of games every day. Although I consider it a no-brainer purchase for players who never bought a Switch, I'm not convinced it's worth upgrading from the original. At least, not yet. I'm confident the Switch 2 will eventually become an even better console than the Switch 1, but it needs more exclusive games to get there. See also: Nintendo Switch 2 vs. Nintendo Switch 1 Like the original Switch, the Nintendo Switch 2 can be used as a handheld gaming system or connected to your TV at home. This new model has more powerful hardware and supports 4K resolution, HDR, and 120 FPS gaming. Specifics Like the original Switch, the Switch 2 is a handheld system that can also be placed in a dock to use with a TV at home. The Switch 2's built-in screen is nearly two inches bigger than the original console's, and when combined with a higher resolution ‚Äî up to 1080p from the original's 720p ‚Äî the comparison is night and day. Small details are easier to see, and tiny text takes less time to decipher. However, this is an LCD screen rather than an OLED one. Nintendo released an OLED version of the original Switch in 2021, and this type of screen offers higher contrast. That said, this new display's colors are still noticeably more vibrant than the standard Switch's LCD. The improved image quality is in part due to the screen's support for high dynamic range (HDR), a feature that the Switch 1 didn't have. HDR enables enhanced contrast and a wider range of colors. Though the Switch 2's backlight isn't bright or precise enough to showcase the full impact of what HDR can do, it still benefits from this feature. You can learn more in our HDR guide. I'm excited to see more games take advantage of the console's 120Hz refresh rate (up from 60Hz on the original Switch) and the dock's 4K output for Ultra HD gaming on a 4K TV. The higher refresh rate can provide smoother motion, while the higher resolution offers a sharper, more detailed picture. There's only one game released so far that goes up to 120 FPS, the "Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour" tech demo, and it does indeed look very smooth. The creatively named Joy-Con 2 controllers are a mixed bag. They're larger than the original controllers, making them feel less cramped in your hands. They also connect to the Switch 2 magnetically, which is more convenient than the original's physical rails, albeit a bit flimsier feeling. It's a worthwhile tradeoff. But for whatever reason, Nintendo built them with the same problematic joystick parts that caused the infamous "Joy-Con Drift" issue on the original system. This flaw is a ticking time bomb that'll crop up more frequently as time goes on, so keep an eye on your controllers for symptoms. Each Joy-Con 2 can also be used as an optical mouse, but few games take advantage of this feature so far. When I used it, the mouse sensors were accurate and responsive, but the controller felt a bit too thin to handle as comfortably as a real mouse. Where the Nintendo Switch 2 truly shines is in its performance, and not just with Switch 2 games. Like its predecessor, the Switch 2 runs on a custom-made Nvidia chip. It's hard to compare the chip to any other system like-for-like, but most hardware breakdowns describe the Switch 2 as a mobile PlayStation 4. That might not sound like much, but it's a big improvement over the original Switch's underpowered hardware and opens the door to a wide variety of big-budget AAA titles. Graphically intensive games, like "Cyberpunk 2077," which were impossible to run on an original Switch, are now available on the Switch 2. "Cyberpunk 2077" still doesn't run perfectly, but it's more than playable. The most shocking aspect of the Switch 2's performance is how it improves games made for the original console: The load times in "Splatoon 3" and "The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom" have shrunk to only a few seconds. Fast travel in "Pok√©mon Sword" is near-instantaneous, and the normally lag-filled "Pok√©mon Scarlet" runs at a smooth 60 FPS. Some "Super Smash Bros. Ultimate" matches start before the game can even show which characters are fighting. The Switch 2 has become the ultimate way to experience original Switch games, even if they don't have a dedicated "Switch 2 Edition" update. If you don't own the original console and you've been wanting to play these games, this makes the Switch 2 an obvious buy. This improved performance does come with downsides, though. Most notable is the reduced battery life, which is down to an estimated two to 6.5 hours from the original's 4.5 to nine. Both also take more than five minutes to turn on after being plugged in to charge, which is a major blow to the console's portability. I ran a test comparing the Switch 2 to my 2018 original model, seeing how long they could last running "Tears of the Kingdom" in a busy in-game area with the camera endlessly spinning. The brand-new Switch 2 lasted about two hours and fifty minutes, while I logged about two hours and thirty-five minutes on my original Switch. Though the Switch 2 did last slightly longer in this test, it's important to note that my original system has a seven-year-old, heavily used battery. With that in mind, the comparison is disappointing. As of this writing, the Switch 2 only has two exclusive Nintendo games: "Mario Kart World" and "Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour." They're leagues apart in quality. "Mario Kart World" is the best game in the series so far. The most fun part of any "Mario Kart" race is the chaotic first few seconds when everyone is jockeying for an early lead, and the new Knockout Tour mode, which turns the race into a battle royale, makes that chaos last the entire match. There's no such thing as a comfortable lead ‚Äî you're always in danger of getting bumped to the bottom of the pack. It also boasts a wonderfully diverse set of characters, most of whom have multiple unlockable costumes or forms; an updated trick system that lets you ride on walls and charge boosts at any time; and some incredible tracks, including a beautiful new version of Rainbow Road that's both the longest course in series history, and feels more like a shared boss battle than a racetrack. The graphics are crisp, and load times are short. It's also got a banger soundtrack that references and remixes songs from throughout the "Mario" franchise. But is it worth buying a Switch 2 for? By itself, I wouldn't say so. For all its new features, the basics of "Mario Kart" haven't changed, and I don't expect the original Switch's "Mario Kart 8" multiplayer servers to empty out anytime soon. Wait for more exclusives ‚Äî and, hopefully, for "Mario Kart World" to go on sale. "Nintendo Switch Welcome Tour," meanwhile, presents itself as a quirky way to learn more about your system, but in reality, it's more of a chore than a fun instruction manual. To progress from area to area, you need to collect stamps, which are gathered by running up to each of the Switch 2's individual buttons/ports and pressing "A" to open a pop-up that tells you what they're called. There's no indication of which stamps you're missing, which leads to situations where you're sprinting around a giant Joy-Con, desperately checking every corner to figure out what buttons you missed. The mini-games are amusing but one-note, and the quizzes, which require you to read dozens of pages of explanations on how the Switch 2 was built and works, are boring. If "Welcome Tour" was a free pack-in with the system, none of this would be much of an issue, but it costs $10. My advice? Just watch a playthrough on YouTube. GameChat is the Switch 2's voice and video-chatting app. It's free until 2026, at which point you'll need a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pass membership to use it. Nintendo has hyped it up as one of the console's biggest selling points. Going in, I was pretty negative on GameChat. I figured it'd be like Nintendo's past attempts at online chat: Clunky and unintuitive. I also thought it'd pale in comparison to a free service like Discord. I'm happy to say that I was wrong! Setting up a GameChat session with my friend took only a few seconds, although waiting for them to actually connect once they accept the invite takes some time. The choppy screen sharing looks bad at first, but in practice, really wasn't noticeable. And the system's built-in microphone has some shockingly good noise cancellation. Even when I ran a hair dryer at full blast only a few feet away, my friend couldn't hear it, but made out my voice perfectly. GameChat isn't as feature-rich as Discord, but it doesn't need to be. It's made for quick, casual multiplayer sessions, not long-term communication. I expect it'll also be popular with kids, since it's encased in its own ecosystem, making it safer than a random Discord server. I didn't have a compatible webcam to test out the video-chatting function, but testing from The Verge has found mixed results when connecting third-party webcams. There doesn't seem to be much rhyme or reason to which cams work and which don't. But when they do work, video evidence from other players shows that the feeds are pretty smooth. Now, the elephant in the room: The Switch 2 costs $450, which is $100 more than the Switch OLED, $150 more than the standard Switch, and comparable to both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles. It's also $100 more expensive than the cheapest Steam Deck, which is the most popular non-Nintendo handheld gaming system. The Switch 2's price isn't unreasonable compared to its competitors from rival brands. But this high cost makes it the most expensive Nintendo console yet, and it might mean that Nintendo's reign as the choice for gamers on a budget is ending. The price of games is getting higher, too. "Mario Kart World" costs $80, and that's not going to be a rare occurrence. Add in the cost of a Nintendo Switch Online subscription ($20 to $50 a year, depending on your plan), and the budget starts to get frighteningly tight. And that's before you consider buying any Nintendo Switch 2 accessories, like microSD Express cards, screen protectors, cases, controllers, and cameras. Obviously, everyone has a different financial situation. But at a time when prices are rising across the board, it's hard to justify spending so much on a relatively incremental upgrade of a console. If you already own a Nintendo Switch, then no, the Switch 2 isn't worth it just yet. The system doesn't have enough exclusive games right now, so most of your library will be titles you could have played already without spending more money. And because there aren't many exclusives that take advantage of the system's new graphical features, the Switch 2's 120 FPS and 4K resolution upgrades aren't that important. And while the new design is fantastic, it's not worth $450. The system simply hasn't justified its price. But if you never hopped on the Switch train, now's a great time to buy your ticket. That is, if you can find one in stock. Buying a Switch 2 gives you immediate access to a massive library of games, including original Switch classics like "Super Mario Odyssey," new experiences like "Mario Kart World," and remastered ports like "Street Fighter 6." There are also loads of new games coming in the next year, including the open-world RPG "Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A" and the highly anticipated first-person adventure "Metroid Prime 4." All this is to say that, yes, the Nintendo Switch 2 is a great console. And a year or two from now, it might just be the best product Nintendo has ever released. But right now, it's an inessential upgrade. It's the best choice for new players who never bought an original Switch, but overpriced for existing Switch owners.

ByChloe Sorvino ByChloe Sorvino, Forbes Staff. In the first hours since the world‚Äôs largest meatpacker began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday under the ticker JBS, the stock had a slow start before ending the day up nearly 5%. The addition of American investors has been expected to help the Brazilian conglomerate with $77 billion in 2024 revenue from processing and selling beef, pork, chicken and lamb to more than 100 countries. During the first day of trading, shares rose around 3% before briefly falling past where the stock opened at $13.65 per share at around 2:30 p.m eastern. As of the close of markets, the stock was back up and hit a high $14.29, or around 5% up. The market capitalization of JBS was more than $31 billion. And the billionaire sons of the founder, who guided the expansion of JBS beyond Brazil‚Äîand went to jail seven years ago after its American acquisition spree got ensnared in a massive corruption scandal involving 1,800 politicians in in their homeland‚Äîare now richer for it. As JBS stock rose, the net worths of Joesley and Wesley Batista increased an estimated $200 million each. The brothers, who are the top shareholders in the company and serve as board directors, are now worth $4.8 billion each. Together, through family holding companies, they own nearly 50% of JBS. Billionaires Wesley (left) and Joesley Batista are the top shareholders of JBS, the world's largest meatpacker, which began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. Joesley and Wesley Batista, 53 and 52 respectively, were personally charged with foreign corruption in the U.S. as well as insider trading allegations in Brazil (related to the timing of the news of their bribery scheme) that saw them briefly jailed in Brazil for about six months from 2017 to 2018. In all, the Batistas and one of their holding companies agreed to more than three dozen incidents of bribery in Brazil, according to their 2017 cooperation agreements with the Brazilian government. And the U.S. Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission found evidence of some $150 million in kickback when the Batistas and their holding company, J&F Investimentos, pled guilty to U.S. foreign corruption charges in 2020. J&F paid a $128 million criminal fine as part of a settlement with the Department of Justice. J&F also paid $27 million over foreign corruption charges with the SEC. At the same time, the Batista brothers, who are Brazilian citizens, settled a civil penalty with the SEC and paid $550,000 each. Until 2025, there had been a bipartisan effort to stop the U.S. listing on the NYSE. Last year, 15 senators‚Äîincluding Republicans Josh Hawley of Missouri and John Barrasso of Wyoming as well as Democrats Cory Booker of New Jersey, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts‚Äîdenounced a potential IPO. Years prior, former Florida Senator Marco Rubio, now Secretary of State, was one of JBS‚Äô loudest critics and twice requested a broad investigation by the Treasury Department into the Batistas and their assets. The long-delayed SEC approval for JBS‚Äô dual-listing came just two days after the Trump Administration‚Äôs new SEC chairman was sworn into office. The SEC approval also came two days after it was revealed in a public filing with the federal election commission that the largest donor to the Trump Inaugural Committee was the JBS subsidiary, chicken processor Pilgrim‚Äôs Pride. The $5 million donation to Trump‚Äôs Inauguration was five times larger than the checks given by Amazon, Meta, Uber, Nvidia and Microsoft, which each gave $1 million. A JBS spokesperson has denied any link in the timing of the donation. The Trump Administration did not return request for comment. Allowing JBS to trade in the U.S. is likely bad news for America‚Äôs homegrown‚Äîand largest overall‚Äîmeatpacker, Tyson. With a market capitalization of just under $20 billion, Tyson is slightly bigger than JBS in beef and chicken, but its stock price has been struggling, down 8%, in the past three months. Tyson has historically traded at around double the multiple of JBS, but analysts expect the addition of JBS to an American stock exchange to change that, which means JBS will have more buying power, and the competition is on. ‚ÄúFood is a national security issue,‚Äù says Carlos Laboy, the lead analyst on JBS at HSBC. ‚ÄúIt benefits the United States to have the largest protein company in the world not only operated in the U.S. but listed in the U.S. and with the oversight of U.S. regulators. The alternative scenarios are not favorable to the U.S.‚Äù

Title: Flying taxi developer Archer Aviation raises another $850M in funding

UPDATED 15:31 EDT / JUNE 13 2025 by Maria Deutscher Archer Aviation Inc. has raised $850 million in funding to support the rollout of its flying taxis. The NYSE-listed company announced the deal on Thursday. The transaction was structured as a direct offering in which Archer sold 85 million shares for $10 apiece. In today‚Äôs trading session, its stock price dropped about 14% to exactly $10. The deal marks Archer‚Äôs third nine-figure capital raise in under a year. It secured $300 million in February from a consortium that included Blackrock and closed a $430 million investment three months earlier. Following this week‚Äôs cash infusion, Archer‚Äôs total pro forma liquidity stands at about $2 billion. ‚ÄúWe now have the strongest balance sheet in the sector and the resources we need to execute both here in the U.S. and abroad,‚Äù said Archer founder and Chief Executive Officer Adam Goldstein. Santa Clara, California-based Archer is developing a flying taxi called Midnight that takes off like a helicopter and flies like a plane. According to the company, it can take four passengers on up to 100-mile trips with a top speed of 150 miles per hour. Midnight lands and takes off from specialized landing pads called vertiports. The aircraft is powered by 12 electric rotors that can adjust their angle midflight to reduce drag. Archer says they‚Äôre 100 times quieter than a helicopter, which makes Midnight suitable for use in urban areas. The rotors draw power from six onboard battery packs optimized for quick charging, which reduces downtime between flights. Midnight completed its first piloted test flight in late May. According to Archer, the aircraft reached altitudes of more than 1,500 feet. The successful test may have simplified the company‚Äôs latest capital raise by boosting investor confidence in its development roadmap. Archer will use the funds to develop an ‚ÄúAI-based aviation software platform.‚Äù In parallel, it plans to build the infrastructure necessary to support flying taxi networks based on Midnight. The company has inked deal to establish such networks in the U.S., United Arab Emirates, India and South Korea. Last year, Archer won a contract to provide air taxi services for the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Midnight aircraft will ferry spectators and staff between sports venues in the city. The company has also teamed up with United Airlines to launch multiple flying taxi routes in the U.S. One of those routers will ferry passengers from Manhattan to the Newark Liberty International Airport. As part of the deal, United has pre-ordered hundreds of Midnight flying taxis worth about $1.5 billion.

Title: China-backed firms in talks to join stalled $19B Panama ports deal: report

Full Content:
Several China state-backed firms ‚Äì including the country‚Äôs largest shipping company ‚Äì are reportedly in talks to join a stalled $19 billion deal for 43 global ports, including two along the Panama Canal. China‚Äôs Cosco Shipping Corp. has held discussions about partnering with a global consortium headed by Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte‚Äôs Terminal Investment Ltd., as well as US asset manager BlackRock and its Global Infrastructure Partners unit, sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. The move comes after Beijing‚Äôs fierce opposition has jeopardized a deal that would hand over control of the ports owned by Hong Kong business magnate Li Ka-Shing to TiL and BlackRock, the world‚Äôs largest asset manager led by Larry Fink. President Trump had touted the sale of the ports as a national security win after demanding the US ‚Äútake back‚Äù the Panama Canal and eliminate Chinese influence over the critical shipping lane. The inclusion of Cosco and other China state-backed companies emerged as a way to nudge the deal forward after intense trade talks between US officials and their Beijing counterparts over tariffs in Switzerland last month, sources told Bloomberg. The consortium is staring down a deadline in late July after a 145-day period for talks on the ports deal expires, and have already missed an initial goal of signing an agreement by early April. Aponte‚Äôs family-run business ‚Äì Mediterranean Shipping Company, which owns TiL ‚Äì has emerged as the lead investor, though BlackRock is notably expected to take over the two Panama ports included in the sale. The deal is expected to crown Aponte‚Äôs MSC as the world‚Äôs largest terminal operator after acquiring the ports from Li‚Äôs CK Hutchison Holdings. China has steadfastly opposed the deal over concerns it could hinder its global trade and shipping operations. Talks are ongoing and terms of the deal have not been finalized, sources told Bloomberg. BlackRock declined to comment. Cosco Shipping and TiL did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The White House and CK Hutchinson did not immediately respond to The Post‚Äôs request for comment. The canal, which was finished by US engineers, was handed back to Panama between 1977 and 1999 under a Jimmy Carter-era treaty establishing permanent neutrality. The head of the operator of the Panama Canal has warned that the deal could threaten its commitment to neutrality. ‚ÄúThere is a potential risk of capacity concentration if the deal comes the way it is structured as we understand right now,‚Äù Ricaurte Vasquez Morales, administrator of the Panama Canal, told the Financial Times in an interview published this week. ‚ÄúIf there is a significant level of concentration on terminal operators belonging to an integrated or one single shipping company, it will be at the expense of Panama‚Äôs competitiveness in the market and inconsistent with neutrality.‚Äù Advertisement

Is it time to panic for Bitcoin investors? The data currently doesn‚Äôt support that view. Bitcoin dropped 4.5% in the past 24 hours to trade at $104,343, while Ethereum crashed 8.2% to $2,552 as escalating Middle East tensions sparked a massive risk-off move across cryptocurrency markets. The selloff, which began during Asia trading hours on June 13, wiped out over $420 billion from the total crypto market cap and triggered $1.2 billion in leveraged liquidations. Following news that Israel had launched a major military operation against Iran, digital assets indeed tumbled sharply. The pre-dawn airstrikes targeting Iranian nuclear and military facilities sent shockwaves through global financial markets, with cryptocurrencies bearing the brunt of the selling pressure as investors fled to traditional safe havens. The odds of such dramatic escalation seemed remote just days ago. The probability of Israel attacking Iran was trading at less than 20% throughout the week on the prediction market Polymarket, dipping as low as 11% at various points. And this is something markets don‚Äôt like‚Äînot war, but uncertainty. Currently, on Myriad Markets‚Äîa prediction market developed by Decrypt‚Äôs parent company Dastan‚Äîthe odds of a US-Iran nuclear deal before the end of the week has dropped to just 4.7%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 dropped 0.66% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.17% as investors fled to traditional safe havens. Gold surged 1.8% to $3,445 per ounce, approaching its record high of $3,500.05, while Brent crude oil prices jumped as much as 9.21% during Asia hours before settling around 7% higher at $72.6 per barrel. The sharp moves in commodities reflected genuine supply concerns. Iran, as OPEC's third-largest producer, controls critical oil infrastructure, and any prolonged conflict could severely disrupt global energy markets. Defense stocks predictably surged. Just for context, Lockheed Martin and Palantir jumped about 3% as investors positioned for potential military escalation The crypto Fear & Greed Index, which measures investors‚Äô appetite for these risk assets, retreated from 65 to 54, moving from "greed" to "neutral"‚Äîan arguably healthy reset rather than the extreme fear readings typically associated with major market bottoms. This measured shift in sentiment, combined with continued ETF inflows of $86.31 million into Bitcoin despite the price decline, suggests institutional conviction remains intact. Against this backdrop of panic in traditional markets, Bitcoin's 2.4% decline to $104,343 appears remarkably contained. Yes, the leading cryptocurrency triggered $1.2 billion in leveraged liquidations as it broke below the psychologically important $106,000 level. But considering the magnitude of the geopolitical shock, the selloff lacks the hallmarks of genuine panic. The technical picture supports this thesis. Bitcoin's Relative Strength Index, or RSI, on the daily chart sits at 47‚Äîdown from overbought levels near 80 last week but still firmly in neutral territory. This suggests profit-taking rather than capitulation. The Average Directional Index (ADX), which measures the strength of a trend regardless of direction, is now at 17, which indicates weak directional momentum. That means the current move lacks the conviction typically seen during crisis-driven crashes, which tracks with the coin‚Äôs recent lateralization. Bitcoin‚Äôs Exponential Moving Average, or EMA, is even more telling. EMA measures the average price of an asset, in this case Bitcoin, over a given period of time. Bitcoin‚Äôs 50-day EMA at $102,513 provided initial resistance on the bounce attempt, suggesting technical levels still matter‚Äîa sign that algorithmic trading rather than emotional panic is driving price action. The 200-day EMA sits much lower at $92,687, showing the longer-term uptrend remains intact. For Bitcoin, the immediate test lies at reclaiming the $105,757 level (50/200-day EMA confluence). Failure to break back above this level would target: $100,000 as psychological support, and $95,000 as visible support, based on the charts. Upside resistance stands at $110,000, with the recent all-time high near $111,891 remaining the key level for bulls to reconquer. Ethereum's steeper 7% drop to a daily low of $2,439 before bouncing to its current $2,552.30 reflects the typical risk-off rotation from altcoins to Bitcoin during market stress. Despite recording 19 consecutive days of ETF inflows, ETH couldn't maintain support above $2,700 as traders de-risked portfolios. The second-largest cryptocurrency's technical indicators paint a more bearish picture than Bitcoin's. With RSI at 50.6 and the ADX at 22 showing that the bullish bounce is now very, very weak, and the longer bearish trend is still in play, Ethereum shows stronger directional movement to the downside. The price is currently hovering near the 200-day EMA ($2,473), having broken below it during the selloff. The 50-day EMA sits at $2,417, and a break below would signal a more significant trend change. Ethereum bulls, then, must defend the current $2,552 level to avoid a deeper correction. The key levels to watch are the resistances at $2,738 and an immediate support hear the psychological levels of $2,417. Meme coins suffered disproportionate losses, with Fartcoin‚Äîthis week‚Äôs epitome of meme coin bullishness for absolutely no meaningful reason‚Äîplummeting 12% to $1.1968. The token's breakdown from its ascending wedge pattern, combined with strong selling pressure, exemplifies how speculative positions unwind rapidly during times of uncertainty. The RSI at 50 shows neutral momentum after falling from overbought conditions, while the ADX at 22 confirms the switch from bullish to neutral move. And even with all that said, the chart still paints an overall bullish picture for Fartcoin, and meme coins tend to do weird things. As a general rule, though, you can expect meme coins and other altcoins to mirror Bitcoin‚Äôs moves, but with a lot more volatility.

Title: New code strings attached to Xbox Game Pass suggests a price increase may be imminent
URL: https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/a-new-string-attached-to-xbox-game-pass-suggests-a-price-increase-may-be-imminent

Death, taxes, and subscription service price increases. The three horsemen of inevitability. A new code string suggests Xbox Game Pass is next. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here‚Äôs how it works. Microsoft recently raised the price of Xbox game consoles. Then it raised the price of games to $80. Next on the list might be Xbox Game Pass. Over the past year, Microsoft and other companies have been gradually increasing the price of their products and services, blaming things like Trump's tarriff war, sticky inflation, and consumer confidence. Whatever the reason, shareholders don't seem to be too bothered, with megacorps like JP Morgan, Blackrock, and Vanguard set to earn millions via Microsoft's dividend pay outs this quarter. But hey, hedge funds could always use some more, right? After raising the price of Xbox consoles and, now, controversially, Xbox games to $80, Microsoft may also be on the cusp of raising the price of Xbox Game Pass too. @RedPhx who who builds the rather amazing Better xCloud Xbox Cloud Gaming enhancement project noticed that Xbox Cloud Gaming recently added a new notification type, dubbed "SubscriptionPriceIncrease" over the past few days. Fun. A new notification type called "SubscriptionPriceIncrease" has been added to the xCloud website pic.twitter.com/iH29k1x3VxJune 13, 2025 The strings pertain to pop-ups that Xbox Cloud Gaming serves to players who enable notifications on the Xbox.com/play web app. Most of them are innocuous enough, like reporting on rewards earned, achievement unlocks, friends coming online, and so on. But this latest one specific to subscription price increases is new. It's not a stretch to think that an Xbox Game Pass price increase is imminent, given the fact Microsoft decided now would be a good time to necessitate such a notification type. Either way, I don't think anyone is expecting Game Pass to stick to its current price. Netflix, Disney+, and other subscriptions are constantly increasing, or gunning for enshittification tactics like Amazon Prime, which now seemingly has more ads than simply watching TV. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Xbox Cloud Gaming currently costs $19.99 per month as part of the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate bundle, and provides access to hundreds of games playable via Microsoft's servers. It's still the best subscription deal in gaming overall, and Xbox Cloud Gaming is a decent service on top. However, its latency and resolution is sub par compared to NVIDIA GeForce Now, whose purpose-built PC gaming cloud servers are simply better at delivering gaming streams than Microsoft's. At least for now. Still, it has improved a lot over the years, but not to the point where Microsoft is confident enough to remove its (Beta) tag, which has been bundled with its title since its formal public launch years ago. Our sources have indicated to us that Microsoft is working on the next generation of Xbox cloud servers, which are in testing at Redmond HQ as we speak. These new servers will be part of Microsoft's next-gen hardware offering, alongside devices like the Xbox Ally and Xbox Series X successor. The new Xbox Cloud Gaming servers should deliver lower lag, improved bitrates, and higher resolution options. We've also heard that Microsoft is exploring a cloud-only subscription, which would free it up from Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. An increasing number of users in certain markets are becoming cloud-only. If Microsoft was interested in building Xbox Cloud subscriptions on a tiered basis like NVIDIA GeForce Now, it stands to reason that you might have to pay a bit more to get access to higher resolution feeds. Either way, it probably won't be long until we find out if Xbox Game Pass is indeed going up in price, following on from last year's price increase. You can stack Xbox Game Pass subscription cards for up to two years to combat price increases, if you intend to stay subscribed. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate | $19.99Xbox Game Pass provides access to hundreds of games, natively on Xbox consoles and PC, but also via Xbox Cloud Gaming on the web. All of Microsoft's upcoming games including Call of Duty Black Ops 7 and The Outer Worlds 2 go live day and date into the service.

Title: Invesco, Galaxy Digital file to launch Solana ETF in Delaware amid SEC approval buzz
URL: https://cryptobriefing.com/solana-etf-sec-approval/
Time Published: 2025-06-13T17:15:06Z
Full Content:
Share this article Invesco and Galaxy Asset Management, the fund management arm of Galaxy Digital, have filed to register a trust in Delaware for a proposed Solana ETF, a key early step toward launching the fund. The filing suggests that a formal SEC application may be imminent. Once Invesco and Galaxy Asset Management submit a formal application to the SEC, the firms will officially join the growing list of asset managers seeking to launch a spot Solana ETF in the US. To date, that list includes Grayscale, VanEck, Bitwise, 21Shares, Canary Capital, Franklin Templeton, and Fidelity. In effect, nearly every fund manager that offers US-listed spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs is now pursuing a Solana-based counterpart, except BlackRock. The latest move by Invesco and Galaxy comes amid growing optimism around potential SEC approval of spot Solana ETFs. Momentum picked up this week following reports that the SEC had engaged directly with ETF issuers, instructing them to submit revised S-1 registration statements. The requested revisions suggest possible fast-tracking of the approval process, which some sources believe could conclude within three to five weeks. The SEC has also reportedly signaled its openness to staking within the ETF structure. Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart estimate a 90% chance of approval for Solana and Litecoin ETFs this year, placing them at the top of their list. XRP ETFs follow closely with approval odds of roughly 85%. I wrote about this topic a bit today as well.

Title: The Weekly Closeout: Michaels rolls out Summerween and Shakira‚Äôs beauty brand debuts

Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The crafts retailer is releasing Halloween decor earlier than ever, while the pop star‚Äôs Isima line will launch at Ulta Beauty. It‚Äôs been another week with far more retail news than there is time in the day. Below, we break down some things you may have missed during the week, and what we‚Äôre still thinking about. From Janie and Jack‚Äôs sweet collection to Blue Moon lip care, here‚Äôs our closeout for the week. Time to par-tee with Uber Eats Other people order burrito bowls and fries for delivery. You order cleats and team jerseys. Uber Technologies announced a partnership with Dick‚Äôs Sporting Goods and its sister store Golf Galaxy this week. Shoppers can order items like athletic apparel, footwear and golf equipment from the stores via the Uber Eats platform. ‚ÄúWe believe that speed and convenience is key to our omnichannel experience, and we‚Äôre excited to launch our partnership with Uber Eats as an extension of that philosophy,‚Äù Scott Casciato, vice president of omnichannel fulfillment and strategy at Dick‚Äôs Sporting Goods, said in a statement. ‚ÄúWhen those moments arise where new gear is needed, this partnership with Uber Eats extends our capabilities to give our athletes convenient shopping to get the products they need fast and in a way that is convenient for them.‚Äù Shakira launches beauty brand Isima Twenty years after ‚ÄúHips Don‚Äôt Lie‚Äù was released, pop star Shakira is hoping her hair care won‚Äôt either. The artist on Tuesday launched Isima, a beauty brand focused on clinically backed hair products inspired by the Latin community, which becomes available for purchase online Monday. The line, which includes eight products to start, emphasizes scalp, cortex and cuticle health and is meant to tackle the diverse hair types of Latin shoppers. Products range from $32 to $42 and include shampoos, conditioners, oil, serum, a hair mask and a curl perfector. "A big part of my identity has always been my hair. I'm an artist, a performer, a daughter, a mother, and through it all I've had these curls that, believe me, have been through a lot,‚Äù the artist, who is Isima‚Äôs founder and chief community officer, said in a statement. ‚ÄúI've watched friends, family, and many other women who like me, spent years trying every new product available to find the right one. I have always felt like there are a lot of products out there, but nothing to meet the challenges that come with complex hair and multiple textures." In addition to its own website, Isima will launch exclusively at Ulta Beauty stores nationwide and on that retailer‚Äôs website come July 6. Ulta will also showcase the products at its Mexico flagships in August (the retailer announced last year it would expand to that market in 2025). The beauty line is vegan, Leaping Bunny-certified and a part of Ulta‚Äôs Conscious Beauty collection. Michaels celebrates Summerween Craft retailer Michaels is launching boo-tiful products earlier than ever and just in time for Summerween ‚Äî the unofficial June nod to Halloween that continues to grow in popularity. The decor debuts Friday (the 13th!) in stores and rolls out throughout the summer. Collections include Trick or Treat (available Friday), Sweet & Spooky (available Friday), Dead Regency (July 25), Iridescent Moon (July 25) and Alice‚Äôs Adventure (Aug.15). "Our customers' passion for Halloween is unmatched, and the incredible enthusiasm for last year's collections made one thing clear: we had to go bigger and bolder than ever before," Chief Merchandising Officer Stacey Shively said in a statement. "This year, we're thrilled to deliver our most expansive and creatively daring Halloween assortment to date.‚Äù A lip balm that only comes once in a Blue Moon Ever taken a sip of beer and wished it was lip balm? This summer, it could be. Blue Moon is teaming up with personal care brand Eos to launch a $5 Valencia Orange Lip Balm. The product launched Wednesday and is available on both Eos and Blue Moon‚Äôs websites for a limited time. While it doesn‚Äôt contain alcohol, the lip balm was ‚Äúspecially crafted for fans 21 and older,‚Äù per a company press release. "The Valencia orange is more than a garnish. It's a core part of our identity and what makes a Blue Moon a Blue Moon," Courtney Benedict, vice president of marketing at Above Premium Beer at Molson Coors Beverage Company, said in a statement. "Through this unexpected partnership with Eos, we're giving fans a whole new way to enjoy that iconic citrus taste ‚Äì no Valencia orange required. It's a fun, fresh take on what it means to brighten your summer with Blue Moon." And it‚Äôll save shoppers a few calories too. Happy lip smacking! A sweet collection for kids Janie and Jack introduced a 25-piece collection with Milk Bar featuring looks inspired by the dessert shop‚Äôs signature treats. Items in the collection range from $18.50 to $79 in sizes up to 12. It's now available on Janie and Jack‚Äôs website and enters stores nationwide on Monday. "We believe childhood should be sweet‚Äîand this Milk Bar collection brings that to life in the most joyful way," Parnell Eagle, president of Janie and Jack, said in a statement. $1.75B That‚Äôs the amount of convertible senior notes Gamestop on Wednesday announced as a proposed private offering. The retailer also intends to grant initial note purchasers an option to purchase up to an additional $250 million aggregate principal amount of notes. Gamestop said it intends to use net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes. This includes making investments consistent with GameStop‚Äôs investment policy and potential acquisitions. The zero-interest notes will mature in 2032 and are convertible into either cash, company stock or a combination of cash and stock. 8.1% That‚Äôs the projected drop in port volumes for May, measured in twenty-foot equivalent units or TEU, the first year-on-year decline since September 2023. The estimated volume, at 1.91 million TEU, would be the lowest since December 2023, according to the Global Port Tracker from the National Retail Federation and Hackett Associates. The decline is largely due to tariffs instituted in April, notably a 145% levy on goods from China that has since been lowered to 30%. Tariffs may go lower still following recent trade negotiations, though the situation remains in flux. Retailers are entering their busiest time of year, with inventory needed for the back-to-school and holiday seasons, so volumes are likely to pick up, though import duties remain a concern, NRF Vice President for Supply Chain and Customs Policy Jonathan Gold said in a statement. ‚ÄúRetailers had paused their purchases and imports previously because of the significantly high tariffs,‚Äù Gold said. ‚ÄúThey are now looking to get those orders and cargo moving in order to bring as much merchandise into the country as they can before the reciprocal tariff and additional China tariff pauses end in July and August.‚Äù U.S. immigration policy erodes normally robust spending by Hispanic consumers Some retailers and brands enjoying the robust spending power of Hispanic consumers have noticed a pullback in the past several months, and the companies, along with some analysts, are pointing to current U.S. immigration policy. Executives have called out slowing growth due to a pullback from Latino consumers, according to a Wall Street Journal report this week. In March, several analysts warned that U.S. immigration policy is restraining Hispanic shoppers‚Äô spending and dragging down off-price stores. Immigration policy presents challenges to the U.S. economy broadly and retailers in particular in a few ways, including weaker population growth, a tighter labor supply and disruption from fears of deportation, Wells Fargo analysts said earlier this year. The Trump administration stepped up raids in recent days, sparking protests in Los Angeles and other major cities. These households aren‚Äôt necessarily more financially challenged than others. Nearly 60% ‚Äúreported positive sentiment about their ability to afford everyday essentials, the highest level since 2021,‚Äù plus this group has higher savings and more discretionary income than others, according to Kantar‚Äôs ShopperScape tracker. Yet Hispanic consumers started the year avoiding stores, with the steepest declines at supermarkets and dollar stores, Kantar said. For the first time in two years, demand from this cohort is weaker than others, according to an April report from Circana, which lists ‚Äúimmigration concerns‚Äù among the factors.

While the job market hasn't fallen off a cliff and layoffs remain low, stiffer competition for roles, surging use of artificial intelligence, and some employers' hesitation to hire are scrambling some job searches. That means some job seekers might have to pivot ‚Äî potentially to an entirely new industry ‚Äî or find other ways to stand out if they're set on a certain field. In some cases, you might have to adjust your goals. "Maybe put aside for the moment that dream to work for Amazon and Google, and maybe think about a different company that's more mid-cap," Angie Kamath, dean of the School of Professional Studies at New York University, told Business Insider. Kamath said the need to stay open to various options if you're looking for a role reflects the rapid change in many industries, especially as employers and employees alike try to understand what AI will mean for many aspects of work. "That's here to stay," she said, referring to the need for job seekers to understand how technology might remake jobs. To keep up, Kamath said, you should find ways to build your skills. That doesn't only mean getting a degree in a field, she said. Kamath said you might look to freebie or low-cost classes, for example, on AI from Amazon, Google, or online learning platforms like Udemy. "That's my No. 1 advice. Try something out. See if you like it. See if you hate it. See if you're energized by it," she said. If you don't want to shift to a different field or job type, you might simply have to work harder to stand out. Ryan McManus, a vice president at the recruitment firm Selby Jennings, told BI that some employers have become more selective in who they hire. "It might just be a bit more competitive in the sense that we're looking to check more boxes," he said, referring to finding candidates for the company's employer clients. For those who don't necessarily have every part of a job description nailed down, intangibles like being personable and a strong communicator can make a difference, McManus said. While finding ways to be flexible and try to stand out in a job search can help, it doesn't necessarily mean it will be easy to land a role. Some employers are slow-walking hiring, and some workers' confidence about business prospects is slipping. In the Glassdoor Employee Confidence Index released Tuesday, the share of employees who expect a positive six-month business outlook fell to 44.1% in May from 45.8% in April. The May reading was the lowest since 2016, when Glassdoor began collecting predictions from tens of thousands of US workers. To navigate an uncertain landscape, NYU's Kamath said job seekers might think of themselves as entrepreneurs who generate more than one idea for a business. "That's what we should do as we're looking for jobs. We should come up with a couple of versions of success, or what's interesting," she said. To know which option might be best, Kamath said it can help to ask friends what they think. She said that might mean having a conversation with a connection on LinkedIn who's in the line of work you're considering. Or it could involve visiting an employer that has public events or conferences. That manner of thinking, Kamath said, helps you avoid putting much pressure on yourself to land a certain role, and the thinking that "anything other than being successful in that one path equals failure." "It widens out what you might do and where you might do it," she said. Ultimately, Kamath said, job seekers often benefit when they step back and consider alternatives. "That's been very eye-opening for our students and our alumni to say there's more out there than the singular path to success," she said.

Title: Meta Invests $14.3 Billion in Scale AI as Zuckerberg Builds New Artificial Intelligence Team

Scale CEO and co-founder Alexandr Wang will lead Meta‚Äôs new ‚ÄúSuperintelligence‚Äù division following the deal Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said earlier this year that his company will be investing heavily in artificial intelligence in 2025. And on Thursday, he put his money where his mouth is, with the parent company of Facebook and Instagram investing $14.3 billion in Scale AI, a company that offers a platform and training data for developing AI models. The investment values Scale AI at more than $29 billion, the San Francisco-based company said in a blog post. As part of the deal, 28-year-old Alexandr Wang, Scale‚Äôs chief executive and co-founder, will join Meta to spearhead its new AI research division now dubbed the ‚ÄúSuperintelligence‚Äù lab. Meta‚Äôs stock was down 0.77% on Friday, the morning after the deal was officially announced, to $688 per share. The company‚Äôs stock price is up about 15% since the start of the year. The tech giant‚Äôs stake in Scale AI ‚Äî its second-largest deal ever, after the $19 billion it spent to buy WhatsApp in 2014 ‚Äî reinforces Zuckerberg‚Äôs claim that AI is a key focus for Meta moving forward. Zuckerberg in January said Meta would spend between $60 billion and $65 billion to ‚Äúsignificantly‚Äù expand its AI team; the company then updated that projection during its first quarter earnings call in April, saying it planned on spending up to $72 billion this year on AI. ‚ÄúThis will be a defining year for AI,‚Äù Zuckerberg said in January. ‚ÄúI expect Meta AI will be the leading assistant serving more than 1 billion people, Llama 4 will become the leading state of the art model, and we‚Äôll build an AI engineer that will start contributing increasing amounts of code to our research and development efforts.‚Äù The new superintelligence division will be separate from Reality Labs, Meta‚Äôs division that has been focused on virtual reality, augmented reality and AI. That division has stood out as one sector where Meta is spending more than it is making; the company reported it lost $4.21 billion on Reality Labs during the first quarter, while Meta overall reported $42.31 billion in sales.

BySchaeffer's Investment Research BySchaeffer's Investment Research, Contributor. Chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) has had a busy month. The semiconductor company cleared the $1 trillion market cap level on the way to a record high of $265.43 on June 4. One day later though, AVGO gapped lower by 5%, after the company‚Äôs fiscal-year revenue forecast fell short of estimates. The shares have battled back since then, poised to add 1.2% this week and remain a chip-shot from that peak. The good news is that Broadcom stock is flashing a historically bullish combination. The stock‚Äôs recent peak comes amid historically low implied volatility (IV), which has been a bullish combination for the equity in the past. According to data from Schaeffer‚Äôs Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, there have been eight different times in the past five years when AVGO was trading within 2% of its 52-week high, while its Schaeffer‚Äôs Volatility Index (SVI) sat in the 20th percentile of its annual range or lower -- as is the case with the security‚Äôs current SVI of 32%, which sits in the bottom percentile of its 12-month range. Data shows Broadcom stock was higher a month later 75% of the time, averaging a 3% return for that time period. From its current perch, a move of similar magnitude would put AVGO just $264, within striking distance of that record high. Keep an eye on the $250 level, which could step up as support should it get cleared today. This area was home to peaks in December and January. In the shorter term, a cushion could come from AVGO‚Äôs ascending 20-day moving average, a trendline that caught the post-earnings bear gap last week and hasn‚Äôt been breached on a closing basis since April, per the chart below. AVGO Stock Chart With 20-Day Moving Average Puts have been much more popular than usual in the options pits. Broadcom‚Äôs 50-day put/call volume ratio of 0.59 at the International Securities Exchange (ISE), Cboe Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX (PHLX) ranks higher than 91% of readings from the past year. So while calls still outflank puts on an absolute basis, the high percentile suggests the ratio is on an uptick that nears an annual high rate. Options are an intriguing route. The equity‚Äôs Schaeffer‚Äôs Volatility Scorecard (SVS) ranks high at 84 out of 100, meaning AVGO has tended to exceed these expectations during the past year -- a boon for options buyers.

Title: Bitcoin At $1 Million? CEO Says It‚Äôs The Price To Beat Gold

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. According to CNBC‚Äôs Power Lunch, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz thinks Bitcoin could climb all the way to $1 million per coin if big institutions keep piling in. The cryptocurrency hit a weekly peak of $110,290 on Tuesday. It slipped 4.5% to $104,300 by Thursday, but it‚Äôs still climbed 1.75% over the past seven days. Novogratz says this isn‚Äôt just hype. He points to firms moving cash from dollars and gold into crypto. BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) went live in January 2024 after SEC approval. Based on reports, that fund now gives big investors a straightforward path to own Bitcoin without buying coins directly. BlackRock manages about $11.6 trillion in assets. When a player that size steps in, others notice. Novogratz says wealth managers and pension funds have started treating Bitcoin like a macro asset, on par with gold and the S&P 500. Treasury companies are adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Sovereign wealth funds have begun to follow suit. Retail investors keep buying, too, thanks to easier trading apps and ETFs like IBIT. A handful of public companies have raised millions to buy Bitcoin outright. According to filings, Metaplanet, the Blockchain Group, GameStop, and US President Donald Trump‚Äôs Media arm all announced major purchases this year. Their moves chip away at the 21 million-coin supply, making each remaining Bitcoin scarcer. Bitcoin‚Äôs 21 million supply cap is hard-wired into its code. Gold, by comparison, has a market worth north of $12 trillion and sees about 1‚Äì2% new supply each year through mining. Novogratz argues that younger investors will choose a capped digital asset over a metal bar. That switch isn‚Äôt guaranteed, but once people see Bitcoin as a store of value, its appeal could grow. At today‚Äôs $2 trillion market cap, Bitcoin has room to expand many times over if it ever rivals gold. Regulators remain a wildcard. The SEC green-lit IBIT, but future rules on taxes or derivatives could slow things down. Bitcoin‚Äôs price swings make it riskier than bonds or gold. Institutions often chase stable returns, and Bitcoin pays no dividends or interest. Finally, moving another $10 trillion into crypto would need a massive shift in asset allocations. That kind of inflow isn‚Äôt impossible, but it won‚Äôt happen overnight. Based on reports, Novogratz sees Bitcoin‚Äôs march toward gold‚Äôs market cap as a ‚Äúball rolling down a hill.‚Äù He predicts that, over time, Bitcoin will match gold and then outpace it. Featured image from Imagen, chart from TradingView They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle.

When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats ‚Äì a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin‚Äô helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words ‚Äì the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Gold, long considered a safe haven, beckoned investors seeking safety from the escalating Middle East conflict. Bitcoin, often touted as digital gold, instead joined the exodus of risk assets. "The traditional buyers of gold are not in the crypto market yet,‚Äù Stephen Wundke, director of strategy and revenue at quantitative digital asset investment firm Algoz, told Decrypt. He added that gold buyers are ‚Äúrisk-off investors who will return to the safe haven that is gold, as they see it, whenever there is potential conflict." Though gold is up over 2% on the day, Wundke thinks this is "hardly a rush to cover," adding that Bitcoin, for one, had been falling "well before there was any news of the strike on Iran." Data from CoinGecko show that the price of Bitcoin plunged 3.6% to $103,900 Friday morning as initial reports that Israel launched airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities came in. At the same time, gold leapt to $3,427.90 per ounce, showing how the two assets diverge during a geopolitical crisis. It is up 7% in the past month and more than 46% year-to-date, data from Trading Economics indicate. "Bitcoin is sometimes seen as a safe haven, but in reality, it often moves in line with tech stocks rather than gold," Jay Jo, senior research analyst at Tiger Research, told Decrypt. "Because of this coupling, Bitcoin and gold can show opposite price trends during geopolitical crises." While the smoke hasn't settled, altcoins including Ethereum, XRP, and Solana tapped over $1 billion in liquidations, most of which are in long positions. Meanwhile, traditional safe havens, including gold, the U.S. dollar, and government bonds, attracted flight-to-safety flows as investors dumped risk assets. "Fundamentals are more at play with BTC than problems in the Middle East, at the moment," Wundke noted, adding that June is "traditionally a quiet month for BTC" and that the market appears to be "in a consolidation phase." Still, Wundke argued that if "any significant escalation in the Middle East" occurs, it might affect Bitcoin and send it breaking below $100,000. Sentiment has slipped over the past day; although the Crypto Fear and Greed Index currently sits at 61, indicating greed, it's down 10 points on the day‚Äîand over 81% of predictors on Myriad expect it to hold below 64 through the end of the week. (Disclaimer: decentralized on-chain prediction market Myriad was launched by Decrypt's parent company, DASTAN) Bitcoin's younger, more leverage-prone investor base might have contributed to the selloff intensity, with some noting that a shift is underway. "The bull case becomes [that] over time, young people care about it more than old people," Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz claimed in a CNBC interview Friday. Gold "slowly gets replaced by Bitcoin" as the alpha crypto has increasingly become an institutionalized "macro asset," he added. Citing weighted demand from financial institutions such as BlackRock, Novogratz said that interest in Bitcoin as a macro-asset could be likened to "a ball rolling downhill."

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CHONGQING, CHINA - JUNE 08: In this photo illustration, the logo of Adobe Inc. is displayed on a ... More smartphone screen, with the company's latest stock market chart visible in the background, reflecting investor sentiment and recent trading activity, on June 08, 2025, in Chongqing, China. (Photo Illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images) Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) recently revealed its Q2 results (fiscal year ending in November), exceeding analyst expectations. The firm reported earnings of $5.06 per share on revenues of $5.9 billion, surpassing the consensus estimates of $4.97 per share and $5.8 billion, respectively. Moreover, Adobe raised its full-year guidance. Despite these encouraging results, the stock experienced a modest reaction in after-hours trading, falling by 1%. This response, or lack of it, calls for a deeper analysis of the company‚Äôs financial performance and its present stock valuation. If you seek an upside with a more stable experience than individual stocks, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500, achieving over 91% returns since inception. In a different context, check out ‚Äì Boeing Stock Faces Fresh Crisis After 787 Dreamliner Crash. Adobe's revenue rose by 11% year-over-year, totaling $5.87 billion in Q2 (fiscal year ending in November). This increase was fueled by its main segments: Adobe is presently benefitting from clients transitioning to its premium subscription plans, which are generating a stable revenue flow. Adobe's Firefly, an innovative AI tool that allows users to create, modify, and enhance images and videos through simple text commands, has broadened Adobe's suite of AI-driven creative tools, aimed at accelerating the ideation and content creation processes. Furthermore, Adobe recently announced that it is incorporating image-generation AI models from OpenAI and Google directly into the Firefly application, further enhancing its capabilities. Adobe's adjusted operating margin of 45.5% in Q2'25 was slightly lower than the 46% figure reported in the same quarter last year. The company also repurchased 8.6 million shares during the quarter. Increased revenues, a small drop in operating margins, and a reduced number of shares outstanding led to the company reporting a bottom line of $5.06 compared to $4.48 in the prior-year quarter. Looking forward, Adobe has revised its full-year revenue forecast to a range between $23.5 billion and $23.6 billion, an increase from the previous estimate of $23.3 billion to $23.55 billion. The firm also expects adjusted earnings per share to range from $20.50 to $20.70, up from the earlier estimate of $20.20 to $20.50. ADBE stock has declined 6% this year, trailing behind the broader indices, with the S&P 500 index up 3%. Overall, ADBE stock has shown considerable volatility compared to the index over recent years. The stock's returns were 13% in 2021, -41% in 2022, 77% in 2023, and -25% in 2024. In contrast, the S&P 500's returns were 27% in 2021, -19% in 2022, 24% in 2023, and 23% in 2024 ‚Äî indicating that ADBE underperformed the S&P in 2021, 2022, and 2024. On the other hand, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which comprises 30 stocks, has effectively outperformed the S&P 500 during the last four-year span. Why is this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks yielded superior returns with diminished risk compared to the benchmark index, providing a less turbulent experience, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Considering the current unpredictable macroeconomic landscape, amidst ongoing geopolitical tensions, could ADBE encounter a situation akin to those in 2021, 2022, and 2024, resulting in underperformance relative to the S&P over the next 12 months ‚Äî or will it bounce back? While we will soon refresh our model to incorporate the latest results and guidance for ADBE, the stock appears undervalued. At its current price of $410, ADBE stock is trading at 20x the anticipated adjusted earnings of $20.35, based on the mid-point of the provided guidance, compared to the stock's average P/E ratio of 25x over the past three years. In fact, we currently estimate Adobe's Valuation to be $550 per share, indicating more than 30% upside potential from current levels. Nevertheless, it is crucial to acknowledge potential risks. Investors may moderate their valuation of Adobe due to a slower-than-expected pace of growth driven by AI. Furthermore, the stock has historically lagged behind the S&P 500 during recent market downturns, as outlined in our ‚ÄúBuy or Sell Adobe Stock‚Äù dashboard. Therefore, investors should cautiously consider these risks before investing in Adobe stock. While ADBE stock seems to have the potential for growth, it is beneficial to examine how Adobe's Peers perform on relevant metrics.

ByAlex Knapp ByAlex Knapp, Forbes Staff. In this week‚Äôs edition of The Prototype, we look at a big space stock IPO, Korea‚Äôs plan to dominate the world of robots, building electric motors without metal and more. You can sign up to get The Prototype in your inbox here. Dylan Taylor, chairman and CEO of Voyager Technologies Inc. Space company Voyager Technologies brought in nearly $383 million in its IPO on Wednesday, with shares priced at $31. The company offers a number of different space services for both governments and commercial customers, including services on board the International Space Station. Its stock price soared upon the opening of trading, hitting a sky-high $63.88 at one point on Wednesday. It‚Äôs since come back down to Earth a bit, closing at $49.70 yesterday, giving it a market cap of over $2.7 billion. The company plans to use the increased capital to expand a number of its offerings, particularly Starlab, a private space station the company is developing for use after the International Space Station is decommissioned. Investors hope this success might lead to more IPOs in the space sector this year. P.S. - Quick housekeeping note: There will be no edition of the Prototype next week, as I will be off for the holiday. See you all back here on the 27th! Joe Buglewicz/AP In 2021 Hyundai Motor Company paid $1.1 billion to acquire 80% of robotics pioneer Boston Dynamics, famous for videos of its dog-shaped bot named Spot and its running and jumping humanoid Atlas. The deal initially seemed more of a headline grab for Hyundai rather than part of a fully baked strategy. That‚Äôs no longer the case. Four years later, Hyundai now represents the tip of the spear in Korea Inc.‚Äôs thrust into robotics. The company has continued to develop Spot, especially for use as a roving site inspector, and is also iterating on Atlas, with the intention of selling mass-produced humanoids controlled by AI as soon as 2028. Hyundai‚Äôs robotics lab has already deployed its X-ble platform of wearable robotic exoskeletons for use in factories. X-ble Shoulder, launched late last year after trials with 300 workers, is said to reduce shoulder and deltoid muscle exertions by more than 30% when lifting heavy objects like car parts. Its X-ble MEX is a more complicated rehabilitation suit that can help people walk again. Incredibly, these X-ble exoskeletons don‚Äôt require an outside power source, instead using passive spring-torque mechanics. Industrial robots are nothing new to Korea, which already leads the world in density of robot deployment, with 1,000 bots per 10,000 factory workers, compared to about 300 in the U.S. and 470 in China. But now its industries and government see a massive opportunity for robots outside the factory. A new public-private partnership, the K-Humanoid Alliance, aims to offer a commercially viable bipedal bot by 2028 that weighs less than 130 pounds, can lift 40 pounds, walk about 3 yards per second and can move with the flexibility enabled by more than 50 joints. The K-Humanoid Alliance also seeks to develop a common AI ‚Äúbrain‚Äù that all Korean robots can use. Read the whole story at Forbes. A team at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology has invented an electric motor that doesn‚Äôt use any metal. Instead, its main electric components are made from carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which are lighter than metals but just as electrically conductive. Use of this material has been proposed in the past, but has been hampered by the fact that making CNTs involves metals, and the residue left behind ends up degrading electrical performance. The researchers figured out a way to remove those metal particles with a chemical process that didn‚Äôt disrupt the CNT‚Äôs structure. The European Space Agency's Solar Orbiter spacecraft has sent back the first clear images of the sun‚Äôs south pole. The unique views of the sun were captured on March 16-17, when the Solar Orbiter was orbiting the sun from 15 degrees below the solar equator, enabling this first look. The spacecraft‚Äôs three cameras provide images of the sun in visible light, ultraviolet light, and light emanating from different temperatures of charged gas above the sun‚Äôs surface, revealing distinct layers of the sun‚Äôs atmosphere. In my other newsletter, InnovationRx, Amy Feldman and I wrote about RFK Jr.‚Äôs vaccine advisory committee purge, a tech billionaire‚Äôs funding of research on AI and healthcare, FDA approval of a new medicine that prevents RSV in infants and digital health company Omada‚Äôs IPO. On the Forbes YouTube channel, I spoke with my colleague Brittany Lewis about the potential science impacts of the Trump Administration‚Äôs proposed budget cuts to NASA as well as the potential consequences of HHS Secretary Kennedy firing all members of a key vaccine advisory committee. Researchers developed a new kind of paint that can passively cool buildings. It does this in two ways. First, its color reflects sunlight, which is a well-known technique. But it also incorporates nanoparticles that make the paint more porous, so that it captures more water when it‚Äôs wet. When that water evaporates, it cools down the building, working the same way sweat does to cool down your body. NASA‚Äôs Hubble Space Telescope took new photos of Uranus, giving scientists new insights about the seventh planet. One surprise: Its magnetic field doesn‚Äôt interact with its moons. IBM is aiming to have the first practical quantum computer built by 2028. It will comprise modular units each containing quantum chipsets, and the company says it has figured out scalable error correction, one of the major issues holding quantum computing back. Satellite company Kymeta developed a single antenna that can communicate across multiple satellite frequency bands. Until now, a satellite had to be outfitted with multiple antennas to do this, so this could lay a foundation for more seamless satellite communications. A gene therapy for hemophilia is still safe and effective, over a decade after it is first administered. A new study found that 10 patients who received it between 2010 and 2012 still showed the benefits of their one-time treatment, with few side effects. An analysis of over 3,500 companies across Europe over a span of 20 years found that firms that are newly-listed on the stock market will see a quick boost of profit compared to private companies that abandon their plans to IPO. The researchers also found that those companies see an increase in sales per employee and greater market expansion following going public as well. ‚ÄúGoing public may unlock growth potential, provided market conditions are favourable,‚Äù researcher Francisco Urzua said in a press release about the study. The great rock musician Brian Wilson passed away earlier this week at the age of 82. To commemorate his legacy, Rolling Stone enshrined 25 of his essential songs, and I can‚Äôt quibble with any of their picks. My own personal top five: ‚ÄúGod Only Knows‚Äù, ‚ÄúI Just Wasn‚Äôt Made For These Times‚Äù, ‚ÄúGood Vibrations‚Äù, ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt It Be Nice?‚Äù and the utterly transcendent ‚ÄúLove And Mercy.‚Äù He may be gone now, but he‚Äôs left behind an incredible catalog of music.

ByDanielle Chemtob andForbes Daily ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. President Donald Trump has touted his $5 million ‚ÄúGold Card‚Äù visa as a way to raise trillions of dollars for the U.S. But a new website launching the initiative doesn‚Äôt look or feel like a legitimate government site, experts say. Among the red flags are the URL itself, unexpected links to the Department of Commerce rather than Homeland Security, and no disclaimer regarding usage of personal data. ‚ÄúThis is a joke,‚Äù says immigration and investing expert Nuri Katz. ‚Äú[The Trump Administration] is asking very wealthy individuals to trust a one-page website that feels like it was created in five minutes by a teenager in his bedroom.‚Äù And while Trump told his social media followers that the waitlist for the Gold Card was open, it could take years for applications to be processed. Congress has yet to initiate any changes to immigration and tax law that the program would require. AP Photo/Vahid Salemi Israel launched a series of major military strikes against Iran and its nuclear program late on Thursday, killing several top military officials and nuclear scientists in the country, a move that U.S. officials said was a ‚Äúunilateral‚Äù action by Israel as they denied any involvement by U.S. forces. President Donald Trump urged Iran to make a nuclear deal or face ‚Äúmore brutal‚Äù attacks in the future. Global crude oil prices jumped sharply, while U.S. stock futures fell early Friday in the wake of the strikes, which marked a significant escalation of tensions in the Middle East. A federal judge ruled Thursday that President Donald Trump must return control of the California National Guard troops deployed in Los Angeles back to the state‚Äôs Governor Gavin Newsom, but an appeals court later temporarily blocked the judge‚Äôs order. In his ruling, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer said Trump‚Äôs deployment of the National Guard, which was done without Newsom‚Äôs approval, was illegal, ‚Äúexceeding the scope of his statutory authority and violating the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.‚Äù Shares of Boeing fell 5% Thursday after a plane operated by Air India crashed shortly following takeoff, killing more than 260 people aboard as well as others on the ground, and adding to the safety concerns that the airplane maker has faced for years. Boeing said it was in contact with Air India, and the aircraft involved with the crash was a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner delivered to Air India in 2014. Digital bank Chime‚Äôs stock popped in its debut on the Nasdaq Thursday, rising 37% and bringing its valuation to $16 billion, the latest successful IPO in recent weeks. The 13-year-old bank grew rapidly during the pandemic, and while it maintained that expansion, it spent heavily to get there‚Äîmaking it critical for Chime to find cheaper ways to attract and retain customers. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison overtook Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg to become the second-richest person in the world Thursday, as shares of his cloud computing giant surged amid the AI arms race. Ellison enjoyed the largest daily fortune boost of any billionaire, with his net worth climbing by $25 billion to $242 billion, second only behind his longtime friend Elon Musk. Two long-tenured partners at Y Combinator, which has incubated some of the most successful companies in Silicon Valley‚Äîfrom Airbnb to Dropbox‚Äîare leaving the firm to start their own fund, Forbes has learned. While the size of the fund, intended to nurture early stage companies, hasn‚Äôt been announced, one source said it will be substantially north of $250 million. Major platforms like Google Cloud and Spotify experienced technical issues on Thursday amid a widespread internet outage, though social media platforms appeared to be largely spared. Cloudflare, which serves tens of millions of web requests per second, said in the afternoon that a number of services suffering ‚Äúintermittent failures‚Äù were being investigated, but later in the day, said services were fully restored. Despite his real estate empire, a majority of President Donald Trump‚Äôs fortune‚Äî$3.3 billion of his total $5.5 billion‚Äîis now tied to crypto, which the president has tapped for cash and worked to promote. The latest shift was when Trump Media and Technology Group purchased crypto to bolster its balance sheet, transforming Trump‚Äôs company from a social-media play to a Bitcoin bet. FBI officers physically removed Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., from a press conference held by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in Los Angeles on Thursday as he attempted to shout questions at Noem, an incident that drew bipartisan backlash. Noem falsely claimed in a Fox News interview after the incident that Padilla ‚Äústarted launching towards the podium‚Äù and ‚Äúdid not identify himself.‚Äù Megan Briggs/Getty Images When Lionel Messi laces up his cleats to compete in the FIFA Club World Cup that begins Saturday, the Argentine soccer superstar will be the highest-paid player there, with $135 million in estimated earnings over the past 12 months. He‚Äôll be joined by other top earners like Real Madrid forward Kylian Mbapp√© and Manchester City striker Erling Haaland, a confluence of top-earning talent that is a direct result of FIFA‚Äôs new format for the tournament. The FAA is investigating a JetBlue flight that skidded off the runway at Boston Logan International Airport, and the airport was under a ground delay Thursday afternoon. The carrier said no one was injured in the incident, which occurred on a flight that originated from Chicago O‚ÄôHare International Airport. Drew Angerer/Getty Images Scale AI‚Äôs shocking $15 billion deal to sell a 49% stake to Meta has raised the specter that the startup‚Äôs $14 billion-valued data labeling business could implode. At play is the concern that Scale, which has been the dominant player in labeling data to help major tech companies and AI startups train their models, could share details about the types of data that leading AI players have used to build their most cutting edge tech with Meta. OpenAI, one of its most prominent customers, has already been winding down its work with Scale, according to four sources with knowledge of its business. Scale AI spokesperson Joe Osborne denied that OpenAI has pulled back its spending. Scale built its business on the back of a massive clickworker army, largely of workers based overseas who would teach AI models by providing context for masses of data. But this kind of work has become a commodity. ‚ÄúAnyone who puts up a team can compete with you, and it comes down to price really quickly,‚Äù said Kevin Guo, cofounder of a startup that got out of the data labeling business, in a 2023 interview. WHY IT MATTERS Access to high quality human data is crucial for training powerful AI models, so much so that data has been considered a moat for AI juggernauts like OpenAI and Anthropic in the AI race. Scale AI, which booked $870 million in revenue in 2024, captured the data labeling market early by supplying troves of human-labeled data to companies like Cohere, OpenAI and Microsoft. But Meta owning almost half of Scale would change that equation. MORE How Alexandr Wang Turned An Army Of Clickworkers Into A $7.3 Billion AI Unicorn The House voted to claw back funding from NPR and PBS, in a move known as rescission, as the White House has sought to slash their funding.

Title: Bitcoin To Replace Gold As Store Of Value And Hit $1 Million, Predicts Mike Novogratz

Former Goldman Sachs partner and Galaxy Digital founder Mike Novogratz remains one of the most prominent Bitcoin bulls in finance. Novogratz has now joined the $1 million per Bitcoin (BTC) bandwagon, suggesting that the OG cryptocurrency could 10X and break that milestone if it continues to grow in popularity and surpass gold. Appearing on CNBC‚Äôs Power Lunch on Thursday, Mike Novogratz said he foresees a seven-figure moonshot for the premier cryptocurrency. Novogratz‚Äôs main rationale for anticipating Bitcoin‚Äôs potential 1,000% growth is based on the crypto‚Äôs increasing institutional adoption as a macro asset. ‚ÄúNow we‚Äôve got all these treasury companies buying Bitcoin, we‚Äôve got sovereign wealth buying Bitcoin, we‚Äôve got retail investors buying Bitcoin, there‚Äôs easier ways to get it,‚Äù he quipped. ‚ÄúSo the adoption of Bitcoin as a macro asset, as an asset to save money in, I think that‚Äôs now a ball rolling down hill.‚Äù BlackRock is perhaps the most notable example of institutional adoption of Bitcoin as a macro asset. The $11 trillion asset manager‚Äôs spot BTC exchange-traded fund has amassed approximately 3% of Bitcoin‚Äôs total supply for its clients since going live in January 2024. The iShares Bitcoin Trust currently holds more than $70 billion in assets under management. Novogratz further suggested that the increasing adoption will ensure Bitcoin catches up with gold. According to the pundit, younger investors would buy Bitcoin over gold, with the supply-capped digital asset replacing the yellow metal over time: ‚ÄúIf you look at gold‚Äôs market cap and Bitcoin‚Äôs market cap, Bitcoin has a long way to go, 10x, and so that‚Äôs [$1 million] Bitcoin just to be where gold is.‚Äù Novogratz is not the first Bitcoin bull to predict that Bitcoin will appreciate significantly in value over the long term. In April, Cathie Wood‚Äôs Ark Invest raised its bull-case Bitcoin price projection to $2.4 million by 2030, up from a previous projection of $1.5 million. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes said last month that BTC could break $1 million by 2028, thanks to strong tailwinds including a likely outflow of foreign investment and devaluation of the huge stock of the US Treasury. Strategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor has also, on multiple occasions, shared his thoughts on how high he thinks the price of Bitcoin could rocket to.

From their Manhattan headquarters on Thursday, top BlackRock leaders‚Äîincluding Chief Executive Larry Fink, who had just flown back to New York after a trip to the Middle East‚Äîlined up to discuss their business with investors and analysts over five hours of presentations. The goal: to show why they think BlackRock is a stock worth owning. They were gathered for the company‚Äôs investor day, complete with 147 slides packed with fresh five-year financial targets for fund-raising, revenue, and more. The firm‚Äôs last investor day was in 2023. BlackRock has ambitious goals. Over the next five years, the company aims to roughly double its operating income to $15 billion, double its market capitalization to $280 billion, and increase revenue, which in 2024 totaled $20 billion, by 75% to $35 billion. It‚Äôs targeting organic base fee growth of at least 5%, and an operating margin of at least 45%, ‚Äúthrough the market cycle." Private markets will be a big part of BlackRock‚Äôs growth. The world‚Äôs largest money manager, with $11.6 trillion of assets, is now targeting $400 billion of private markets fund-raising by 2030 as it aims for technology and private markets businesses to contribute at least 30% of overall revenue by that year. That‚Äôs up from a 15% slice in 2024. ‚ÄúBold, but doable ambitions," said Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr. BlackRock‚Äôs fresh targets sets new stakes for the performance expected from the $28 billion of private markets acquisitions it‚Äôs carried out in the past year. They paint a picture of an asset manager betting its future on private markets after making its name in the public markets with fixed income and exchange-traded funds. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not reliant on any one strategy or asset class," said Martin Small, BlackRock‚Äôs chief financial officer and head of corporate strategy, in prepared remarks. ‚ÄúAll of our businesses have delivered organic base fee growth over the last five years. That said, the BlackRock of the next five years, to 2030, is different than the past." Trading at 24 times earnings, investors assign BlackRock‚Äôs stock a lower multiple than shares of pure private markets players Blackstone and KKR, which trade at 42 times and 54 times earnings, respectively. Investors could start to view BlackRock‚Äôs stock as a play for exposure to assets such as private credit and infrastructure, not just its best-known products in the public markets like exchange-traded funds. ‚ÄúAre we in direct competition with Blackstone? I would say, in their two core businesses, no. But in other areas of private [assets], where we have deemed we have an incredible opportunity, [yes]," Fink said in an interview with Barron‚Äôs in March. He added at the time: ‚ÄúI have no intention of going into private equity" with any large-scale acquisition. ‚ÄúI have no intention of being huge in real estate." For now, investors seemed underwhelmed by what they heard Thursday. Shares of BlackRock fell 0.4% while the S&P 500 rose 0.2%. That slide is typical of the firm‚Äôs investor days. In 2018, 2021, and 2023‚Äîthe past three such events held by the firm‚Äîthe stock fell 1.1%, 0.4%, and 0.5% before recovering those losses the following session, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

Title: This AI platform is drastically changing how major financial firms do business: ‚ÄòLike having a really capable intern‚Äô

Time Published: 2025-06-13T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
George Sivulka ‚Äî the 27-year-old founder and CEO of AI platform Hebbia ‚Äî is supplying artificial intelligence to those with more information than time, and millions, if not billions, on the line. Since starting the company in 2020, his client list has grown to include BlackRock, KKR, the U.S. Air Force, Centerview Partners, MetLife, Gunderson Dettmer, Oak Hill and TowerBrook, among others. ‚ÄúThe CEOs that get to the [top of these firms] know that innovation could either [elevate] their companies to even bigger levels or completely disrupt their market position,‚Äù Sivulka told NYNext. ‚ÄúAnd so, we‚Äôre partnering at the board level for massive transformational projects ‚Ä¶ really help[ing] them think through how they‚Äôre going to [embrace] change.‚Äù While popular AI applications such as ChatGPT are largely transactional ‚Äî a user issues a prompt, the model responds and then the conversation ends ‚Äî Hebbia‚Äôs models are tailor-made, persistent, process-oriented and evolve through repeated use. Agents ‚Äî autonomous AI programs trained to mirror how a firm works ‚Äî can execute customized workflows, asynchronously, non-stop. An analyst at a private equity firm could instruct their agent to analyze a target company‚Äôs filings, build comps, generate a valuation model in Excel and prepare a draft investor memo ‚Äî all within a single query loop. But the analyst isn‚Äôt being replaced, they‚Äôre being freed up from repetitive work so they can ‚Äúfocus on more interesting, investigative or curious tasks,‚Äù Sivulka told NYNext. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost like having a really capable intern.‚Äù Sivulka initially planned to pursue a career in academia, not business. He spent nearly a decade at Stanford, earning his undergraduate and master‚Äôs degrees before enrolling in a fully funded PhD program. Over the years, he saw innumerable peers leave for white-collar jobs and come back disillusioned. They had secured high-paying, high-powered gigs, yet they spent their days copying data into slides or skimming dense filings for small insights. ‚ÄúSome of the smartest people in the world were doing some of the stupidest tasks,‚Äù Sivulka said. So he dropped out, moved into a closet in East Palo Alto, and started working on what would become Hebbia. Each morning he would wake up, code for 16 hours and cold-call prospective clients. This was back before the world had heard of ChatGPT, when AI was still a murky and misunderstood term. Most investors didn‚Äôt bite at his ideas for intelligence tools, but eventually, a few did: Peter Thiel, Mike Volpi at Index, and later, Andreessen Horowitz growth partner Alex Immerman. Sivulka ultimately decided to base Hebbia in New York City‚Äôs SoHo neighborhood to get away from the pervasive ‚Äúgroupthink‚Äù of the Bay Area. He relishes being near to those he and his growing team are making tools for. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in New York [because] there‚Äôs nothing like actually being able to understand user pain, to be on the floor with our customers,‚Äù he said. Just as Zoom made offices location-agnostic, Sivulka thinks AI will make companies compositionally agnostic. The new normal won‚Äôt just be in-person or remote, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll have hybrid teams of AI agents and humans.‚Äù This story is part of NYNext, an indispensable insider insight into the innovations, moonshots and political chess moves that matter most to NYC‚Äôs power players (and those who aspire to be). He notes that in recent decades, despite software services and cloud platforms, productivity per employee hasn‚Äôt changed much. He believes AI has the power to finally move the needle, dramatically changing how companies work. ‚ÄúAI is actually delivering hours and hours of time savings,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre seeing tangible results.‚Äù Send NYNext a tip: nynextlydia@nypost.com Advertisement

Title: Private equity wants in on your 401(k). What you need to know before investing | CNN Business
URL: https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/13/business/private-equity-401k-investing-explained
Time Published: 2025-06-13T09:30:03Z

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Chances are very good that your 401(k) does not currently offer you access to private equity investments, which, as the name implies, are investments in companies that are not publicly traded. The question is, will that change in the next few years? And, if it does, is it worth it for you to invest? Large company pension plans and university endowments ‚Äî both of which have very long time horizons ‚Äî have invested for years in private equity and private debt funds. But 401(k)s typically haven‚Äôt offered those options to plan participants. In November 2024, only 2.4% of 401(k) sponsors said they added a private equity investment option to their plan, according to a weekly poll question from the Plan Sponsor Council of America. That may be because employers are afraid of potential lawsuits if they include those options, which typically charge investors more than investment funds in public companies. And under the Employment Retirement Security Act (ERISA), employers have a fiduciary duty to ensure that investment options in your 401(k) are prudent and have reasonable fees, said Jerry Schlichter, founding partner of Schlichter Bogard, who pioneered lawsuits against plan sponsors for charging excess 401(k) fees. It also may be because private assets are riskier to invest in and information about them is opaque, since they‚Äôre private. So there is less of a requirement to be transparent with investors about how a fund is doing on a regular basis. In addition, private capital options are considered illiquid investments because you can‚Äôt take your money out whenever you want. And that may prove too constraining for retirement plan participants, who may need access to their 401(k) money for any number of reasons ‚Äî including changing or losing a job, Schlichter said. There has been an increasing push to provide more private capital investment opportunities for retail investors and participants in workplace retirement plans like 401(k)s and 403(b)s. On the regulatory front, according to Jaret Seiberg, a financial services policy analyst at TD Cowen Washington Research Group, the Trump administration is likely to make it easier to access so-called alternative investments, which include private equity, private real estate and hedge funds. That could result in an executive order from the president requiring government agencies to expand access to such investments as well as rulemaking or guidance from the Department of Labor ‚Äî which enforces ERISA ‚Äî ‚Äúto expand the ability of individuals to invest in 401(k) and IRA accounts in alternative investments,‚Äù Seiberg said in a daily research note. There are far fewer public companies today than there were 30 years ago, as more companies remain private. For that reason, some say, if investors want to own the whole market and have a truly diversified portfolio, where some asset classes move up when others move down, they should have access both to public and private companies. In a recent conversation with Morningstar, BlackRock chief operating officer Robert Goldstein noted that the performances of publicly traded stocks and bonds have become more correlated than they used to be, and ‚Äúmany of the less correlated assets are only accessible through the private markets.‚Äù That may be. Or not. For average retail investors, it could be hard to tell because there currently isn‚Äôt a centralized way to track the performance and underlying investments of private capital funds and directly compare them to that of the stock and bond funds and indexes they‚Äôre used to. That‚Äôs just one reason why other market watchers and investor advocates worry about expanding access to private capital for average retirement savers. Among those squarely in the camp of those who say employee and retiree nest eggs won‚Äôt be helped ‚Äî and could be harmed ‚Äî by having exposure to private capital is Benjamin Schiffrin, director of securities policy at Better Markets, a nonprofit seeking to promote the public interest in financial markets. ‚ÄúWhy is there a push to open up the private markets to 401(k)s now? It‚Äôs not because workers want less liquid and harder-to-value assets in their 401(k)s. And it‚Äôs not motivated by plan sponsors, who have long worried that exposing 401(k) plan participants to private market assets would violate their fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of the investors,‚Äù Schiffrin said in a statement. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs because private market firms are finding it harder now to raise money. Their traditional sources of funding ‚Äî institutional investors such as pensions and endowments ‚Äî have evaporated.‚Äù Indeed, for plan sponsors, including private equity among their plan‚Äôs investment options will require a lot more due diligence from them in terms of investigating the underlying investments in a given fund and examining the fee structure, Schlichter said. ‚ÄúThis is fraught with danger. A company that puts private equity in its 401(k) is undertaking a serious risk of breaching its fiduciary duty.‚Äù Credit ratings agency Moody‚Äôs this week put out an analysis, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, which cautioned that the accelerated push to give private capital firms access to the multitrillion-dollar retirement investment industry holds risk for everyone. ‚ÄúCompetition for retail investor capital within private markets will intensify as alternative asset managers roll out new partnerships and special funds to address this potentially vast, still largely untapped market,‚Äù the analysts wrote. ‚ÄúBut rapid growth within this still relatively opaque market also carries systemic implications.‚Äù One example, they cited, is the potential for a liquidity crisis. ‚ÄúUnlike institutional investors, retail investors expect ready access to their cash. To help, managers are launching products with periodic windows of liquidity. But in volatile markets, retail investors may run for the exits, which would exacerbate liquidity needs and the risk of potential mismatches between a product‚Äôs available liquidity and what investors are expecting.‚Äù The promise of investing in private equity is that the additional expense and risk assumed by investors can be rewarded with potentially strong returns over time. While it‚Äôs hard to easily and quickly track private equity performance on your own, there have been academic and industry studies on it, and the results have been mixed, said Jason Kephart, senior principal for multi-asset strategy ratings at Morningstar. So, while you will likely pay more and have less transparency into what you‚Äôre investing in, having a stake in private capital is no guarantee that you will enjoy meaningfully better returns in your portfolio. As for the diversification argument, Kephart said, it‚Äôs worth remembering that just as with public companies, private companies‚Äô performance will be affected by external forces such as economic downturns, interest rates, geopolitical concerns, tariffs and supply chain issues. ‚ÄúBeing private doesn‚Äôt shield you from the world,‚Äù he noted. And, Kephart added, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like the public markets are broken. Public stocks and bonds have paid off pretty well for those who‚Äôve stayed invested.‚Äù Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

(Photo by Chesnot/Getty Images) Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has established itself as a frontrunner in the realm of autonomous driving for quite some time. Its Full Self-Driving (FSD) software improves the driving experience by automating specific tasks, enabling Tesla vehicles to navigate, change lanes, and park independently while necessitating the driver‚Äôs active supervision. However, despite years of anticipation and high investor expectations, Tesla‚Äôs FSD does not seemingly make a substantial contribution to the company's revenues, while other tech giants like Google have been ramping up their investments in self-driving technology. Concurrently, higher-margin software products such as FSD are becoming increasingly crucial to Tesla‚Äôs growth narrative as its core EV business faces pressure from waning demand and heightened price competition. So, what is the current status of the FSD software? Tesla offers FSD as either a one-time purchase of $8,000 or a subscription priced at $99 per month. We believe the subscription option is likely to be the preferred choice for most new Tesla buyers due to its flexibility and lower initial cost. Although Tesla does not report FSD revenue separately, estimates from RBC Capital Markets indicate that roughly 5% of customers chose the subscription by early 2024. This attach rate has likely improved after Tesla reduced the monthly fee by 50% to $100 by April 2024. Based on vehicle delivery forecasts for 2025, we estimate that Tesla could sell approximately 1.7 million vehicles this year. If we assume that 10% of these customers opt for the FSD subscription, that results in about 170,000 additional subscriptions. This would raise cumulative subscriptions to around 460,000 by the end of this year. See detailed calculations in our dashboard How Big Is Tesla‚Äôs Software Business? At a monthly rate of $100, that translates to approximately $550 million in annual revenue for Tesla. While this is significant, it remains a small portion of Tesla‚Äôs total sales, and it falls short of justifying the substantial valuation premium that Tesla‚Äôs stock commands on account of FSD‚Äôs long-term potential. On a different note, if you‚Äôre looking for upside with less volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative, having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Elon Musk has continuously promised significant advancements in autonomy, yet Tesla has frequently missed its own timelines. For example, Musk had asserted that v13 of the FSD software would facilitate a 5 to 6 times increase in miles driven between disengagements compared to the v12.5 version. The miles between critical disengagements, which indicates the average distance a vehicle travels before the system must be disengaged, is regarded as a vital safety metric for FSD. Nonetheless, data now reveals that v13 yielded barely a 2.5 times improvement, increasing from 200 miles to about 495 miles. The head of FSD at Tesla has previously mentioned that for Tesla to achieve truly unsupervised self-driving, the average number of miles per critical intervention would need to match the ‚Äúequivalent of human miles between collisions,‚Äù which stands at approximately 700,000 miles. By this measure, it appears Tesla has a considerable distance to cover. Conversely, Alphabet‚Äôs Waymo has been quietly and consistently making tangible strides in the real world. The company is currently conducting over 250,000 fully autonomous, paid rides each week across Phoenix, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, a significant increase from around 10,000 rides merely two years ago. Waymo‚Äôs vehicles operate without any human oversight, in contrast to Tesla‚Äôs FSD, which still requires driver supervision. Additionally, riders seem to have a preference for Waymo; according to Earnest Analytics, Waymo retains riders at a higher rate than Uber or Lyft. This implies that once individuals experience fully autonomous rides, they favor them. Safety could also be a compelling selling point. Waymo‚Äôs safety report from last year indicated that its autonomous vehicles achieved a 78% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to human drivers. See: Waymo To Separate From Google? That being said, Tesla has some advantages at this moment. Waymo‚Äôs system relies on a comprehensive hardware stack that includes custom lidar and radar sensors as well as cameras that are retrofitted to the vehicles it procures from traditional automakers. In contrast, Tesla relies on a camera-only system powered by neural networks. This approach makes Tesla‚Äôs system potentially simpler and cheaper to scale. Furthermore, there are likely over 5 million Teslas currently on the road, and it‚Äôs reasonable to assume that a significant percentage of these vehicles are equipped with the necessary hardware to run FSD software. If the software can advance accordingly, Tesla could activate a vast FSD user base, swiftly altering the economics of its business.

Business FILE PHOTO: Midnight, an all-electric aircraft from company Archer Aviation, is seen at the Salinas Municipal Airport in Salinas, California, U.S. August 2, 2023. REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo Air taxi maker Archer Aviation on Thursday said it raised $850 million in funding following executive orders signed by U.S. President Donald Trump to boost electric air taxis. Trump's orders also focused on bolstering U.S. defenses against hostile drones, and supporting the development of supersonic commercial aircraft. Earlier this year, Archer secured $300 million in a funding round led by institutional investors, including accounts managed by BlackRock . In April, Archer unveiled plans to establish an air taxi network in New York City in partnership with United Airlines. The company has also been named the official air taxi service for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, June 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Elevance Health, Inc. (‚ÄúElevance‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) (NYSE: ELV) and reminds investors of the July 11, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the risk and cost profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid programs. While Defendants acknowledged that Medicaid expenses were rising, they repeatedly assured investors that this was adequately reflected in the Company‚Äôs guidance for the year. The truth began to emerge on July 17, 2024, when the Company revealed that it was now ‚Äúexpecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.‚Äù In response to this disclosure, the price of Elevance common stock declined by $32.21 per share, or 5.8%. However, Defendants continued to make false, reassuring statements to investors concerning the extent of the cost increase and how that was accounted for in the Company‚Äôs full year guidance. The truth was further revealed on October 17, 2024, when Elevance announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2024, revealing that the Company had missed consensus earnings per share (‚ÄúEPS‚Äù) expectations for the quarter by $1.33, or 13.7%, ‚Äúdue to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.‚Äù Elevance further revealed that it was lowering EPS guidance for 2024 from $37.20 to $33.00, or 11.3%, as it expected these Medicaid issues to continue. These disclosures caused the price of Elevance common stock to decline by another $52.61 per share, or 10.6%. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Elevance‚Äôs conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the Elevance Health class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/ELV or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify‚Äôs customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company‚Äôs technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify‚Äôs ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company‚Äôs high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify‚Äôs Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify‚Äôs competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify‚Äôs ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company‚Äôs profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify‚Äôs risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the foregoing, Defendants‚Äô positive statements about the Company‚Äôs business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. The truth about this fraud was revealed through a series of disclosures culminating in February 2025 and March 2025. In February 2025, DoubleVerify reported disappointing earnings and disclosed a multiyear deceleration trend due to the suspension of DoubleVerify services by a large customer. On this news, the price of DoubleVerify stock fell 36 percent. Then, in March 2025, market research company Adalytics Research released a report claiming that DoubleVerify‚Äôs web advertisement verification and fraud protection services are ineffective, and that DoubleVerify customers are regularly billed for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms.

Title: Smart Speculation vs. Gambling
URL: https://dailyreckoning.com/smart-speculation-vs-gambling/
Time Published: 2025-06-12T21:57:10Z
Full Content:
By Adam Sharp PostedJune 12, 2025 Watching sports these days feels completely different than it did a decade ago. These days, half the ads are about gambling. During pre-game shows, analysts seem to spend more time on betting strategies than actual analysis. Major sports leagues like the NFL now openly partner with sports books and gambling platforms. That was once a red line which respectable leagues wouldn‚Äôt cross. Influencers promote ‚Äúparlay‚Äù strategies which involve 5-10 legs and offer the chance to earn 50x. But in truth, parlays are where the sports books make the most money. Another hard truth is that only about 5% of sports bettors withdraw more than they put in. It‚Äôs very difficult to overcome the house‚Äôs edge. The average sports bet has a commission rate of around 9%, which only a very lucky minority can overcome. Lower income households are disproportionately affected by sports gambling. This group spends a much larger percentage of income on sports betting, as shown in the chart below. Source: Gambling Away Stability: Sports Betting‚Äôs Impact on Vulnerable Households As you can see from the chart, this problem is only getting worse. In 2024 Americans legally wagered around $148 billion on sports, up a massive 23% from 2023. Look, it‚Äôs a free country and some people are capable of gambling responsibly. I myself play in a few fantasy football leagues with friends and co-workers, and it‚Äôs great fun. But I won‚Äôt allow myself to download a sports book app. It‚Äôd be too tempting to gamble on 8-leg parlays in the hopes of hitting a 50x. Much better to stick to what I know: contrarian and long-term investing. The fact that Americans increasingly see sports gambling as a path to riches is downright scary‚Ä¶ Our nation‚Äôs obsession with gambling extends beyond sports. We see it in crypto markets, margin trading, meme stocks, options mania, and crazy stock valuations. America is in the midst of a decade-long speculation bender. This trend is being driven by fundamental factors which cannot be ignored. The core problem is that the cost of living is rising far faster than wages. Younger generations face completely unaffordable home prices, expensive stocks, a brutal job market, and stagnant pay. Many see speculation and gambling as the only way out. The average person knows little about the stock market, but they do know something about sports. So the sports gambling path seems to offer an exit from the rat race. But it‚Äôs the worst possible route to riches. Overcoming the house advantage may as well be impossible. If you find yourself in a situation where you ‚Äúneed‚Äù to speculate, do it smartly. Don‚Äôt bet on 9-leg sports parlays which are never going to hit. For people with limited savings, speculation shouldn‚Äôt even be on the menu. It‚Äôs much better to invest in yourself. Try building a business on the side. This is how the vast majority of self-made individuals become wealthy. In contrast, the number of people who got rich through pure speculation is miniscule. Especially from a low starting point. If you have $500 to invest, it‚Äôs much better to buy a pressure washer and hit the streets rather than speculate on dubious investments. The pressure washer has a high probability of paying for itself many times over, assuming the owner is willing to apply the necessary elbow grease. Meanwhile, $500 on sports parlays may as well be flushed down the toilet. Building a business today is more accessible than ever. A motivated and curious person can use cheap AI tools to build a website, write a business plan, get legal advice, and brainstorm marketing ideas. Just a few years ago these setup costs could have easily totaled $10,000+. If you‚Äôre unemployed or struggling, one of the best investments you can make is in your own AI skills. Just go to ChatGPT.com and start experimenting. You can do a lot even with a free account. A premium subscription costs $20 per month and used correctly can provide an incredible ROI. One could argue that a $20/month ChatGPT membership is far more valuable than a $150k MBA in today‚Äôs world. The future belongs to entrepreneurs and those who learn to harness AI to its full potential. For those who do have funds to invest, only a portion should be used for high-risk bets. The majority should be put into tax-protected retirement accounts like a 401k or IRA, and invested in index or target-date retirement funds. Of course, a portion of your portfolio can be invested in speculative assets. There‚Äôs absolutely nothing wrong with smart and disciplined speculation. For example, well-researched and executed options bets can improve long-term returns. But we need to recognize the increased risk in this area, and treat it with respect. Keep options betting to a small portion (5% or less) of your overall portfolio. And no, that doesn‚Äôt mean invest 5% on a single options trade. It means that only 5% of your total portfolio should be dedicated to options, and that‚Äôs it. If you lose that 5%, don‚Äôt dip into the core. Personally, I feel safe putting a larger percentage of my assets in long-term contrarian investments. For me, that often means buying out of favor assets like emerging markets (Brazil is a personal favorite currently ‚Äì see more here). Silver miners are another of my favorite speculative investments today. They are a classic asymmetric trade, meaning they have far more upside potential than downside. Read more about the silver miner thesis in Something to Behold. These examples are speculative, but in a smart way. They couldn‚Äôt be more different from sports gambling. This method takes patience, but it has an infinitely higher chance of producing wealth than gambling and other dubious methods. Look for more contrarian investment ideas in the near future.

Title: BlackRock‚Äôs BUIDL nears $3B, registers 3x increase in less than 90 days

The fund also register another monthly dividend record, distributing over $10 million in May. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock‚Äôs USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) expanded by about $1 billion between March 26 and June 11, representing roughly half of the $2 billion growth of the tokenized US treasuries market in the period. According to rwa.xyz data, BUIDL‚Äôs size is $2.89 billion as of June 11. It is the largest tokenized money fund, representing 40% of the $7.34 billion market. The March 26 benchmark is significant because it‚Äôs when Ethena Labs stopped adding the fund shares to back its USDtb stablecoin. USDtb drove most of BUIDL‚Äôs growth in 2025, channeling 90% of its reserves into the fund, totaling $1.3 billion. Consequently, the significant 35% growth in less than three months without Ethena‚Äôs boost suggests continuing demand for regulated, high-yield cash instruments on public blockchains. Furthermore, the fund has grown by nearly three times since it reached $1 billion on March 13, achieving this milestone in just over a year. However, it took less than 90 days to triple the amount, suggesting a spike in interest in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, especially tokenized US treasuries. According to rwa.xyz‚Äôs overview, the RWA market grew by nearly $5 billion between March 13 and June 11. The tokenized US treasuries market represented almost half of the global RWA market growth. As shared on June 12 by ETF Store CEO Nate Geraci, BlackRock recently published its effort to bridge the traditional capital markets ‚Äúwith the developing digital assets ecosystem,‚Äù currently focusing on tokenized funds. Alongside asset growth, BUIDL‚Äôs income distributions continued to set new highs. The fund paid $4.17 million in March, pushing cumulative payouts above $25 million. April dividends rose to about $7.9 million, lifting lifetime payments past $33 million, according to issuer posts. May distributions exceeded $10 million, bringing total dividends to more than $43 million since inception. This represented the third consecutive monthly record.

U.S. data centers are rapidly driving up demand for power, with the official forecast for electricity consumption next year almost doubling in the past month. Total power usage in the U.S. is expected to climb 2.15% in 2026, spurred largely by a 5% spike from commercial users because of the expansion of data centers, according to a U.S. Energy Department report released this week. That‚Äôs up sharply from a month ago, when the agency expected commercial demand to rise by 2% and total consumption to gain by 1.12%. Amazon said Monday that it will spend $20 billion on two data center complexes in Pennsylvania, including one it is building alongside a nuclear power plant. U.S. filings for jobless benefits were unchanged last week, remaining at the higher end of recent ranges as uncertainty over the impact of trade wars lingers. New applications for jobless benefits numbered 248,000 for the week ending June 7, the Labor Department said Thursday. Analysts had forecast 244,000 new applications. A week ago, there were 248,000 jobless claim applications, which was the most since early October and a sign that layoffs could be trending higher. ‚ÄúThere are early warning signs in the labor market,‚Äù said Navy Federal Credit Union‚Äôs chief economist, Heather Long. ‚ÄúIf layoffs worsen this summer, it will heighten fears of a recession and consumer spending pullback.‚Äù On Wednesday, Google confirmed that it had offered buyouts to a swath of its workforce in a fresh round of cost-cutting ahead of a court decision that could order a breakup of its internet empire. Other companies that have announced job cuts this year include Procter & Gamble, Workday, Dow, CNN, Starbucks, Southwest Airlines, Microsoft and Facebook parent company Meta.

BlackRock Inc. wants to achieve $400 billion in cumulative fundraising between 2025 and 2030, according to an investor day presentation released Thursday. The $10 trillion asset manager‚Äôs vision includes expanding its alternative investment offerings to insurers and wealth managers, leveraging its recent manager acquisitions and technology offerings. The firm recently acquired infrastructure investor Global Infrastructure Partners ($170 billion assets under management) and expects to close its acquisition of private credit manager HPS Investment Partners ($157 billion AUM) in the third quarter. HPS and BlackRock reported that together, as of the first quarter, they had $14 billion in fee-paying credit AUM in existing wealth management channels, a figure they hope to grow to at least $60 billion by 2030 by expanding into European direct lending, private asset-based income products and offering private credit investments across wealth management channels. BlackRock, through its acquisition of GIP, has become the world‚Äôs largest infrastructure manager, and it sees private capital bridging the infrastructure funding gap. According to BlackRock, the world needs $94 trillion in infrastructure funding by 2040, of which a $15 trillion gap exists between the current pace of investment and what will be needed. Never miss a story ‚Äî sign up for CIO newsletters to stay up-to-date on the latest institutional investment industry news. ÔÅ° The asset manager wants to increase its annual revenue to more than $35 billion from $20 billion by the end of the decade, nearly doubling operating income to $15 billion from $8 billion and doubling its market capitalization to $280 billion from $140 billion. Revenue derived from private markets and technology is expected to double as a percentage of BlackRock‚Äôs income. In 2024, private markets and technology accounted for 15% of the firm‚Äôs $20 billion in revenue. In 2030, BlackRock wants these businesses to account for 30% of total revenue.

Title: Hamas Attacks Aid Group, Challenging Israel‚Äôs Gaza Plan
URL: http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/hamas-attacks-aid-group-israel-gaza-1235363397/
Time Published: 2025-06-12T19:03:58Z
Full Content:
By Mac William Bishop An ambush allegedly carried out by Hamas on Wednesday killed at least eight Palestinian aid workers, with an unknown number of others taken hostage, according to an aid group. The apparent massacre makes clear that Hamas, even after a year and half of deadly military strikes carried out by Israel that have killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, remains operational. It also underscores the difficulties faced by the U.S.- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), whose local Palestinian employees were the target of the attack. ‚ÄúWe are still collecting more information on the deadly and unprovoked attack on our dedicated local team members and volunteers. As of now, we can confirm at least eight fatalities, multiple injuries, and we fear that some of our team members have been taken hostage,‚Äù GHF Interim Executive Director John Acree said in a statement. ‚ÄúThis attack did not happen in a vacuum. For days, Hamas has openly threatened our team, our aid workers, and the civilians who receive aid from us,‚Äù a GHF spokesperson said in a statement. ‚ÄúThe GHF holds Hamas fully responsible for taking the lives of our dedicated workers who have been distributing humanitarian aid to the Palestinian people at the foundation‚Äôs sites in central and southern Gaza. Tonight, the world must see this for what it is: an attack on humanity.‚Äù Indeed, nothing surrounding GHF has occurred in a vacuum. Since its inception earlier this year, the foundation has been a focal point of criticism from international aid groups, human rights organizations, and pro-Palestinian activists. In mid-May, more than two dozen burly Americans arrived in Tel Aviv‚Äôs Ben Gurion International Airport, with photos of the men circulating across social media and local news outlets speculating about their purpose. Private military contractors ‚Äì mercenaries ‚Äì had previously been hired by two U.S. security companies to work in Gaza manning checkpoints, under the sanction of the Israel Defense Forces. But the group that arrived in Tel Aviv represented something new. They were the vanguard of GHF, a newly established non-profit intended to place the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza outside the purview of the United Nations ‚Äî and under the control of the Israeli government. Editor‚Äôs picks The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time The 200 Greatest Singers of All Time The Israeli military has strictly controlled access to Gaza since Hamas‚Äô surprise attack on October 7, 2023, and humanitarian groups cannot deliver aid to the territory without its cooperation. Israel has periodically restricted or blocked aid deliveries, to the point that aid groups have regularly issued warnings of imminent famine. The most recent blockade started on March 2, and continued until mid-May. Some aid groups have described the aid blockade as a deliberate strategy, designed to starve the civilian population of Gaza, and some have even called it a war crime, or part of an overall plan to ethnically cleanse the territory. Others see a motive that is equally ruthless, but with a more immediate political goal: By cutting out aid groups with established ground operations, and putting Gaza aid in the hands of a friendly non-profit, Tel Aviv hopes to reduce Hamas‚Äô influence. Tel Aviv has long viewed the UN and its local agency, UNRWA, as essentially under the control of Hamas, and antipathetic to Israel‚Äôs existence. ‚ÄúDistribution of food and humanitarian aid is one of the major tools that Hamas uses as a means to maintain its ruling capacity, and for the time being, to maintain its relationship with the major clans or families in the Gaza Strip,‚Äù says Avi Melamed, a former Israeli intelligence official and Arab affairs specialist. Related Content Trump Nixed Israeli Plan to Assassinate Iran's Supreme Leader: Report Sen. Alex Padilla: If Law Enforcement Detained Me, 'Imagine What They're Doing to People Without Titles' Internet Trolls Around the World Are Mocking Trump's Military Birthday Parade Trump‚Äôs FAA Nominee Lied About Having a ‚ÄòCommercial‚Äô Pilot License He notes instances of organized looting outside the control of Hamas, saying Israel‚Äôs aid blockades have created a ‚Äúvolatile dynamic‚Äù in the relations between the political group and the network of Gaza‚Äôs powerful clans ‚Äî perhaps intentionally. Israel‚Äôs strategy with aid in Gaza ‚Äúmostly has to do with the whole issue of putting pressure on Hamas, in the sense of neutralizing or limiting its ability to continue to dictate its agenda‚Ä¶ it is basically trying to reduce or minimize as much as possible [Hamas‚Äô] governance capacity and role in the Gaza Strip.‚Äù The men behind GHF are a hodgepodge of former military and intelligence officials, backed by Israeli tech billionaires, an Armenian financier with a checkered past, and tens of millions of dollars from unknown donors. The international version of GHF was established as a stiftung ‚Äî the designation for a nonprofit foundation in Switzerland ‚Äî on Feb. 11 this year, according to documents published by the Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce. Its purpose was ‚Äúspecifically to provide humanitarian aid to those affected by the conflict in the Gaza Strip, including the secure provision of food, water, medicine, shelter, and reconstruction.‚Äù The president of the foundation was listed as David Papazian, an Armenian investor. A brief examination of Papazian reveals a curious background for an aid executive, with links to a 2015 insider-trading cyber-hacking scandal, ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, and a key role in development projects funded by the United Arab Emirates while head of Armenia‚Äôs state-backed development fund ‚Äî a position from which he was ousted in January 2024 amid questions about his governance. Another individual listed in the GHF‚Äôs international documents was David Kohler, a Cologne-based and ‚ÄúSwiss-registered lawyer with experience in handling complex cross-border transactions, contract and corporate matters, capital markets and financing issues,‚Äù who has ‚Äúsignificant experience in representing clients in Europe, the U.S., the Middle East and Russia,‚Äù according to his LinkedIn profile. On May 14, as questions about the foundation‚Äôs legitimacy and ability to deliver aid proliferated, Kohler resigned from the stiftung‚Äôs board. The final person listed on GHF‚Äôs Swiss registration is Loik Henderson, an Arlington-based lawyer who serves as general counsel for Protection Services Inc., a private security company that provides ‚Äúcomprehensive security solutions and personnel security expertise to the U.S. government.‚Äù Henderson is also listed as the president of GHF in its U.S. incorporation documents. Where the money for all of this is coming from is not clear ‚Äî GHF officials have talked about receiving a ‚Äú$100 million donation‚Äù from an unspecified source. One Middle Eastern intelligence source tells Rolling Stone a substantial amount of money was most likely provided by the UAE, which has been quietly working with both Israel and the Trump administration behind the scenes in Gaza. The U.S. State Department is also considering funneling $500 million to GHF, Reuters reported last week. In addition, The Washington Post reported that two Israeli tech moguls were backing GHF, naming them as ‚ÄúLiran Tancman, an entrepreneur and reservist in the IDF‚Äôs 8200 signals intelligence unit, who called for using biometric identification systems outside the distribution hubs to vet Palestinian civilians. Another was Michael Eisenberg, an American Israeli venture capitalist who argued that existing U.N. aid distribution networks were sustaining Hamas and needed to be overhauled.‚Äù On the ground, two private security contract firms have been tied to GHF, with Reuters reporting one as ‚ÄúUG Solutions ‚Äî a low-profile company founded in 2023 and based in Davidson, North Carolina,‚Äù which began hiring security personnel earlier this year, offering ‚Äúa daily rate starting at $1,100 with a $10,000 advance to veterans it hires.‚Äù According to The New York Times, GHF‚Äôs security and logistics plan appears to have been developed under the direction of Israel, working with Safe Reach Solutions, a newly formed Wyoming-based company headed by Phillip F. Reilly, a retired CIA paramilitary officer and former agency station chief in Afghanistan. Amid this panoply of international lawyers, guns, and money, GHF also went looking for officials from the humanitarian sector with the experience and gravitas to lend the organization credibility. Initial documents from the foundation listed a number of respected veterans of international aid work for potential senior positions. These included David Beasley, the former head of the World Food Program, and Nate Mook, the former chief executive of World Central Kitchen. Both men subsequently denied they had agreed to join the organization. The man who did become the public face of GHF was Jake Wood, a former U.S. Marine and social entrepreneur best known for co-founding Team Rubicon, a veteran-based emergency response nonprofit. As it prepared to begin operations, Wood took to the airwaves, describing the humanitarian disaster unfolding in Gaza and calling on international aid organizations to work with GHF, rather than criticize it. His leadership was short-lived. On May 26, as the media furor swelled ahead of GHF‚Äôs first deployment, Wood announced he was resigning from the foundation, saying he no longer believed in its ‚Äúneutrality, impartiality and independence.‚Äù Veteran aid workers, who had been saying this from the start, were celebratory. ‚ÄúI hope this idea of having a privatized, militarized, and politicized humanitarian aid organization is gone forever,‚Äù says Jan Egeland, the secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council. ‚ÄúWe cannot work with Hamas, and we cannot work with Israel.‚Äù But GHF was far from finished. An evangelical activist with close ties to President Donald Trump, Rev. Johnnie Moore, was appointed as chairman of GHF after Wood‚Äôs departure. Since it started operations at the end of May, scenes of food distribution sites run by GHF ‚Äî densely packed crowds of refugees gathered in the hot sun, corralled into mazes of chain link fencing to wait for hours for the chance to receive food supplies ‚Äî confirmed the fears of many critics that the group was in over its head. A series of deadly incidents involving people gathering to collect food at GHF-run distribution sites have resulted in dozens killed, with Palestinians claiming the Israeli military was responsible. Israel, in turn, has disavowed responsibility. Meanwhile, the GHF has been adamant that none of the incidents at distribution sites were the result of actions taken by its personnel. ‚ÄúAs we have repeatedly cautioned, there are many parties who wish to see GHF fail. Their goal is to force a return to the status quo, even if it means risking life-saving aid to the people of Gaza,‚Äù a GHF spokesperson wrote on May 28. Since beginning operations, GHF says that it has delivered 19 million meals at four sites, with three remaining operational. The attack on the busload of Palestinians working for GHF makes it clear that the group is in the crosshairs of Hamas. For now, it continues its operations. ‚ÄúThis has been a painful day but our team made the decision that the best way to honor the memory of our local Palestinian colleagues was to press on, proceeding with food distribution today, as planned,‚Äù wrote Moore, the GHF chairman. ‚ÄúWe provided food for 2.6 million meals TODAY.‚Äù Contrary to the neutrality espoused by most international aid groups, GHF has been explicit that it views Hamas as the primary barrier to delivery of aid in Gaza. ‚ÄúHamas wants to return to a broken system it once controlled and exploited ‚Äî diverting aid, manipulating distribution, and putting its own agenda ahead of the Palestinian people‚Äôs basic needs,‚Äù a GHF spokesperson said.

Server manufacturers may vary configurations, yielding different results. Performance may vary based on use of latest drivers and optimizations. Current customer pricing as of June 10, 2025, and subject to change. MI350-049 iv MI400-001: Performance projection as of 06/05/2025 using engineering estimates based on the design of a future AMD Instinct MI400 Series GPU compared to the Instinct MI355x, with 2K and 16K prefill with TP8, EP8 and projected inference performance, and using a GenAI training model evaluated with GEMM and Attention algorithms for the Instinct MI400 Series. Results may vary when products are released in market. (MI400-001)v EPYC-030a: Calculation includes 1) base case kWhr use projections in 2025 conducted with Koomey Analytics based on available research and data that includes segment specific projected 2025 deployment volumes and data center power utilization effectiveness (PUE) including GPU HPC and machine learning (ML) installations and 2) AMD CPU and GPU node power consumptions incorporating segment-specific utilization (active vs. idle) percentages and multiplied by PUE to determine actual total energy use for calculation of the performance per Watt. 38x is calculated using the following formula: (base case HPC node kWhr use projection in 2025 * AMD 2025 perf/Watt improvement using DGEMM and TEC +Base case ML node kWhr use projection in 2025 *AMD 2025 perf/Watt improvement using ML math and TEC) /(Base case projected kWhr usage in 2025). For more information, https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/corporate-responsibility/data-center-sustainability.html. vi AMD based advanced racks for AI training/inference in each year (2024 to 2030) based on AMD roadmaps, also examining historical trends to inform rack design choices and technology improvements to align projected goals and historical trends. The 2024 rack is based on the MI300X node, which is comparable to the Nvidia H100 and reflects current common practice in AI deployments in 2024/2025 timeframe. The 2030 rack is based on an AMD system and silicon design expectations for that time frame. In each case, AMD specified components like GPUs, CPUs, DRAM, storage, cooling, and communications, tracking component and defined rack characteristics for power and performance. Calculations do not include power used for cooling air or water supply outside the racks but do include power for fans and pumps internal to the racks.Performance improvements are estimated based on progress in compute output (delivered, sustained, not peak FLOPS), memory (HBM) bandwidth, and network (scale-up) bandwidth, expressed as indices and weighted by the following factors for training and inference. Performance and power use per rack together imply trends in performance per watt over time for training and inference, then indices for progress in training and inference are weighted 50:50 to get the final estimate of AMD projected progress by 2030 (20x). The performance number assumes continued AI model progress in exploiting lower precision math formats for both training and inference which results in both an increase in effective FLOPS and a reduction in required bandwidth per FLOP. vii AMD estimated the number of racks to train a typical notable AI model based on EPOCH AI data (https://epoch.ai). For this calculation we assume, based on these data, that a typical model takes 1025 floating point operations to train (based on the median of 2025 data), and that this training takes place over 1 month. FLOPs needed = 10^25 FLOPs/(seconds/month)/Model FLOPs utilization (MFU) = 10^25/(2.6298*10^6)/0.6. Racks = FLOPs needed/(FLOPS/rack in 2024 and 2030). The compute performance estimates from the AMD roadmap suggests that approximately 276 racks would be needed in 2025 to train a typical model over one month using the MI300X product (assuming 22.656 PFLOPS/rack with 60% MFU) and <1 fully utilized rack would be needed to train the same model in 2030 using a rack configuration based on an AMD roadmap projection. These calculations imply a >276-fold reduction in the number of racks to train the same model over this six-year period. Electricity use for a MI300X system to completely train a defined 2025 AI model using a 2024 rack is calculated at ~7GWh, whereas the future 2030 AMD system could train the same model using ~350 MWh, a 95% reduction. AMD then applied carbon intensities per kWh from the International Energy Agency World Energy Outlook 2024 [https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2024]. IEA‚Äôs stated policy case gives carbon intensities for 2023 and 2030. We determined the average annual change in intensity from 2023 to 2030 and applied that to the 2023 intensity to get 2024 intensity (434 CO2 g/kWh) versus the 2030 intensity (312 CO2 g/kWh). Emissions for the 2024 baseline scenario of 7 GWh x 434 CO2 g/kWh equates to approximately 3000 metric tC02, versus the future 2030 scenario of 350 MWh x 312 CO2 g/kWh equates to around100 metric tCO2.

The Gigagas roadmap positions Polygon for high-throughput financial applications with planned scalability and instant finality. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Polygon has laid out an ambitious scaling roadmap to reach 100,000 transactions per second (TPS), beginning with a July upgrade that will bring the network to 1,000 TPS. The roadmap comes a day after Polygon announced a governance revamp and shift in focus to Agglayer. Dubbed the ‚ÄúGigagas‚Äù roadmap, the initiative is focused on making Polygon the go-to blockchain for real-world financial applications. It culminates in a long-term plan to power global-scale payments and tokenized assets. The July Bhilai Upgrade will introduce 1,000+ TPS throughput, reduce transaction finality to ~5 seconds, and stabilize gas fees under $0.001 per transaction without increasing validator requirements. In a separate development, the network‚Äôs native token POL became available on Solana (SOL) via Wormhole Bridge on June 12. By the end of this year, Polygon expects to scale past 5,000 TPS using a new Validator-Elected Block Producer (VEBloP) model that streamlines block production with stateless validation and a single leader architecture. This approach removes the risk of chain reorganizations by guaranteeing one-block finality, a key requirement for institutions and financial applications demanding predictable execution. Polygon said that the 5,000 TPS benchmark has already been achieved in a devnet environment, with technical proposals (PIP-64 and others) outlining the pathway to mainnet rollout. Alongside this upgrade, Polygon will also integrate with Agglayer, a multichain interoperability layer powered by POL staking that allows seamless liquidity movement across chains. In 2026 and beyond, Polygon‚Äôs goal is to exceed 100,000 TPS through continued optimization of its validator network and deeper integration with Agglayer. It will also focus on scaling for high-volume use cases like retail payments, AI-driven microtransactions, and tokenized financial markets. The network aims to match the reliability and speed of traditional payment systems while preserving decentralization. Polygon already ranks among the top chains in stablecoin and RWA activity, with over $134 billion in stablecoin transfer volume in April and hundreds of millions in institutional RWAs deployed by firms like Apollo and BlackRock. However, the Polygon team said the chain needs to scale ‚Äúan order of magnitude higher‚Äù to support trillions in on-chain value. The Gigagas roadmap signals a shift from theoretical scaling to real-world execution and positions Polygon as a high-throughput infrastructure layer for the next wave of blockchain adoption.

More Santiago/Getty Images) In the race to finally convince consumers of the benefits of AR and AI powered smart glasses, the global tech giants are heading back to the future ‚Äì with stores. As Google, Apple, Meta and Snap go head to head for what they believe will be a lucrative growth market, three of the four have established store networks to introduce their products to a new generation of consumers ‚Äì many of whom will not have seen Google‚Äôs pioneering but unsuccessful first attempt to create the market. Meta has partnered with Ray Ban, Apple has its own flagship store network to leverage, while the big headline came when Google recently committed to as much as $150 million with the consumer eyewear company Warby Parker. They are set to jointly develop AI-powered smart glasses based on Android XR and Google has already committed $75 million to Warby Parker‚Äôs product development and commercialization costs. Google will invest an additional $75 million, taking an equity stake in Warby Parker, should the trendy eyewear manufacturer meet certain milestones. The news immediately turbocharged Warby Parker‚Äôs stock price, which is up a little short of a fifth since the announcement after a challenging year to date which means that despite the boost the value is still around 11% off year to date. In May, Warby Parker announced first-quarter net revenue increased nearly 12% year over year to $223.8 million. It also reported its first positive quarterly net income as a public company, with $3.5 million in income compared with a loss of about $2.7 million in Q1 2024. It also opened 11 net new stores, ending the quarter with 287 locations nationwide. At the Google I/O 2025 event, Google also announced partnerships with several companies to develop smart glasses with Gemini AI and AR capabilities, including Samsung and uber trendy Korean eyewear retailer Gentle Monster. Google has no doubt taken a close look at Meta‚Äôs smart glasses strategy after the latter found success partnering and investing in the maker of iconic sunglasses brand Ray-Ban to develop its smart glasses. One of the reasons that Ray-Ban and Meta have acheived some success is that the smart glasses, far from the clunky original iterations, have a stylish and familiar design and they are being sold across Ray-Ban‚Äôs stores network.

More Cros/NurPhoto via Getty Images) It seems likely that Google will use the same playbook with Warby Parker, taking advantage of the eyewear company‚Äôs popular frame designs and its growing network of retail stores and online presence around the country. In announcing the collaboration, Warby Parker and Google said that they intend to launch a series of products over time and forecast that their first line of eyewear will launch ‚Äúafter 2025‚Äù and will incorporate multimodal AI with prescription and non-prescription glasses. Meantime, Snap has announced its own plans to release a sixth-generation of its augmented reality glasses next year. The company behind Snapchat said that its next-generation glasses will be called Specs, marking a break from the company‚Äôs Spectacles branding that it has used for prior versions of its wearable devices. Specs will use AR technology to let wearers see and interact with digital imagery overlaid over the physical world and its new glasses will be smaller and lighter than their predecessors, the company said, with Snap‚Äôs most recent Spectacles released in September 2024 to developers only. Those glasses were made available under a leasing model that required users to commit to paying $99 a month for a full year. Apple is also working on its own smart glasses, based on chips used in the Apple Watch that require less energy than the components in some of its other products like the iPhone, iPad and Mac, but they may not hit the market until sometime in 2027. Apple has already leveraged its store network to launch a host of products and updates and will be able to use those stores again to provide a platform for its smart glasses technology when it finally arrives.

It also opened 11 net new stores, ending the quarter with 287 locations nationwide. At the Google I/O 2025 event, Google also announced partnerships with several companies to develop smart glasses with Gemini AI and AR capabilities, including Samsung and uber trendy Korean eyewear retailer Gentle Monster. Google has no doubt taken a close look at Meta‚Äôs smart glasses strategy after the latter found success partnering and investing in the maker of iconic sunglasses brand Ray-Ban to develop its smart glasses. One of the reasons that Ray-Ban and Meta have acheived some success is that the smart glasses, far from the clunky original iterations, have a stylish and familiar design and they are being sold across Ray-Ban‚Äôs stores network.

More Cros/NurPhoto via Getty Images) It seems likely that Google will use the same playbook with Warby Parker, taking advantage of the eyewear company‚Äôs popular frame designs and its growing network of retail stores and online presence around the country. In announcing the collaboration, Warby Parker and Google said that they intend to launch a series of products over time and forecast that their first line of eyewear will launch ‚Äúafter 2025‚Äù and will incorporate multimodal AI with prescription and non-prescription glasses. Meantime, Snap has announced its own plans to release a sixth-generation of its augmented reality glasses next year. The company behind Snapchat said that its next-generation glasses will be called Specs, marking a break from the company‚Äôs Spectacles branding that it has used for prior versions of its wearable devices. Specs will use AR technology to let wearers see and interact with digital imagery overlaid over the physical world and its new glasses will be smaller and lighter than their predecessors, the company said, with Snap‚Äôs most recent Spectacles released in September 2024 to developers only. Those glasses were made available under a leasing model that required users to commit to paying $99 a month for a full year. Apple is also working on its own smart glasses, based on chips used in the Apple Watch that require less energy than the components in some of its other products like the iPhone, iPad and Mac, but they may not hit the market until sometime in 2027. Apple has already leveraged its store network to launch a host of products and updates and will be able to use those stores again to provide a platform for its smart glasses technology when it finally arrives.

Micron Technology (MU) on Thursday became the latest major corporation to announce plans to expand domestic production following President Donald Trump's call for firms to boost American manufacturing. The chipmaker and the Trump administration said Micron will boost its U.S. investments to about $150 billion in memory manufacturing and $50 billion in research and development (R&D). Micron explained that most of the money would be used for "two leading-edge high-volume fabs in Idaho, up to four leading-edge high-volume fabs in New York, the expansion and modernization of its existing manufacturing fab in Virginia," as well as advanced high-bandwith memory (HBM) packaging capabilities. The company noted that it has already received federal, state, and local funding for the Idaho, New York, and Virginia fab work, including up to $6.4 billion from the CHIPS and Science Act. Micron added it expects all of the investments will be eligible for federal Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit (AMIC). CEO Sanjay Mehrotra argued that this expansion "will reinforce America's technological leadership, create tens of thousands of American jobs across the semiconductor ecosystem and secure a domestic supply of semiconductors‚Äîcritical to economic and national security." This week, General Motors (GM) announced it would spend $4 billion to increase vehicle production at three U.S. plants. Earlier this year, chipmaking giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) said it planned to invest $100 billion in U.S.-based chip manufacturing facilities, and Apple (AAPL) announced plans to spend more than $500 billion domestically over the next four years. Shares of Micron Technology were little changed today but are up 37% this year, trading at their highest level since last July. TradingView

Title: The Ultimate Guide To Side Hustles

Time Published: 2025-06-12T15:31:46Z

ByAllBusiness ByAllBusiness, Contributor. By Dominique Harroch Side hustles can be your path to financial freedom and the life you actually want. We all could use some extra cash, right? Whether you're drowning in student loans, dreaming of that vacation to Bali, or just want some breathing room in your budget, side hustles are your ticket to financial freedom. And the best part? You don't need to quit your day job to start making serious money on the side. A side hustle is basically any gig you do outside your main job to bring in extra income. But here's where it gets exciting‚Äìtoday's side hustles can be incredibly flexible, creative, and surprisingly profitable. We're talking about making money from your couch, turning your hobbies into cash machines, and maybe even building the foundation for your future empire. Extra income: Let's talk money‚Äìbecause that's probably why you're here. We're not talking pocket change here. Many side hustlers are pulling in an extra $500 to $5,000 or more every month. That's mortgage payment money, vacation fund money, or "goodbye credit card debt" money. You're not putting all your eggs in one basket: Here's what's even better than the money itself. Is your boss having a bad day? Company downsizing? No problem. You've got multiple income streams flowing, which means you're less stressed about any financial curveballs life might throw at you. Freedom and flexibility: These are game-changers that affect everything about how you work. You decide when to work, what projects to take, and how much to charge. No more asking permission to leave early or begging for time off. Your side hustle works around YOUR life, not the other way around. Skill-building goldmine: Don't forget this massive advantage that keeps paying dividends. Every side hustle teaches you something new‚Äìmarketing, customer service, time management, or whatever specialty you choose. These skills don't just make you more money; they make you more valuable everywhere. Many people have turned their side hustle skills into promotions at their day jobs or completely new career paths. Creative outlet: This aspect is huge for people stuck in boring day jobs. Tired of mind-numbing spreadsheets all day? Your side hustle can be your creative playground where you actually enjoy what you're doing while making money. It's like getting paid for your hobbies‚Äìbecause sometimes you literally are. Ready to dive in? Let's make this happen without overwhelming yourself. Start by getting real about your available time. Don't go crazy planning 40-hour weeks‚Äìmost successful side hustlers start with just 5-10 hours per week. You can always scale up once you're making money and feeling the groove. Pick something you actually enjoy or are naturally good at. Life's too short to hate your side hustle too. If you love dogs, consider pet services. Good with words? Writing might be your goldmine. Tech-savvy? Virtual services are calling your name. Do a little homework before jumping in. Check out what others are charging, see what customers are complaining about (hello, opportunity!), and figure out how to do it better. A quick scan of Facebook groups, Reddit threads, or Google searches can save you months of trial and error. Set some goals that actually excite you. "I want to make $1,000 extra this month" hits different than "I want some extra money." Get specific about what that money will do for you‚Äìpay off your car, fund your wedding, or let you finally take that trip you've been dreaming about. Keep it simple at first. Don't worry about business licenses, fancy websites, or complicated accounting systems right out the gate. Test your idea, make some money, then worry about the fancy stuff once you know it's working. Here's the thing‚Äìhaving a good idea for a side hustle is just the beginning. To really make money, you need to treat it like a real business. That means showing up consistently, delivering quality work, and always looking for ways to improve and grow. Get online and stay visible. Social media isn't optional anymore‚Äìit's where your customers are hanging out. Post regularly, engage with people, and show off your work. You don't need to be everywhere, but pick 1-2 platforms and post to them consistently. Network like your bank account depends on it. Join Facebook groups, post on Instagram, attend local business events, tell everyone what you're doing. Most side hustle success comes from word-of-mouth and referrals, so make sure people know how to find you. Always be improving your game. Raise your prices as you get better, streamline your processes to work faster, and look for ways to make more money from the same effort. The difference between someone making $500 a month and $5,000 a month often comes down to these optimizations. Scale smart when you‚Äôre ready. Once you're consistently booked and making good money, think about hiring help, raising prices, or expanding your services. The goal is to make more money without working yourself to death. Time management will make or break you. Start small and build up gradually. Use calendars, time-blocking, and whatever tools keep you organized. The last thing you want is to burn out or mess up your day job. Don't undervalue yourself. Seriously, charge what you're worth. If you're too cheap, people will think you're not good. If you're delivering value, price accordingly. You can always start lower and increase as you prove yourself. Inconsistent income is part of the game, especially at first. Keep some money in the bank for slower months, and don't quit your day job until your side hustle is reliably bringing in serious money. Avoid shiny object syndrome. Pick one thing and get good at it before jumping to the next opportunity. The grass isn't always greener‚Äìsometimes you just need to water your own lawn better and focus on nurturing your side hustle. Side hustles can be your path to financial freedom and the life you actually want. In a world where job security is uncertain and bills keep getting higher, having multiple income streams isn't just smart; it's essential. The opportunities we've laid out here are real ways to make real money by leveraging skills you probably already have or can easily learn. The best part? You don't need permission from anyone to start. No boss to convince, no investor to pitch to, no committee to approve your idea. Just you, your hustle, and the decision to take control of your financial future. Start with one idea that excites you, commit to it for at least 3 months (and ideally longer), and watch what happens. Your future self‚Äìthe one with more money, more options, and more freedom‚Äìis waiting for you to make the move. So what are you waiting for? Get going on that side hustle!

Title: Strategy, GameStop Lead $50 Billion Institutional Surge Into Bitcoin as Treasury Asset

Highlights Bitcoin has evolved from a niche asset to a mainstream institutional-grade investment, with Fortune 500 companies, like Strategy and GameStop among others, allocating billions to bitcoin holdings, transforming corporate treasuries into crypto-forward financial operations. Companies are leveraging complex financial instruments (e.g., convertible notes, structured products, bitcoin-backed loans) to gain crypto exposure, potentially blurring the line between financial innovation and speculative risk. The role of corporate treasurers is expanding beyond traditional finance to include crypto expertise, risk governance, and digital asset strategy, prompting a critical reevaluation of bitcoin's place on balance sheets ‚Äî as a hedge, speculative asset, or branding signal ‚Äî based on a company‚Äôs unique financial profile. In the early days of bitcoin, it was hard to imagine Fortune 500 treasury teams doing anything more than monitoring its unpredictable price swings out of casual interest.

Œî But 15 years and several bull-bear cycles later, the cryptocurrency is no longer just the domain of technologists and retail investors. It‚Äôs evolving into an institutional-grade asset. Not just in theory, but in practice. Fortune 500 blockchain adoption has allegedly now hit 60% with institutions injecting as much as $50 billion into crypto funds in Q1. Leading the pack is the one-time software company Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), which has compiled a war chest of 580,000 bitcoin, worth about $63 billion, since the middle of 2020, with its latest purchase coming within the past two weeks. Strategy has transformed itself into a bitcoin treasury company and is now primarily in the business of selling securities to raise money to buy the cryptocurrency. Far from being viewed as a black sheep, the company‚Äôs ‚Äúbitcoin treasury‚Äù approach has spurred a wave of publicly traded copycats. GameStop, for example, on Wednesday (June 11) announced it was issuing $1.75 billion in convertible notes to buy bitcoin. This followed an earlier Q1 acquisition of 4,710 BTC (about $513 million), which made GameStop the 13th‚Äëlargest corporate holder. Elsewhere, The Blockchain Group, which describes itself as Europe‚Äôs first bitcoin treasury company, on Monday (June 9) announced a $300 million issuance for, you guessed it, the purposes of purchasing more bitcoin. From structured notes and hedging instruments to yield-bearing custodial accounts and even Bitcoin-backed loans, the ecosystem is diversifying at a pace few anticipated. But beneath the innovation lies a familiar tension: are these truly risk-managed tools for corporate finance, or cleverly packaged speculative bets in disguise? Read also: Making Sense of Bitcoin‚Äôs Growing Relevance for Corporate Treasuries Milestones like the launch of CME Bitcoin futures (2017), the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. (2024), and the entrance of traditional financial institutions like Fidelity, BlackRock, and JPMorgan into the crypto arena have provided a sense of legitimacy. With regulatory clarity slowly improving, especially around custody and reporting standards, corporate finance professionals are being offered a potential new value proposition: the cryptocurrency not as a gamble, but as a balance sheet diversification strategy. As PYMNTS covered, even the Ivy-league institution Brown University has recently disclosed a $4.9 million investment in BlackRock‚Äôs bitcoin ETF, signaling a broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies in diversified portfolios. After all, the CLARITY Act, which aims to establish a regulatory framework for digital assets and crypto markets in the U.S., is set to be considered by the full U.S. House of Representatives after being advanced by two House committees Tuesday (June 10). At the same time, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) wants to ease restrictions governing decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. The treasurer‚Äôs role in this environment? It‚Äôs no longer merely about cash, FX, or interest rate swaps ‚Äî but increasingly about whether the CFO team has the infrastructure, expertise, risk governance, and capital strategies to harness any crypto strategy judiciously. See also: Are Crypto Markets Going Mainstream? What Treasury Execs Should Know Bitcoin is maturing into a multi-dimensional treasury instrument: a defensive store-of-value, a potential yield generator and a signal of corporate innovation. But behind the headlines and bold plays lies a complex ecosystem rich with financing engineering, volatility exposure, regulatory uncertainty, and governance pitfalls. After all, for all the innovation, there‚Äôs a critical issue at the heart of this trend: are these financial tools being used to serve prudent corporate strategy, or are they a new flavor of speculative risk? Some critics argue that bitcoin-linked treasury products may be less about strategic diversification and more about corporate speculation dressed in financial engineering. Today‚Äôs suite of corporate crypto offerings are designed to mitigate some of the risks. But in doing so, they can sometimes introduce new forms of complexity ‚Äî particularly around counterparty risk, liquidity constraints and regulatory uncertainty. The accounting treatment of crypto assets remains a thorny issue. In the U.S., bitcoin is still classified as an intangible asset, meaning unrealized losses must be recognized, but gains can‚Äôt be booked unless the asset is sold. This creates a lopsided risk profile for public companies. Perhaps the central question for corporate treasurers is this: What is bitcoin in the context of the corporate balance sheet? Is it a modern hedge against fiat inflation, akin to gold? A speculative instrument that can juice short-term returns but introduces material downside? Or a strategic signaling tool ‚Äî part financial asset, part branding exercise? The answer may depend on the type of business and its risk profile. For a tech-forward firm with high margins and a long investment horizon, limited bitcoin exposure may offer a form of asymmetric upside. For a capital-intensive industrial company with tight liquidity, it may be an unjustifiable risk.

Title: What Drove Meta Stock's 2x Rise?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. PARIS, FRANCE - JUNE 12: The Meta AI logo is displayed during the 9th edition of the VivaTech show ... More at Parc des Expositions Porte de Versailles on June 12, 2025 in Paris, France. VivaTech, the biggest tech show in Europe but also in a unique digital format, for 4 days of reconnection and relaunch thanks to innovation. (Photo by Chesnot/Getty Images) META Platforms stock (NASDAQ: META) has witnessed a substantial increase, spurred by investor enthusiasm over rising user interaction and consistently robust quarterly earnings. So far this year, Meta has gained 16%, significantly outperforming the wider NASDAQ index, which has increased by 2%. Examining a slightly extended timeframe, Meta‚Äôs outperformance is even more pronounced. Since the beginning of 2024, Meta‚Äôs stock has achieved a striking 97% return, rising from about $350 to roughly $700 per share. In comparison, the NASDAQ index recorded a 31% increase during the same timeframe. The remarkable 97% increase in Meta‚Äôs stock can be linked to three primary factors: We will explore the details of these factors. While META stock has had a positive trajectory, if you seek an upside with a steadier experience than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has surpassed the S&P and recorded >91% returns since inception. Additionally, see ‚Äì Is Oracle Stock A Buy At $190? Meta Platforms stands as the world‚Äôs leading social network that connects individuals with friends and family. The company generates revenue mainly through advertising, which it offers to marketers by targeting specific demographics based on information shared by users on its platforms. Meta Platforms‚Äô revenue growth recently can be credited to an increase in ad impressions as well as a rise in the average price per ad. Additionally, Meta‚Äôs family daily active users (DAP) has grown by 7.5% from 3.19 billion in 2021 to 3.43 billion now. The company benefits from its AI initiatives aimed at enhancing advertising. It also intends to leverage AI for generating more content. Not only has the company‚Äôs sales improved in the past three years, but its net income margin has expanded from 29% in 2023 to 39% currently. Meta‚Äôs outstanding shares have also decreased by 1% over this timeframe, largely due to the $63 billion the company invested in share buybacks since 2023. The rise in revenues combined with margin expansion and fewer shares has resulted in the company‚Äôs net profit of $25.58 now, an increase of 72% from $14.87 in 2023. Investors are increasingly optimistic about Meta‚Äôs stock, and rightly so. The company is experiencing a healthy increase in both ad impressions and the average price per ad, which directly enhances its sales. A significant factor driving this optimism is Meta‚Äôs proactive investment in AI. This is not merely a trendy term for Meta; AI is significantly contributing to heightened advertising revenues by: Meta is deeply incorporating generative AI throughout its entire social media ecosystem. This includes innovative features such as the Meta AI virtual assistant for chat, advanced image generation, and robust photo editing tools. Moreover, its Llama AI model is quickly gaining a substantial user base, further solidifying its leadership in AI. These potent growth drivers, coupled with Meta‚Äôs improving profitability‚Äîevidenced by a solid 39% net income margin‚Äîhave significantly enhanced investor confidence. Consequently, the company‚Äôs Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio has notably expanded from 6.9x trailing revenues in 2023 to 10.6x currently. Indeed, META stock has performed well since the start of 2024. Nonetheless, the rise in META stock has not been steady. The stock‚Äôs returns were 23% in 2021, -64% in 2022, 194% in 2023, and 66% in 2024. In contrast, returns for the S&P 500 were 27% in 2021, -19% in 2022, 24% in 2023, and 23% in 2024 ‚Äî suggesting that META underperformed the S&P in 2021 and 2022. Conversely, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring a selection of 30 stocks, has successfully outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four years. What accounts for this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded better returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; offering a smoother ride, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Considering the current uncertain macroeconomic environment characterized by trade disputes, interest rate adjustments, and geopolitical tensions, could META find itself in a situation similar to that of 2021 and 2022, potentially underperforming the S&P over the next twelve months ‚Äî or will it experience a strong upturn? From a valuation perspective, we believe that Meta‚Äôs stock is currently fully valued. Our evaluation places Meta Platforms‚Äô valuation at $702 per share, which is quite close to its current market price. The stock is currently trading at 10.6 times its trailing revenues, noticeably higher than its four-year average Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio of 6.8x. While a slight increase in Meta‚Äôs valuation multiple appears reasonable given its recent strong advertising growth, investors should also take into account the inherent risks. The exact impact that AI will have on the company‚Äôs long-term earnings growth remains uncertain. This uncertainty renders Meta‚Äôs ongoing, aggressive investments in AI a potential risk factor. For context, Meta has already invested $77 billion in capital expenditures since 2023, and it intends to allocate an additional $64 to $72 billion this year alone for AI infrastructure. While META stock seems fully valued, it is useful to examine how Meta Platform‚Äôs peers perform on important metrics.

June 12, 2025 08:18 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, June 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company‚Äôs senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance‚Äôs Medicaid members. What‚Äôs more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance‚Äôs rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now ‚Äúexpecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid‚Äù and that it was ‚Äúseeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.‚Äù On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that its missed consensus earnings per share (‚ÄúEPS‚Äù) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, ‚Äúdue to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.‚Äù On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Title: Here‚Äôs Why You Should Be Wary Of 401(k) Crypto Options

ByChris Carosa ByChris Carosa, Senior Contributor. It seems you can‚Äôt avoid crypto. It‚Äôs everywhere. In ads. On X posts. And, maybe soon, in your 401(k). But is that a good thing? If you‚Äôre thinking of dipping your toe into this undeniable buzz, it‚Äôs crucial you conduct a little due diligence. Professional fiduciaries have been pondering the enigma wrapped in a mystery that calls itself cryptocurrency. What are their feelings about this highly volatile and complex digital asset? Why have so many been so reticent about adding this asset class to portfolios? How might their thoughts inform you? Like any other hot investment, you only see the headlines trumpeting the good news. After all, no one ever goes to a cocktail party and enthusiastically brags, ‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt believe how much money I lost on this stock!‚Äù The truth is, what goes up often goes down. And what goes up dramatically can just as quickly go down dramatically. It‚Äôs this downside that most alarms (or should alarm) retirement savers. For this reason, the Department of Labor issued a release in 2022 that told 401(k) plan sponsors to proceed carefully before offering investment options based on digital currencies. ‚ÄúThe DOL‚Äôs Compliance Assistance Release No. 2022-01 cautioned plan fiduciaries to use extreme care when deciding whether to offer 401(k) plan participants cryptocurrency investment options,‚Äù says Michelle Capezza, of counsel at Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, P.C. in New York City. ‚ÄúEBSA raised many concerns, including the possibility of fraud, the speculative and volatile nature of these investments, valuation, custodial and recordkeeping challenges, and difficulty for participants to make informed decisions. EBSA also warned about conducting investigations of plans that offered such investment options and questioned plan fiduciaries on their decisions to offer them in the plan. So, even though financial institutions brought products to market to facilitate these investments, including through digital asset accounts designed to address custody and cybersecurity issues, and through brokerage window models, the DOL guidance had a chilling effect on many plan fiduciaries and raised questions concerning whether they were subject to a new, heightened standard of extreme care review for cryptocurrency investments.‚Äù Set aside the idea that this is about digital assets. Think instead about highly volatile stocks. As you approach retirement, you‚Äôre more appreciative of certainty. The last thing you want is for your retirement savings to take a sudden drop just when you need to start withdrawing funds. That‚Äôs the way fiduciaries think. They look out for what‚Äôs best for you. It‚Äôs what being prudent is all about. Now, there are those who feel it‚Äôs one thing for a professional you willingly hire to take that demeanor. On the other hand, having the government tell you what to do? That just rankles some the wrong way. In effect, the DOL‚Äôs 2022 advice merely reiterated what every fiduciary should always do. When the DOL recently rescinded that ruling, it did not remove that duty. The hurdles for adding cryptocurrency to 401(k) investment menus remain today as they always have. ‚ÄúDOL has now issued Compliance Assistance Release 2025-01, formally rescinding the prior release and, importantly, reaffirming for fiduciaries the legal framework governing the evaluation of what particular investments should be included within a 401(k) plan,‚Äù says Max Fuller, senior director of government solutions, TaxBit in Denver, Colorado. ‚ÄúWhile the rescission is great, I am not sure it will result in the floodgates being opened for direct crypto investment within 401(k) plans just yet.‚Äù It is this ‚Äúextreme care‚Äù requirement that has fiduciaries walking on eggshells. ‚ÄúThe new guidance opens up a Pandora‚Äôs box of questions,‚Äù says Lyle Himebaugh, managing partner at GGA Retirement in Stamford, Connecticut. ‚ÄúThe first question is liability. I would imagine that most 3(38) investment fiduciaries are not equipped to do due diligence and therefore would not take on the liability.‚Äù If fiduciaries continue to shy away from crypto, does that raise a red flag for you? Sure, they might be more concerned about potential liabilities than you might be. But that‚Äôs precisely where the red flag pops up. Why? The purpose of 401(k) plans is to provide long-term growth and, eventually, stability. This clashes with the inherent volatile nature of cryptocurrencies. The crypto risk magnifies as you approach retirement. But you can realize it at any age. ‚ÄúGiven turnover rates and the volatility of closing prices, there is considerable risk that participants would realize a loss when assets are distributed at separation,‚Äù says J. M. ‚ÄúJack‚Äù Towarnicky, of counsel at Koehler Fitzgerald, LLC in Powell, Ohio. This is the big challenge with cryptocurrencies. They‚Äôre on 24/7. If you invest in them, you‚Äôll have to be on your toes, ever watchful of what‚Äôs happening in their markets. With digital assets like these, there are no ‚Äúclosing bells.‚Äù Their prices can move at any time, day or night. Still, the positive shift in the regulatory tone means crypto fans may advocate for these investments to be included in their 401(k) plans. While plan sponsors may bow to these demands, their service providers are likely to remain skeptical. ‚ÄúI am sure some investment fiduciaries will put them in the plan,‚Äù says Himebaugh, ‚Äúbut there are so many unforeseen and incalculable risks that it will have a mild impact.‚Äù Because of these issues, don‚Äôt be surprised if digital assets fail to become a mainstream 401(k) option as quickly as some hope. For one thing, it‚Äôs not just a decision of whether to include them, it‚Äôs how to include them. ‚ÄúThe challenges will the same as any asset class consideration,‚Äù says Jason Grantz, CEO of Integrated Pension Group in Highland Park, New Jersey. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll have to prudently decide that having crypto available in plans is in the best interest of the participants, without conflict and not solely to appease a small handful of employees who might be clamoring for it. If the asset class does get added, the second hurdle will be even more daunting, which is to decide on which crypt or to simply offer a crypto fund, and that will need to pass Investment Policy criteria like other fund offerings.‚Äù There‚Äôs clearly retail interest in digital assets. It would not be a surprise if that interest spills over into the 401(k) realm. The rescission of the DOL‚Äôs 2022 advice makes it harder for plan sponsors and their advisers to quickly rule out including cryptocurrency products on the plan‚Äôs investment menu. The new DOL guidance, however, doesn‚Äôt remove the best interest standards when evaluating the appropriateness of adding such investments to retirement plans. ‚ÄúFiduciaries now face the usual significant challenges in evaluating cryptocurrencies for 401(k) plans,‚Äù says Jonathan Rose, CEO of BlockTrust IRA in Beverly Hills, California. ‚ÄúIssues like volatility, valuation uncertainty, custody risks, and changing regulatory oversight will be the focus, although each of these respective topics are making massive strides. The primary challenge fiduciaries will now face is a lack of experience in the cryptocurrency market itself, as demand from their clients increases. Many retail investors, 401(k) investors in particular, are looking for a solution that offers the unmatched upside of the crypto market with a minimized risk profile.‚Äù Are professional fiduciaries the only ones wary of 401(k) crypto? Like annuities, the actual interest in these investments may be smaller than headlines would suggest. ‚ÄúPrior to the 2022 guidance,‚Äù says Towarnicky, ‚Äúaccording to a GAO report, no surveyed 401(k) plan had added crypto as a core option, or a window to a crypto asset trading program, and less than 6 in 10,000 401(k) plans (about 300 total) offered crypto via self-directed brokerage windows.‚Äù The regulatory bias against 401(k) crypto may be lifting, but that doesn‚Äôt mean the fog has dissipated. The underlying risks remain significant. While the DOL has removed its heavy hand, it has not eliminated the fiduciary duty that goes with ERISA plans. Cryptocurrencies expose investors to extreme volatility and difficult pricing mechanisms. The potential for losses at distribution is very real. Does that mean you shouldn‚Äôt invest a portion of your retirement assets in them? As with all investments, the decision depends on your individual circumstances. Making prudent decisions is the key, as the elements surrounding both your personal conditions and the cryptocurrency market are ever-changing.

Title: The World‚Äôs Largest Technology Companies 2025: Nvidia Continues To Soar Amid AI Boom

ByRashi Shrivastava ByRashi Shrivastava, Forbes Staff. Nvidia's cofounder and CEO Jensen Huang is worth an estimated $125 billion thanks to its stock's rapid rise. The whiplash growth of artificial intelligence has minted a gaggle of billionaires and unicorns, but chip behemoth Nvidia continues to remain among the largest beneficiaries of the AI boom against all odds. The company took a hit on the $50 billion Chinese AI chip market after the Trump administration placed export controls on its H20 chips, which ‚Äúeffectively closed‚Äù the market to the U.S. industry, CEO Jensen Huang said in a recent earnings call. Earlier this year its stock briefly nosedived after Chinese darkhorse DeepSeek‚Äôs popular AI model launch triggered a panic sell-off. Despite challenges‚Äîexternal and internal‚Äîthe $3.5 trillion (market cap) juggernaut has continued to capitalize on the global demand for AI infrastructure. In its latest quarterly earnings in May, Nvidia beat Wall Street analysts‚Äô expectations and reported $44.06 billion in revenue, up 69% from a year ago. A hefty portion of its business growth, $39.1 billion of its revenue, comes from its data center operations as the company plans to build ‚ÄúAI factories‚Äù in the US and internationally that will help billions of people across the world run AI tools like ChatGPT. In late May, Nvidia said it will supply its powerful silicon chips to Stargate UAE, a joint project with OpenAI, Oracle and others to build a 1 gigawatt ‚Äúcompute cluster‚Äù in Abu Dhabi's AI campus. Such projects have helped push the company to the top 100 on Forbes‚Äô Global 2000 ranking the world‚Äôs largest public companies. It‚Äôs now at position No. 47, 63 spots higher than last year, thanks to a period of strong business growth spurred by widespread use of generative AI. The company is now among the likes of massive tech conglomerates like Tencent (No. 37) and Taiwan Semiconductor (No. 38). The Global 2000 measures market value, revenue, profit and assets equally using the last 12 months of data as of April 25, 2025. Even as AI companies have shifted from training large language models to building applications on top of them, they require a steady supply of Nvidia's powerful silicon chips called graphics processing units (GPUs) to do what‚Äôs called inference‚Äî where a model produces an answer based on new information fed to it in real time. To top that, new so-called ‚Äúreasoning AI models‚Äù that take a step-by-step approach to answer complex problems consume 100 times more computational resources, creating more demand for Nvidia‚Äôs hardware. While Nvidia is the market leader, other companies are growing as well. Semiconductor company Micron, which builds memory and data storage products, has hopped more than 400 spots on the list and is now at No. 228. And South Korean memory chip provider SK Hynix Inc is up 419 spots to No. 155. But not all semiconductor companies have benefited from the AI frenzy. Silicon Valley stalwart Intel, now at No. 488, dropped 381 spots on the Forbes‚Äô Global 2000 this year. The company has struggled after a string of woes including declining revenue, leadership challenges and losing its market share to rivals like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Arm Holdings. In December 2024, Intel‚Äôs CEO Pat Gelsinger stepped down, and was replaced by Lip-Bu Tan in March 2025. In April, the company said its plans to lay off 20% of its staff, Bloomberg reported. The largest tech companies like Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Alphabet have all made gigantic bets on artificial intelligence, throwing billions of dollars and the best engineers to develop AI models and build products for their users. Those four firms are all among the top 20 of the Global 2000. South Korean conglomerate Samsung is the only tech giant based overseas in the top 20, moving up to 19th this year. One new AI beneficiary to watch is CoreWeave, which rents cloud computing power to customers and went public in March. It‚Äôs making its first appearance on the list at 1,799th this year and is likely to move up fast. It‚Äôs not profitable yet, but after the data was compiled for this year‚Äôs Global 2000 on April 25, it reported $982 million in first quarter revenue, a 420% increase compared with the first quarter last year, and its stock price has surged 250%.

Title: The Diplomat, The Oligarch, The FBI Agent: Russian-American Faces Trial In Deripaska Sanctions Case
URL: https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/russia/2025/06/russia-250612-rferl01.htm
Time Published: 2025-06-12T09:13:47Z
Full Content:
By Mike Eckel June 12, 2025 When one of the FBI's top counterintelligence agents was arrested in January 2023, charged with doing illegal work for sanctioned Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, the US national security community was stunned. Retired by then, Charles McGonigal, who had spent the latter part of his career investigating Russian spies and oligarchs, ultimately pleaded guilty, and was sentenced that December to more than four years in prison. He wasn't the only person implicated by US authorities in the Deripaska case. After more than 16 months of delays and postponements, Sergei Shestakov, a former Soviet and Russian diplomat who became a naturalized US citizen and later worked as an authorized US court interpreter, is set to go on trial on June 17, on charges similar to those McGonigal faced. Like McGonigal, Shestakov is accused of conspiring to help Deripaska evade US sanctions imposed on him in 2018, as well as conspiring to commit money laundering. Shestakov, who was arrested at the same time as McGonigal, is also accused of lying to FBI agents. The trial, and the pretrial legal wrangling, have drawn less attention, mainly because Shestakov is less well known than McGonigal. Until his retirement in 2018 from the FBI's New York office, McGonigal was at the vanguard of the bureau's efforts to track Russian spies and oligarchs, including Deripaska. In addition to being business partners, Shestakov and McGonigal, along with another Russian man, are linked to another former Russian tycoon, Vladimir Gusinsky, who for many years spent most of his time at a Connecticut mansion. Gusinsky has not been implicated in the criminal case against Shestakov and McGonigal. However, he has drawn the interest of the FBI, with agents twice questioning his now estranged wife and employees of the couple's Connecticut household about his relationship to them. Gusinsky was introduced to McGonigal by Shestakov and socialized with them both. Shestakov has pleaded innocent to the charges. According to extensive filings in US federal court in Manhattan, Shestakov's defense hinges in part on the question of whether the work he and McGonigal did was for the benefit of Deripaska or for his massive holding conglomerate, EN+ Group, which controls one of the world's largest aluminum companies, Rusal. Key to that defense is an EN+ employee named Yevgeny Fokin, who the FBI alleges is an agent with Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service. Shestakov's defense lawyer, Rita Glavin, has said in court filings that Fokin can provide evidence that the work Shestakov and McGonigal were hired to do was on behalf of EN+ and involved lobbying to help advocate for the Deripaska companies, which is largely allowed under US law. Glavin did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Prosecutors have alleged Fokin was an "unindicted co-conspirator" with Shestakov and McGonigal. The FBI surveilled, photographed, and secretly recorded him beginning in July 2019, according to court records, and his US visa was revoked in 2022 at the behest of the bureau. Prosecutors have skirmished with Glavin over deposing Fokin, who lives in Russia, where he works as a top adviser to Deripaska at EN+. He has refused to travel to the United States for any reason, according to court filings, fearing possible arrest. After negotiations on whether to depose Fokin in Turkey or Dubai, the two sides agreed that Fokin will testify by videoconference during the trial. Fokin did not respond to e-mails from RFE/RL seeking comment. Among some Russian-speaking circles in the New York City region, Shestakov was known as a fixer, a troubleshooter, and a charmer. A naturalized US citizen who previously worked for the Soviet and Russian foreign ministries, Shestakov retired to the New York area in 1993. In the 2010s, he worked as an authorized interpreter for US federal courts and for the US attorneys' offices for Manhattan and Brooklyn. Shestakov's relationship with Fokin dates back to the 1980s, and both have been employed by Gusinsky. As recently as 2019, Shestakov had a credit card under Gusinsky's name that he used to buy, among other things, thousands of dollars' worth of tickets to professional ice hockey games. Gusinsky did not respond to e-mails seeking comment. Shestakov introduced McGonigal to Fokin sometime in 2018, according to the indictment. That April, Deripaska was sanctioned by the US Treasury Department "for having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, a senior official of the Government of the Russian Federation." EN+ and Rusal were designated for sanctions at the same time. One of Russia's wealthiest men, Deripaska minted his fortunes in the chaotic 1990s, when insider businessmen fought pitched and often bloody battles for control over the country's industrial giants, such as aluminum production. He's considered a textbook example of an oligarch: a businessman with vast wealth who also has close ties to President Vladimir Putin's Kremlin. He's also been on the radar screen of US law enforcement for decades, going back at least as far as 2006, when he was denied a visa to enter the United States. The visa difficulties led him to enlist Republican-linked lobbying firms, and in the late 2010s, he invested in projects with Paul Manafort, the Republican operative who briefly managed President Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. In September 2022, Deripaska was indicted on charges of trying to evade US sanctions. The charges include allegations that he arranged for his pregnant girlfriend to travel to the United States to give birth so that their child would be a US citizen. Sanctions against EN+ Group and Rusal were lifted in 2019 after Deripaska agreed to distance himself from ownership of the companies. He remains under sanction. US authorities allege Fokin hired McGonigal and Shestakov to research compromising information on Vladimir Potanin, another Russian oligarch and metals tycoon who is a rival of Deripaska. McGonigal, who retired from the FBI in late 2018, also sought to secure an internship for Fokin's daughter at the New York City Police Department, something that raised eyebrows in the department. McGonigal told authorities he was trying to cultivate Fokin as a possible double agent, according to court papers. In late November 2021, FBI agents seized Shestakov's electronic devices. Days earlier, he was questioned about his relationship with Fokin and asked about whether he had ever done any business with him. "No, no business," he told the FBI, according to court documents.

Title: Musk Pins Tesla‚Äôs Comeback on Robotaxis After Retreat From Feud

Tesla Inc. already had a lot riding on its highly anticipated robotaxi launch long before Elon Musk decided to swing a wrecking ball through his alliance with President Donald Trump ‚Äî and the company‚Äôs share price. Now investors are looking for a win that can help repair the brand damage and shift Tesla back into growth mode. Musk said Tesla would start the new self-driving car service in Austin as soon as June 22, as part of the EV maker‚Äôs big bet on artificial intelligence and autonomous driving. While Tesla gave the city an outline of its tentative plans, the company hadn‚Äôt disclosed a launch date ‚Äî either publicly or directly to Austin officials ‚Äî until late on Tuesday, when Musk warned the service‚Äôs debut could shift because it was ‚Äúsuper paranoid about safety.‚Äù The proclamation came as part of an all-night series of social media messages by Musk, which included a near-apology that ‚ÄúI regret some of my posts‚Äù about the president, which ‚Äúwent too far.‚Äù The comments helped push shares up about 3% Wednesday by investors who have been urging Musk to refocus on his business empire. The billionaire has said the rollout would start slowly, with 10 to 20 vehicles, and a testing area verified by Bloomberg News suggests the initial contours of the debut resemble more of a souped-up demo than a full-fledged launch. That may not matter to Tesla‚Äôs biggest fans, or the stock price. Investors generally have been willing to give Musk the benefit of the doubt in the short term as they believe in his long-term vision. For the moment, Tesla sales are tumbling around the world, its stock is down around 20% this year and analysts have lowered their expectations for the company‚Äôs performance. While Musk tries to undo some of the damage from his meltdown with Trump, the immediate impact to Tesla‚Äôs shares and Musk‚Äôs own wealth shows just how delicate the whole balance is. The government has outsized influence over his businesses, from billion-dollar contracts to the regulatory environment for autonomous vehicles and Tesla‚Äôs robotaxi network. ‚ÄúHe needs to dial down the rhetoric and the drama and get back to the business of Optimus and robotaxi and Full Self Driving,‚Äù Nancy Tengler, CEO and chief investment officer of Laffer Tengler Investments, told Bloomberg Television. ‚ÄúThat is what people own the stock for ‚Äî and for his brilliance and genius of course ‚Äî but not for the histrionics.‚Äù Musk has promised to establish a ride-hailing network that is part ‚ÄúAirbnb, part Uber.‚Äù The company wants the fleet to built on its Full Self-Driving technology and eventually feature both purpose-built Cybercabs without pedals or steering wheels, as well as Teslas owned by the company and individual drivers. Musk predicts hundreds of thousands of the vehicles on the road by late 2026. The robotaxi launch is the first step in showing investors he can deliver. Tesla will be the fourth robotaxi service to launch in Austin in the past several years. While Tesla can operate its standard consumer models in Texas with no driver, it needs federal exemptions to use the Cybercab in its fleet. In other states, including California, Tesla faces a patchwork of regulations. Representatives for Tesla and Musk did not respond to requests for comment. There have been signs of the company‚Äôs preparation in Austin. Model Y vehicles with manufacturer‚Äôs plates have become a frequent sight around town in the south and southeast portions of the city that are studded with residential neighborhoods and retail shopping centers and a few minutes drive from downtown. In some cases, the vehicles drive around in what appear to be circular routes. The initial operation area will likely cover only a few square miles, according to a person familiar with the plan who was not authorized to speak publicly on it. The zone could change before launch or be amended quickly after the service begins. The rules governing driverless vehicles in Texas are notably light. While rideshare companies with human drivers must obtain a license to operate in Texas, a legal loophole means robotaxis like those operated by Tesla don‚Äôt need the same approvals, according to the Texas Department of Licensing and Registration. That makes the statea popular choice for companies in the early stages of autonomous service. Waymo, the driverless-rideshare business owned by Google parent Alphabet Inc., currently has about 100 robotaxis in Austin in partnership with Uber and plans to ramp up to hundreds over time. Volkswagen ADMT and Amazon.com Inc.‚Äôs Zoox are testing their vehicles there. A number of autonomous trucking companies are also testing elsewhere in the state. Tesla has embraced a different approach to autonomy, favoring a camera-only system rather than a combination of lidar, radar and pre-mapping that competitors use. Musk has long claimed such an approach will allow the company to scale up sooner than rivals including Waymo, which he considers too expensive. According to some estimates, Tesla‚Äôs system of sensors costs about $400 per vehicle; Waymo‚Äôs fleet, which totals 1,500 vehicles in California, Arizona and Texas, runs roughly $9,300 per car. Critics have said Tesla‚Äôs vision-only system is riskier as it‚Äôs more limited in certain conditions with less visibility, such as sun glare, fog or dust. Regardless of the vehicles‚Äô specifications, autonomous vehicle testing in Austin and elsewhere has brought challenges. General Motors Co.‚Äôs now-defunct Cruise dragged a person along a street in San Francisco in a gruesome incident that left the pedestrian in critical condition. Driverless rideshare cars have caused viral traffic jams in Austin and last week, Waymo drove into a flooded area following a storm. ‚ÄúSafety is our highest priority at Waymo, both for people who choose to ride with us and those with whom we share the streets. We remain committed to improving road safety through our ongoing learnings and experience,‚Äù a Waymo spokesperson said. In preparation for its launch, Tesla has been in touch with Austin city officials and first responders to discuss safety expectations, according to emails seen by Bloomberg News that date back to at least May 2024. Tesla has said robotaxis will be remotely monitored initially. But several key aspects of Tesla‚Äôs plan are yet to be finalized with the city‚Äôs autonomous vehicle working group, which communicates with AV companies operating in Austin. Tesla has only shown officials a draft of an expected first responder guide, and an emergency training is still outstanding, according to Andre Jordan, division chief of homeland security and special operations for the Austin Fire Department, and a member of the city‚Äôs working group. ‚ÄúAutonomous vehicles are required to follow the law, but what happens when the law and directions of first responders conflict? It‚Äôs a complicated world,‚Äù said Jordan. It‚Äôs also a complicated moment for Musk to pitch Tesla as a trusted brand to take passengers, many of whom aren‚Äôt accustomed to riding in self-driving cars, where they need to go. Thanks to months wading through the political fracas in Washington, the billionaire and his cars have never been more polarizing. Although Musk has sought to dial down the hostility with the president, the billionaire‚Äôs public spat with Trump threatens to alienate even more customers. ‚ÄúTesla at this moment is a brand with all sorts of mixed associations,‚Äù said Tim Calkins, a marketing professor at Northwestern University‚Äôs Kellogg School of Management. ‚ÄúIf people have negative feelings about Elon Musk and they spill onto robotaxi, I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll be eager to take a ride. There‚Äôs lots of alternatives.‚Äù Driverless vehicles require an extra element of trust and critics will be ready to amplify any mishaps, said Mike Paul, president of crisis consultancy Reputation Doctor LLC. ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre starting from a deficit currently, from a trust in branding perspective, with all things Elon,‚Äù Paul said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs going to be very difficult to show success.‚Äù Musk has been building expectations for this launch for years. While some investors are willing to lend him some leniency on timing and the exact details, many want concrete signs of progress. Baird analyst Ben Kallo downgraded Tesla to neutral, citing, in part, overhyped expectations from Musk around the robotaxi launch and intensifying competition in the space. Kallo also said that Musk‚Äôs deteriorating relationship with Trump has led to more uncertainty. ‚ÄúThe valuation has gotten ahead of itself around the robotaxi,‚Äù Kallo told Bloomberg Television. ‚ÄúI do think the rollout will take longer. At first it will require more people, so people in control centers making sure that the cars do not get into accidents something like that.‚Äù For that reason, Kallo said there will likely be some short-term pain. ‚ÄúRolling this out will be very difficult.‚Äù Topics Tesla

June 12, 2025 02:00 ET | Source: PayPoint plc PayPoint plc PayPoint PlcResults for the year ended 31 March 2025 Further progress towards ¬£100m EBITDA by end of FY26 New targets established for the Group for the next three years, including share buyback programme increased and extended to at least ¬£30 million per annum till the end of FY28 GROUP FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Nick Wiles, Chief Executive of PayPoint Plc, said: ‚ÄúThis has been another year of progress for PayPoint where we have delivered a resilient financial performance and made further significant steps towards delivering ¬£100m EBITDA by the end of FY26. These results reflect both the resilience of our businesses in the current challenging economic environment and the impact of our growing capabilities as we unlock further opportunities and growth across our four business divisions. Looking ahead, in addition to our existing target of ¬£100m EBITDA for the current year, we have now established new targets for the Group for the next three years to the end of FY28, underlining our confidence in the future growth prospects of the business: achieving net revenue growth in the range of 5% to 8% per annum across the Group; establishing an organisational framework which will deliver greater automation of processes and greater agility to support the delivery of our plan; and delivering a reduction of at least 20% of our issued share capital through an enhanced share buyback programme, consistent with a prudent capital structure and leverage in the range of 1.2x to 1.5x. We have had an encouraging start to the current financial year in each of our business divisions and have already secured a number of important new contract wins, particularly within the Housing sector. In addition to our focus on the organic building blocks for growth, significant energy is being directed into: building strong new business pipelines, particularly in Love2shop Business, Housing and Charities; successful delivery of our Local Banking service, with at least two banks due to go live in H1; continued parcels growth, driving volume opportunities with each carrier and growing Out of Home consumer adoption; optimising our retailer network performance, through better adoption of services, our new Store Growth Specialist team and further site growth; and the further upselling of our enhanced payment capabilities into our existing client base, including utilities. Our continued confidence in the growth opportunities in the business and the execution of our plan to deliver strong earnings growth and cash flow generation, combined with a sustainable dividend policy, provide a robust platform for the Board to further enhance shareholder returns through an increased and extended share buyback programme of at least ¬£30 million per annum till the end of March 2028, all underpinned by our confidence and clear operational plans to deliver further progress in the current year and our ¬£100m EBITDA target.‚Äù SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAMME INCREASED AND EXTENDED Today the Group announces its intention to increase and extend its 3-year share buyback programme (the ‚ÄúBuyback Programme‚Äù). This enhanced Buyback Programme reflects the strong cash generative nature of the Group, along with the Board‚Äôs confidence in delivering on our growth targets for FY26-FY28 and in-line with our commitment to enhance shareholder returns. The Buyback Programme will be increased with a plan to return at least ¬£30 million per annum to shareholders and will be extended until the end of March 2028, with the target of reducing our equity base by at least 20% over that period. We will continue to review the Buyback Programme based on business performance, market conditions, cash generation and the overall capital needs of the business. Throughout this period, we will continue to increase dividends at a nominal rate and, as a result of our continued financial performance, grow our cover ratio from the current 1.5 to 2.0 times earnings range to over 2.0 times earnings by FY28. Combined with the increased and extended Buyback Programme, this dividend policy will enhance shareholder returns and ensure the business continues to maintain an efficient capital structure, balancing an appropriate leverage ratio of around 1.2 to 1.5 times net debt/EBITDA with the overall capital needs of the business. DIVISIONAL HIGHLIGHTS Shopping divisional net revenue increased by 1.2% to ¬£65.2 million (FY24: ¬£64.4 million) E-commerce divisional net revenue increased strongly by 39.0% to ¬£16.4 million (FY24: ¬£11.8 million) Payments & Banking divisional net revenue increased by 1.7% to ¬£54.4 million (FY24: ¬£53.5 million) Love2shop divisional net revenue increased by 0.8% to ¬£51.7 million (FY24: ¬£51.3 million) BUILDING BLOCKS FOR GROWTH In the current financial year, the Group remains focused on executing against the seven building blocks for growth to the end of FY28: RECONCILIATION OF REPORTED NUMBERS BUSINESS DIVISION NET REVENUE AND MIX A presentation for analysts is being held at 9.30am today (12 June 2025) via webcast. This announcement, along with details for the webcast, is available on the PayPoint Plc website: paypointbusiness.com/corporate CHIEF EXECUTIVE‚ÄôS REVIEW GROUP UPDATE Resilient financial performance with further progress towards delivering ¬£100m EBITDA by the end of FY26 This has been another year of progress for PayPoint where we have delivered a resilient financial performance and made further significant steps towards delivering ¬£100m EBITDA by the end of FY26. These results reflect both the resilience of our businesses in the current challenging economic environment and the impact of our growing capabilities as we unlock further opportunities and growth across our four business divisions. Targets for the Group to the end of FY28 While we remain focused on the delivery of our current target of ¬£100m EBITDA by the end of FY26, looking further ahead, we have now established new targets for the Group for the next three years to the end of FY28, reflecting our confidence in the growth prospects of the business and our continued commitment to delivering enhanced returns for our shareholders: 1. Achieving net revenue growth in the range of 5% to 8% per annum across the GroupOur strategy over the past five years to transform the business and its capabilities from our legacy cash bill payments history has created a more robust and higher organic growth platform. We believe a combination of our business mix today and the opportunities in each of our key building blocks for growth supports a consistent, underlying net revenue growth rate in the range of 5-8% per annum. 2. Establishing an organisational framework which will deliver greater automation of processes and greater agility to support the delivery of our planAn important next step to support the delivery of this growth is to ensure as a business we have the necessary organisational framework to deliver better operational performance at a reduced cost and a higher level of customer service and experience. To achieve this, we have sought the support of Nile, an independent consultancy, in a project to review our operational structure and business processes today and develop a plan to deliver greater automation and business agility in the future to support the delivery of our plan. 3. Delivering a reduction of at least 20% of our issued share capital, with scope for leverage in the range of 1.2x to 1.5xThe actions we are taking to deliver sustained organic growth across the business in a more efficient and agile business structure will further enhance the core cash generative characteristics of the business, enabling an accelerated share buyback programme over the next three years within a prudent capital structure of leverage in the range of 1.2x to 1.5x REVIEW BY DIVISION SHOPPING DIVISION In Retail Services, our core focus is to continue the growth of our retailer estate and to drive a consistently higher level of adoption of our service proposition. We remain committed to supporting our retailer partners drive more revenue and to maximising the opportunities from our unparalleled portfolio of community services. The next stage of that commitment is the recent rollout of a Store Growth Specialist team, dedicated to supporting retailers to unlocking more commission opportunities and enabled by targeted data and analytics to ensure we are focusing our efforts in the right locations. Early indications from this rollout have been very positive in terms of demonstrable performance optimisation and services adoption. In addition, we continue to drive further engagement with our Retailer Rewards scheme, launched in September 2024, giving retailers additional commission for scanning goods in store. Our next generation device, PayPoint Mini, continues to rollout across our estate with 2,898 now live, along with our integrated third-party EPoS solution, PayPoint Connect. We also now have structured plans in place to support our multiple retailer partners in maximising the value of our wide portfolio of services in their stores, including the rollout of additional Collect+ sites, FMCG campaigns, Love2shop gift cards and our new Local Banking service. Our FMCG consumer engagement proposition, PayPoint Engage, continues to gain good traction delivering campaigns for major consumer brands, leveraging our PayPoint One platform, advertising screens and vouchering capability. Over 18 campaigns have been delivered in the year, including an award-winning campaign for Spar during Euro 2024, with a building pipeline of further brand campaigns for delivery over the next 12 months. In Cards, we have focused in the year on delivering a successful transition to Lloyds Bank Cardnet as an acquiring partner across the wider Group, with the partnership launching in December 2024 into our Handepay business. The partnership has enhanced our merchant proposition, including earlier in the day settlement, and delivered an enhanced and faster onboarding for our merchants. Additionally, we have launched our Merchant Mobile App, enabling merchants to access transaction data and insights about their business, with over 3,000 merchants already signed up and plans in place for further growth over the current year. Over the course of the next 12 months, we will be adding further features and functionality to the app, including real-time transaction data and the integration of our Rewards scheme. In the period, we have also improved participation in our Handepay Rewards Scheme, with over 3,500 merchants registered, and continued to drive further enhancements to our core proposition, with the launch of a new AI-driven statement reader to further speed up and enhance the merchant sales experience, strengthened pricing governance and time to transact drastically reduced from 14.7 days to 2.2 days, driven by our welcome call programme and an improved customer onboarding process with the new Lloyds Bank Cardnet partnership. All of these actions are focused on driving an improved retention performance in the current year, with a target reduction of churn to 25%. Our Business Finance product, via YouLend, continues to grow with over ¬£23.8m of funding delivered to merchants across the Group in FY25, an increase of 23% versus the prior year, and with plans in place to pilot an Asset Finance product with merchants in H1 FY26. In our Community Cash Access and Banking network, while progress continues to be frustrating, a detailed ATM recovery plan is now underway to improve performance in the current year, including the enablement of Mastercard and Visa throughout the network in H1 FY26, an improved support and maintenance model with Notemachine to drive ATM uptime and service, individual site performance optimisation visits and further network expansion opportunities in progress with new partners. Our Counter Cash service, offering withdrawals and balance enquiries over the counter, is now live in 2,993 locations, and we have processed over ¬£475 million of consumer deposits for our neobank clients in the year. We are also well advanced with the launch of the first two major High St Banks delivering consumer deposits across our extensive network in H1 FY26, which will be followed by an SME deposit solution for High St Banks in development for pilot in H2 FY26. E-COMMERCE DIVISION In E-commerce, we have delivered a record year, with net revenue +39.0% at ¬£16.4 million and parcel transactions growing to 133.4 million. This performance reflects the strong positioning of our growing Collect+ network for Out of Home (OOH) fulfilment with both consumers and carriers and a continuing market shift towards OOH delivery. Our partnership with Royal Mail launched earlier in the financial year, with over 7,500 sites rolled out across the UK and store to store and click and collect services now live. Our longstanding Yodel/Vinted partnership has continued to deliver strong volumes through our Store-to-Store service, with growing adoption by consumers and our carrier partners. We have also expanded our Zebra printer technology to over 93% of our network, underlining our continuing commitment to invest in improving the consumer experience in store and driving further adoption of Out of Home (OOH) with our carrier partners. As referred to in our interim results in November 2024, we made a strategic investment in Yodel alongside other investors, including InPost in June 2024. As we indicated at the time, our investment was in support of the Yodel management team as they planned to further automate and modernise the Yodel business. Since this initial investment, InPost has provided Yodel with significant additional funding and announced their acquisition of Yodel on 17 April 2025, resulting in a significant dilution of our original investment to a 4.5% minority stake in the business and a write down of the investment to ¬£2.2 million. An expansion of InPost PUDO locations has also recently been announced, growing to over 6,000 sites, which harmonises locations, parcel volumes and opening up the opportunity for further expansion and parcel volume growth across our extensive network for both InPost and Yodel. We have now established new partnerships with Chinese and South Asian marketplaces, with the initial rollout of 26 stores with SFExpress, the leading integrated logistics service provider with an extensive PUDO network in China, focused on enabling our services in Chinese communities across the UK. We continue to explore further opportunities to build increased momentum and drive further volume into our network, with the primary focus to establish Collect+ as the first-choice partner for Pick Up Drop Off (PUDO) with these marketplaces. We have successfully grown the Collect+ network to 14,213 sites in new locations and demographics, including increasing our presence with major multiple retailers like One Stop, Spar NI owned by Henderson Group and a pilot with Asda, rolling out further sites for the Royal Mail, InPost and UPS, and growing our student presence working with 19 of the top universities and student unions across the UK (Strathclyde, Aberdeen, Sunderland and Open University added in the year). We will continue to identify opportunities to grow the Collect+ network across a number of new and existing channels, in partnership with our carriers and consistent with developing consumer behaviours and needs in the Out of Home market. PAYMENTS & BANKING DIVISION In Payments & Banking, our integrated digital payments platform, MultiPay, continues to establish itself as a comprehensive payment solution for clients across card processing, Open Banking, direct debit and cash, with net revenue growth of 4.5% year on year. We have secured further strong wins in the Housing sector, with Guinness Housing, Sovereign and Thirteen, and in the Charity sector with several Citizen‚Äôs Advice regional offices, Alzheimer‚Äôs Society, Shelter and Wiltshire and Bath Air Ambulance. A major focus for the current year is on increasing opportunities to cross-sell payments services within our existing client base, leveraging our wider multichannel payments platform and Open Banking capabilities. We have also completed our first full year of delivering the DVLA International Driving Permit service, which went live on 1 April 2024, marking another key central government service fulfilled via our extensive retailer network. In our cash through to digital category, we have made the key decision to build on our success and market positioning in the cash through to digital sector, by combining our leading portfolio of consumer brands, including Amazon, Netflix, Deliveroo and Uber, with physical Love2shop gift cards in store. This creates a strong consumer proposition, offering the choice of specific cash through to digital brands and our Love2shop multi-retailer redemption card, which is expected to generate meaningful additional card load and revenue opportunities for retailer partners. The strength of this proposition is evidenced by the sales momentum built with Love2shop gift cards in over 2,600 multiple retailers in the PayPoint network, establishing an annual run rate of circa ¬£1m of value processed, and the early success of our partnership with InComm Payments offering Love2shop gift cards into a range of major retailers. Following the completion of our majority investment in obconnect in October 2024, we are now making strong progress executing on our strategy in Open Banking. In PayPoint, we are focused on winning business with both new and existing clients delivering Open Banking services and payments channels, all enabled by obconnect and Aperidata, with 28 further clients live in the year for our services, including the Crown Commercial Service. In the year, the BBC also went live for Confirmation of Payee. In obconnect, the focus is on providing the necessary support and expertise to deliver data sharing ecosystems for major banks and jurisdictions, as demonstrated by the major contract win to deliver the Confirmation of Payee ecosystem for the New Zealand Banking Association which went live successfully in December 2024, including major banks like ANZ, Kiwibank and Westpac. In addition, a major focus for the current year is developing the next generation of Open Banking technology and capability, which will support future pipeline opportunities in this rapidly evolving market. As we indicated at the time of the announcement of the investment in obconnect on 1 August 2024, we have recognised a modest net revenue contribution in H2 FY25 of ¬£1.8 million, in the expectation of a more meaningful contribution in FY26 and thereafter, driven by further pipeline opportunities in Confirmation of Payee, Verification of Payee in Europe and ecosystems in additional jurisdictions. In Cash, legacy energy bill payments net revenue decreased by 6.5% for the year consistent with our expectations, with this part of the business continuing to be resilient, both in transaction volumes, rates and the renewal of a number of key contracts including Scottish Power. We expect this pattern and moderation in the rate of decline to continue into the current year. Over the year, the energy price cap, updated by Ofgem on a quarterly basis, was set for pre-pay customers at ¬£1,643 for April to June 2024, ¬£1,522 for July to September 2024, ¬£1,669 for October to December 2024 and ¬£1,690 for January to March 2025. However, the price cap has increased in the current financial year to ¬£1,803 for pre-pay customers for April to June 2025. LOVE2SHOP DIVISION Overall, the Love2shop division had an excellent year, delivering growth in Love2shop Business, a resilient performance in Park Christmas Savings and strong progress in a number of key initiatives to develop new sales channels and partnerships. In Love2shop Business, we delivered a positive year with ¬£172.2 million of billings delivered (FY24: ¬£162.8 million), benefiting from the excellent planning and preparation by the Love2shop team well in advance of the peak trading period, and the growing benefits from corporate API integrations launched into major clients last year, delivering increased billings and improved customer experience. For our top 10 clients, we saw sales volumes grow by 17% YOY as we continue to develop our relationships, with ourmanaged client portfolio billings retention at 91% and major clients retention at 107%. During our peak trading month of December, we saw a YOY increase in AOV by 11% to ¬£11.5k. Highstreetvouchers.com performance was strong with billings +12.8% ahead of plan, reflecting the benefits of the actions taken at the beginning of the financial year to our online strategy. This positive outcome has been driven by a more efficient use of paid media spend driving a higher Average Order Value (AOV) of ¬£320 vs ¬£92 previously, improved customer journeys optimised for business customers transacting online or wishing to speak to our sales team, and an improved digital product and participation enabling larger bulk orders which has also increased AOV from ¬£400 to ¬£1500. Our expanded distribution partnership with InComm Payments launched successfully on 20 October 2024 and has delivered a strong first six months with over ¬£2.9 million of billings. The partnership has seen a significant expansion of physical Love2shop gift cards into major grocers and High St retailers, with plans already underway to build on this positive start and gain further momentum in FY26. Our sales momentum has also continued to build with Love2shop gift cards in over 2,600 multiple retailers in the PayPoint network, establishing an annual run rate of circa ¬£1m of value processed. New redemption partners onboarded in the year for Love2shop included Dobbies Garden Centres, Foyles Bookstores, Blackwells, Frankie & Bennys, Las Iguanas and Wilko. Together these initiatives launched over the year have further enhanced consumer recognition of the Love2shop brand through our online and physical in store channels. Park Christmas Savings delivered a solid outcome to the Christmas 2024 campaign with final billings of ¬£162.2m, consistent with the previous year, with average saver value increased by 2.5% versus the prior year and customer retention strong at 91% of value retained from the prior season, all against the backdrop of tighter consumer spending and fluctuating consumer confidence over the year. A key focus in the year has been improving payment to conversion for new customers, which increased by 5% vs prior year delivering an improvement in the number of ‚Äònil paid‚Äô and ‚Äòoff track‚Äô customers. All of this has been achieved by focused saver activity and engagement campaigns leveraging Group capabilities via PayPoint‚Äôs PayByLink payment solution. The 2025 savings season has started positively, with gross accounts +18,000 versus the prior year, and the paid order book and cash collected +2% in the season to date. In addition, a new Agent App was launched to support savers and new digital gift cards added to the extensive product portfolio, with ongoing campaigns focused on driving payment to conversion. This again reinforces the enduring appeal and vital role this service plays in helping consumers budget for big occasions and avoid debt, with a Trustpilot rating of 4.6/5 and over ¬£2 million of value delivered to savers each year. We continue to explore new expansion opportunities with a number of potential partners, in which to support further growth of our prepaid savings platform and leverage the strength of this capability. MBL, the leading gift card technology platform that was acquired by Love2shop in 2022, processed ¬£123.2 million in gift card value in in the year (FY24: ¬£59.7 million), reflecting continued momentum as a gift card service provider for Greggs, B&M, New Look, Tapi, and Schuh, and as a key distributor for over 150 UK retailers' gift cards. We continue to expand the range of MBL solutions that we offer to our corporate clients and grow gift card management services with more retailers. UPDATE ON CLAIMS AGAINST PAYPOINT In FY24, a number of companies in the PayPoint Group, including PayPoint Plc, received two claims relating to issues addressed by commitments accepted by Ofgem in November 2021 as a resolution of Ofgem‚Äôs concerns raised in its Statement of Objections received by the PayPoint Group in September 2020. The Ofgem resolution did not include any infringement findings. The first claim was served by Utilita Energy Limited and Utilita Services Limited (subsequently renamed Luxion Sales Limited) (‚ÄúUtilita‚Äù) on 16 June 2023. The second claim was served by Global-365 plc and Global Prepaid Solution Limited (‚ÄúGlobal 365‚Äù) on 18 July 2023. On 14 May 2025, PayPoint and Utilita came to a settlement such that Utilita has withdrawn its claim against PayPoint. As part of this settlement, the two parties have agreed to a new 5-year contract for over-the-counter prepayment services. PayPoint is looking forward to the opportunity to build a more collaborative and mutually supportive relationship with Utilita going forward. PayPoint remains confident that it will successfully defend the claim by Global 365 at trial. The claim fundamentally misunderstands the energy market and the relationships between the relevant Group companies and the major energy providers, whilst also over-estimating the opportunity available, if any, for the products offered by Global 365. The trial at the Competition Appeal Tribunal, started on 10 June 2025. OUTLOOK AND DIVIDEND The continued progress and momentum established across the Group, particularly with the seven key building blocks, underpins our confidence in delivering our newly established targets for the next three year period to the end of FY28: achieving net revenue growth in the range of 5% to 8% per annum across the Group; establishing an organisational framework which will deliver greater automation of processes and greater agility to support the delivery of our plan; and delivering a reduction of at least 20% of our issued share capital through an enhanced share buyback programme, consistent with a prudent capital structure and leverage in the range of 1.2x to 1.5x. We have had an encouraging start to the current financial year in each of our business divisions and have already secured a number of important new contract wins, particularly within the housing sector. In addition to our focus on the organic building blocks for growth, significant energy is being directed into: building strong new business pipelines, particularly in Love2shop Business, Housing and Charities; successful delivery of our Local Banking service, with at least two banks due to go live in H1; continued parcels growth, driving volume opportunities with each carrier and growing Out of Home consumer adoption; optimising our retailer network performance, through better adoption of services, our new Store Growth Specialist team and further site growth; and the further upselling of our enhanced payment capabilities into our existing client base, including utilities. Our commitment to an increased and extended share buyback programme will enhance shareholder returns and is reflective of our long-term confidence in the business and our underlying cash flow. The Board has declared a final dividend of 19.6p per share, an increase of 2.1% vs the prior year final dividend of 19.2p per share, consistent with our dividend policy and target cover range of 1.5 to 2.0 times earnings excluding exceptional items. We remain confident in delivering further progress in the current year, meeting expectations and achieving our financial goals to FY28. Nick WilesChief Executive 11 June 2025 KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS PayPoint Group has identified the following KPIs to measure progress of business performance: FINANCIAL REVIEW OVERVIEW Current year total statutory revenue of ¬£310.7 million is reported after an exceptional deduction of ¬£14.2 million related to a claim settlement. Underlying revenue, excluding this deduction, increased by ¬£18.5 million (6.0%) to ¬£324.9 million. Net revenue increased by ¬£6.7 million (3.7%) to ¬£187.7 million (2024: ¬£181.0 million). Net revenue from the PayPoint segment increased by ¬£6.3 million to ¬£136.0 million (2024: ¬£129.7 million) predominately driven by the growth in e-commerce, with parcel transactions exceeding 130 million in the year, and the 5 months of net revenue contribution from obconnect partially offset by the cash payments decline in Payments & Banking. Total costs increased by ¬£0.4 million to ¬£119.7 million (2024: ¬£119.3 million). The increase in costs includes ¬£1.5 million additional costs from 5 months of contribution of obconnect, together with increases in transactional costs of revenue and depreciation of terminals and devices used to drive revenue in the business, these increases have been partially offset by savings in overheads following the organisational restructure earlier in the year. Exceptional costs of ¬£23.4 million, which are one-off, non-recurring and do not reflect current operational performance, comprises settlement and legal fees incurred as a result of the Group‚Äôs defence of claims served against it, costs associated with early exit of a property lease in Love2shop and accelerated amortisation on certain modules of Love2shop ERP systems following the commencement to re-platform key systems. The prior year costs comprise the same legal fees as noted in the current year, restructuring costs and costs associated with refinancing for the Group. During the year the Group remeasured its investments and convertible loan notes resulting in a net charge of ¬£9.6 million in the Consolidated statement of profit or loss for the current year, reported within adjusting items (see note 14). The underlying profit before tax for the Group increased by ¬£6.3 million (10.2%) to ¬£68.0 million (2024: ¬£61.7 million). Profit before tax of ¬£26.3 million (2024: ¬£48.2 million) decreased by ¬£21.9 million (45.4%). Underlying EBITDA increased by ¬£8.7 million to ¬£90.0 million (2024: ¬£81.3 million), which comprises ¬£21.0 million for the L2s segment and ¬£69.0 million for the PayPoint segment. Cash generation increased by ¬£11.1 million to ¬£69.0 million (2024: ¬£57.9 million), delivered from profit before tax of ¬£26.3 million (2024: ¬£48.2 million). There was a net working capital outflow of ¬£10.3 million (2024: ¬£11.8 million) with trade receivables and inventory levels increasing as the Group grows its revenue and supports new revenue generating initiatives which requires increases in working capital. Net corporate debt increased by ¬£29.9 million to ¬£97.4 million (2024: ¬£67.5 million), with cash generation of ¬£69.0 million offset by tax payments, capital expenditure, share buyback, investments and dividends. At 31 March 2025 loans and borrowings were ¬£102.3 million (2024: ¬£93.9 million) PAYPOINT SEGMENT Revenue of ¬£163.6 million includes a ¬£14.2 million exceptional deduction, excluding this underlying revenue increased by ¬£8.1 million to ¬£177.8 million (4.8%). Shopping net revenue increased by ¬£0.8 million (1.2%) to ¬£65.2 million (2024: ¬£64.4 million). Service fees net revenue increased by ¬£2.1 million (10.7%) driven by the implementation of the annual RPI increase and additional PayPoint sites. Cards net revenue decreased by ¬£0.3 million (0.9%), with site growth delivered in the PayPoint retailer estate and a reduction in the Handepay SME partners as we strengthen the field sales team and align to the strong and consistent progress already achieved in the Telesales teams. Lower than anticipated consumer spending has impacted the total value processed through the network which is down 4.2%. ATM and Counter Cash net revenue decreased by ¬£1.0 million (11.4%) due to a reduction in transactions driven by the continuing trend of reduced demand for cash across the economy. E-commerce net revenue increased by ¬£4.6 million (39.0%) to ¬£16.4 million (2024: ¬£11.8 million), driven by strong growth in parcel transactions which increased by 33.3%. This was due to the growing strength in partnerships with InPost and Royal Mail, the investment in the in-store experience with Zebra label printers over the past 18 months and the continued expansion from new services and carrier partners. Payments & Banking net revenue increased by ¬£0.9 million (1.7%) to ¬£54.4 million (2024: ¬£53.5 million). Cash bill payments and top ups revenue decreased by ¬£1.9 million (6.8%) to ¬£25.9 million (2024: ¬£27.8 million) driven by a 18.9% reduction in transactions following the reduced usage of cash and the continued switch to digital payments. Digital net revenue increased by ¬£1.7 million (12.3%) to ¬£15.5 million (2024: ¬£13.8 million) with the current year including 5 months contribution from obconnect partially offset by a reduction in cashout transactions. In addition there was an increase in other Payments & Banking income received from a number of items which are non-recurring in nature. The cost of commission to PayPoint retailers increased by ¬£1.8 million (4.5%) to ¬£41.7 million (2024: ¬£39.9 million). This increase in payment to our retailer partners reflects an increase in the number of E-commerce transactions processed as well as more with higher commission rates per transaction. Total costs (excluding adjusting items) increased by ¬£3.4 million (4.3%) to ¬£82.6 million (2024: ¬£79.2 million), primarily as a result of the depreciation and amortisation impact of investment software and devices and the further investment in our people and field sales team to support growth in sales. SECTOR ANALYSIS SHOPPING Shopping consists of services provided to retailer and SME partners, which contain two sub divisions, Card Services and Retail Services. Services include providing the PayPoint terminal to retailer partners, ATMs and Counter Cash and FMCG vouchering. Net revenue increased by ¬£0.8 million (1.2%) to ¬£65.2 million (2024: ¬£64.4 million) due to the growth in service fees driven by growth in sites and an annual RPI increase . The net revenue of each of our key products is separately addressed below. As at 31 March 2025, PayPoint had a live terminal in 30,712 UK sites, an increase of 5.4% primarily as a result of new PayPoint Mini sales. Service fees: This is a core growth area and consists of service fees from PayPoint terminals. Service fee net revenue increased by ¬£2.1 million (10.7%) to ¬£21.8 million driven by the additional revenue generating sites compared to the prior year. Card services: Card acquiring services generated ¬£21.0 million net revenue in the year, a reduction of ¬£2.3 million from the previous year (2024: ¬£23.3 million). Transaction values overall have decreased by 4.2% to ¬£6,868 million (2024 ¬£7,173 million) following lower than anticipated consumer spending. During the year unprofitable legacy RSM2000 sites have been removed which has reduced revenue and reduced costs. Revenue from terminal rentals has increased by ¬£1.8 million to ¬£10.6 million (2024: ¬£8.8 million) mainly as a result of a change in the sales mix of operating leases compared to finance leases. Operating leases also have associated costs included in the profit and loss account. ATMs and Counter Cash: Net revenue reduced by ¬£1.0 million (11.4%) to ¬£7.8 million (2024: ¬£8.8 million) as transactions reduced by 14.0% to 24.5 million. This is attributable to the continued reduced demand for cash across the economy. ATM and Counter Cash live sites decreased 33.7% to 6,365 following a review to remove non transacting counter cash sites. Other: Other shopping services remained flat at ¬£3.2 million (2024: ¬£3.2 million) E-COMMERCE E-commerce net revenue increased by ¬£4.6 million (39.0%) to ¬£16.4 million following a record year for Collect+ as parcel transactions grew strongly by 33.3% to 133.4 million. This was due to the growing strength in partnerships with InPost and Royal Mail, the investment in the in-store experience with Zebra label printers over the past 18 months . There has been continued expansion from new services, Yodel store to store and Amazon returns, and new carrier partnerships with Royal Mail. Parcel sites increased by 20.6% to 14,213 sites. PAYMENTS & BANKING Payments & Banking divisional net revenue increased by 1.7% to ¬£54.4 million following 5 months of contribution from obconnect included within Digital and higher non-recurring other income. This has been partially offset by fewer cash bill payments and top up transactions. Cash net revenue decreased by ¬£1.9 million (6.8%) to ¬£25.9 million. This is due to a reduction in transactions as consumers move to different payment methods. Digital (obconnect, MultiPay, Cash Out, Open banking) net revenue increased by ¬£1.7 million (12.3%) to ¬£15.5 million. This is mainly due to including ¬£1.8 million revenue from the first 5 months of trading from obconnect. Digital transactions excluding obconnect decreased by 1.9 million (4.1%) to 45.0 million. MultiPay net revenue increased by ¬£0.3 million to ¬£6.7 million (2024: ¬£6.4 million). The DWP Payment Exception Service contributed ¬£3.5 million net revenue in the year (2024: ¬£3.9 million) following the expected decrease in customers. Cashout revenue decreased by ¬£0.4 million (14.0%) to ¬£2.7 million (2024: ¬£3.0 million). Open banking and other revenue increase by ¬£0.3 million (60.0%) to ¬£0.8 million (2024: ¬£0.5 million). Cash through to digital (eMoney) net revenue remained flat at ¬£6.8 million (2024: ¬£6.8 million) and transactions decreased by 0.3 million (3.7%) to 7.9 million (2024: 8.2 million). Other payments & banking net revenue includes interest income from client balances, SIM sales and other ad-hoc items which contributed ¬£6.2 million (2024: ¬£5.1 million) net revenue. The year on year increase is driven by a number of items which are non-recurring in nature. LOVE2SHOP SEGMENT Love2shop (L2s) Segment has generated ¬£367.5 million of total billings in the year (2024: ¬£359.3 million). Net revenue for the year increased ¬£0.4 million to ¬£51.7 million (2024: ¬£51.3 million) as a result of higher interest income and the product mix, partially offset by changing product mix in Prepaid Christmas Savings to drive customer retention and a reduction in prepaid media on lower margin billings which has led to an increased profit contribution. Love2shop achieved ¬£204.5 million of billings in the year, an increase on prior year of ¬£7.9 million (2024: ¬£196.7 million). This increase reflects improved performance in our corporate area, with our established client base achieving record retention and an increase in client order value of 11% during our key peak trading month of December. Included in Love2shop are billings from the distribution partnership with Incomm payments, this went live in October 2024 with a phased rollout. During this phased rollout Love2shop gift cards were sold in over 3,100 unique locations, including leading UK grocers and high street stores for the first time. Through this partnership and our distribution across the PayPoint multiple retailer network gift cards were sold in over 6,000 unique locations in FY25. Park Christmas Savings achieved billings of ¬£163.0 million (2024: ¬£162.6 million), building on prior year channel improvements. PROFIT BEFORE TAX AND TAXATION The income tax charge of ¬£7.0 million (2024: ¬£12.5 million) on profit before tax of ¬£26.3 million (2024: ¬£48.2 million) represents an effective tax rate of 26.6% (2024: 25.9%). This is higher than the UK statutory rate of 25% mainly due to the impact of prior year adjustments. GROUP STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION Net assets of ¬£97.3 million (2024: ¬£121.2 million) decreased by ¬£23.9 million reflecting the first year impact of the share buyback programme, the claim settlement and fair value investment adjustments, partially offset by underlying profit after tax. Current assets decreased by ¬£26.0 million to ¬£270.6 million (2024: ¬£296.6 million) due to a reduction in corporate cash and a decrease in the balance for items in the course of collection, an equal but opposite decrease in the settlement payables is included in current liabilities. Non-current assets of ¬£237.8 million (2024: ¬£222.5 million) increased by ¬£15.3 million reflecting the acquisition of obconnect. Total liabilities increased by ¬£13.0 million to ¬£411.0 million (2024: ¬£398.0 million) following an increase in loans and borrowings, offset by a reduction in settlement payables, as noted above. Net corporate debt was ¬£97.4 million (2024: ¬£67.5 million) and has increased by ¬£29.9 million from the previous year. Positive cash generation from trading has been offset by ¬£14.9 million on the share buyback programme, investments in obconnect and Yodel and working capital requirements in the year, along with tax payments, capital expenditure and dividend requirements. Total loans and borrowings were ¬£102.3 million at the year end, increasing by ¬£8.4 million from 31 March 2024. These consisted of a ¬£45.0 million non-amortising term loan, ¬£58.0 million drawdown of the ¬£90.0 million revolving credit facility and ¬£0.3 million of accrued interest less ¬£1.0 million arrangement fees (2024: ¬£36.0 million of amortising term loans, ¬£57.5 million drawdown from the revolving credit facility, and ¬£0.4 million of accrued interest). GROUP CASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY The following table summarises the cash flow and net debt movements during the year. Cash generation increased ¬£11.1 million to ¬£69.0 million (2024: ¬£57.9 million) delivered from profit before tax of ¬£26.3 million (2024: ¬£48.2 million). There was a net working capital outflow of ¬£10.3 million (2024: ¬£11.8 million) with trade receivables and inventory levels increasing as the Group grows its revenue and supports new revenue generating initiatives which requires increases in working capital. Taxation payments on account of ¬£11.4 million (2024: ¬£8.4 million) were higher than the prior year, with payments based on a higher estimated profit before tax. Dividend payments were higher compared to the prior year following an increased interim and final ordinary dividend per share from the prior year ended 31 March 2024. The 3-year share buyback programme commenced on 1 July 2024 and returned ¬£14.9 million cash during the year (2024: ¬£nil). Capital expenditure of ¬£18.8 million (2024: ¬£16.2 million) was ¬£2.6 million higher than the prior year. Capital expenditure primarily consists of payment terminals including Zebra printers, IT hardware, card terminals and other software development. The increase in capital expenditure is primarily the result of software development investment to modernise heritage systems. DIVIDENDS We have declared an increase of 2.1% in the final dividend to 19.6 pence per share (2024: 19.2 pence per share) payable in equal instalments of 9.8 pence per share (2024: 9.6 pence per share) on 11 August 2025 and 26 September 2025 to shareholders on the register on 4 July 2025 and 29 August 2025 respectively. The final dividend is subject to the approval of shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 6 August 2025. The final dividend will result in ¬£13.8 million (2024: ¬£14.0 million) being paid to shareholders from the standalone statement of financial position of the Company which, as at 31 March 2025, had approximately ¬£67.2 million (2024: ¬£102.2 million) of distributable reserves. CAPITAL ALLOCATION The Group maintains a capital structure appropriate for current and prospective trading over the medium term that allows a healthy mix of returns to shareholders and cash for investments. The Group‚Äôs capital allocation priorities have been updated as follows: GOING CONCERN The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis having regard to the identified principal risks and uncertainties and the viability statement on page 22. Our cash and borrowing capacity provides sufficient funds to meet the foreseeable needs of the Group including dividends. Rob HardingChief Financial Officer 11 June 2025 PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES Continuous development and review, whilst maintaining a dynamic and effective risk management process, is vital to support the business in achievement of its strategy and business objectives. Risk management continues to be an essential part of PayPoint‚Äôs Corporate Governance. Changes to principal risks New risks and disclosures PayPoint‚Äôs risk appetite is determined by the Board and aligns the level of risk considered acceptable in achieving our strategic objectives, increasing financial returns and adhering to statutory requirements. Our risk appetite remains the same as last year. It is defined as: Changing risks Credit and Liquidity/Treasury Management ‚Äì The name of this risk has been updated to reflect the increasing importance of Counter Party Risk Management to the Group which is now included within the risk profile. This risk is considered to be increasing following recent investment activities aligned to our strategic objectives. Operational Model ‚Äì this risk has been renamed as Client Services to more accurately reflect the composition of this risk and its associated risk management strategy. Other principal risks have remained similar to last year, although they reflect current trends and our risk appetite for each area. Emerging Risks ESG and Climate Risk remains an emerging risk. Whilst we recognise the impact climate change is having globally, we continue to be a low-carbon producing company and, as such, these risks do not pose an immediate risk to our operations. We have embedded a strategy of reducing our carbon emissions, with a goal of becoming fully net-zero by 2040 (2030 for our own operations). Details of how we plan to achieve are set out in our annual report. In 2022 we implemented The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) which provides companies with a framework to improve reporting on climate-related risks and opportunities. Risks caused by climate change have been embedded into our enterprise risk management framework including our financial planning processes, business case development and our overall risk identification and management processes are set out in our annual report. The table on pages 18 to 21 sets out our principal and emerging risks and includes: details of the potential impact; mitigation strategies; status of each risk; risk appetite; and exposure trend. They do not comprise all risks faced by the Group and are not set out in order of priority. VIABILITY STATEMENT In accordance with the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, The Directors have assessed the viability of the Group over a three-year period, taking account of the Group‚Äôs current financial and trading position, the principal risks and uncertainties (as set out on pages 18 to 21) and the strategic plans that are reviewed at least annually by the Board. Assessment periodThe Directors have determined that the Group‚Äôs strategic planning period of three years remains an appropriate timeframe over which to assess viability. This broadly aligns to average client renewal terms, new client prospecting and onboarding cycles and the development-through-to-maturity evolution of new products and service lines. The current financing facilities are in place until 2029 broadly in line with this period. Assessment of prospectsThe Directors assess the Group‚Äôs prospects through the annual strategy day in September 2024 and review of the Group‚Äôs three-year Plan in March 2025. The planning process forecasts the Group‚Äôs financial performance that include cash flows which allow the Directors to assess both the Group‚Äôs liquidity and adequacy of funding. In its assessment of the Group‚Äôs prospects, the Directors have considered the following: ‚Äî The Group‚Äôs strategy and how it addresses changing economic environments in the context of our clients, parcel partnerships, merchants, prepay savers and retailer requirements. In each of our business divisions, we evolve our proposition to specifically address the requirements of our clients and merchants. In the e-Commerce division, we continue to extend our network and offer online customers greater convenience driven by the developing partnerships with carriers. In our Shopping division, our partnership with Lloyds Bank is providing a market-leading banking and card services proposition. In Payments and Banking, leveraging our open banking capabilities (obconnect) to cross- and up-sell our multi-channel payment capabilities, bringing innovation to our targeted sectors. In Love2shop, we continue to integrate our products into new channels (Incomm) and extend adoption of the PayPoint OpenPay service enabling consumers the choice of cash or vouchers. Finally, we are expanding our community cash banking solutions across the UK providing much needed access to cash for consumers, through our retailer partners. The Group‚Äôs inherent resilience to risk. The Group has an inherent resilience to risk from its diversified proposition across many sectors. This means there are substantial opportunities to continue to provide more key services across all our customers (Retailers, SMEs, Clients, prepay savers and Parcel partnerships). This will ensure we are more integral to all our customers. The business remains highly cash generative, enabling continued investment in key areas of growth to support the Group‚Äôs longer-term viability. Expectations of the future economic environment. The economic environment remains uncertain. Higher inflation and cost of borrowing have and continue to impact consumer behaviours and confidence. The diversity and necessity of our proposition ensures the business can adapt to ongoing and unexpected changes. A good example of this is the Yodel/Vinted partnership which supports many value seeking consumers with purchases in the previously loved clothing market. The Group‚Äôs financial position. As at 31 May 2025 the Group had ¬£105.7 million of net debt, split ¬£8.7m cash and ¬£114.4 utilised facilities. Compared to the total facility of ¬£165m means the group has substantial headroom of ¬£59.3m. This level of liquidity is sufficient for all viability scenarios. Furthermore, the Group has proven, robust performance and cash generation in previous economic downturns. Assessment of viability To assess our viability, we modelled different scenarios identified by considering the potential impact of the principal risks (as shown in the table on pages 18 to 21). Our development of scenarios included reviewing the risks of PayPoint Group, and where appropriate we have made adjustments. Risks are broadly unchanged, the additional investments required to realise our integration and plan targets are included in the plan financial projections. We have reassessed the group‚Äôs scenarios to reflect the progress made in delivering our strategy. All ten principal risks were used in our modelling. They were chosen because they combine to represent plausible scenarios covering a range of different operational and financial impacts on the business.In total, three severe but plausible individual scenarios have been modelled, with a fourth reverse stress test scenario. These scenarios and the assumptions within are detailed in the table below. Theoretically all these scenarios, with differing causes could occur together, with varying levels of impact. However, we have not included a combined scenario of scenarios A to C.None of the separate scenarios modelled was found to impact the long-term viability of the Group over the assessment period. In assessing each of the scenarios, we have taken account of the mitigating actions available to us, including, but not limited to reducing discretionary operating spend, reducing non-committed capital expenditure. repricing our products and services, freezing recruitment, reducing variable incentives and temporary suspension of dividend payments. ConclusionHaving assessed the Group‚Äôs current position, potential impacts of principal risks, managing adverse conditions in the past, potential mitigating actions and prospects of the Group, the Directors confirm they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation over the next three years and there are no indications that impact the Group‚Äôs longer term prospects.

At 31 March 2025, the Group had corporate cash of ¬£4.9 million. The Group carried out a refinancing, completed on 6 June 2024, following which its borrowing facilities consisted of: On 11 June 2025, the Group completed an amendment to the above arrangement, to manage its working capital requirements and capital allocation. Its borrowing facilities now consist of: At 31 March 2025, ¬£58.0 million (2024: ¬£57.5 million) was drawn down from the ¬£90.0 million revolving credit facility and the outstanding balance of the non-amortising term loan was ¬£45.0 million. The Group‚Äôs statement of financial position shows net assets of ¬£97.3 million as at 31 March 2025 (¬£121.2 million as at 31 March 2024), having made a profit after tax for the year of ¬£19.3 million (2024: ¬£35.7 million) and generated cash from operations of ¬£74.7 million for the year then ended (2024: ¬£65.7 million). The Group had net current liabilities of ¬£14.0 million (2024: ¬£4.4 million). The Directors consider the going concern period as twelve months from the date of signing of these financial statements and have reviewed detailed monthly cash flow forecasts from the Group over this period. In this ‚Äòbase case‚Äô scenario, the cash flow forecasts show considerable liquidity headroom and debt covenants will be met throughout the period. In addition, the Directors have considered and confirm there are no significant or material events that have been identified beyond the going concern period that may cast significant doubt upon the continuing use of the going concern basis. Additionally, the Directors have carried out an assessment of the principal risks and uncertainties and applied severe but plausible scenarios, together with a reverse stress test, to test further the Group going concern assumption. These scenarios included a reduction in the volume of transactions caused by a severe economic downturn, transformation and growth plans not delivering intended benefits and material one-off impacts of regulatory, IT or credit loss events. As mitigating actions, we have assumed achievable reductions in expenditure and a reduction in the level of future dividends following the payment of the final dividend of 19.6 pence per share declared in respect of the financial year ended 31 March 2025. The cash flow forecasts included an analysis and stress test for the above scenarios to ensure working capital movements within a reporting year do not trigger a covenant breach. Based on this assessment the Directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of not less than twelve months from the date of approval of these financial statements and therefore have prepared the financial statements on a going concern basis. Use of judgements and estimatesIn the application of the Group‚Äôs accounting policies, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the year in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that year, or in the year of the revision and future years if the revision affects both current and future years. Critical judgement: recognition of cash and cash equivalents and restricted funds held on depositThe nature of payments and banking services means that PayPoint collects and holds funds on behalf of clients as those funds pass through the settlement process and retains retailer partners‚Äô deposits as security for those collections. Love2shop also holds, in trust, gift card voucher deposits on behalf of agents, cardholders and redeemers and prepay savers‚Äô cash on behalf of savers. A critical judgement in this area is whether each of the above categories of funds, and restricted funds held on deposit, are recognised on the consolidated statement of financial position, and whether they are included in cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the Statement of consolidated cash flows. This includes evaluating: (a) the existence of a binding agreement, such as a legal trust, clearly identifying the beneficiary of the funds;(b) the identification of funds, ability to allocate and separability of funds;(c) the identification of the holder of those funds at any point in time, and;(d) whether the Group bears the credit risk. Where there is a binding agreement specifying that PayPoint holds funds on behalf of the client (i.e. acting in the capacity of a trustee) and those funds have been separately identified as belonging to that beneficiary, the cash (referred to as ‚ÄòClients‚Äô own funds‚Äô) and the related liability are not included on the consolidated statement of financial position. In all other cases, the Group has access to the interest on such monies and can, having met certain conditions, withdraw the funds. The cash and corresponding liability are therefore recognised on the consolidated statement of financial position. Corporate cash and cash equivalents consists of cash freely available to the Group for use in its daily operations and is presented as a separate line item on the consolidated statement of financial position from non-corporate cash and cash equivalents, which is not freely available to the Group, either because of self-regulation and segregation or due to contractual or regulatory requirements. Non-corporate cash and cash equivalents comprises: Both corporate cash and non-corporate cash are included within cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated statement of cash flows.Restricted funds held on deposit (non-corporate), comprises gift card voucher cash and prepay savers‚Äô cash. However, unlike the gift card voucher cash and prepay savers‚Äô cash included in non-corporate cash and cash equivalents, restricted funds held on deposit (non-corporate) may only be accessed after a minimum of three months. Consequently, they are excluded from cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated statement of financial position and the Consolidated statement of cash flows. The amounts recognised on the Consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 March 2025 are as follows: Critical judgement: assessment of the Group‚Äôs Cards division cash generating units (CGUs)Management reassessed its CGUs during the prior period, prompted by the signing of a new partnership with Lloyds Banking Group‚Äôs ‚ÄúCardnet‚Äù division in March 2024. This resulted in the creation of a new Cards CGU in the prior period, comprising the former Handepay CGU and Merchant Rentals CGU plus the pre-existing PayPoint cards business. Consequently, the Group now tests for impairment the aggregate goodwill of ¬£45.2 million which arose on the acquisitions of Handepay and Merchant Rentals, by comparing the enlarged Cards CGU‚Äôs recoverable amount to its carrying value. Prior to this CGU reassessment, the Group performed separate impairment tests on the goodwill which arose on the Handepay and Merchant Rentals acquisitions (¬£35.6 million and ¬£9.6 million respectively) by comparing the recoverable amounts to the carrying values for each of the Handepay and Merchant Rentals CGUs. The consolidation of the former Handepay CGU, Merchant Rentals CGU and PayPoint cards business into a single Cards CGU remains a critical judgement. Critical estimate: Valuation of acquired intangible assets on acquisition of obconnect LtdThe fair value of acquired intangible assets (customer relationships, brand and developed technology) recognised on the acquisition of obconnect Ltd amounted to ¬£11.0 million, with a related deferred tax liability of ¬£2.7 million. Together with other assets acquired and liabilities assumed, this resulted in goodwill of ¬£12.2 million. The estimate of fair value measurement of acquired customer relationships is considered by management a critical estimate due to a significant risk of material adjustment in the measurement period. The fair value of customer relationships is derived from assumptions, changes to which would have a material impact on its fair value. The table below summarises the fair value of customer relationships recognised, the assumptions used in deriving the fair value and the range of fair values obtained by changing one or more of the assumptions: Given that the acquired customer relationships were not purchased in separate transactions, but rather as part of the wider obconnect Ltd business combination, the ‚Äòmarket participant‚Äô perspective is hypothetical. Therefore, in measuring the acquired customer relationships at fair value, management considered the types of potential market participants (e.g. competitors and comparable companies) to apply assumptions that were consistent with the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the intangible assets. Given that the acquired customer relationships are not traded on an active market, have no recent market transactions and are unique to obconnect, management valued them using a multi-period excess earnings (MEEM) method, which reflects market participant fair value by including forecast lifetime earnings which were specifically attributable only to the customer relationships existing at the acquisition date. The discount rate applied to the MEEM incorporates general market rates of return at the acquisition date as well as industry risks and the risks of the asset to typical market participant, based on an analysis of comparable companies. The residual ¬£12.2 million goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from the acquisition that were not individually identified and separately recognised at the acquisition date. The buyer-specific synergies subsumed into goodwill did not exist at the market-participant level at the acquisition date because i) they result from combining PayPoint and obconnect Ltd, enabling PayPoint to cross-sell to the obconnect Ltd customer base and ii) the new customer relationships and sectors are anticipated to arise post-acquisition but these were not identifiable at the acquisition date. The workforce and operating expertise are not separately identifiable intangible assets and are also included in goodwill. Critical estimate: Valuation of the investments in Judge Logistics Ltd Convertible loan notesAs explained in note 7, the Company held a convertible loan note in Judge Logistics Ltd (‚ÄúJudge‚Äù) at 31 March 2025, which it had purchased for consideration of ¬£15 million during the current period. In accordance with IAS32 Financial Instruments the Company is required to re-measure the loan note at fair value at the end of each reporting period, using an appropriate valuation method. Management used the Probability-Weighted Expected Return Method (‚ÄúPWERM‚Äù), valuing the instrument under each of the different outcomes it identified, and assigning a relative probability to each such outcome. Management exercised judgement in assigning the relative probabilities. It assigned the highest probability to the scenario which transpired on 17 April 2025, namely the conversion of the Company‚Äôs loan note into a 3.6% equity investment in Judge, triggered by InPost spa z.o.o.‚Äôs (‚ÄúInPost‚Äôs‚Äù) acquisition of Judge. Management assigned lower probabilities to other feasible scenarios. Management also exercised judgement in estimating the fair value of a 3.6% equity investment. The amount paid by InPost to purchase convertible loan notes in Judge, prior to acquiring 95.5% of it, provided management with observable market information to assist in estimating the fair value of a 3.6% share. The re-measurement of the Company‚Äôs loan note in Judge, from ¬£15.0 million to ¬£2.2 million, resulted in a charge of ¬£12.8 million in the Consolidated statement of profit or loss for the current year, reported within adjusting items (see note 7). Equity investmentIn addition to the convertible loan note, the Company purchased for ¬£100 an equity investment in Judge in the current year. This investment represented a 0.9% share in Judge following conversion of the Company‚Äôs and InPost‚Äôs loan notes on 17 April 2025. With reference to the valuation of ¬£2.2 million derived by the PWERM method for its loan note and the estimated relative probabilities of the possible scenarios, management re-measured the Company‚Äôs equity investment in Judge at ¬£0.5 million, resulting in a gain of ¬£0.5 million in the Consolidated statement of profit or loss, reported within adjusting items (see note 7). Future impactWith the conversion of the Company‚Äôs loan note into equity on 17 April 2025, the element of uncertainty relating to the relative probabilities of the scenarios existing at 31 March 2025 was removed. However, the fair value attributable to the Company‚Äôs investments in Judge remains subject to estimation. It is reasonably possible that changes to assumptions used by management to estimate the fair value of its investments could give rise to further material adjusting items in the following financial year. Alternative performance measures Non-IFRS measures or alternative performance measures are used by the Directors and management for performance analysis, planning, reporting and incentive-setting purposes. They have remained consistent with the prior year. These measures are included in these financial statements to provide additional useful information on performance and trends to shareholders. These measures are not defined terms under IFRS and therefore they may not be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies. They are not intended to be a substitute for IFRS measures. Underlying performance measures (non-IFRS measures)Underlying performance measures allow shareholders to understand the operational performance in the year, to facilitate comparison with prior years and to assess trends in financial performance. They exclude the impact of one-off, non-recurring and exceptional items and the amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition, such as brands and customer relationships. The adjusting items between the Group‚Äôs statutory and underlying performance measures are as follows: Love2shop billings (non-IFRS measure relating solely to the Love2shop segment)Billings represents the value of goods and services shipped and invoiced to customers during the year and is recorded net of VAT, rebates and discounts. Billings is an alternative performance measure, which the directors believe provides an additional measure of the level of activity other than total revenue. This is due to revenue from multi-retailer redemption products being reported on a ‚Äònet‚Äô basis, whilst revenue from single-retailer redemption products and other goods are reported on a ‚Äògross‚Äô basis. Net revenue (non-IFRS measure)Net revenue is total revenue less commissions paid (to retailer partners and Park Christmas Savings agents) and the cost of revenue for items where the Group acts in the capacity as principal (including single-retailer vouchers and SIM cards). This reflects the benefit attributable to the Group‚Äôs performance, eliminating pass-through costs to create comparability of performance under both the agent and principal revenue models. It is a key consistent measure of the overall success of the Group‚Äôs strategy. A reconciliation from total underlying revenue to net revenue is included in note 4. Total costs (non-IFRS measure)Total costs comprise other costs of revenue, administrative expenses, finance income and finance costs. Total costs exclude adjusting items, being exceptional costs, amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition and net movement on investment fair values. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) (non-IFRS measure)The Group presents EBITDA as it is widely used by investors, analysts and other interested parties to evaluate profitability of companies. This measures earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. See page 11 for a reconciliation from profit before tax to EBITDA. Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Underlying EBITDA) (non-IFRS measure)The Group also presents adjusted EBITDA, which comprises EBITDA, as defined above, excluding exceptional items and net movements on convertible loan notes and other investments. See page 11 for a reconciliation from profit before tax to adjusted EBITDA. Underlying earnings per share (non-IFRS measure)Underlying earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit before adjusting items attributable to equity holders of the parent by the basic or diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue. Underlying profit before tax (non-IFRS measure)Underlying profit before tax represents statutory profit before tax excluding adjusting items. Net corporate debt (non-IFRS measure)Net corporate debt represents corporate cash and cash equivalents less bank overdraft and amounts borrowed under financing facilities (excluding IFRS 16 liabilities). The reconciliation of corporate cash and cash equivalents to net corporate debt is as follows: 2. Segmental reporting Segmental information The Group considers its Love2shop business to be separate segments from its legacy PayPoint business, since discrete financial information is prepared for Love2shop and PayPoint and they offer different products and services. Furthermore, the chief operating decision maker (CODM) reviews separate monthly internal management reports (including financial information) for Love2shop and PayPoint to allocate resources and assess performance. The material products and services offered by each segment are as follows: PayPoint Love2shop Information related to each reportable segment is set out below. Segment profit / (loss) before tax and adjusting items is used to measure performance because management believes that this information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of the respective segments relative to other entities that operate in the same industries. A business division analysis of revenue has been provided in note 3. The ¬£310.7 million (2024: ¬£306.4 million) total revenue and ¬£237.8 million (2024: ¬£222.5 million) non-current assets at 31 March 2025 are geographically located within the UK. 3. Revenue Disaggregation of revenue Service fee revenue of ¬£21.8 million (2024: ¬£19.7 million) and management fees, set-up fees and upfront lump sum payments of ¬£1.1 million (2024: ¬£1.3 million) are recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the contract. Card terminal leasing revenue of ¬£10.6 million (2024: ¬£8.7 million) is recognised over the expected lease term using the sum of digits method for finance leases and on a straight-line basis for operating leases. Multi-retailer voucher, card and e-code service fee revenue is recognised on redemption by the customer. The remainder of revenue is recognised at the point in time when each transaction is processed. The usual timing of payment by PayPoint customers is on 14-day terms. The usual timing of Love2shop‚Äôs corporate customers is 15-day terms; its consumer customers pay on ordering. Revenue subject to variable consideration of ¬£14.1 million (2024: ¬£13.6 million) exists where the consideration to which the Group is entitled varies according to transaction volumes processed and rate per transaction. Management estimates the total transaction price using the expected value method at contract inception, which is reassessed at the end of each reporting year, by applying a blended rate per transaction to estimated transaction volumes. Any required adjustment is made against the transaction price in the year to which it relates. The revenue is recognised at the constrained amount to the extent that it is highly probable that the inclusion will not result in a significant revenue reversal in the future, with the estimates based on projected transaction volumes and historical experience. The potential range in outcomes for revenue subject to variable consideration resulting from changes in these estimates is not material. Love2shop revenue is recorded net of corporate discounts. Other revenue comprises: 4. Alternative performance measures Net revenue The reconciliation between total underlying revenue and net revenue is as follows: Total costs Total costs, excluding adjusting items, comprises: 5. Exceptional items The tax impact of the exceptional items is ¬£5,859,000 (2024: ¬£1,305,000). Exceptional items are those which are considered significant by virtue of their nature, size or incidence. These items are presented as exceptional within their relevant income statement categories to assist in the understanding of the performance and financial results of the Group, as they do not form part of the underlying business. Claim settlementThe current year deduction against revenue relates to the Group‚Äôs settlement of a claim brought against it by Utilita, as disclosed in note 12. The claim was settled after the year-end date and has been treated as an adjusting event in accordance with IAS10 Events after the reporting period. Legal feesThe current year charge relates to the Group‚Äôs defence of two claims served on a number of its companies in connection with the issue disclosed in note 12. The Group remains confident that it will successfully defend the claim served by Global-365. Chapel St. The costs arise from the Group‚Äôs decision to vacate part of its leased Chapel Street, Liverpool premises in February 2025. Following the decision, the Group will continue to pay rent until June 2029, five years short of the original lease termination date. Consequently, the lease liability and associated right of use asset were remeasured in the current year and the reduced right of use asset fully impaired, along with other assets in the vacated space. In addition, the Group has recognised an onerous contract provision for unavoidable costs related to the vacated space. ERP system amortisationThe current year accelerated amortisation costs relate to Love2shop‚Äôs ERP system. As part of an e-commerce project initiated in the current period, certain modules of that system will be replaced by 31 March 2025, earlier than the previously expected date. Restructuring costsThe prior year restructuring costs relate to the organisational design of the Group communicated by management to all staff on 6 March 2024. Refinancing costsThe prior year refinancing costs comprise legal and professional fees incurred by the Group in respect of its borrowing facilities referred to in note 1 and the write-off of the unamortised balance of capitalised costs arising on the previous refinancing exercise. 6. Tax The income tax charge is based on the UK statutory rate of corporation tax for the year of 25% (2024: 25%). Deferred tax has been calculated using the enacted tax rates that are expected to apply when the liability is settled, or the asset realised. Deferred tax has been calculated based on the rate applicable at the date timing differences are expected to reverse. The income tax charge of ¬£7.0 million (2024: ¬£12.5 million) on profit before tax of ¬£26.3 million (2024: ¬£48.2 million) represents an effective tax rate1 of 26.6% (2024: 25.9%). This is higher than the UK statutory rate of 25% due to adjustments in respect of disallowable expenses, share-based payments and prior year adjustments. The tax charge for the year is reconciled to profit before tax, as set out in the consolidated statement of profit or loss, as follows: 1Effective tax rate is the tax cost as a percentage of profit before tax. Given the Group‚Äôs effective tax rate, its annual revenue and that it has no overseas operations, the Group assesses that the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development‚Äôs Pillar Two tax regime will have no impact on it. 7. Investments Convertible loan notes The movements in the fair values of the convertible loan note investments in the prior and current years are as follows: Judge Logistics LtdThe Group‚Äôs ¬£15 million investment in Judge Logistics Ltd was purchased in three stages (¬£10 million on 21 June 2024, ¬£3 million on 31 July 2024 and ¬£2 million on 30 September 2024). Judge Logistics Ltd is the parent company of Yodel Ltd, a customer in the Group‚Äôs e-commerce parcel business. At 31 March 2025 the Company revalued its investment to fair value in accordance with IAS32 Financial Instruments. It elected to use the Probability-Weighted Expected Return Method (‚ÄúPWERM‚Äù), under which the Directors identified various future scenarios for its investment and assigned a relative probability and valuation for each such scenario. They considered the most probable outcome to be that which transpired on 17 April 2025, namely the conversion of the Company‚Äôs loan note into equity, following the acquisition of Judge Logistics Limited by InPost sp z.o.o. The fair value derived from the above valuation method was ¬£2.2 million, with the ¬£12.8 million loss recorded within adjusting items . obconnect LtdThe Company purchased a convertible loan note of nominal amount ¬£3.0 million on 7 July 2022 from obconnect Ltd, which provides open banking services to banks and other financial institutions. Based on the key terms of the convertible loan note and investment agreement, the investment was recognised at fair value, with any gains or losses recognised through the statement of profit or loss. The fair value as at 31 March 2024 determined using the discounted cash flow method was ¬£3,689,000. Management therefore recognised a ¬£689,000 gain in the statement of profit or loss in the prior year, reported within adjusting items. The loan converted into a 22.5% equity stake in obconnect Ltd‚Äôs ordinary shares on the Company‚Äôs acquisition of a majority shareholding in obconnect Ltd on 30 October 2024 (see note 8). On that date, the fair value of the convertible loan note was ¬£6,117,000, the increase of ¬£2,428,000 reflecting the continued trading improvements of obconnect Ltd in the seven months since 31 March 2024 and an observable market price provided by the price per share paid by the Company to acquire control of obconnect Ltd. Aperidata LtdThe Company purchased a convertible loan note in Aperidata Ltd in May 2024 for consideration of ¬£1.0 million. Aperidata Ltd provides credit reporting and open banking services to consumers and businesses. The loan converts into an equity stake in Aperidata Ltd‚Äôs ordinary shares on 23 May 2027, such that the Company‚Äôs aggregate equity stake in Aperidata Ltd following conversion will be 42.97%, including its diluted, direct equity investment referred to below. The current year discounted cash flow valuation is based on a 5-year forecast extrapolated to perpetuity, using the following financial assumptions. The discount rate reflects management‚Äôs view of the level of risk associated with the business: The fair value derived from the above valuation method was ¬£1.0 million. Other investmentsThe movements in the fair values of the equity investments in the prior and current years are as follows: Judge Logistics LtdDuring the year the Company acquired 17.3% of the ordinary share capital of Judge Logistics Ltd for consideration of ¬£100, in addition to the convertible loan note in Judge Logistics Ltd referred to above. At 31 March 2025 the Company revalued its investment to fair value in accordance with IAS32 Financial Instruments. It elected to use the Probability-Weighted Expected Return Method (‚ÄúPWERM‚Äù), under which the Directors identified two future scenarios for its investment and assigned a relative probability and valuation for each such scenario. The fair value derived from the above valuation method was ¬£0.5 million, with the ¬£0.5 million gain recorded within adjusting items. obconnect LtdIn the year ended 31 March 2023 the Company acquired 2.5% of the ordinary share capital of obconnect Ltd for consideration of ¬£251,000, in addition to the convertible loan note in obconnect Ltd referred to above. In the current year, the Company increased the fair value of this investment to ¬£516,000, the increase of ¬£265,000 reflecting the continued trading improvements of obconnect Ltd. This 2.5% shareholding ceased to be treated as a separate investment, following the Company‚Äôs current year acquisition of obconnect Ltd. Aperidata LtdDuring the year the Company acquired 19.9% of the ordinary share capital of Aperidata Ltd for consideration of ¬£0.2 million, in addition to the convertible loan note in Aperidata Ltd referred to above. The current year discounted cash flow valuation of this investment is ¬£0.2 million. 8. Acquisition of subsidiary On 30 October 2024, PayPoint acquired a further 52.8% of the share capital of obconnect Ltd for consideration of ¬£17.2 million, comprising cash of ¬£10.5 million plus the fair values of its convertible loan note (¬£6.1 million) and existing 2.5% equity investment (¬£0.5 million) and stamp duty of ¬£0.1 million. The convertible loan note converted into 22.5% equity as part of the acquisition, within the total 55.3% acquired. The acquisition resulted in a net ¬£8.9 million cash outflow (net of cash acquired) in the current year. The primary reason for the acquisition was to further leverage obconnect Ltd‚Äôs technology platform, offering its Open Banking services to both new and existing clients. In accordance with IFRS3 Business Combinations, the Group identified and recognised the following intangible assets as part of the fair value exercise. The assets are being amortised over useful lives as shown: In the period since acquisition, obconnect Ltd contributed revenue of ¬£1.8 million and profit before tax of ¬£0.3 million to the Group‚Äôs results. Had the acquisition taken place on the first day of the financial year, obconnect Ltd would have contributed revenue of ¬£4.5 million and profit before tax of ¬£0.2 million. Acquisition costs incurred in the year in relation to obconnect totalled ¬£0.1 million, which are reported within administrative expenses in the Consolidated statement of profit or loss. The following table summarises the provisional fair values of the identifiable assets purchased and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date: The acquired identifiable assets and liabilities have been recognised at their fair values at acquisition date and in accordance with the Group‚Äôs accounting policies: ‚Ä¢ The acquired customer relationships including order backlogs have been valued using the multi-period excess earnings method (‚ÄúMEEM approach‚Äù) by estimating the total expected income streams from the customer relationship and deducting portions of the cash flow that can be attributed to supporting, or contributory, assets (including workforce). The order backlog is estimated based on the expected revenue to be received, less the costs to deliver the service. The residual income streams are discounted. No tax amortisation benefit is applied. The key inputs to this method are the customer churn rate, revenue growth rate and discount rate applied to future forecasts of the businesses.‚Ä¢ Acquired brands have been valued using the relief-from-royalty method.‚Ä¢ Acquired software intangible assets have been valued using the depreciated replacement cost method, considering factors including economic and technological obsolescence. ‚Ä¢ Trade receivables and trade payables have been assessed at fair value on the basis of the contractual terms and economic conditions existing at the acquisition date, reflecting the best estimate at the acquisition date of contractual cash flows not expected to be collected. The following acquired assets and liabilities were valued using management‚Äôs best estimates based on information available at the acquisition date, which are therefore subject to adjustment within the measurement period if new information about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date is obtained and, if known, would have resulted in the recognition of those assets and liabilities at that date. Of the ¬£12.2 million goodwill acquired during the year, no goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill arising on the acquisition is attributable to workforce, synergies, growth from new customers and other assets not separately recognised. A non-controlling interest (NCI) of ¬£4.0 million arose on the acquisition, measured as 44.7% of the ¬£8.9 million fair value of net assets acquired. The NCI‚Äôs share of post-acquisition profit in the current year was ¬£0.1 million, resulting in an NCI balance of ¬£4.1 million, reported within total equity in the Consolidated statement of financial position. 9. Provisions In February 2025 the Group decided to vacate part of its Chapel St. premises in Liverpool. Consequently, in accordance with IAS37 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets, it has recognised a provision for unavoidable costs related to the lease agreement. In May 2025 the Group settled a claim which had been served by Utilita in 2023 (see note 12). The claim settlement is treated as an adjusting event in the year ended 31 March 2025 and consequently the Group has recognised a provision at that date for the full ¬£14.2 million settlement amount. The current year provision utilisation relates to the group-wide review of its organisational structure which PayPoint conducted in the prior year. All related payments were made to the employees impacted by the restructuring between April and October 2024. The prior year Company balance was classified as non-current. 10. Share capital, share premium and merger reserve On 13 June 2024, the Group announced a share buy-back programme of at least ¬£20.0 million over a 12-month period. In accordance with IFRS9, the Group recognised an initial liability for the full ¬£20.0 million, with a corresponding reduction in retained earnings. The ¬£14.9 million cost of shares purchased under the programme to 31 March 2025 is recorded against the liability. A total of 2,031,817 shares were purchased, with a nominal value of ¬£6,773. This resulted in a reduction in Share capital of ¬£6,773 and the creation of a corresponding Capital redemption reserve balance. Partly offsetting the impact of the share buy-back programme,146,394 shares (of 1/3p each) were issued in the current year for share awards which vested in the year and 25,910 matching shares (of 1/3p each) were issued under the Employee Share Incentive Plan. The share premium of ¬£1.0 million (2024: ¬£1.0 million) represents the payment of deferred, contingent share consideration in excess of the nominal value of shares issued in relation to the i-movo acquisition. The merger reserve of ¬£18.2 million (2024: ¬£18.2 million) comprises ¬£1.0 million initial share consideration in excess of the nominal value of shares issued on the initial acquisition of i-movo and ¬£17.2 million share consideration in excess of the nominal value of shares issued in relation to the Love2shop acquisition. 11. Notes to the statements of cash flow 12. Contingent liability Ofgem‚Äôs Statement of ObjectionsIn FY24, a number of companies in the PayPoint Group, including PayPoint Plc, received two claims relating to issues addressed by commitments accepted by Ofgem in November 2021 as a resolution of Ofgem‚Äôs concerns raised in its Statement of Objections received by the PayPoint Group in September 2020. The Ofgem resolution did not include any infringement findings. The first claim was served by Utilita Energy Limited and Utilita Services Limited (subsequently renamed Luxion Sales Limited) (‚ÄúUtilita‚Äù) on 16 June 2023. The second claim was served by Global-365 plc and Global Prepaid Solution Limited (‚ÄúGlobal 365‚Äù) on 18 July 2023. On 14 May 2025, PayPoint and Utilita came to a settlement such that Utilita has withdrawn its claim against PayPoint. As part of this settlement, the two parties have agreed to a new 5-year contract for over-the-counter prepayment services. PayPoint is looking forward to the opportunity to build a more collaborative and mutually supportive relationship with Utilita going forward. PayPoint remains confident that it will successfully defend the claim by Global 365 at trial. The claim fundamentally misunderstands the energy market and the relationships between the relevant Group companies and the major energy providers, whilst also over-estimating the opportunity available, if any, for the products offered by Global 365. The trial at the Competition Appeal Tribunal, started on 10 June 2025. HMRC assessmentIn February 2024, HMRC raised an assessment on the Group‚Äôs tax position for the accounting period ended 31 March 2021. The Group has appealed the assessment on the grounds that it is not valid from a tax technical and administrative perspective and no provision has therefore been recognised. 13. Events after the reporting date Conversion of loan note investment in Judge Logistics LtdOn 17 April 2025 the Company‚Äôs ¬£15.0 million convertible loan note investment in Judge Logistics Ltd converted to an 3.6% equity share. The conversion was triggered by InPost spa. z.o.o. acquiring a controlling equity share in Judge Logistics Ltd by converting its loan note investment into equity. See note 7. Share buy-backOn 12 June 2025 the Group announced that the share buy-back programme, which it began on 1 July 2024 for an initial 12-month period, would be extended until the end of March 2028. The Group plans to purchase at least ¬£30 million of shares per annum. It will continue to review the programme based on business performance, market conditions, cash generation and the overall capital needs of the business. This is a non-adjusting event, having no impact on the current year financial statements. Settlement of legal claimOn 13 May 2025 the Group settled the legal claim with Utilita referred to in note 12. The total settlement amount was ¬£14.2 million, recorded in the current year as an exceptional revenue deduction and a provision. See notes 5 and 9. 1 Underlying EBITDA (EBITDA before exceptional items and net movements on convertible loan notes and other investments) is an alternative performance measure.

Title: NYC taxi financier fined $4M for planting ‚Äòfake news‚Äô to boost his company‚Äôs stock price

A New York financier and his publicly traded firm that bankrolled loans to taxi drivers were ordered to pay $4 million for allegedly planting fake news articles online to boost the company‚Äôs stock price. Medallion Financial Corp. ‚Äî which got hit a decade ago as ride-sharing apps like Uber and Lyft began to tank the value of taxi medallions ‚Äî will have to pay $3 million as part of a settlement after a judgment by Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of the US Southern District of New York. Medallion president Andrew Murstein ‚Äî who made headlines when he hired Nicki Minaj to perform at his son‚Äôs bar mitzvah in 2015 ‚Äî must fork out $1 million in a case brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to a May 29 securities filing. The SEC complaint contained ‚Äúmore than sufficient allegations to support the claim that Murstein and Medallion Financial misled investors by withholding information material to Medallion Bank‚Äôs fair value,‚Äù Kaplan wrote in his opinion denying the company‚Äôs motion to dismiss a case brought in December 2021 under the agency‚Äôs President Biden-appointed chair Gary Gensler, The Post previously reported on Murstein‚Äôs alleged brazen scheme to secretly pay for ‚Äúfake news‚Äù stories as the rise of Uber and Lyft caused investors to sour on taxi-related stocks, leaving Medallion‚Äôs share price floundering. The top executive hired media strategists to place at least 50 stories from 2014 to 2017 on sites such as HuffPost and Crain‚Äôs New York Business, according to the SEC complaint. The taxi medallion lender also failed to disclose that the authors of the bogus blogs were being paid, and that many of the stories had been personally tweaked and edited by Murstein, the complaint said. Instead, the posts were written in a way to make it look as if they had been penned by actual investors who were bullish on Medallion stock, the SEC complaint alleged. According to the SEC complaint, he had gone ‚Äúopinion-shopping‚Äù when one valuation firm refused to ignore his deteriorating medallion portfolio and accept his inflated view of the company‚Äôs actual worth of $193 million. It resulted in the value of Medallion‚Äôs banking unit jumping to $280 million at the end of 2016, from $166 million just two quarters earlier, even as the price of medallions slumped, the complaint said. California PR agent Lawrence Meyers, one of the main communications specialists hired by Murstein, must also pay a $100,000 fine, according to SEC filings. As part of the settlement deal, all defendants neither admit nor deny the allegations, the judgment said. ‚ÄúOur agreement with the SEC puts this nearly decade-old matter behind us and enables us to apply our full focus to continuing to grow the company,‚Äù a Medallion spokesperson told The Post on Wednesday. ‚ÄúIt removes the distraction, cost, and uncertainty of continued litigation and is in the best interest of the company and our shareholders.‚Äù News of the settlement was first reported by American Banker on Tuesday. The brash boss and his father, Leon, raked in more than $42 million from 2002 to 2014, according to the New York Times. Aside from spending lavishly on the ‚ÄúWAP‚Äù singer, Medallion Financial bought up professional lacrosse and NASCAR teams, the paper reported. ‚ÄúOne wonders if the SEC is going easy on them a bit, due to the change in administration or lack of staff,‚Äù a source close to the situation told The Post. ‚ÄúThat should give investors pause for thought if boards and executives can get away with such behavior.‚Äù President Trump-nominated SEC Chair Paul Atkins replaced Gensler. Rebecca Fike, a partner at Vinson & Elkins and a former SEC enforcement attorney, added that it shows ‚Äúa desire to wrap up actions that were initiated under the previous administration.‚Äù ‚ÄúI expect the Atkins SEC to favor quicker resolutions and accept much lower civil penalties, particularly where the staff cannot show a corporate benefit from the fraudulent acts,‚Äù she told The Post. The company‚Äôs stock closed Wednesday at $9.50. By law, there are only 13,587 taxi medallions in New York City, and each yellow cab must have a medallion linked to it. Prices for a prized medallion soared to as much as $1 million under Mayor Michael Bloomberg. But they plunged under tougher competition from the ride-sharing apps, leaving the drivers drowning in debt and piling the pressure on Medallion‚Äôs profit margins. Medallion went public in 1996. The company had been originally set up by Murstein‚Äôs taxi-driving father, a Polish immigrant, who started trading some of the cab medallions. A driver would put up roughly a third of the purchase price when buying the permit, with Medallion financing the rest with interest over a fixed period of time. After years of protests from drivers amid the rise of digital rivals, former New York Mayor Bill de Blasio unveiled a deal in November 2021 to cap medallion loans at $170,000 and interest repayments at 5%. Medallion has since tried to shift to more traditional consumer and commercial banking over the past few years. Advertisement

Title: Carbon Capture Comes Crashing Down (Again): A Comedy in Subsidies

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change If you heard a distant wailing this week, don‚Äôt worry‚Äîit was just The New York Times realizing their beloved carbon capture techno-fantasy is, once again, face-planting in the real world. In a recent Climate Forward newsletter piece titled ‚ÄúCarbon Capture Comes Back Down to Earth‚Äù, Times writer David Gelles practically had to mop his keyboard with tears over the news that the carbon removal market‚Äîonce projected to be a trillion-dollar juggernaut‚Äîis now wheezing toward irrelevance. Not that we mind. After all, here at Watts Up With That, we never bought into the carbon panic to begin with. CO2 isn‚Äôt a pollutant‚Äîit‚Äôs plant food. But watching the climate-industrial complex flop around trying to vacuum molecules out of the sky is pure entertainment. From ‚ÄúThe Next Big Thing‚Äù to Layoff Bingo Just a few months ago, the hype machine was at full throttle. Bill Gates was investing. Google, Amazon, and Airbus were snapping up ‚Äúcarbon credits‚Äù like trendy NFTs. McKinsey‚Äîever the oracle of bad ideas‚Äîdeclared carbon capture a $1.2 trillion market by 2050. One venture capitalist even called it ‚Äúthe single greatest opportunity I‚Äôve seen in 20 years.‚Äù You almost have to admire the brazenness of the grift. Fast-forward to now: 24 government grants worth $3.7 billion have been scrapped, Climeworks axed 22% of its staff, and permit applications have tanked. The ‚Äúmarket‚Äù is imploding because‚Äîbrace yourself‚Äîno one wants to fund something that doesn‚Äôt work. Meanwhile, Climeworks‚Äô headline-grabbing Iceland plant managed to remove only a sliver of its projected CO2. Naturally, the execs blame ‚Äúramp-up issues.‚Äù Of course they do. It‚Äôs never the technology‚Äôs fault‚Äîit‚Äôs always ‚Äúearly days‚Äù or ‚Äútransitional challenges.‚Äù You‚Äôd think they were launching a moon mission, not running industrial shop vacs for the atmosphere. The Laws of Physics Want a Word Let‚Äôs be crystal clear: carbon capture is a thermodynamic clown show. Pulling CO2 from ambient air‚Äîwhere it exists at a wispy 0.04%‚Äîis like trying to find a particular grain of sand on a beach‚Ä¶ using tweezers‚Ä¶ while blindfolded. It takes more energy to remove CO2 from the air than was released burning the fossil fuel in the first place. And even then, you still have to compress it, transport it, inject it underground, and pray it doesn‚Äôt leak back out. This isn‚Äôt cutting-edge climate tech. It‚Äôs an energy-intensive Rube Goldberg machine designed to appease green investors, virtue-signaling corporations, and bureaucrats allergic to basic physics. Bonus: It Boosts Oil Production! Now here‚Äôs the kicker: the CO2 some of these companies do manage to capture is often used for enhanced oil recovery. That‚Äôs right‚Äîafter spending billions to ‚Äúfight climate change,‚Äù the carbon is injected into wells to squeeze out even more oil. And yes, Occidental Petroleum‚Äîthe same company running a giant DAC project in Texas‚Äîopenly touts this as a feature, not a bug. The Times, ever reverent, quotes CEO Vicki Hollub promising that the project will help achieve ‚Äúenergy security‚Äù and ‚Äúproduce vital resources and fuels.‚Äù Translation: we‚Äôre going to burn more hydrocarbons and call it green. The NYT‚Äôs Tiny Violin Section What really makes this article sing is the melodramatic tone. The author laments layoffs, canceled subsidies, and a ‚Äúretrenchment‚Äù in the industry like it‚Äôs some noble cause under siege. And when the DOE finally did something rational‚Äîcanceling $3.7 billion in vaporware grants‚Äîthe Carbon Capture Coalition, which is about as unbiased as a pharma lobby, called it a ‚Äúmajor step backward.‚Äù For whom? Rent-seeking climatepreneurs? Even Climeworks now admits they‚Äôre going into ‚Äúconsolidation mode‚Äù and focusing on ‚Äúefficiency.‚Äù Translation: the gravy train is slowing, so it‚Äôs time to pretend we‚Äôre tightening belts while keeping the PR spigot open. Final Thoughts: Not Our Problem Let‚Äôs be honest: the entire carbon capture craze was never about saving the planet. It was about: The NYT can whimper all it wants about Trump pulling the plug, but the real villain here is reality. Physics doesn‚Äôt care about good intentions, ESG scores, or narrative arcs. It just keeps tallying the kilowatt-hours. So while The Times continues wringing its hands over CO2 removal dreams deferred, we‚Äôll be here pointing, laughing, and perhaps warming ourselves with the comforting glow of all that wasted taxpayer cash being vaporized in yet another doomed climate gimmick. Coming Soon: Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email. Type your email‚Ä¶ Subscribe Sequestering CO2 also sequesters Oxygen. Why would anyone want to do that? News to me. What do you think the O2 part of CO2 stands for? Be more curious, George Plant Trees and market them as Natural Carbon Capture Machines Please stop buying into their imaginary CO2 problem. There are lots of reasons why planting trees is a good idea, but capturing CO2 isn‚Äôt one of them. But it works. And gives us oxygen in return The oxygen is the important factor. Shade is nice. I like trees. Canada‚Äôs disgraced / dumped ex prime minister Justine Trudeau promised to plant 2 billion trees to save the planet. Turned out that all the spare land in Canada was already covered in trees, so nowhere left to plant another 2 billion of the buggers. That darn reality / rationality just keeps smacking ideology down. (Just as it always has) Somebody pointed out that some study said the permafrost line was moving northward 75 km per year causing CO2 and methane release‚Ä¶probable Climageddon. Someone else pointed out that they knew where the permafrost line was because the boreal forest was advancing northwards in unfrozen ground‚Ä¶someone else calculated how many trees must have sprouted to cover the area‚Ä¶Someone else calculated that Canada‚Äôs 300 billion trees only had to grow by 1.2 Kg of cellulose and lignin per year per tree to completely offset Canada‚Äôs entire anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Pretty soon the room went silent, and they changed the topic to how they could further greenwash getting more carbon taxes out of the oil and gas industry in Western Canada and rewarding their voter base in Ontario and Quebec for using electric heat pumps, and subsidizing electric cars. ‚ÄúOh what a tangled web we weave When first we practice to deceive‚Äù Sounds like some of our democrats have migrated up north. We have plenty of our own greenie weenies, thank you. Our new PM (Carney) is going to sell ‚Äúdecarbonized oil‚Äù to Asia. Forests are carbon (dioxide) neutral of course (trees die/burn/rot) It is really hard to come up with a worse idea than downgrading perfectly good electricity into hydrogen through electrolysis, but DAC and CCS (as ‚Äúclimate‚Äù mitigation) take the prize. This article is far too kind to CCUS schemes and purposes. There is NO good feature, period. Engineered and built a few AGI systems (acid gas injection) ‚Ä¶if you are producing sour natural gas, containing H2S and CO2, sequestering it underground is very good solution in most cases compared to the expense of building and operating a sulfur plant. The earth is geologically active. How do you prevent leaks? Long term. Despite the hype, there is no real evidence that CO2 has any meaursable effect on our global climate system. The AGW hypothesis has been falsified by science. Spending money trying to fight climate change is just a big waste of funds. Climeworks Very close to Slimeworks, home of the famous Slimeburger, the ubiquitous ever miltipling fast food chain in the Craig Shaw Gardner‚Äôs Neatherhell novels. I think they knew all along. Every time I see the name, I think Crimeworks. Ha! In the enviro case Crimeworks does. It lines there pockets I just saw an article that exposed the Obama EPA‚Äôs refusal to introduce their study on carbon capture and storage because it concluded that process was not a viable technology. The policies implemented required a proven process to mitigate the ‚Äúpollution‚Äù they controlled. This could be a story tip if I could find the article. Dilbert Dude, Scott Adams loves the idea of carbon capture. He‚Äôs proud of his economics training. What a tard. Nobody‚Äôs perfect. Doesn‚Äôt sound like him, either. Story tip. Consider my comments on carbon capture from a Wall Street Journal article below: Subject: Occidental Petroleum‚Äôs CO2 Reduction Plan In the April 11, 2023 edition of the Wall Street Journal, an article by Benoit Morenne described a plan by Occidental Petroleum to extract massive amounts of CO2 out of the air. Occidental is spending more than $1 billion to build the first of a planned fleet of plants. The plant will remove 500,000 metric tons of CO2 from the air per year. Occidental intends to build up to 135 more of these plants by the year 2035. Occidental claims that its initial cost to remove a metric tonne of CO2 would be between $400 and $500. Using $400 a metric ton, the total cost by 2035 would be $2,400,000,000, excluding possible cost reductions due to efficiencies of scale, for removing 810,000,000 metric tons of CO2. Tax incentives will subsidize 45% of the initial costs, thanks to Bidens‚Äô climate package that was signed into law last year. Consider how this plan will cut global CO2 levels from now to the year 2035. Assume that all 135 plants are on line and operating today. By 2035, these plants will have removed 810,000,000 metric tons of CO2. The atmosphere weighs 5,500,000,000,000,000 (5.5 quadrillion) metric tons. 810,000,000 metric tons of removed CO2 is 0.0000147% of the atmosphere. CO2 currently constitutes about 0.04 % of the atmosphere. Removing 0.0000147 % of CO2 would reduce atmospheric CO2 levels to 0.03999%, which when rounded to two decimal places yields 0.04%. Ergo, there will be no significant percentage reduction in CO2 levels. Occidental expects to generate between $400 and $630 in revenue per metric ton, which includes a $180 per metric ton tax credit. So, even without the tax credits, Occidental expects to earn between $220 and $450 a metric ton. It should be noted that cost estimates for untested new technologies tend to escalate. Occidental‚Äôs projections of costs and potential revenues may be a bit too rosy in my opinion. Time will tell. At 2.4 billion dollars, Occidental‚Äôs project may or may not be a technical or financial success. But the anticipated removal of 810,000,000 metric tons of CO2 by 2035 from the atmosphere will not measurably change the global percentage of atmospheric CO2. I don‚Äôt know what the current price is but in 2022 the water plant I worked at paid $140.60 a ton for Liquid CO2. Unless the price has skyrocketed, $400 to $630 a metric ton doesn‚Äôt sound like a bargain. (Our supplier got the CO2 from ethanol production.) How does one generate a revenue from such a system without government funding? ‚ÄúPulling CO2 from ambient air‚Äîwhere it exists at a wispy 0.04%‚Äîis like trying to find a particular grain of sand on a beach‚Ä¶ using tweezers‚Ä¶ while blindfolded. It takes more energy to remove CO2 from the air than was released burning the fossil fuel in the first place.‚Äù Sounds thermodynamic. But as often, emphasis rather than quantitative. And wrong. The free energy difference between CO2 at 0.04% and 100% is RT*log(.0004)=8,3*290*log(.0004)=-18832 J/mol The heat of combustion of carbon is 393,500 J/mol. Are you talking about the heat of combustion of Carbon Dioxide molecules (CO2), or the heat of combustion of the Carbon (C) element here Nick? CO2 does not burn. It will burn with Fl2 or O3, won‚Äôt it? Yeah I get that ‚Äì fire extinguishers. but why mention anything about Carbon when the subject is Carbon Dioxide? The claim was ‚ÄúIt takes more energy to remove CO2 from the air than was released burning the fossil fuel in the first place.‚Äù OK, but the whole exercise was / is an idiotic pursuit in the first place, yes? And a flagrant waste of taxpayers‚Äô dough. Nick, I think you win the battle but not the war. It does take less energy to sequester carbon than is produced by burning fossil fuels. But it takes so much energy, e.g., as a parasitical load in a coal-burning power plant, that sequestration becomes uneconomical. That is how I understood the article. Here in West Virginia AEP did a pilot CO2 sequestration project a decade or so ago and found it just won‚Äôt work. Actually, it did work. But the Virginia utility regulators refused to put their share of the costs into the rate base (AEP serves western Virginia). They also refused to pay the for the engineering study for the new 240 MW demonstration project (the pilot was 20 MW). So AEP shut down the project and wiped all of the pilot equipment off the site. What does the free energy difference have to do with extracting the molecules from the atmosphere? It‚Äôs the ‚Äúbasic physics‚Äù that this WUWT article says people are allergic to, but which WUWT doesn‚Äôt seem to have any idea about. So, instead of answering a legitimate question you chose to go with insults. Nick, Your argument will not convince anyone that plucking CO2 molecules from the atmosphere is a great idea. You might better spend your time planting trees. Meanwhile, I have some to cut** and dry for next year‚Äôs firewood. Just keeping up with their growth, dying, and decay is exhausting ‚Äì ‚Äì growth is relentless. **when I‚Äôm not planting little ones Just responding to ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs be crystal clear: carbon capture is a thermodynamic clown show.‚Äù It is Gelles who can‚Äôt get the thermodynamics right. Confusion there ‚Äì it wasn‚Äôt Gelles (NYT), it was the WUWT writer. Your figures seem to assume that the removal process is 100% efficient. What is the actual energy consumption involved in the process? You are correct, Nick. 18.8 kJ/mol is much less than 393,500 J/mol. Billions have been invested wasted in technologies schemes to remove carbon dioxide from the sky in recent years. But Trump‚Äôs policies have clouded the outlook ended the farce. There, I fixed it. Very nice, more good news. If CO2 is removed from the air, CO2 will bubble out of all bodies of water, especially the cold polar oceans, to replace the captured CO2 molecules. What were the OXY chemical engineers thinking? Remove CO2 from the atmosphere, all other factors being equal, the oceans and earth will emit CO2 to replace it to maintain equilibrium of the partial pressure. Shoveling against the tide. Comedy is the wrong word. Tragedy is more appropriate. Direct Air Capture vs. a Leaf: Guess Which One Works Better This a loaded question. One works and one doesn‚Äôt. To my knowledge, no one has developed technology that has captured more carbon than was released in making the facility to capture the carbon. It is the same thing with wind turbines and solar panels. They do no more than shift the location where the carbon gets burnt. They do not reduce it. HOW? How could anybody be so stupid as to think such a scheme could work? How? Stupid? Maybe. Greedy? Definitely. Correction: ‚Äúcarbon is injected into wells to squeeze out even more oil‚Äù No. CO2 is injected. The Iceland plant did not extract even one gram of molecular carbon. It did manage a pissant amount of CO2. MIT researchers a while back came up with a very interesting process. Similar to photosynthesis, they passed are over a chemical element and in the presence of sunlight produced methane. I lost the link. Typo: they passed CO2 over a chemical element‚Ä¶. All of this nonsense is no different than Solyndra. It‚Äôs an unsophisticated money laundering operation where left wing politicians use taxpayer money to fund obviously non-viable projects coincidentally run by their friends. Eventually all the taxpayer money vanishes into the pockets of the politicians and their friends. There is no accountability or oversight, just a bunch of truly terrible people getting rich off the taxpayers. How much CO2 ‚Äúneeds‚Äù to be captured for ‚Äúcarbon capture‚Äù to work? What will be done with it? How much space will all that CO2 take up? Where will it be put? Some of this may have been addressed in posts I‚Äôve missed, but they‚Äôre questions I‚Äôve had for a while about this approach. Leaving aside whether it‚Äôs actually needed, it seems quite impractical to do at any scale that would make a difference globally. I lived in Iceland where the pictured scrubbers are. I find this very odd. They have geothermal heat everywhere. The Blue Lagoon is a tourist attraction driven by geothermal heat. If the scrubbers aren‚Äôt next to a volcano they are useless. I was lucky enough to visit Hekla when it erupted in the early 70‚Äôs. An awesome sight. There are lots of volcanoes that spew lots of CO2 in Iceland.

Title: Here's Where Traders Expect Adobe Stock To Go After Earnings

Design software developer Adobe (ADBE) is slated to report fiscal second-quarter earnings after the bell Thursday, and investors are expecting a relatively modest share movement to follow. Options pricing suggests traders anticipate Adobe stock to move about 6.6% in either direction the day after its earnings report. A move of that scale would lift shares to roughly $440, their highest level in three months, or drop them to about $386, a one-month low. Adobe shares slipped 0.8% to $412.84 on Wednesday. The stock is down about 7% since the start of the year. Adobe stock has registered an average post-earnings move of 12.6% over the past four quarters, and fell in three of those instances. A 6.6% gain or loss on Friday would represent the stock‚Äôs smallest post-earnings move since December 2023. In March, shares dropped nearly 14% the day after Adobe reported record quarterly revenue but issued an outlook that underwhelmed investors. In December, it was a similar story: a worse-than-expected forecast sent shares tumbling more than 13%. Most analysts are bullish on Adobe's long-term outlook. Of the 17 Adobe analysts tracked by Visible Alpha, 10 rate the stock a ‚Äúbuy,‚Äù six are neutral, and one rates it a ‚Äúsell.‚Äù The average price target of about $477 is more than 15% above the stock‚Äôs closing price on Wednesday. Morgan Stanley analysts earlier this week said investor concerns about Adobe's long-term competitiveness and generative AI opportunity should help Adobe "step over a low bar" when results come out Wednesday. The bank assigns the stock an "overweight" rating and an above-consensus price target of $510.

As part of the integration, all bridged USDC tokens on World Chain were automatically upgraded to the newly launched native USDC. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre excited to announce that native USDC and CCTP V2 are now live on World Chain,‚Äù the firm wrote in a blog about the announcement. ‚ÄúThis upgrade enhances liquidity, security, and capital efficiency for developers and users across the World Chain ecosystem.‚Äù The expansion now puts USDC, the second largest stablecoin, on 21 different blockchains, the announcement says. Circle stock (CRCL) is currently trading above $116, up more than 10% on the day and sitting at a price nearly four times its $31 IPO price. Listed on the Nasdaq, CRCL pumped as high as $138.57 on Monday. After hitting the public market last week, the stock was initially halted multiple times on its first day of trading, jumping to more than three times its IPO price in a matter of minutes. That debut exceeded the initial performance of major publicly traded tech companies like Meta, Robinhood, and Airbnb upon their respective listings. The IPO, which raised $1.1 billion for the firm and early shareholders, accelerates a trend of crypto companies going public. In May, trading platform eToro made its debut on public markets. Prior to that, Bitcoin rewards company Fold went public as well. Neither, though, saw as much success upon debut as shares of CRCL, which scored a major victory when compared to the initial listings of other crypto-focused companies, in terms of share price surge after offering. However, another prominent crypto firm may join the race soon, with New York-based exchange Gemini recently filing for its own IPO. Circle, now valued around $28.34 billion, sought to go public as early as 2022. But plans to go public via a merger with a SPAC fell through at the time.

Join 307,012+ Monthly Readers Join 307,012+ Monthly Readers We respect your privacy. Please refer to our full privacy policy. If you're new here, please click here to get my FREE 57-page investment banking recruiting guide - plus, get weekly updates so that you can break into investment banking. Thanks for visiting! The ‚Äútell me about a recent deal‚Äù question in finance interviews is designed to test your genuine interest in the industry. Anyone can copy/paste a ‚Äústory‚Äù based on one of our templates, and plenty of candidates are good at memorizing the technical questions. But it‚Äôs much harder to ‚Äúfake‚Äù your way into a solid deal discussion, especially in an in-person setting. Deal discussions are popular for the same reason that assessment centers are widely used in London: They‚Äôre a quick/cheap way to assess candidates and provide more accurate results than generic interview questions. If you are changing careers, you can expect to get this question a lot because it‚Äôs a great way to assess your motivations and commitment. Are you recruiting for investment banking roles to double your compensation? Or do you have a genuine interest in working on deals? Note that this guide is for discussing deals in the news, not deals you have worked on personally. Discussing your own deals is different, so please refer to the ‚Äúdeal sheet‚Äù article for more on that one. I‚Äôd summarize the importance of the ‚Äútell me about a recent deal‚Äù question as follows: If you‚Äôre in the ‚ÄúMost Important‚Äù category, it‚Äôs worth spending a few hours preparing a solid deal discussion. If you‚Äôre in one of the other categories, spend less time on it and stay focused on your story and answers to the normal fit and technical questions. I‚Äôll suggest these qualities for any deal you discuss: If you have Capital IQ or FactSet, you can screen transactions based on these criteria and click through to the results to find the description and documents for each deal: If you cannot access these services, you must rely on simple online searches and deal summaries from other sources. There are plenty of finance newsletters from sources/people like Axios, Litquidity, etc., so you can certainly subscribe to one of those and pick a deal listed there. But there are also plenty of lesser-known-but-still-useful sources. As a specific example, the Bocconi Students M&A Circle has write-ups and analysis of deals each year, so that could be a starting point. Another example is that many boutique banks issue market and M&A reports with recent transaction activity and even public comps for the sector. The best reports I‚Äôve seen come from Capstone Partners, which publishes detailed ‚Äúindustry insights‚Äù for the most popular industries. These reports are all free and require no login or even an email sign-up. For example, if you go to Capstone‚Äôs Food & Beverage M&A report, you can find ‚Äúnotable M&A transactions by subsector‚Äù on page 8 of the PDF: They won‚Äôt necessarily give the multiples for these deals, but once you have a few names, you can do some quick searches to find the financials. For an M&A deal, you can search for the following information: If you go against my advice and discuss an equity or debt deal instead, you‚Äôd have to search for documents like the S-1 for an IPO or a credit rating update issued by the credit rating agencies. To say anything about the valuation, you‚Äôd have to use sites like FinViz or BeyondSPX to look up multiples for other companies in the sector (or hope the Capstone reports cover it). I recommend against discussing these deals because of the extra time and effort required. Continuing with the food & beverage industry, I‚Äôll use Celsius‚Äô $1.8 billion acquisition of Alani Nu, announced in February 2025, as an example. There is no Fairness Opinion because Alani Nu was private, but there are shorter and longer investor presentations: The quality of Substack articles varies widely, but it‚Äôs always worth searching the site for commentary on specific deals: The details in these posts are not always correct, but you can sometimes use them to stand out in interviews by bringing up more interesting talking points. It‚Äôs not like reading the WSJ or FT, where the articles recycle the same points repeatedly (usually from the company‚Äôs PR department). You should read enough of the source material to outline the following points: Here‚Äôs a sample outline for this Celsius / Alani Nu deal: This is a lengthy outline (over 250 words), so it might be too long for your initial answer. A shorter, ~100-word version might be a better ‚Äúfirst response‚Äù in this case: ‚ÄúOne recent deal I followed was Celsius‚Äô $1.8 billion acquisition of Alani Nu in the energy drink and supplement space. Celsius had weak recent sales growth and did the deal to return to growth and gain more distribution, but the unadjusted multiple was 21x EBITDA, which is very high for this vertical; adjusted for synergies and tax benefits, it was more like 12x. I still think it‚Äôs quite an expensive deal in a difficult market, and it might reduce Celsius‚Äô ability to do future deals since it also issued $900 million in Debt to fund it.‚Äù When you present your short deal outline, the discussion could go in different directions. If the banker is satisfied and wants to ask about other topics, they might switch to other questions. But if they want to dig deeper or test your knowledge, they might ask follow-up questions to see how much you know. All you can do to ‚Äúprepare‚Äù for these questions is read more of the source material and sketch answers to a few common follow-ups. Common questions include: This information takes more time to find, so budget your time based on the importance of this question (not important for university students, but more important for MBA/experienced hires). Since we first covered deal discussions on this site, a flood of AI tools, chatbots, and AI-powered search engines have been released. Many of these tools claim to ‚Äúdo all the work for you.‚Äù So, you might look at this guide and think: ‚ÄúThis seems like a lot of work. Can‚Äôt I just ask ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, or Grok to do everything? Then I can memorize the answers.‚Äù The short answer is that you can use these tools to speed up your research/prep process, but you should never rely on them 100%. There are several specific problems: The last point is so important that I recommend using pencil and paper to draft deal outlines and even responses to fit/behavioral questions. Yes, it‚Äôs 2025, and I am still recommending a stone-age method because it‚Äôs still the best way to make details ‚Äústick‚Äù for in-person interviews. I mentioned in the introduction that the ‚Äútell me about a decent deal‚Äù question is designed to test your interest and commitment to investment banking, especially for career changers. But it‚Äôs also a great example of why banks are old-school and will always conduct in-person interviews, even if the initial rounds are done via HireVue. You could cheat your way through entire interviews if they‚Äôre all remote. And even when you go in for an in-person Superday, it‚Äôs still possible to ‚Äúgame‚Äù standard interview questions with enough memorization. But it‚Äôs very difficult to get through an extended deal discussion if you haven‚Äôt done the work or don‚Äôt understand the metrics and rationale. So, expect this question to become even more important in the future. Just hope the shift happens before banks shift even more of their workload to bots and agents‚Ä¶ Brian DeChesare is the Founder of Mergers & Inquisitions and Breaking Into Wall Street.

Title: Allison Transmission: Heavy-Duty Profits And Low Expectations

Time Published: 2025-06-11T14:20:10Z

ByDavid Trainer ByDavid Trainer, Contributor. Blue bus moving on the road in city in early morning I first made Allison Transmission (ALSN) a Long Idea in June 2020 and most recently reiterated my thesis in August 2024. After the company beat on the bottom-line but missed top-line 1Q25 estimates, my thesis remains intact, and the stock looks poised to outperform further. Allison Transmission runs a well-diversified business, in terms of its revenue-generating segments and customer base. Per Figure 1, in the TTM ended 1Q25, the company‚Äôs revenue came from: Further breaking down the largest segment, 30% to 40% of Allison Transmission‚Äôs North America on-highway revenue is driven by municipal spending, which the company notes reduces end-market volatility. Figure 1: Allison Transmission‚Äôs Revenue by Segment in the TTM ended 1Q25 ALSN Business Segments Allison Transmission holds majority market share in its core addressable market (which includes class 4 through 8 vehicles) within its North America on-highway segment. For example, as of 2024, the company holds a market share of: The North American production in Allison Transmission‚Äôs core addressable market is projected to grow 1% compounded annually through 2030. See Figure 2. With its strong expertise, product development, service network, trusted brand name, and leading market share, Allison Transmission is poised to grow alongside the broader industry. Figure 2: North American Production in Allison‚Äôs Core Addressable Market: 2014 ‚Äì 2030E ALSN Projected NA Growth In its 1Q25 presentation, Allison Transmission‚Äôs management highlighted four different opportunities that it expected will each generate an additional $100 million incremental annual revenue. These opportunities are in four separate end markets and include: As noted, these opportunities combine to create a potential total $400 million in incremental annual revenue. Allison Transmission is in a great spot to capitalize on the transition to electric vehicles and parts. As noted in my previous report, the company has already demonstrated the viability and success of its electric product offerings, with significant growth opportunities still ahead. While Allison Transmission offers multiple electric/hybrid products, its electric hybrid propulsion system for buses stands out the most. To date, the company has delivered nearly 9,800 of these systems for buses worldwide, which has resulted in an estimated savings of 457 million gallons of fuel and 3.9 billion miles of reliable operation. Since its introduction in 2003, this product line has generated over $1.5 billion in revenue. Additionally, the global electric bus market is projected to grow 14% compounded annually, from 2024 to 2030. Figure 3: Global Electric Bus Market Forecast: 2024 ‚Äì 2030 ALSN Electric Bus Market Forecast The company also continues to produce zero-emission electric axles for medium- and heavy-duty commercial vehicles, which provide a ‚Äúcontent per vehicle‚Äù opportunity that is three times higher compared to a fully automatic transmission. Allison Transmission‚Äôs newest electric product offering is an electric hybrid propulsion system for tracked combat vehicles. The transmission will allow electric hybrid propulsion and electric-only silent maneuverability. Allison will provide American Rheinmetall the next-gen electrified transmission for its Lynx vehicle, which is competing for the U.S. Army‚Äôs XM30 combat vehicle program. This program is a ground modernization initiative that could replace nearly 4,000 infantry fighting vehicles. Allison Transmission has a long track record of quality fundamentals. The company has grown revenue and net operating profit after-tax (NOPAT) by 4% and 9% compounded annually since 2014. The company‚Äôs profit growth has been particularly strong since the COVID induced lows of 2020. See Figure 4. The company improved its NOPAT margin from 15% in 2014 to 25% in the TTM while invested capital turns rose from 0.5 to 0.8 over the same time. Rising NOPAT margins and invested capital turns drive return on invested capital (ROIC) from 8% in 2014 to 19% in the TTM. Additionally, the company‚Äôs Core Earnings, a superior and cleaner earnings measure, grew 12% compounded annually from $240 million in 2014 to $745 million in the TTM. Figure 4: Allison Transmission‚Äôs Revenue and NOPAT: 2014 ‚Äì TTM ALSN Revenue & NOPAT 2014-TTM Since 2019, Allison Transmission has paid $506 million (6% of market cap) in cumulative dividends and has increased its quarterly dividends from $0.15/share in 1Q19 to $0.27/share in 1Q25. The company‚Äôs current dividend, when annualized, provides a 1.0% yield. Allison Transmission also returns capital to shareholders through share repurchases. During the first three months of 2025, the company repurchased $150 million worth of shares. In 2024, Allison Transmission repurchased $254 million in shares. The company has $1.4 billion authorized repurchases remaining under its current authorization. Should the company repurchase shares at the 1Q25 pace for the rest of the year, it would buy back $600 million of shares in 2025 and provide a 6.9% repurchase yield. When combined, the dividend and share repurchase yield could reach 7.9%. Even if the company only repurchases shares at its 2024 pace, it would repurchase an additional $104 million of shares in 2025, which would represent 1.2% of the company‚Äôs current market cap. Allison Transmission has generated positive free cash flow (FCF) every year since 2013 (earliest data available). Investors should take comfort in knowing Allison Transmission will be able to afford to pay its dividends and repurchase shares due to its large FCF generation. From 2019 through 1Q25, Allison Transmission generated $3.4 billion in FCF, which equals 31% of the company‚Äôs enterprise value. Figure 5: Allison Transmission‚Äôs Cumulative Free Cash Flow: 2019 ‚Äì 1Q25 ALSN Free Cash Flow 2019-1Q25 Allison Transmission‚Äôs $3.4 billion FCF since 2019 is more than enough to cover its $2.6 billion in combined dividend payments ($506 million) and share repurchases ($2.1 billion). Unlike many other riskier stocks, Allison Transmission‚Äôs repurchases have also meaningfully reduced its shares outstanding from 118 million in 2019 to 84 million in 1Q25. See Figure 6. In its 1Q25 investor presentation, the company pointed out it has repurchased nearly 64% of shares outstanding since its IPO. I like companies that choose to return capital to shareholders instead of spending it on costly acquisitions or executive bonuses that rarely drive shareholder value creation. Figure 6: Allison Transmission‚Äôs Shares Outstanding: 2019 ‚Äì 1Q25 ALSN Shares Outstanding 2019 - 1Q25 Allison Transmission is not only the leading manufacturer of fully automatic transmissions for the on-highway, medium- and heavy-duty commercial vehicle market in North America, it also has the highest profit margins in the industry. Over the TTM, Allison Transmission has the highest NOPAT margin and third-highest ROIC among competitors, which include Caterpillar (CAT), Dana (DAN), Cummins (CMI), and more. See Figure 7. Figure 7: Allison Transmission‚Äôs Profitability Vs. Peers: TTM ALSN Profitability vs Peers While Allison Transmission‚Äôs markets are projected to grow over the long term, the cyclical nature of each industry cannot be avoided. Allison Transmission notes specifically in its 1Q25 earnings presentation that its mining and construction market has ‚Äúconsiderable end market cyclicality‚Äù even as the company believes there will be less cyclicality in its energy segment. I show the cyclicality in production in its largest segment, North America, in Figure 2. After four straight years of production growth, production is expected to decline YoY in 2025, then fluctuate significantly through in 2026 ‚Äì 2027, before rising once again through 2030. By diversifying its end markets, Allison Transmission can minimize cyclicality on the overall business. When one segment is in a trough, another can be peaking, thereby allowing the company to generate positive cash flow throughout all economic cycles. The good news for investors, despite a consistent track record of profitability and long-term growth drivers, Allison Transmission‚Äôs stock is priced as if the company‚Äôs profits will never grow again, as I‚Äôll show below. At its current price of $105/share, ALSN has a price-to-economic book value (PEBV) ratio of 1.0. This ratio means the market expects the company‚Äôs profits to never grow from TTM levels. For context, Allison Transmission has grown NOPAT by 4% compounded annually over the last five years and 9% compounded annually over the last ten years. Below, I use my reverse discounted cash flow (DCF) model to quantify the cash flow expectations for different stock price scenarios for ALSN. In the first scenario, I quantify the expectations baked into the current price. If I assume: then the stock would be worth $105/share today ‚Äì or equal to the current stock price. In this scenario, Allison Transmission‚Äôs NOPAT would grow <1% through 2034, which is far below historical growth rates. If I instead assume Allison Transmission‚Äôs: ALSN would be worth at least $129/share today ‚Äì a 23% upside to the current price. In this scenario, Allison Transmission‚Äôs NOPAT would grow just 2% compounded annually through 2034. Should ALSN grow profits more in line with historical levels, the stock has even more upside. Figure 8 compares ALSN‚Äôs historical NOPAT to the NOPAT implied in each of the above DCF scenarios.

Title: What‚Äôs Driving AMZN Stock Higher?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Brick facade of Amazon office building with logo, San Francisco, California, May 27, 2025. (Photo by ... More Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images) Over the last year, Amazon stock (NASDAQ: AMZN) has appreciated 16%, closely mirroring the NASDAQ‚Äôs 14% increase. This year has been rather tumultuous for Amazon stock. After reaching peaks above $240 in January, the stock decreased by over 30% to just below $170 by April. This drop was mainly influenced by President Trump‚Äôs vigorous trade policies. Yet, as trade tensions subdued, the stock rebounded 30% from its lowest point. When examining a slightly extended timeframe, AMZN stock has surged 43% since the start of 2024. This notable growth can largely be credited to three major factors: We‚Äôll explore these factors in greater detail. Our dashboard on Why Amazon Stock Moved contains more information. While AMZN stock has seen impressive gains, if you desire growth with a less volatile experience than that of a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has surpassed the S&P, achieving >91% returns since inception. Additionally, check out ‚Äì QBTS Stock: What‚Äôs Next For D-Wave After 1,350% Rally? Amazon‚Äôs revenue growth of 13% since 2023 arises from robust long-term trends in e-commerce, streaming, and digital advertising. While sales in North America climbed by 10% and international sales rose by 9% last year, Amazon Web Services (AWS) served as the main growth driver, soaring by 19%. This underscores the effectiveness of Amazon‚Äôs strategic diversification, with AWS emerging as an exceptionally valuable segment. Looking forward, AWS will remain vital for Amazon‚Äôs expansion, although the company faces growing competition in cloud computing from Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. Microsoft‚Äôs strong collaboration with OpenAI and substantial investments in AI, combined with Google‚Äôs rapid growth in generative AI cloud services, present significant obstacles. To preserve its market leadership in this dynamic tech environment, Amazon must continue to innovate. Like its rivals, Amazon is allocating tens of billions to AI-related capital projects. AWS has significantly enhanced Amazon‚Äôs financial outcomes, primarily by increasing its overall profitability. Since 2023, Amazon‚Äôs operating margin has expanded dramatically by 72%, increasing from 6.4% to 11.0%. This improved profitability, alongside strong sales growth and AWS‚Äôs strategic development, has favorably altered investor perception. As a result, the company‚Äôs price-to-sales (P/S) valuation multiple has grown by 30%, from 2.8x trailing revenues in 2023 to the current 3.6x. At its current trading price of $217, Amazon‚Äôs stock is priced at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3.6x, which is closely aligned with its five-year average of 3.2x. Nevertheless, there are strong reasons to anticipate that the valuation multiple could increase further. Amazon‚Äôs strategic investments in AI are expected to drive significant expansion across its various business segments. Within AWS, heightened demand from businesses developing and utilizing AI applications is projected to directly benefit cloud infrastructure sales. Concurrently, AI is set to improve Amazon‚Äôs retail functions through enhanced product recommendations, search, and personalized shopping experiences. These developments could result in higher conversion rates, increased average order values, and more effective ad targeting both on its platform and within the broader digital advertising ecosystem. As a result, Amazon anticipates low double-digit sales growth over the next three years, with even more notable increases in bottom-line growth expected. This enhanced profitability, in conjunction with ongoing AWS expansion and Amazon‚Äôs continued dominance in the e-commerce sector, supports a strong case for a higher valuation multiple. Investors are likely to view these strategic AI initiatives as essential catalysts for future growth and value generation. Amazon stock is not without its risks. During the inflation-driven market downturn in 2022, AMZN fell 52%, dropping from a January peak of $170.40 to $81.82 by December. This decline far exceeded the S&P 500‚Äôs 25.4% drop. AMZN did not return to its previous high until February 2024, highlighting both its volatility and resilience. Earlier this year, a similar pattern was observed amid trade war anxieties, where the stock dropped 30%, compared to a 19% peak-to-trough decline for the S&P 500. In addition to broader market and geopolitical challenges, there are company-specific risks associated with Amazon‚Äôs substantial capital expenditures. Since 2023, Amazon has poured an astounding $161 billion into CapEx. A critical question remains: what if these considerable investments fail to deliver the anticipated returns? Indeed, financial risk is just a minor facet of the risk assessment framework we utilize while creating the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio. This portfolio encompasses 30 stocks and has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 over the past four years. What accounts for this? As a whole, HQ Portfolio stocks have generated superior returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; offering a smoother ride, as illustrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. While AMZN stock appears poised for further appreciation, it is valuable to assess how Amazon‚Äôs Peers perform on key metrics. Additionally, you will find other useful comparisons for companies across different industries at Peer Comparisons.

Title: They made Balatro for stock trading and I fear I may never write another article ever again

All my cards. Gone. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here‚Äôs how it works. There's something alluring about high finance, isn't there? Mostly, I suppose, it's the promise of generating absolutely enormous amounts of money for very little actual work, but it's undeniable that the industry‚Äîsuch as it is‚Äîhas gone out of its way to cloak itself in a certain mystique. The suits, the jargon, the barking into telephones in smoke-filled rooms: what is ultimately just a building full of boys who did boring degrees and have too much money sure does manage to make itself appealing and mysterious, like they were a cabal of sorcerers or something. All this is to explain why I continue to find myself suckered into any and every game that lets me pretend to be one of these masters of the universe, like the excellent Stonks-9800 and, now, the Steam Next Fest demo for Insider Trading. Much like its namesake, Insider Trading is fun, profitable, and victimless, and I strongly recommend you give it a try. Because it's Balatro. Someone went and made Balatro but stock trading and, friends, I fear for my ability to get anything done ever again. This is a roguelike deckbuilder (as are most games in 2025) with a wobbly, warbly, CRT-style interface that sees you assemble absurd multipliers out of painstakingly composed hands of cards, all while using a meta-currency to amass perks that change the flow of the game, cut away at or add cards to your deck, and to optimise your hand. It's not poker-themed, though. Where Balatro had you assemble real-life poker hands to generate your score, Insider Trading just pulls 10 cards from your deck and triggers them in whatever order you leave them in your hand. The goal is to amass enough money (points) to hit a certain target by the end of a week: $1,200 by Friday, $2,000 by next Friday, that kind of thing. At the start of a turn you can either skip‚Äîif you think things will go badly‚Äîor trade, at which point you'll buy the maximum number of stocks you can with whatever cash you have and wait for your assembled hand to affect the stock price. Assuming you did your maths right, you'll sell off those stocks for more money than you started with. Though, hopefully you won't increase the stock price to something higher than you can afford. It starts off simple enough. You might pull six cards that increase the stock price by anywhere from 1% to 5% each, and another four that decrease it by the same amount, but things quickly get weirder. For instance: This card will add or subtract 10% to the price only if it's played first, this card will delete other cards of a certain suit if you place it adjacent to them, this card will buff other suits by 1.5x each time it's triggered. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. I made full use of that last one. Every time I amassed enough tokens to buy a new perk, I stacked on another 'trigger your first card three times' and let it ride, amassing enough of them to trigger my first card 12x every turn and almost obviating the entire rest of my hand. It worked out pretty well, right up until I triggered an event based around shorting, where suddenly it became necessary to decrease the price rather than increase it to make money. It rather made me and my deck composed entirely around buffing the price up a little bit redundant, and I quickly found myself reduced to penury as my fortune. Sound good? Of course it does. So I definitely recommend checking out Insider Trading's demo while you have a chance. Also, you'll always have a chance, because although its demo is featured in Steam Next Fest, it's not a Next Fest-exclusive demo. I wouldn't dally though, the market waits for no one. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together One of Josh's first memories is of playing Quake 2 on the family computer when he was much too young to be doing that, and he's been irreparably game-brained ever since.

Quantum computing shares are jumping in premarket trading Wednesday after Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang said that the industry is ‚Äúreaching an inflection point." Huang's comments during his keynote speech at the chipmaker‚Äôs GTC Paris developer conference mark more optimistic take by the Nvidia CEO, who said early this year that quantum computing technology is 15 to 30 years away. ‚ÄúQuantum computing is reaching an inflection point,‚Äù Huang said in the speech Wednesday. ‚ÄúWe are within reach of being able to apply quantum computing, quantum classical computing, in areas that can solve some interesting problems in the coming years.‚Äù Quantum computing involves qubits, which can exist in a multidimensional state, unlike a normal computer bit that can be in one state (either 0 or 1), making them capable of much more powerful computations than ordinary computers. Shares in Quantum Computing (QUBT) are jumping more than 14% in premarket trading, Rigetti (RGTI) shares are up 7%, and D-Wave Quantum (QBTS) shares are rising 4%. Shares in quantum computing firm IonQ (IONQ), which announced the acquisition of a U.K. rival Monday and has a collaboration with Nvidia, are up 5%. IBM (IBM) shares, which hit an all-time high Tuesday after it showcased a "viable path" to building the world‚Äôs first large-scale, "fault-tolerant" quantum computer by the end of the decade, are little changed in premarket trading.

AI.gov site was discovered by researchers When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here‚Äôs how it works. An apparently leaked GitHub page has revealed the Trump administration is working on a website called ai.gov, set to launch on July 4 with the aim of trying to, ‚Äúaccelerate government innovation with AI‚Äù The site was uncovered by 404Media researchers after an early version of the website was posted on GitHub by the General Services Administration (GSA), The Register reports. Now taken down, the page was aimed at serving as a hub for government agencies to enable AI integration into their processes. The GSA department responsible for the website looks to be the Technology Transformation Service (TTS). Headed up by Thomas Shedd, a close associate of Elon Musk, the TTS will seemingly launch the AI website with three key components; a chatbot, an ‚Äúall-in-one‚Äù API that enables connections between existing systems and AI models from Anthropic, Google, or OpenAI, and ‚ÄòCONSOLE‚Äô - a "groundbreaking tool to analyze agency-wide implementation," according to the page. The initial staging site suggests that the ai.gov site will serve AI models through Amazon Bedrock, and most of the models listed in the API documentation on the GitHub page are FedRAMP certified for government usage, the researchers confirmed. However, they note that one model identified and listed from AI firm Cohere is not FedRamp certified. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! The fact the US government is planning to leverage AI or increase its connections with AI companies probably won‚Äôt come as much of a surprise to anyone - with the Trump administration pushing hard for widespread government adoption. Earlier in 2025 it was announced that the IRS could use AI to replace fired workers following mass layoffs at the hands of Elon Musk‚Äôs Department of Government Efficiency. Other departments like the SEC and VA are reportedly bracing for ‚Äòrestructuring‚Äô as the department investigated whether AI can be used to replace human workers across a range of government departments.

I‚Äôm HBR executive editor Alison Beard filling in for Hannah Bates. This month, we‚Äôre highlighting some of the best conversations from the 2025 HBR Leadership Summit held in April. In today‚Äôs episode, we hear from David Risher, the CEO of Lyft. Since taking the wheel in 2023, figuratively and literally, Risher has led the company through a bold transformation‚Äîfocusing on customer obsession, technological innovation, and a renewed commitment to drivers and riders alike. Lyft recently reached record bookings and a 31% increase in annual revenue and its first full year of profitability. In this conversation with me, Risher shares how his own experience behind the wheel as a Lyft driver informs product innovation. And why listening deeply‚Äîwhether to a single passenger or a room of drivers‚Äîcan lead to breakthrough ideas. He also opens up about navigating layoffs, launching inclusive features, and preparing for an autonomous future while keeping human dignity front and center. If you care about service, leadership, or what it takes to revive a brand in a hyper-competitive space, this episode is for you. Here it is. ALISON BEARD: I want to hear how Lyft evaluates and anticipates what customers want and need. Is it analytic surveys, focus groups, all of the above? DAVID RISHER: It‚Äôs kind of all of the above, but in maybe a different order. So I would actually say analytics are the least important, and I‚Äôm going to tell you why in a second. The most important, for sure, is lived experience. So we‚Äôre really lucky. Lyft gives two million rides a day, obviously a huge volume, 800 million rides a year. And every one of us‚Äì we have 3,000 people who work for us. Every one of us can be a rider or a driver. And I actually am a huge, huge believer in lived experiences, one of the best ways to‚Äì because then you‚Äôre literally putting yourself in the driver‚Äôs seat or in the passenger seat. You don‚Äôt even have to imagine it. We also do round tables pretty often with drivers in particular where we‚Äôll bring groups of drivers together. I‚Äôve done them in New York. I‚Äôve done them in DC, in Boston, in Seattle, here in San Francisco because people‚Äôs interests vary a little bit in different parts of the country, so for sure. Social media is also really important. Of course, you have to filter things out a little bit, but there is a lot of wisdom out there if you can see through the noise and through some of the frustration and extreme stuff that you get. I get email every day and texts all the time from friends and from random people who find my email address online. And so it‚Äôs all that. And then analytics is‚Äì the reason I say it‚Äôs the least important is because it‚Äôs so tempting, I think, to sit at your desk and look at the numbers. And while you can use that to size opportunities and maybe prioritize, but you very rarely get the real insight that leads to the breakthrough just by looking at the analytics. ALISON BEARD: I know that you‚Äôve done some Lyft-driving yourself, so is that standard process for all managers so you can better understand the situation on the ground? DAVID RISHER: Yeah, I‚Äôd like to say that it is. This sounds maybe a little braggy, but I think I‚Äôve driven more than‚Äì I think this is true‚Äì than just about anyone else at the company. So we have 1.5 million drivers on the platform. They‚Äôre all independent contractors. But in terms of Lyft employees, I might be the first. I‚Äôm not sure. I drive about every six weeks, and I never tell people when I‚Äôm going to do it. I don‚Äôt tell the social media team or anything like that. I do post about it afterwards just with the pictures and experiences I‚Äôve had, and you can see that on LinkedIn. But I take it really seriously, really seriously. And I listen very carefully. I ask, tell me why you chose Lyft today, and also very interested in other things going on in people‚Äôs lives. I‚Äôve had these great conversations with people who, for example‚Äì I‚Äôll give you an example. So I picked a woman‚Äì I live in San Francisco. I picked a woman up‚Äì this was last year‚Äì in Sausalito. And I said, why did you choose Lyft? And she said, well, look, every day I wake up in the morning at, like, 6 or 7 o‚Äôclock in the morning. And I said, why? And she said, well, to check the pricing because sometimes it‚Äôs $20. Sometimes it‚Äôs $30. Sometimes it‚Äôs $40. And it kind of drives me crazy because when it‚Äôs $40, that‚Äôs too expensive for me, but when it‚Äôs $20, I‚Äôll take it. $30, maybe I‚Äôll check the competition. But today is a colleague‚Äôs birthday, and so I really wanted to be there. So I was so glad that it was inexpensive. So just that conversation really got me understanding how frustrating what‚Äôs called surge pricing is to people. And I can tell you all about this, but we have a feature called Price Lock that really tries to get rid of it. And it was really developed or it was catalyzed because of that conversation I had with her. ALISON BEARD: So when you get these new ideas for features or services, how do you make a decision about which will be worthwhile and value-creating to pursue? And then how quickly can you move to execution? DAVID RISHER: So two very different questions. The answer to the second is it‚Äôs never quickly enough, so this is a source of constant‚Äì it turns out, as a CEO, you can have all sorts of ideas about how fast things can go, and then just brutal reality gets in your way. I‚Äôll come back to that in a second. The prioritization is‚Äì so we have a pretty rigorous process because, again, of course, there are always more ideas than you can possibly do. And so broadly, broadly speaking, we‚Äôre always‚Äì OK, Lyft‚Äôs business model, very simply, is the more people we have taking rides, the better we do. It‚Äôs kind of that simple. If our fixed costs are more or less fixed, which they are, then the incremental contribution of every ride‚Äì it might be $1, or it might be $2, might be $3, whatever it is‚Äì is a certain number. And the more of those we can drive across the platform, the more money we make. We‚Äôre now profitable, as you said in your introduction. We spun off about $760 million in cash over the last 12 months. That was up from negative $300 million the year before. So once you really understand the basics of the business model, everything else is just execution. And so that helps you understand then how you evaluate new ideas is, can it‚Äì is the product market fit‚Äì is the potential for product market fit so good that it could potentially drive hundreds of thousands or millions of more rides on the platform? Now, the economics of them might be different. So for example, with Price Lock, it‚Äôs actually a subscription product. You pay $2.99 a month, and then you lock in a price, a cheap price so it doesn‚Äôt bounce around. And then we have to do a lot of math to try to figure out whether we can make money on that or not. So you then have to figure out whether you can do it profitably. But the first question is, is it compelling? Is it interesting? Can it touch either, I‚Äôll say‚Äì let‚Äôs call it millions of people. Or is it something that maybe a smaller group of people care about, but they care about it so much that the impact is outsized? And I think those are two different cases, but they both come up. And I‚Äôll give you just very quickly an example of the latter. This actually came out of another‚Äì I mentioned this idea of driver roundtables. We were talking to about 12 different people. This is in New York City. And we were talking about things that they like about the platform and things they don‚Äôt, and one of the women said almost offhand‚Äì she said, you know, I have a tough time taking breaks to go to the bathroom. And I said, why? And she said, well, some bathrooms‚Äì they feel unsafe, or they‚Äôre dirty, or whatever. And then she said, the thing that struck with me‚Äì that stuck with me the most. She said, and I can‚Äôt just pull out a bottle and pee in it. It‚Äôs like, OK, that‚Äôs a good point. And so we developed as a result of that and some other things we‚Äôre doing something called a restroom finder now that allows drivers to indicate where there are safe restrooms and easy-to-access restrooms and maybe what the restroom code is. So anyway, so it might only affect a‚Äì it affects all drivers at some point, but it probably only affects a small number of drivers in a deep way. But for those drivers, it‚Äôs really important. ALISON BEARD: I love that example because it illustrates how you have customers that are riders, but then your drivers are also your customers. So you have to be equally obsessed with their experience. DAVID RISHER: That‚Äôs right. ALISON BEARD: So talk about that execution piece. And sorry for jamming two questions together, but when you decide that that‚Äôs a great thing to implement, the restroom finder, how do you ensure that your teams can get it out there quickly enough that it makes an impact? DAVID RISHER: Yeah, so it‚Äôs such a‚Äì it‚Äôs a simple question, and there are multitudes within it because of course you have an annual plan that you‚Äôve done. You have certain themes you really want to work through over the course of the year. So as an example, one of the themes we‚Äôve been working on for quite a long time is, how can we increase driver earnings? How can we increase driver earnings? As you say, there are two customers in every car. The rider has a certain price that they‚Äôre willing to pay. The driver has a certain price that they‚Äôre willing to accept. And we have to figure out how to make those lines cross millions of times every single day. Drivers get very frustrated if they feel that they‚Äôre not getting rides that meet a certain threshold for them. In some cases, there‚Äôs work we can do at the user interface level to help a driver see how much they‚Äôre going to make. This is something we‚Äôve done a lot of work on to make it very clear every time they accept a ride how much money they can expect to make on that on a per-hour basis so it‚Äôs easy for them to compare. But we‚Äôve also put in minimum standards. So we used to have no minimum. Now we have a 70% earnings guarantee. That means that at the end of every week a rider will always get‚Äì excuse me, a driver will always get at least 70% of what riders pay after insurance and some other fees are taken out. And that‚Äôs been a game-changer, very expensive‚Äì it costs us millions of dollars to do‚Äì very technically complex. And so it took us months and months of work to do. This was last year. But because it fit in a thematic piece that we‚Äôd already put out for ourselves over the year, how can we increase driver earnings, we had space for it. So it was a lot of work, but it was kind of straightforward. The trickier ones are ideas that come along the way that you hadn‚Äôt necessarily anticipated, or you realize, we‚Äôre kind of missing the boat here, or whatever it is. And then, frankly, it‚Äôs a lot of my job as CEO‚Äì you think of it as an allocation question. Like, how do I reallocate resources periodically in a way that focuses on a combination of what we thought was important at the beginning of the year and what we think is important now without being so disruptive? I know that‚Äôs of a generic answer, but it‚Äôs the way it goes. ALISON BEARD: No, I think that‚Äôs useful. So I‚Äôm on the same note, when you discover that there are problems, how do you fix them? I hear you have something called Falcon Mode. DAVID RISHER: I do. [CHUCKLES] I do. I do. Yeah, I do. So Falcon Mode refers to the idea that‚Äì so Falcons are unbelievable animals. And I‚Äôm not a falconer, by the way. I don‚Äôt know that much about them. But what I do know is that they can fly at very, very high altitude for a very long period of time. But then they get hungry, and so they‚Äôve got to dive. And they got to dive 2,000 feet or whatever it is and then pick a fish out of the ocean or whatever it is they actually eat. As I say, I‚Äôm not really a falconer. So as a metaphor, I use it sometimes to help people understand, there are going to be times where even I at the level that I operate need to go deep, and I need to go deep fast. I need to understand some problem at some level of detail so that I‚Äôm assured myself that I‚Äôm making good calls on whether or not to put energy over here or energy over here or what have you. Now, the problem, of course, is that generally people who work for you don‚Äôt like this very much. [CHUCKLES] And there‚Äôs this word, ‚Äúmicromanagement,‚Äù that comes up from time to time. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm that person, but maybe some people have a different opinion. But my point is I‚Äôm not trying to solve necessarily the problem. That‚Äôs generally not my job. But I do believe that sometimes you have to go very deep to understand the problem and to hang out in that problem space for a while and really get it. So let‚Äôs go back to driver earnings for a second. It‚Äôs very easy to detect that drivers want to be paid more like anyone who‚Äôs doing a job. That‚Äôs not complicated. The question becomes then, how do you do it in an economic way? But I think what becomes more interesting is, well, hold on. What else are drivers telling us about their goals and their life besides the obvious, besides the loud thing, which is earnings? And one of the things that we know is that‚Äì so the vast majority of people who drive on the Lyft platform do it part time. They‚Äôll do it 20 hours a week or less. Often it‚Äôs supplemental income. Sometimes it‚Äôs a bridge. They‚Äôve just lost their job, and they need to earn quick money, whatever it is. But it‚Äôs always‚Äì most of the time‚Äì let‚Äôs call this 85% of the time‚Äì it‚Äôs part of a bigger plan. Call it 15% of the time a person might want to be a professional driver. 85% it‚Äôs a bigger plan. So how can we support them? How can we‚Äì how can we support them in a way that‚Äôs going to be economically good for us? So we put together this thing called the driver accomplishment letter, which allows the driver to push a button and get a readout of their accomplishments, an AI-generated readout so they can use that, for example, as a reference letter for another service-oriented job. That‚Äôs an example‚Äì sorry for going on at some length with this, but that‚Äôs an example of moving beyond the transactional and the obvious stuff and trying to understand deeply enough, what do drivers really care about? Not just making more money but setting themselves up for maybe longer-term financial success in a way that if you don‚Äôt do those social media readings or focus-groupy-type things‚Äì you might not get to. But once you get there, you realize, oh, yeah, this really matters too. ALISON BEARD: Yeah. So in your recent shareholder letter, you recently wrote about a different kind of problem. You have a term for it that I‚Äôll let you share yourself. But it‚Äôs basically the slow degradation of a product, of a service that happens over such a long period of time that you‚Äôre not really aware of it, until the problem is so bad that it‚Äôs more difficult to fix. So how do you protect against that? DAVID RISHER: Yeah, so I think you‚Äôre referring to enshittification. I appreciate your‚Äì [CHUCKLES] I understand. I wrote this letter myself, but of course I have other people who look at it. And I got a lot of‚Äì some pushback on the term. But I said, look, this is it‚Äôs first of all, it‚Äôs not mine. It‚Äôs Cory Doctorow‚Äôs term. You might know him. He‚Äôs an author and a thinker. And one of the things that he recognized some period of time ago is that ideas and businesses, let‚Äôs say‚Äì they start often with a high-quality, high-bar mode but then over time tend to get worse. And you can see this even within rideshare. Rideshare, for those of you who‚Äôve been paying attention for, let‚Äôs say, the last decade‚Äì you might remember when you first got in the car it was kind of a magical experience. The driver treated you super well, and maybe it was a very nice car. And it kind of felt amazing. I push a button, and three minutes later, someone pulls up. They take me where I want to go. I don‚Äôt have to pay at the end. It seems like magic, all this stuff. Well, rideshare, like many other things‚Äì but I‚Äôll use the industry I know the best. I would say, looking at it objectively, it‚Äôs gotten worse over time, not better. And we‚Äôre in the service industry. That‚Äôs crazy. So one of the, let‚Äôs say, responsibilities I feel, as a leader in this industry, is to push against that and to say, let‚Äôs not just let that be the way. Let‚Äôs not let quarterly earnings or what I call additive bias‚Äì again, not my term. But there‚Äôs always a general mode of, just add more and more stuff to a thing, and make it better, which sometimes is exactly the wrong thing to do. Anyway, let‚Äôs actively fight against some of this. And again‚Äì I should zoom out‚Äì my basic premise in the last two years has been‚Äì customer obsession is what‚Äôs going to drive profitable growth. Customer obsession will drive profitable growth. And it‚Äôs worked right. We used to be not profitable. Now we‚Äôre profitable, full stop. And we used to be not growing so much, and now we‚Äôre growing a lot. So anyway, so I think all the questions you‚Äôre asking get at the same fundamental premise, which is, can you really be a customer-obsessed organization and grow as a result profitably? And we‚Äôre trying to demonstrate the answer is yes. ALISON BEARD: So on that note, Shazab is asking, how do you ensure that your 1.5 million driver contractors, who are gig workers‚Äì they‚Äôre not employed by Lyft‚Äì live and embrace your customer experience obsession? DAVID RISHER: Ah, this is a very cool question. This is a very cool question. And I‚Äôm going to answer the question, but I‚Äôm going to give you‚Äì I‚Äôm going to tell you you‚Äôre in good company for asking this question. So first of all, let me say this‚Äì service, of course, doesn‚Äôt just mean, what happens when you‚Äôre in the car. It means, for example, after I open up the app, what‚Äôs the estimate I‚Äôm going to get? How fast am I going to get picked up? Let‚Äôs start with that. So right now we pick you up about a minute faster, on average, than we did a year ago. That‚Äôs about 40 faster than our biggest competitor, which is actually quite an accomplishment. So before I get to the answer, I will just note that ‚Äúservice‚Äù means a whole lot of different things. It can mean, for example, does your driver cancel on you, which is quite irritating? And you might‚Äì interestingly enough, it‚Äôs actually hard to detect in the data how irritating it is because people tend to get rematched, and a car eventually picks them up. But people find it very frustrating. They don‚Äôt like the idea of‚Äì and you‚Äôve probably seen this yourself. It says, oh, we‚Äôre finding a new ride. It‚Äôs not a great experience. So anyway, that service experience starts from the second you pick up the app. But now to the center of your question, now you get in the car. The car pulls up, and you get in the car. And I find this a very, very interesting question of how can‚Äì we do all kinds of things today. Let‚Äôs just start with level set. So we have what‚Äôs called a driver education center, a coaching center. I‚Äôm a driver myself, as I said. I just got a prompt yesterday to go in and review some videos and stuff. In a week‚Äì actually, we haven‚Äôt said this publicly yet, but I‚Äôll say it now because why not‚Äì we‚Äôre actually starting a new driver podcast, which I think will be very cool because drivers, of course, spend time in the car. And it‚Äôs actually not‚Äì it‚Äôs produced by Lyft, but it‚Äôs actually drivers talking to‚Äì its two drivers, a man and a woman, talking to each other about how to deliver great service and how that connects to great tips. So that‚Äôs cool. And then we also have various incentive programs and bonuses and so forth and so on if you do certain things and don‚Äôt do certain things. So there‚Äôs a whole, as you can imagine, machine behind it. But I still think the question is even more interesting because‚Äì and I‚Äôve asked this very same question. I happen to have had the very lucky experience of getting to talk to Thomas Keller a couple months ago, who runs The French Laundry and then just completely coincidentally to Eric Ripert, who runs Le Bernardin in New York, so two three-star Michelin restaurants. And I asked both of them exactly the question you‚Äôre asking me. I said, how can we, as a company, coach, cajole, encourage, whatever it is but create a service culture, a service ethic among the 1.5 million drivers that drive on our platform that‚Äôs at the same level, same consistency, maybe not five-star, three-star level but a consistent level, that you do in your restaurants? And both of them‚Äì it was so interesting. You know the difference in a question you ask, and the person is‚Äì they give you a rote answer and like, whatever. But this was the opposite. In both cases, they leaned into this and spent another five or 10 minutes saying, that‚Äôs a mind-blowing, mind-blowing idea. Like, how can you get at that level the type of service that we get? So that was a very, very long way of not answering a question. I don‚Äôt actually know yet. I can tell you some of the things we‚Äôre working on, and some of them I‚Äôve already mentioned. But I think it‚Äôs one of the things that‚Äôs going to, I hope, set us apart and make us an industry leader in this group, in this area. ALISON BEARD: I‚Äôm sure that driver experience, customer experience is going to play a big role in your answer to the next question. But it is a really good one, and it‚Äôs certainly one on everyone‚Äôs mind. Two people are asking it. Jordan asks, how does Lyft differentiate itself from its biggest competitor to encourage consumers to switch? And an anonymous viewer asks, how did you position your company to compete so well against a robust, name-recognized competitor? And kudos to our very polite audience for not mentioning the name of the competitor. But that‚Äôs the question for you. How are you battling this dominant force in your industry? DAVID RISHER: Sure. So again, it is a good question, and it‚Äôs quite hard. It‚Äôs quite hard, particularly when some of our drivers drive on both platforms. The car is the same. So it‚Äôs quite an interesting problem. I‚Äôll go back to the same thesis. So you mentioned also that I was on the board of Lyft for a couple of years before joining the CEO. And it‚Äôs quite interesting and, of course, a separate issue of the perception you have of as a company‚Äì of a company as a board member versus inside. I will say, as a board member, I believed the company was customer-obsessed, and I was asked to be on the board to push that idea at the board level because boards often think about finance and strategy, not so much customers. But I came to believe over the course of the two years I was on the board before joining as CEO that customers‚Äì and then when I joined the company as CEO, I realized, no. Not that we were not but that, gosh, we were a bunch of different things. We were many‚Äì we were trying to do too many things all at the same time and maybe not‚Äì not maybe not. I‚Äôm sorry‚Äì definitively not really obsessing over our customers. We were pricing too high. We were paying too little. Our reliability wasn‚Äôt so great, on and on and on. And so the answer to your question‚Äì again, it comes to the same. Our purpose is to serve and connect. Let me start with those two words, ‚Äúserve‚Äù and ‚Äúconnect.‚Äù And I want to serve riders and drivers better than they‚Äôve ever been served before, and I want to connect them with the people and places they love. That‚Äôs big, big picture, what I want to do. And that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre doing. So I‚Äôll give you some evidence that we‚Äôre beginning to make some inroads against those other guys. When I joined‚Äì let‚Äôs look at two statistics. When I joined, our share was about a 26, maybe 27, now, most recent, about a 30, 31. That might not seem like a big change, but it‚Äôs a big change. In Canada, we‚Äôve gone from being irrelevant to having our ride volume double and double again. That‚Äôs been 100% a street fight against the other guys because we weren‚Äôt really there, and then we entered seriously about a year ago. And now we‚Äôve been‚Äì And again, so some of it comes from differentiated service, things like Price Lock, Women+ Connect, a product I started, actually, on the first day I was here that lets women drivers and riders choose each other, a product that‚Äôs coming out next week. I‚Äôll give you an early preview. It‚Äôs called Lyft Silver, which allows old people to have a simplified version of the app, and you can invite them to be part of the app and even pay for their ride if you‚Äôre maybe a son or daughter, caregiver. So some of it‚Äôs product differentiation. Some of it‚Äôs partnerships. We have partnerships with a company called Bilt, for example, or a company called, well, Chase Sapphire Reserve. Many people probably have their credit card or‚Äì in the audience. So some of it‚Äôs that. We have these sorts of partnerships that give us exclusive or preferential access to certain customer sets in return for certain things. Some of it‚Äôs brand, an area, actually, we haven‚Äôt actually invested that much in recently, but you‚Äôll see more of that later this year and next year. So again, maybe a little bit of an ‚Äúall of the above‚Äù thing, but the through line through all this is we want to level up the service that you get by far, by far and really redefine it. And here‚Äôs where I‚Äôll end. On the driver‚Äôs side‚Äì and this is probably the area where we‚Äôve made the most progress‚Äì because of things like earnings guarantee, because of‚Äì and this earnings commitment and a set of tools around that and various other things we‚Äôve done, we now have a 20-point advantage, 20-point advantage over the other guys when drivers are asked the question, which company would you prefer to drive from, 20 points. So step by step by step, by treating them well, by obsessing over drivers and riders, that‚Äôs how we‚Äôre getting there. ALISON BEARD: So you‚Äôve been a change agent in the company. When you took over as CEO, you wanted to execute a turnaround that included layoffs at the start. How did you make the very difficult decisions in that scenario and then communicate them to the workforce? DAVID RISHER: Yeah, so it was very difficult but in a weird way kind of straightforward. And this is what I mean. So my first day was April 17, 2023, and I had actually been coming in for the prior‚Äì call it two months, on Thursdays and Fridays. So that my first full-time day. And within the first, say, six weeks, we had announced a couple of very significant things. The first, as you mentioned, was quite a significant layoff. It was 26% of the workforce. Now, that‚Äôs devastating. That‚Äôs devastating. But‚Äì or and, I guess I should say‚Äì the framing that I gave was, this is the only way, only way that I know how to pay for the things that we are going to do for our customers, for our riders and drivers, which is to say, lower prices to be competitive and raise pay to be competitive. And I was‚Äì and of course it was devastating, of course, for the company and particularly because the company had gone through layoffs in the past. But I will say‚Äì and I don‚Äôt think this is just people telling me what they thought I wanted to hear‚Äì even some people who left the company, who were asked to leave the company or told to leave the company, said, I hate it, but I get it. But I get it. If we want this company to survive, you got to make these types of choices, and it‚Äôs the type of choice that maybe we needed to have made in the past that we didn‚Äôt make with such clarity of purpose, which was so that we could provide better service to riders and drivers. The second thing, just to walk down that path for a couple more steps, I said is‚Äì and remember, you have to put yourself back in 2023. We‚Äôre all coming back to work three days a week. Now, this was an interesting decision because at the time it was not obvious that that was maybe the right thing to do. And in fact, the company had in the past said, we‚Äôre going to be remote first, as many companies did. Now, obviously, a lot of companies since have also done the same. But I bring this up because I thought of it as a very important cultural moment for us as well, to say, if our purpose is to serve and connect and we‚Äôre about getting people out of the house and dealing‚Äì all these sorts of things, we can‚Äôt just do it remotely, and we‚Äôre not going to come up with our best ideas. And we‚Äôre not going to‚Äì it‚Äôs very hard for that‚Äì again, you can look at the data screens. But to get that real feel of what drivers and riders really will respond to without the whiteboard sessions and all the rest, so that was a very important second thing. And then the third thing that we announced‚Äì it was all right in these first couple of weeks‚Äì was a new product called Women+ Connect. This‚Äì I mentioned this before briefly‚Äì allows women riders and drivers to choose each other. And this was something I actually started on the first day. It was actually 10 o‚Äôclock in the morning the first day I was here. And the reason I thought it was so important is because it was an idea that had been kind of floating around for a while, and people had always come up with a way to say no to it. Ah, it‚Äôs complicated, or there‚Äôs legal issues, or this or that, all sorts of things. And I‚Äôm like, yeah, but on the other hand, 25%‚Äì excuse me, 50% of our riders are women, roughly, and 25% of our drivers are women. And they‚Äôre telling us guys, when we listen, that they‚Äôre not always comfortable, particularly late at night or particularly in a new city. They‚Äôre not always comfortable. So what are we doing here? So anyway, we pushed through some of those objections and talked about the risks and characterized them in certain ways and did the technical work. And I think it was six months later, in August, they came out with a‚Äì came out with the product. And it‚Äôs been very popular. It‚Äôs actually one of our most popular products, particularly for drivers. Once they turn it on, they never turn it off I go into detail on this because I wanted to say from the beginning, it‚Äôs not just about cost-cutting. It‚Äôs cost-cutting for a reason‚Äì we can do better for riders and drivers as a result. And we‚Äôre going to grow too. We‚Äôre going to innovate. We‚Äôre not going to let this stall us, and we‚Äôre going to do it together. ALISON BEARD: That‚Äôs good advice for anyone who‚Äôs trying to lead a change effort in any-size organization or team. So Martin asked, would you consider onboarding autonomous drivers, i.e., cars without driver, and Wendy asks, how does Lyft view the Waymo disruption, continuing to innovate toward that future trend, while balancing your current business model and offering and assuring support to your current drivers? [00:28:23.75] DAVID RISHER: Yeah, so great questions. So the answer to the first is yes, we will absolutely welcome autonomous vehicles onto our platform. In fact, we‚Äôve already announced an agreement with a company called‚Äì with a company called May Mobility that operates or will operate in Atlanta later this year, actually this summer. They operate Toyota Siennas in self-driving mode. And we‚Äôve announced an agreement with Mobileye, which is a technology company that produces autonomous technology that will be installed in a to-be-named OEM, to-be-named car that will also be on our platform. And I think, if I zoom out for just one click, autonomous vehicles, self-driving vehicles are absolutely going to happen. In some places, it‚Äôll happen fast. Here in San Francisco, they‚Äôre happening quite quickly. In other places, it‚Äôll be slower. But it‚Äôs going to happen. So then the question is, well, how do you really embrace it? How do you bring them onto your platform in a way that hopefully expands the market, which‚Äì we‚Äôve actually seen some evidence of that, which is great‚Äì is respectful and acknowledges the fact that you‚Äôve got millions of people driving on the platform too? So how do you work with them through this transition period? And then how do you make sure that you‚Äôre not accidentally being disrupted out of business? Waymo is a very interesting company. Perhaps at some point they‚Äôll be a partner of ours. Right now you might see them as a competitor, a small-scale competitor. But still, they‚Äôre doing stuff that competes directly with us in some of our markets. So it‚Äôs no exaggeration to say it‚Äôs probably the thing that I‚Äôm thinking about the most and our board is the most engaged with, but I‚Äôm quite optimistic that under 99 scenarios out of 100 it turns out to be actually quite accretive for the industry because it gets‚Äì remember, people take 160 billion rides a year in their own private cars. Rideshare is only three billion between us and the other guys. So there‚Äôs so much opportunity for other people driving you and that experience being part of people‚Äôs lives that I tend to be much more focused on how to take advantage of that market share expansion than I am about fighting a particular battle with a particular competitor or something like that. ALISON BEARD: OK. This is another anonymous viewer asking. He‚Äôs clearly done his research. He says, from your wiki page, an impressive career advancement, Microsoft, Amazon, and now Lyft. It‚Äôs clear that your bosses have loved you. What characteristics do you think set you apart from others? DAVID RISHER: Wow. That‚Äôs like a‚Äì it‚Äôs like an Oprah Winfrey-style question. ALISON BEARD: I know. I love it when they get personal. I do love it when they get personal. DAVID RISHER: Honestly, it‚Äôs maybe easier for me to turn the question around just a little bit and say what I learned at those places. What I learned from working at Microsoft‚Äì and I didn‚Äôt work directly for Bill Gates, of course, but I did have enough interaction with him to get a sense of who he was and what his values and focus was. He was a very competitive person, and so I learned how to compete hard. I really did. And that was very important learning. And then I also learned a lot about taking technology, from a guy named Todd Nelson, actually, my boss for a long time at Microsoft, taking technology which can feel a little obscure, particularly back in the ‚Äô90s, and making it personal and trying to understand it at a personal level, not just at a technology level. I think I did work directly for Jeff Bezos for quite a long time at Amazon, and customer obsession really did come from him. He understood early on the internet everyone‚Äôs a click away from everyone else, and so if you don‚Äôt‚Äì there‚Äôs no such thing as an undifferentiated competition. You have to differentiate in order to compete. Otherwise, people go to something else that‚Äôs better, so anyway, that real focus on customer obsession. And then I ran Worldreader for a long time, the nonprofit I founded, and there I was my own boss. I was my‚Äì well, my board was boss. But really what I learned there is this idea of leading with purpose and that you can get people‚Äì you have so few tools in the nonprofit world. You have small salaries. You don‚Äôt have stock. But you do have purpose, and if you lead with purpose, gosh, people are willing to do amazing things. So maybe those are some things I‚Äôve learned over the years. ALISON BEARD: I really like that you turned a question asking about why you‚Äôre so amazing to talk about why your bosses were so amazing and what they taught you. And so I think maybe what characteristic is most salient for you is that you‚Äôre a learner. You‚Äôre curious, and you‚Äôre picking up lessons from other people. OK, this last question‚Äì and it‚Äôs just a one-word answer‚Äì what‚Äôs your Lyft driver rating? DAVID RISHER: 5. [CHUCKLES] ALISON BEARD: I‚Äôm not surprised. All right, David, I‚Äôm sorry that we‚Äôre out of time. It‚Äôs really been a pleasure talking with you today. Thank you so much. DAVID RISHER: Alison, I‚Äôve had a ton of fun. Thanks for the great questions from you and from the whole audience. It was great. ALISON BEARD: That was Lyft CEO David Risher in conversation with me at the 2025 HBR Leadership Summit.

I think we're in the wrong industry. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here‚Äôs how it works. As companies pour billions of dollars into AI infrastructure, demand for AI talent to program and run these AI data centers is also greatly increasing. Deedy Das, a Venture Capitalist at Menlo Ventures and a former Google Search staff member, posted on X that Meta has an over $2 million annual pay package for AI talent, but still keeps losing its people to OpenAI and Anthropic. He said that he‚Äôs personally heard three such cases this week alone, which is major news given the size of Meta‚Äôs compensation. Statistics say that for every 10.6 from DeepMind, 8.2 from OpenAI, and 2 from Hugging Face that move to Anthropic, it only loses one employee for each company. This movement shows that the startup is quickly growing and that many people from competing AI labs want to work for it. We don‚Äôt know how much the company offers, though, but we can safely assume that it‚Äôs at least on par or, more likely, substantially larger than what the competition pays. According to the SignalFire research, beyond salary, Anthropic's edge is a unique culture that embraces "unconventional thinkers" and gives employees true autonomy, as well as flexible work options, a lack of title politics and forced management tracks. Furthermore, employees report an embrace of intellectual discourse and researcher autonomy, compared to bureaucracy elsewhere. Meta is currently offering $2M+/yr in offers for AI talent and still losing them to OpenAI and Anthropic. Heard ~3 such cases this week.The AI talent wars are absolutely ridiculous.Today, Anthropic has the highest ~80% retention 2 years in and is the #1 (large) company top AI‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/YSv5UNV5H2June 10, 2025 Aside from this, Das also mentioned that Anthropic has an unusually high two-year employee retention rate. The tech industry average is around 40% to 50%, with the retention rate dropping over the past couple of years due to layoffs. However, many AI startups‚Äô two-year retention rates vary between 63% and 80%, with Anthropic holding the top spot. Next to it is Google‚Äôs DeepMind, which has a retention rate of 78%. Many new employees who work in AI labs also come from major tech giants. It‚Äôs estimated that 5.4% of new hires come from Google‚Äôs non-AI divisions, while 4.3% are former Meta staffers. A further 3.2% used to work with Microsoft, and another 2.7% are ex-Amazon employees, while 2.1% were previously affiliated with Stripe, and 1.7% came from Apple. This accounts for nearly 20% of new employees in AI labs that have come from tech giants. Massive tech companies used to be the dream job for many people, especially as they offered competitive pay, strong career growth, many opportunities within the industry, and prestige. However, 2024 was a bad year for the tech sector, with many companies laying off thousands of people. Intel was one of the biggest losers, with the company laying off 15% of its workforce (roughly 15,000 employees) after its disastrous August 2024 financial report. However, other companies like Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Dell, and AMD were also hit with workforce reductions. On the other hand, the continued growth in the AI sector is pushing many talented individuals towards these startups, as shown by the data. This will likely continue in the near future, as companies and nations continuously build more and more AI data centers. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

June 11, 2025 06:52 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA PARIS, June 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NVIDIA GTC Paris at VivaTech ‚Äî NVIDIA today announced a collaboration with Novo Nordisk to accelerate drug discovery efforts through innovative AI use cases. The work supports Novo Nordisk‚Äôs agreement with DCAI to use the Gefion sovereign AI supercomputer. The companies aim to create customized AI models and agents that Novo Nordisk can use for early research and clinical development and to apply advanced simulation and physical AI technologies. ‚ÄúAI is essential for every industry, and there‚Äôs no other field that will benefit more from acceleration than drug discovery,‚Äù said Rory Kelleher, senior director of business development for life sciences at NVIDIA. ‚ÄúWorking with Novo Nordisk, we‚Äôre advancing critical R&D applications with fundamental tools that can harness the full potential of generative and agentic AI to improve pharmaceutical development.‚Äù Novo Nordisk Taps Advanced AI to Accelerate InnovationDCAI‚Äôs Gefion supercomputer, powered by NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD‚Ñ¢, provides Novo Nordisk an AI factory for running drug discovery and agentic AI workloads. Novo Nordisk will use NVIDIA BioNeMo‚Ñ¢ for generative AI-powered drug discovery, NVIDIA NIM‚Ñ¢ and NVIDIA NeMo‚Ñ¢ microservices for building customized agentic workflows, and the NVIDIA Omniverse‚Ñ¢ platform to create physically accurate simulation environments for developing physical AI applications. Novo Nordisk researchers will focus on several AI research programs, including using single-cell models to predict cellular responses to drug candidates and structures, as well as designing models to build molecules with drug-like properties. The companies will also collaborate on tapping Novo Nordisk‚Äôs vast global scientific literature to build biomedical large language models, enabling researchers to uncover correlations between genes, proteins and diseases. ‚ÄúBy coupling NVIDIA‚Äôs accelerated computing platform and expertise with Novo‚Äôs deep expertise in life sciences research and development, we aim to build custom models that will aid our scientists in developing new medicines faster and more efficiently,‚Äù said Mishal Patel, senior vice president, AI and digital innovation at Novo Nordisk. ‚ÄúGefion will allow us to run experiments at an unprecedented scale.‚Äù Advancing Denmark‚Äôs Healthcare EcosystemDCAI owns and operates Gefion, Denmark‚Äôs flagship AI supercomputer. DCAI is helping lower the barrier for accessing advanced computing capabilities and enabling companies in Denmark to pursue research and development across healthcare and drug discovery. ‚ÄúWith Gefion‚Äôs computational power, we can tackle the toughest R&D challenges, with the ultimate goal of unlocking new possibilities for pharmaceutical research and development,‚Äù said Nadia Carlsten, CEO of DCAI. ‚ÄúBy combining Gefion‚Äôs capabilities with NVIDIA‚Äôs expertise, our customers can accelerate innovation even further.‚Äù Gefion has already been used by multiple customers to advance healthcare and drug discovery. Teton, a Danish startup and member of the NVIDIA Inception program for cutting-edge startups, is tapping into Gefion to accelerate the development of its AI care companion for hospitals, using cameras and sensors installed in patient rooms to create real-time 3D digital twins. This allows nurses to monitor patients remotely and receive alerts about potential health issues. Teton‚Äôs technology aims to reduce workload burden on nurses ‚Äî freeing them up for higher-value tasks ‚Äî and improve patient care, with early trials showing up to a 25% reduction in nightshift duties. Last month, DCAI announced that one of the first pharma companies to use Gefion will tap the supercomputer to accelerate drug discovery and development in neurological and psychiatric disorders. Another venture-backed company is using Gefion to accelerate the development of oral alternatives to widely used biologics and to target proteins that are currently difficult or impossible to drug with available compounds. Gefion will also be used as part of an effort by Danish health organizations to unite previously siloed health data into a single national analysis platform, which will provide researchers with secure access to interconnected health data. Along with supercomputing resources, this will make it easier to analyze large datasets, identify disease patterns earlier and develop more personalized treatments.

He is the vice chairman of Ogilvy UK, where he spent, I mean, it says down here the last three decades, but he doesn‚Äôt look that old, so I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs not the case. The last three decades applying behavioral science to some of the world‚Äôs biggest brands. You will know Rory from his best-selling book, Alchemy, which I‚Äôve got here, and if you haven‚Äôt read that, you definitely need to, his TEDx talks, which have racked up over 15 million views, and his uncanny knack for turning irrational ideas into astonishing commercial results. In our conversation today, we‚Äôre going to be focusing in on problem framing and this idea around reframing problems so that constraints become creative springboards that spark different questions and help brands come up with more valuable answers for their consumers. More on that later. Before then, Rory, welcome to the show. Thank you for coming on. Ah, it‚Äôs a pleasure. What a joy. Really happy to be here. Firstly, just to give us a snapshot of, for those people that maybe have been living under a rock and have never heard of you, give us a bit of a snapshot of your journey and how you became sort of focused on behavioural science. Very simply, my first job was other than driving a forklift truck at the Ribena factory when I was a student and working for my dad who was self-employed. My first sort of full-time job was in what was then called Ogilvy and Maither Direct, now called Ogilvy One, which was the direct marketing wing of Ogilvy and Maither at the time. That was in 1988. And it was an incredibly lucky and fortunate place at which to start work because, of course, it was that part of advertising which was measurable. By the way, you know, there was a downside to that. And I‚Äôll come to that later, which is the good thing about measurement is you can compare what‚Äôs working and what‚Äôs not working and what‚Äôs working better. The bad thing about measurement is you‚Äôre never allowed to do anything you can‚Äôt actually measure, which is, if you like, it‚Äôs a double-edged sword. However, what we were doing was effectively behavioral economics avant la lettre. We were performing enormous randomized control trials of both creative and media and targeting and measuring the comparative effect of different changes, which very, very quickly caused you to realize that what motivated people to do things, what was important in terms of a marketing communication, wasn‚Äôt necessarily either what research would tell you was important or what rational economic models would tell you was important. So you would repeatedly find utterly bizarre effects. One of the earliest ones was a simple test for what was then called British Telecom, where if you sold a product and you allowed people to respond by phone, you got a 2% response rate. If you allowed them only to respond by post, all other things being equal, you got a 4% response rate. And if you gave them the choice of both, you got a 6% response rate. I think I‚Äôm 0.1% off on a few of those figures, but I haven‚Äôt got the data anymore because this was 1989. But that‚Äôs the kind of thing that you‚Äôd find. Now, an economist would accept the fact that there‚Äôs something called transaction costs. You know, people are happier engaging in one, responding in one medium rather than another. And therefore, that‚Äôs not going to be negligible. But that finding that 2 plus 4 equals 6, that effectively every additional channel of response you offer creates more response, is something which has‚Ä¶ I always argued then, look, these things‚Ä¶ I said, there‚Äôs a science here for which we have no name. In other words, really understanding what it is that drives people to change their behavior, as opposed to falling back on rational-seeming theories about what matters. And it was only years later when I discovered accidentally the existence of behavioral economics, nudge theory, Kahneman, Tversky, Arielle, Thaler, et cetera, Sunstein. It was only then that I realized that there were a tiny group of people engaged in this thing, and it did in fact have a name. And I always thought it had a vastly greater importance. David Ogilvy would have been the same. David Ogilvy always said people should start by working in direct response advertising because it gives you a effectively an instinctive feeling for what works. And so that was the thing that really‚Ä¶ And of course I was in the right place at the right time. You know, I already knew quite a bit. In fact, when I eventually met Thaler and Kahneman and people like that, what was quite surprising to me is I had interesting things to say to them, and they were interested in what I had to say, because I was party to all kinds of experiments which weren‚Äôt in the academic literature because they were in the commercial field. Amazing. Amazing. Well, you‚Äôve sort of touched on it there, this idea of problem framing, because this is something I know that you speak a lot about in your book Alchemy, and it‚Äôs kind of a key thing that we want to tuck into with you today. So perhaps before we get into some details, let‚Äôs sort of start high level for folks, perhaps, who are just kind of grappling with this for the first time. Well, how would you sort of describe problem framing and specifically, I mean, our audience are all trying to build brands or involved in brand building strategically somehow. How is problem framing helpful for, say, somebody who‚Äôs trying to build a brand to think through? Okay, I‚Äôll reframe this, which is only appropriate. Go for it. Which is to say that how is not problem framing an issue in business and indeed governmental and institutional decision making. In other words, if you don‚Äôt spend time, famously, I think Einstein said, if I had something like an hour left to save the world, I‚Äôd spend 59 minutes defining the problem and one minute solving it. It‚Äôs understood in mathematics, obviously. Mathematicians would understand this instinctively, that if you can redefine the question, you‚Äôve given yourself a second chance at solving it. And not doing that by effectively saying, we have to solve every problem through brute force methods. And if you rewrite the brief or redefine the problem, you‚Äôre cheating. That is hugely problematic because I think that‚Äôs an instinctive thing which has come to us through our educational system, which is, I‚Äôve been given a problem, the problem contains all the information that I need to solve the problem, and there‚Äôs a single right answer. That‚Äôs your typical high school multiple choice maths question. All right? I mean, interestingly, by the way, a few people I know have had an issue with IQ tests because they say an IQ test to make it easy to mark is multiple choice, and when you have multiple choice answers, by definition, the questions can only have one right answer. And so there is this fundamental tendency where I think we take the problem as it is currently defined, we work on it using the approved sequential logical methods for proceeding from that definition of the problem. And whatever is our best shot at it following that process, we then deem to be not only right or interesting or worth testing or worth exploring, we deem it to be the only right answer. And the point I‚Äôm making there is that actually, in many cases, the problem isn‚Äôt as currently defined, or by describing the problem in a different way, you arrive at a completely different avenue for exploration. Okay? So two things that are problematic there. One, people have this instinctive feeling that if I redefine the problem or rewrite the question I‚Äôve been given, I‚Äôm cheating. Okay? That‚Äôs true in a maths exam or whatever. You‚Äôre not allowed to do this in, you know, history 101. I don‚Äôt really like that question about the Norman Conquest. So I‚Äôm going to answer a question about the Roman invasion. Okay? That‚Äôs obviously a con. But actually, in real life problem solving, that‚Äôs exactly what you often need to do. That‚Äôs the first part. The second point is, and this is a really important one, particularly in any institutional setting, okay, is that if you want to signal that you care about a problem, you naturally want to tackle the problem head on in the most obvious way possible, okay? We have a problem with not enough luggage going through X-ray machines in airports. Therefore, we must hire more security staff. And it‚Äôs a very, very fashionable belief, which, you know, and generally it involves the trade off or there‚Äôs a cost attached. And it‚Äôs a very, very logical way to solve that problem, okay? Because you‚Äôre doing what effectively is a direct head-to-head conflict, with the problem as currently defined. With all the parameters that are already in place. So I‚Äôm going to give you this example. When you go through airport X-ray machines, one of the most common problems that happens, and it‚Äôs interesting who notices this and who doesn‚Äôt, is that people start taking their jackets and belts out of the trays as soon as they emerge from the X-ray machine, okay? The problem that creates is that they‚Äôre effectively holding up their tray so that no future trays can be scanned. Now, what you‚Äôll occasionally notice is that there‚Äôs a shrewd person who understands the sort of systems thinking who stands close to the X-ray machine and whizzes the trays along the conveyor belt to the far end, so that there‚Äôs the maximum buffer available for trays to come through and be scanned, and then five people can be removing their belts and jackets and bags in parallel, rather than one person doing it in series. Okay? Now, the way, you know, before you hire more X-ray staff or spend another two million pounds on an amazing scanning machine, maybe you ought to be just instructing the staff who are currently there to actually whizz the trays along to the end, so that the retrieval process can happen in parallel rather than in series, so the throughput of the X-ray machine without any expenditure on money or staff can be trebled. Okay? And so, that will be the typical example I‚Äôd give, where it‚Äôs very, very easy. One, people think they‚Äôre cheating if they change the question, but actually the only thing that matters is the objective, not really the question, and even the objective is open to debate. Okay? When you have a proxy objective, generally, it‚Äôs quite arbitrary. Okay? You know, we need to make this brand appeal more to young people. Well, you know, it would be an absolutely, you know, almost stereotypical form of client paranoia. And therefore, the natural thing to do is to do ads which very explicitly say, hey, young people, you love this brand. Quite frequently, because of the fibles of human psychology, what that creates is a kind of reactance. Okay, which is you‚Äôre trying too hard, disco, vicar, you know what I mean? You know, it‚Äôs the whole thing of, you know, you don‚Äôt look now, but your strategy is showing. Yeah. Now, there may be lots of ways you can appeal more to young people. I once had this thing where we noticed, you know, we don‚Äôt, you know, we‚Äôre not selling that much to the young. And I said, young people have yet less money than old people. Why don‚Äôt you just try offering Klarner? So, you know, what I‚Äôm saying is that, and I think it‚Äôs really important, because one of the things that really bothers me about this whole business is, ever since the advertising business was paid by the hour, it lost something, which was, first of all, clients didn‚Äôt engage you very early on because they didn‚Äôt want the meter to start running. Whereas when you were paid on commission, they got in touch with you day one because after all, you were free until they actually bought some media. All right? The second thing is that consequently, because of that general impatience and the idea that efficiency is on time and in budget, that‚Äôs the kind of goal. We‚Äôve lost what I call the exploratory phase, and we‚Äôre more and more inclined to rush into dumb execution. One of the daft things I think we‚Äôve also done is create a planning department, which instead of working in parallel with the creative department, works in advance of it. Howell-Henry spotted that this was a fault, and they created a kind of five-person team that worked on the whole problem from soup to nuts, which always struck me as a fundamentally useful idea, which produced, by the way, very, very interesting advertising. You know, it was empirically quite a successful approach. But for whatever reason, nobody‚Äôs actually, you know, nobody‚Äôs really replicated this. sponsored message Yeah, it‚Äôs funny, isn‚Äôt it? Because one of the things that I like as a sort of a solo consultant is that I get to do that. You know, I kind of, people will approach with, as you get this idea that we have this problem. And I always say to my clients, look, you know, it may well be that we have, that is the problem that you‚Äôve discussed. But before I just take that and start trying to solve for that, can I interrogate it a bit? I want to go talk to some customers, talk to your staff, talk to your leadership team. And then we‚Äôll settle on that, you know, and then we‚Äôll explore a solution further once we verify that that is a problem to attack. So Roger L. Martin talks about this sort of very narrow island of factual data surrounded by a sea of uncertainty. And for some reason, we feel we have to start the journey from that island, even though it‚Äôs a very restrictive and narrow place from which to start. The analogy I use, which is where I think people get it right, and where I think people, sometimes highly intelligent people get it wrong, is if you look at police work, they accept if you‚Äôve got a criminal you‚Äôre trying to catch, they accept that there are two phases to the investigation. There‚Äôs the investigative phase, and then there‚Äôs the evidential phase. Eventually, you‚Äôve got to prove the guy‚Äôs guilty, right, in a court of law. And to prove the guy‚Äôs guilty, you‚Äôre not allowed to use anecdotes, you‚Äôre not allowed to use entirely circumstantial information. But you are allowed to use that information in the investigative phase. So the standard police question would be, if someone‚Äôs weirdly found dead in a downstairs basement flat, would be to go next door and to ask the neighbors, did you notice anything unusual between the hours of, you know, 9 p.m. and 1 a.m. on, you know, on the third of whatever. Now that‚Äôs a totally open-ended question, okay? The answer could be literally anything. And it‚Äôs almost certainly not going to have any evidential value. I heard a scream at 11.30. Well, that narrows down your time of day, possibly, if you believe they‚Äôre telling the truth. I saw a strange man in a white van drive up repeatedly, and he kept driving back dozens again. You can‚Äôt imprison someone for life for driving a white van in a funny way, although, probabilistically, it wouldn‚Äôt be a bad approach, actually, given the serial killer‚Äôs love of the white van. But you can‚Äôt reasonably, you know, imprison someone for that. That has no evidential value, it has a minor evidential value. But it really tells you, let‚Äôs look at the CCTV and see if we can see any white vans that re-appear more than once and find out if the person driving said van is somehow a bit iffy. Now, again, we‚Äôre not yet in the evidential phase, we‚Äôre just in the exploratory investigative phase, but we‚Äôre allowed to use information there which isn‚Äôt entirely robust. And that‚Äôs only correct. And similarly, you know, what you will probably do in the course of investigation is you will redefine what you‚Äôre trying to do several times in the course of that investigation. You know, first of all, it‚Äôs find something unusual. Secondly, there‚Äôs a line of inquiry around white vans, okay? Thirdly, you would probably, if budget allows, you‚Äôd also say, let‚Äôs also proceed on the basis that the white vans are relevant, because we could be missing something here. Okay? That could be coincidence and it could be meaningful. And so the whole thing is an iterative process. And what we‚Äôve tried to do is turn it into a linear process because, and I‚Äôve got a theory about this, which is one of the reasons why ad agencies don‚Äôt experiment very much with their process, is because we‚Äôve got to justify our activities to some procurement department, who want to know what we‚Äôre doing for every second the meter‚Äôs ticking. And we have to maintain the pretense that every single step of this journey is a sequential stepping stone towards this somehow singular and miraculously perfect solution. Consequently, if you come up with an interesting approach like Howell-Henry, with five people working in parallel, procurement probably won‚Äôt accept that because they‚Äôll say, we need to be able to compare your costs on a like-for-like basis with every other agency that‚Äôs pitching for this count. So innovation is not allowed because it destroys our ability to compare on very narrow cost metrics. It strikes me that a lot of these supposedly well-intentioned parts of business actually have extraordinary dangerous unintended consequences because when you take a business and you optimize for only part of it, and you do so basically with the aim of self-justification, it‚Äôs highly likely that you‚Äôre over-optimizing what you need to lay claim to and under-optimizing other important facets in any decision. There‚Äôs a great book now by Margaret Heffernan, which is called Uncertainty, I think. And it‚Äôs basically a plea for people and organizations to accept existing in a state of uncertainty. Because what we do is a large number of people find being in a state of indecision or uncertainty deeply painful. Yeah, it‚Äôs like a psychological‚Ä¶ It is. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I desperately need to pretend I know what‚Äôs going on here. Or I desperately need to pretend I can make a plausible story up to explain what on earth happened here. And therefore, we rush to kind of what you might call pre-rationalization. Yeah. I once heard it. It‚Äôs like, you know, in the ancient maps, where, you know, they sort of hadn‚Äôt explored areas, they would like just draw a little dragon in the corner. Here be dragons. Here be dragons. It‚Äôs that sort of idea, isn‚Äôt it? It‚Äôs like we don‚Äôt like being in the dragon pit. Like we want to be in a land where we know for sure where we are. So, yeah. Jacob, do you have a question to lead the conversation forward? Yeah, Rory. So, hi, Jacob here. I want to jump into some practical tools and examples that we could use. So, if a team is feeling boxed in by a brief, like what‚Äôs an exercise or something you would do to shift their mindset? Is it like a question or a template or how do you start that shift? Well, it doesn‚Äôt have to shift their mindset at all. You could shift their behavior and then their mindset will follow. So, actually, we know this from quite a lot of evidence in brain science that quite often attitudinal change actually lags behavioral change. In other words, I like this because I do it as opposed to I do this because I liked it in advance. And by the way, there are rational reasons for this, which is once we have experience of something, we often like it more than we expected. Okay. And the classic case of behavioral change versus attitudinal change, which I think is relevant to the electric car industry as well, is I don‚Äôt know how this applies in Australia, probably exactly the same way. British people for years were hugely resistant to automatic transmission in cars. Oh, no, no, no. I like, I like that. The sense of control, that‚Äôs something Americans have. No, no, no. I can‚Äôt stand the idea of an automatic car. Okay. No, no, no. I like the feeling that I can change, you know, da-da-da-da-da-da. And they all came up with these after, and you couldn‚Äôt change their minds, really. Okay. Until they drove an automatic car, at which point nobody ever went back. Okay. Don‚Äôt get me wrong. Okay. If I moved to the north of Scotland and I lived sort of half a mile from the A9, and I had rolling highland roads with no traffic on, and I had the joy of double-D clutching, okay, I might, might go back to a manual car. But for all practical day-to-day purposes, once you‚Äôve had an automatic, you never go back. And once you‚Äôve had one pedal driving in an electric car, you never go back. Driving a car is just mildly irritating. So it isn‚Äôt necessarily the job of assuming you have to change someone‚Äôs attitude to something in order to get them to do it. Sometimes you get them to do it in order to change their attitude to it. Now that strikes me as hugely important. And I‚Äôll give you another example of this. So one of the things that does is it does actually change our attitude to sales promotion. Not necessarily to boring money off sales promotion, which I think can be good, can be bad. It‚Äôs not inherently bad, but it should be the, the last resort should be bribing your people to buy your product, okay? But it does, for example, when we talk to Great British Railways, one of the things we‚Äôd say is, look, there are something like 70% of the population are what‚Äôs called rail rejectors. Some of them have good reasons. They live in a part of the country which is totally all served by rail, for example. Okay, fine. But there‚Äôs this huge percentage of people who don‚Äôt like railways because they never use it, okay? And there‚Äôs a famous joke line about Guinness, I‚Äôve never tried it because I don‚Äôt like it, okay, right? And in a sense, those people are caught in a kind of mental loop of they don‚Äôt use the railways, so therefore they‚Äôve never had any incentive. Why would I have an incentive to have an opinion that conflicts with my existing behavior? So in Denmark, what they do is they give everybody free rail travel on their birthday. Now, I would argue there‚Äôs a whole chunk of people. One of my ideas was increased car tax by 100 pounds a year, but give every person who taxes their car 150 pounds worth of off-peak rail vouchers to use whenever they like on any off-peak train, i.e. train that isn‚Äôt already crowded. I mean, those journeys are more or less free anyway, because you‚Äôre moving trains around the country full of fresh air. And so the incremental, the marginal cost of an extra passenger is zero. And my argument for doing this is that if you make four train journeys a year, next time you have to make a journey, at least rail is in your repertoire. It‚Äôs in your consideration set. Not saying you‚Äôll go, I‚Äôm not suggesting people will go, oh, this is total epiphany. I‚Äôve seen the lights. I‚Äôm selling my car and I‚Äôm going to go everywhere by train. It‚Äôs simply the fact that they will now consider the train as an option because they‚Äôve had experience of using it under reasonably benign circumstances. They can see the benefits of the train and they can see the downsides of the train. Whereas people who only use a car just have imagined downsides of the railway. Also, the first time you use a train is a painful experience because everything is unfamiliar and you need to work out where to park and where you buy a ticket and how much it costs and where you stand and all that stuff, which when you‚Äôve used a train five or six times, then becomes system one rather than system two. It becomes then relatively instinctive and a bit painless. So I wouldn‚Äôt even start from the assumption that you‚Äôre trying to change someone‚Äôs attitude. I‚Äôd just say there is somewhere there is a behavioral bottleneck in the system, which we need to use whatever tools are available to address. Then you have to ask your secondary question, which is, is that the real bottleneck? Which is there‚Äôs no point in getting people to think differently about something if it doesn‚Äôt translate into behavior. So if the real bottleneck is, you know, so this is really important, by the way, because you can identify what appears to be a pinch point in your business. But if there‚Äôs an even worse pinch point upstream or downstream, I‚Äôm a big fan of that book by Eli Goldratt called The Goal, which is all about bottleneck theory effectively, which says that in any system, that the performance of the system is usually constrained by its narrowest point. Now, that originated in what you might call manufacturing processes or chemical processes. He‚Äôs a, Goldratt was a hard-hitting physicist, you know, a serious guy, right? And then people realized that actually also applies upstream to demand. It‚Äôs not just a question of manufacturing and production. There is probably one thing, which is the single point at which it pays you most to intervene. Now, at which point, if you free up that bottleneck, a bottleneck may appear somewhere else. So you have a very weird thing which happens in, I think, the electric car market, which is the first bottleneck was there was huge demand for electric cars in the very early days from earlier doctors, techno geeks, etc. The bottleneck was you couldn‚Äôt produce enough cars, and so there were waiting lists. Then about 10 electric car companies came on stream with massive production of electric cars simultaneously, and the problem was there was a glut. Okay? So, you know, you literally have those issues where, at any one time, where the bottleneck lies may actually change. And therefore, framing the problem, because it‚Äôs important to consistently kind of evolve as you are sort of solving one bit or reframing one bit. It might pop open another bottleneck somewhere else, I guess, is what we‚Äôre saying. sponsored message Absolutely, yeah. So what I‚Äôm saying is there‚Äôs no point in widening a road if there‚Äôs a badly phased set of traffic lights 200 yards further on. All you do is you move the traffic jam somewhere else on the road, and you don‚Äôt actually increase the throughput of cars at all. So Rory, let me ask you a question. So let‚Äôs bring this down into your world in Ogilvy or in terms of what you‚Äôre doing. Can you give us an example or just sort of maybe it would help if you could kind of show us, say maybe where you got a brief through or something through where there seemed to be problem A, but by reframing it, re-exploring it, it changed the outlook and changed the outcome of the project. So Say Mate to a Mate, which is a campaign for the Mayor of London, which created a lot of controversy. And actually the controversy was interesting because a lot of people said that by proposing a relatively small intervention, we were making light of a problem. Okay, but let me explain the logic here. We did huge numbers of interviews with people in the kind of target audience. And what we found is that it was designed to effectively diminish or provide a reasonable solution to what you might call male-on-female misogynistic bullying. Okay. Now, what emerged from that is that that kind of behavior where people are casually misogynistic, either in the presence of women or in their absence in some cases. Okay. Most men don‚Äôt like it, but they didn‚Äôt have a mechanism for criticizing it in their friends without coming across as holier than that. Without coming across as patronizing, because what you can‚Äôt do if your friend engages in casual sexism, some shape or form, most men don‚Äôt support it, don‚Äôt agree and regard it as bad behavior, but you can‚Äôt suddenly read out a Guardian editorial, okay, to your friend because your friendship has an inherent value. Quite often, we tolerate quite a lot from our friends because that‚Äôs what friendship means. And so the whole idea which embraced, for example, comedians talking about it, it embraced a whole lot of a poster campaign, it embraced every form of medium suitable was actually involved in this. Okay. Now, I think it‚Äôs particularly important because you could argue it‚Äôs a version of broken windows theory. Look, it‚Äôs not going to stop. This campaign is not going to stop Fred West, okay? It‚Äôs not going to stop Peter Sutcliffe in his tracks, okay? But you could argue that those behaviors start somewhere and they start small before becoming bigger and bigger. And so the whole point about MATE is it‚Äôs a form of censure or criticism, which doesn‚Äôt actually make the person you‚Äôre criticizing. It doesn‚Äôt actually, effectively, it‚Äôs a corrective. It‚Äôs an internal corrective from a group of friends who would prevent that. Because some of that misogyny is probably performed for bravado, okay? They think they‚Äôre impressing their friends and their friends aren‚Äôt actually impressed. And so it‚Äôs interesting because some people said, no, no, no, we need to spend the money on street lighting. Well, arguably, everything starts somewhere. But secondly, the whole point was, it was very interesting that two people who supported it, I think, were, interestingly, Piers Morgan and Caitlin Moran, were two people who said, I get it, that works to me, that makes sense. And actually, two people who, whether you like them or not, I think are astute. You can say whatever you like about those two people. But they‚Äôre highly astute and they‚Äôre not formulaic thinkers. They will actually take a completely kind of a bleak opinion on things. They were two people who actually supported the campaign. The people who disliked the campaign were people who effectively felt that the only solution to any problem had to be head-on. And actually, human psychology, in many cases, keep off the grass is not a very effective communication. You know my story about, please turn off your mobile phone on entering the restaurant. We immediately think of reasons why it shouldn‚Äôt apply to us. Whereas the brilliant restaurant in Santimedia, which had a sign ostensibly aimed at people leaving the restaurant, but actually visible to everybody walking in, which said, please remember to turn your mobile phone back on when leaving the restaurant. By effectively suggesting a social norm rather than by imposing a rule, okay? The emotional response to that message, although both of them are in service of the same aim, the emotional response to the message is completely different. Now, you know, if you‚Äôre a hardcore person who says the only way to stop people turning their mobile phones on, okay, is by a direct instruction. Or an economist would say you have to fine people, okay, for using mobile phones. But actually, there‚Äôs a perfectly gentle way of doing this, which is just to say that if your mobile phone goes off during the meal, you know, in this fancy restaurant, or, you know, it might be considered a bit of a faux pas by the rest of the diners. And therefore, it‚Äôs a question that you‚Äôre actually, the notice is saving you from embarrassment rather than issuing an edict. And consequently, our emotional response is very, very different, even if the ultimate intent of the message is exactly the same. So going back to that brief for the mayor of London, then, how did that go then? You know, I know it was controversially received, but like, do you know of the data of the outcome of that campaign? I will seek to find out. It will take time because that‚Äôs, that‚Äôs one of my criticisms I will make about one of the problems working in direct marketing and one of the problems about this false claim of quantification we‚Äôve made about marketing is a lot of the value of marketing takes time to emerge. Definitely. It‚Äôs exponential. The value of fame, for example, is really a compounding effect. It‚Äôs more like a pension. You know, as you become more famous, it becomes easier to become more famous. Okay. So these things are not linear and they‚Äôre not immediate, but we will measure it as far as we possibly can. By the way, I mean, you know, we ought to remember that there are some things which are very difficult to measure. If you obsess about the speed of measurement, and it‚Äôs worth remembering there‚Äôs a double problem there. Things you can measure very fast tend to be acquisition focused, bottom of the funnel. Okay. And because you can measure them fast, you get results very fast and the level of attribution is very precise. Any investment in customer service is likely to be slow and less attributable. Consequently, one consequence of this is that almost all companies, I would argue, that are obsessed with justifying their own existence in the marketing department are over invested in acquisition and under invested in customer experience, loyalty and retention and repeat purchase. Right. Because it goes back to that point you were making earlier that if you‚Äôve experienced a train ride and you‚Äôve know that that‚Äôs going to take some time. So, you know, yeah, absolutely right. It takes time for them me to get on the train and then have a couple of turns on that. I have a good experience. Then I, you know, tell someone else about it and then start actually planning that into my behavior going forwards. It does take behavior change takes time. Yeah, absolutely right. Yeah. And so it‚Äôs slow, you know. And so if you think about it, any significant behavioral change involves someone, A, in the early days, it involves people breaking with a habit and doing something altogether unfamiliar. And B, doing something which other people aren‚Äôt doing. Now, there is an interesting issue, which is sometimes called crossing the chasm, which is there is a group of people in any particular field who love doing things that other people aren‚Äôt doing. But there are a minority of people and they aren‚Äôt necessarily where the market value lies. And so you could argue that this very early group of people who are obsessed with buying electric cars, who were both novelty seekers and very high on openness, and to some extent perhaps slightly more individualistic. They want to stand out rather than fit in. Okay. Those people create an early ground swell of uptake for electric cars, which then doesn‚Äôt cross the chasm into the mainstream in part sometimes because the user imagery of early adopters might be quite strange. Okay. So a classic case of that was you had early people who bought Apple Vision Pro, okay, who then started walking around the streets of Manhattan wearing an enormous pair of goggles. It happened apparently famously with Google Glass. They only gave Google Glass out to developers. So the earlier adopters became known as glass holes. And what you need to do is you need to mainstream something. And sometimes the enthusiasts who are your first customers are actually in some ways almost negative ambassadors. Interesting. So how do we do that then, Rory? How do you mainstream something in that regard? I suppose you‚Äôve got to normalize it somehow, haven‚Äôt you? Yeah. I mean, okay, with electric cars, one of the things I‚Äôve made this point repeatedly in the hope that the industry picks it up, it‚Äôs a lot easier to reduce anxiety than it is to increase range. You know, increasing range, you‚Äôre dealing with the laws of physics, which are quite difficult to, I mean, there are wonderful ideas in chemistry and battery chemistry, which I‚Äôm sure can further increase the energy density of batteries. I‚Äôve got no doubt about that. And indeed, it‚Äôs worth spending billions and billions of dollars looking for exactly those ideas. But at the same time, it‚Äôs a lot cheaper and quicker just to make people with a car with a range of 170 miles, say, or even 120 miles, stop feeling so goddamn anxious. So how do you do that? Well, two obvious ones. There are more, okay? One of them is you reduce any legal restrictions within reason on signage directing people to electric car chargers. So if you need planning permission to put up a sign that says car charging, okay? That‚Äôs a problem because electric car chargers are literally only 5 percent as visible as petrol stations are. There are actually more rapid chargers. By the way, Jacob, slight apologies for this because I accept the fact that in Australia, or in certain parts of Australia, this situation is different, okay? Because Australia is what geographers technically call very, very big. In fact, I think you‚Äôre in the 30 countries in the world with the lowest population density, aren‚Äôt you, in Australia. So you have massive cities separated by enormous distances. You know, that‚Äôs like the US similarly, Canada similarly, okay? I accept the fact that what I‚Äôm saying, so I‚Äôm just going to, you know, but in the UK, the Netherlands, Belgium, okay? High density population countries that are, you know, relatively small in size. Range anxiety is, I think, a virus we‚Äôve caught from the United States, where it‚Äôs a rational fear out there. It‚Äôs not really a very rational fear in the UK at all. Because, I mean, apart from the else, in the US, they need 100 and I think that the statistics I went and found is, in the UK, we‚Äôve got eight and a half thousand gas stations to serve a population of 60 million. And in the US, they‚Äôve got about 350 million people, which is five times as many. They actually have 116,000 gas stations. And the reason is they need gas stations to serve a geography, not just a population. With the possible exception of the far north of Scotland, there‚Äôs no where really in Britain where you‚Äôre 50 miles from a place of major habitation. Okay, I mean, literally, there‚Äôs, you know, there are still black spots, by the way. I mean, those need to be ironed out. But one of the things would be you can just go to Android Auto or Apple CarPlay and just say, can you just add for anybody driving an electric car, a little panel that says nearest high-speed charging five miles ahead. Next, three available out of five, you know? Okay, just continue to reassure people. The other thing is you don‚Äôt need the bloody battery to say, your battery charge is 87%. Okay, I do need, when I get down to 11% charge, I need individual digits. 80% plus would be fine. I don‚Äôt need to be made conscious of the fact that I‚Äôve lost a bit of juice when I‚Äôm at 80% already and I‚Äôve just taken the kids to school. I don‚Äôt need that to factor into my thinking any more than I did when I had a petrol gauge. Yeah, because petrol gauges don‚Äôt give you the percentage, do they? No, it‚Äôs just three-quarters full, full, half full, eight full, the light‚Äôs gone on. That was it. That was the level of granularity we needed. There are lots of ways in which you can stop. The other one, by the way, is very simply, I hate to say it, but if you have extended test drives for electric cars, people can basically get addicted because once you‚Äôve driven one, you‚Äôd have going back to petrol field stupid in a weird way. Nothing to do with environmentalism, by the way. In fact, I think the environmental message might have actually set back electric cars by five to 10 years because a lot of people interpreted them as an unfortunate compromise that was being forced on them by tree huggers, rather than the first major step forward in automotive traction in 90 years.

Get on the waitlist now at joinbba.com. Now back to the show. Yeah, Rory, everything you said here resonates because I bought an electric car a couple of years ago and have experienced all of these things, just the‚Ä¶ What did you buy, by the way? What did you get? It was a Polestar. So, yeah. They‚Äôre very good. I hired one of those in Italy. I thought they were excellent. We had a good fun. And yeah, we have a petrol car as well. And going back to that, it‚Äôs like you don‚Äôt want to go back. And it‚Äôs just sluggish, loud. It‚Äôs like, why would you? I mean, the thing that happened was interesting, is the intention was always, I‚Äôll get an electric car, my wife will get a petrol car, so we‚Äôve got one of each. And then basically, once I got the electric car, we liked it so much, we ended up with two electric cars. Her car is Mini, it‚Äôs a Mini Cooper electric. It‚Äôs only got a range of, it‚Äôs one of the earlier ones, so it‚Äôs only got a range of about 110 miles, slightly less in cold weather. But actually, for all practical intents and purposes, it has proved that has been an issue, i.e. the need to recharge en route happens about once every, twice a year, something like that, no more than that. Yeah, I‚Äôve only charged it once on the road and I‚Äôve had it for a couple of years. I‚Äôve never really experienced it. But actually, by the way, I think the government and various people unfairly vilified hybrid cars, because they didn‚Äôt understand the fact that the hybrid, for someone who‚Äôs an Australian, the plug-in hybrid, I mean, is not a bad thing because 99 percent of your journeys are taken care of by plugging in and getting 50 miles, 60 miles of range. I mean, sometimes the great is the enemy of the good. That‚Äôs another issue I‚Äôd raise with things like, an example of that would be heat pumps. People come to you and say, we‚Äôre going to have a perfect heat pump solution. Now, and I go, well, look, if I can reduce my gas consumption by 70 percent, and it costs me 4,000 pounds and I can do it one stage at a time. Okay, that‚Äôs pretty good. Okay, I‚Äôm not Greta Thunberg, but I‚Äôm doing a bit and it‚Äôs all in the right direction. What that probably means is I install four air conditioning units, which you mostly use as air to air heat pumps. I don‚Äôt know if you do that in Sydney. If it gets cold in Sydney, do you reverse your air-con so it warms the house? Yeah, we do. Yeah. Now, it‚Äôs actually a super-efficient fan heater, probably when it‚Äôs super hot outside, sorry, when it‚Äôs super, actually in Sydney, it‚Äôs going to be perfect. It‚Äôs not going to be that cold outside, right? It‚Äôs not like Canada, okay? Actually, it‚Äôs like a five times efficiency fan heater. So it probably takes in two kilowatts, it could be producing eight, okay? Something like that, okay? When you reverse your air-con. Now, in the UK, we don‚Äôt get any subsidies for installing air-con, even though my father, in his nineties, he was a bit frightened of a heat wave, understandably, because they kill you in your nineties. You know, if you can‚Äôt cool off, it‚Äôs really, really risky. So we bought him, my brother and I bought him an air conditioning unit for his main room. He didn‚Äôt want one for his bedroom or anything like that. Actually, because he‚Äôs actually in very hot weather, he‚Äôd sleep downstairs where the air-con was, right? One air conditioning unit. Now, you don‚Äôt get a subsidy for that because they go, oh, no, because you might use it for air conditioning and it‚Äôs actually creating new energy consumption. Mate, he lives in Wales, right? Okay. Heat waves in Wales are going to be about five days of the year at most, maybe 10, 95 percent of the time, my dad was using that air conditioning unit as an incredibly efficient way to heat his main room. As a consequence, he had a gas heater in the room, which he never used. Great. Well done, dad, okay? But no, because it‚Äôs not perfect, and because for five days of the year, he was committing the absolute sin of being a 90-year-old using air conditioning to stay alive. Okay? Right? So these people are not looking at this problem holistically. And so you have this problem. I think there are some areas of activity where we should be increasing carbon consumption. For example, if you can produce steel using coal to produce the blades for a bloody, you know, obviously, they‚Äôre not steel. Okay. But, you know, what I mean is to produce the blades for wind power. And that‚Äôs the best way of producing wind turbines or the belt, you know. There are cases where we should be perfectly happy with carbon use. Okay. The UK has already done really quite well. I mean, I think we‚Äôre just beating ourselves up now. We do have a major problem with this, don‚Äôt we, in the UK? We do beat ourselves up loads. And this is a major topic for international listeners in the UK around steel, because all are still working on closing down in the name of green energy. But the problem is, is then we still we haven‚Äôt all agreed to not still use steel. So we‚Äôre importing it, which therefore is actually, I mean, I‚Äôm not an economist by any stretch of the imagination. But my understanding is, it‚Äôs actually causing more of a problem with the carbon footprint, importing it all. So we kind of shot ourselves in the foot kind of thing with this. Also, the legislation is such a blunt instrument compared to marketing, because the great thing about persuasion is that you‚Äôve got a good reason not to be persuaded. You can ignore it, right? Legislation or economic incentives impose themselves on people who should not be affected by them. This is my great argument for marketing as the first port of call for problem solving. So let me give you an example of this. If you are a retired person who‚Äôs got an 11-year-old petrol car, which is reasonably economical, okay? And about three times a week, you drive to the shops, and once a year or twice a year, you drive to see your cousin at Christmas, you know, or whatever, you know, 120 miles away. But your annual mileage is like 1500, 2000 miles. You should not be in any way encouraged to buy an electric car. Because a battery that could be used by someone who‚Äôs actually driving 10,000 miles a year, namely me, is now sitting outside a cottage somewhere in the middle of the country. Okay? Doing absolutely soddle for 99% of the time. So the fundamental point is that, I‚Äôll give you an example of this. It‚Äôs a good idea to put, for people to put their tumble dryers, washing machines on late at night, because there‚Äôs less pressure on the grid. So the electricity produced at 11 o‚Äôclock at night is probably cleaner. Although there are other arguments, it can be Sunday lunchtime. But let‚Äôs not worry about that. Okay? Now, if you say it‚Äôs a good idea to do that, do that if you can. Lots of people who find it easy to do can do it. Everybody else goes, well, as it happens, I can‚Äôt do that. Now, the first thing, if you create like really expensive, becomes really expensive to use your tumble dryer, okay, until 10 p.m. or 9 p.m., okay? The first call you‚Äôll get if you instigate that legislation is from the London Fire Brigade, who will say, people who work nights will now feel compelled to put their tumble dryer on and leave it in an unoccupied house, where they are a not irrelevant fire risk, okay? Tumble dryers catch fire, particularly old ones, particularly the least economical ones, okay? They catch fire. Secondly, you‚Äôll be encouraging people who live upstairs, their kitchens upstairs from their next door neighbors‚Äô bedroom, to put their washing machine on at 11 o‚Äôclock at night, so it hits the spin cycle at two o‚Äôclock in the morning and their neighbors come and beat them up, okay? The great thing about persuasion is if you‚Äôve got a good reason not to be persuaded, you ignore it, okay? That‚Äôs why persuasion is organic and legislation and economics tends to be physics, okay? Right? One of them is organic change, the other one is kind of what you might call Newtonian change. Input here, output there. And actually the only way we‚Äôre going to solve this problem is organic change unless you‚Äôre happy to live in a country which is literally so oppressive that you spend 30% of your time doing utterly stupid things because you‚Äôve got no choice. This is what you‚Äôre talking about, unintended consequences, isn‚Äôt it? You know, in all of these things, you‚Äôve got to think that through across everything. And I think this is really important, because I think there‚Äôs an awful lot people can do voluntarily. I mean, there are a whole lot of things about solar panels, okay? Okay, now, I imagine you‚Äôre in Sydney. Someone in Germany has obviously got this right in some way, because Germans are using solar panels all over the place. Okay? Now, one of the things you could simply do, okay, is simply describe the value of solar panels to people who have investments using the language of APR. Okay? Now, admittedly, it‚Äôs not a compound effect, but if you spend a thousand pounds on solar panels, and they save you 18% of the amount you spend is saved on an electricity bill every year, there‚Äôs not much in the stock market at the moment that‚Äôs going to give me a guaranteed 18% return in terms of a dividend, right? Okay? So if you basically say this is an investment with a really good dividend, and actually a lot of pensioners who can, now in the UK, you can take a lump sum out of your pension tax-free, and arguably 10% of this, one of the things I say is actually you can take a further 10% out of your pension tax-free if you spend it on renewable energy. And then you‚Äôll get a load of oldsters, often in big houses, which they are effectively saying, okay, that‚Äôs actually a way I can make my pension go further, is basically by not having to spend very much on electricity, on heating. Right. And they do that voluntarily, you‚Äôd imagine, rather than by‚Ä¶ Yeah, but it‚Äôs still voluntary. So incentives, by the way, incentives can be voluntary. We‚Äôve got to be careful about that. Okay. Because an example would be, nobody‚Ä¶ We‚Äôve got a housing crisis. There‚Äôs a very reliable bit of data which shows that nobody downsizes voluntarily, unless they do it by the age of about 72, 73. Once people hit 73, they just stick in their house, for whatever reason. Even if their house is much too big for them, even if logically they know they should move. And I think there‚Äôs a reason for that. I think when you‚Äôre 73, you‚Äôre not confident enough in your future health to say, well, if I move now, I‚Äôve definitely got another eight years in my smaller house. You think, oh, I might spend all this cost of moving, all the cost of moving, and then I‚Äôve got to move into sheltered accommodation three years later. I can‚Äôt be bothered. I‚Äôm going to eek it out as long as I can. Okay. Now, probably what you should say is that if you have a couple with nobody else living in the house and they downsize when both of them are below the age of 74, you should say, no stamp duty, okay? If you‚Äôre buying a less expensive house and you‚Äôre selling a more expensive house, then basically you‚Äôre excused stamp duty on the new house you‚Äôre buying. And then you say, but there‚Äôs a window of opportunity, which is if you leave it until you‚Äôre both 74, windows closed. Now, that‚Äôs an acceptable, okay, it‚Äôs not a nudge because it is actually an economic incentive, okay? But it‚Äôs an economic incentive being used to its maximum psychological effect. Rory, can we switch gears and talk about the future a little bit? You know, AI is a hot topic, so let‚Äôs dive into that. So like AI and data-driven tools, they‚Äôre taking over marketing is like heavy lifting. So where do you see human reframing adding the most value brands? Okay, this is the first time I‚Äôve said this, but I‚Äôve been thinking about this a bit over the last few weeks. Now, this already happened in the UK in the 18th century with the Industrial Revolution and the capability to mass produce things at scale at vastly low expense. So the pottery industry, for example, or operated historically a bit like Faberg√© eggs. You went along, you said, I‚Äôm an immensely rich person, and I would like to commission an egg. And Faberg√© would go and produce an egg, and hopefully you said, ooh, Carl, that‚Äôs a really lovely egg, and then you pay him a stack of money for it. Or you might argue about the egg for ages and go, no, that‚Äôs not the egg I meant at all, go and make another fucking egg. Right? Now, when Wedgwood, and it‚Äôs worth noting that the Industrial Revolution sort of started in things like pottery and textiles, you know, in other words, you know, but the mass production of both furniture and pottery. So Chippendale, in the case of furniture probably, Wedgwood, that was when modern marketing was invented because you suddenly said, well, we can produce so many effing plates. There‚Äôs no point in us waiting to be asked. What we have to do is produce a load of plates in advance and go out and find if anybody wants them. Okay? You reverse the direction of travel. Now, it occurs to me that in creative agencies, what we should do if we‚Äôre using AI correctly is we say, we can now generate interesting interventions and ideas and effectively mock them up to a high level of finish, much, much faster than we could previously. Now, we will still need judgment. It wasn‚Äôt that Wedgewood just produced random plates. Okay? They had very, very good designers who went and produced a very good plate design, usually based on some Chinese theme. Okay? And then bang them out in huge quantities. And then you made more of the ones people liked and less of the ones people didn‚Äôt. I would argue that the ad agency, the creative agency is still operating like Carl Faberg√©. They‚Äôre waiting to be asked. They‚Äôre waiting for a client to come along with an RFP. They‚Äôre waiting for clients. And the reason I partly started the behavioral science practice is I said, look, the fundamental problem of this business is nobody‚Äôs got a budget for a problem they didn‚Äôt realize they had. And so a large part of what we do in Ogilvy Consulting, I would argue, is diagnostic. And actually, in nearly every case, we find something a business is doing, that if they just stopped doing it or did more of something else, they would be much better off. I think we‚Äôve got to change the whole way the ad industry works, so that you actually produce advertising campaigns and ideas and ads and everything else. You produce them and then you find a market for them. I think we‚Äôve got to reverse the direction of travel, because otherwise, if we‚Äôre still waiting to be asked, all we‚Äôve done is commodify ourselves, okay? No one‚Äôs going to pay us any more money because they go, well, look, we know you can do this in three days, so why should we pay you for 15 days work, okay? It‚Äôs going to be a fucking disaster unless we actually reinvent what we do, and that requires a fundamental creation of a different kind of ad agency. Now, that‚Äôs one possibility. The second possibility is even more extreme, which is that when everybody you‚Äôve ever met or had any commercial contact with can generate enormous amounts of sort of mere content at almost nil cost, then the competition for individual human attention, when you remove that level of friction that was involved in content creation, simply becomes intolerable to all consumers. The only way you do it is you do an advertising agency backwards, which is the consumer appoints an advertising agency to keep them informed of interesting and stimulating things. And so you reverse the direction of travel, which is it‚Äôs the consumer appointing an agent on agentic AI to go and look for goods and services, rather than the goods and services looking for the consumer. Love that. And I can see now that that actually, to some extent, goes back to the early days of the Internet when it was predicted, but never happened, OK, with things like the Clutrain Manifesto, written by Doc Searles, markets the conversations, OK, was one of the, was effectively one of the sort of axiomatic points made in, in the Clutrain Manifesto. And there was a prediction a long, long time ago, using a phrase which I haven‚Äôt read in print or pixels for 5 or 10, 15 years, the infomediary. In other words, it‚Äôs an agent, an informational agent operating at the behest of the buyer, effectively, looking for people who might sell to it, rather than the seller looking for people who might buy from it. That reminds me of something, Rory. So these days, there‚Äôs agents on job boards. So you‚Äôd hire an AI agent to go find an agent. So it‚Äôs getting quite meta rather than a person. It‚Äôs kind of what it reminds me of. They will be having conversations with other agents, I suspect. And then the whole question. I mean, it‚Äôs a strange thing if you think about it with the property market, that the property market only works in one direction. Typically, there are exceptions. You can appoint a buyer‚Äôs agent, and that happens at the level of very rich people. Okay. Just before we close, Rory, question. If somebody is building brands, thinking through a problem and listening to this podcast, what would your top three tips be to somebody in that state where they‚Äôre grappling with something? What would you recommend for folks to think about? I‚Äôm thinking three quick fire tips from Rory on problem reframing. The first thing is stop talking about what a brand is and talking instead start talking about what it can do. Because one of the problems I think and one of the reasons I think we undervalue brands. And Matt Johnson, who wrote a book called Brands Mean Business, a fantastic book, he‚Äôs a neuroscientist. His phrase is, having a great brand means you get to play the game of capitalism on easy mode. In other words, people inherently trust you more, people are happier basically making an impulse purchase from a brand than they are from someone they‚Äôve never heard of. People are happier working for that company, people work longer and probably for less money for that company, that company that embellishes people‚Äôs CVs. When the company CEO rings somebody else up, they return his call. So a brand has an effect in lots and lots of ways, which I think grow, by the way, exponentially with brand fame. Okay, and we shouldn‚Äôt be afraid of simply saying a large part of branding is being famous. It can be being niche famous or it can be being broadly famous. Depends on what kind of business the brand exists to serve. But the first point I make is that one of the things I think we tend to do is we tend to have a very Newtonian approach to investment in brands, which is we define what the brand activity is supposed to do very narrowly, and we then measure the value of that activity only to the extent that it obtains the objective we defined in advance. So all other positive spinoff benefits of that investment in branding, of which I would argue there are almost certainly many, okay, all of those get lost because we‚Äôre defining in advance what we want that this thing to do. We also, I would argue, also tend to measure the value of a brand relative to competing brands, okay, Samsung versus LG, okay, when the real value of a brand consists in having a brand at all, okay. So all of you, both of you, I think, if you went to buy a television and there was a television from Samsung or LG, you would pay a couple of hundred bucks more for that television than you would from a television from a brand you‚Äôd never heard of, right? Equity, yeah. Just because they‚Äôve got reputational skin in the game, you know, they have more to lose from selling a bad product. They have, you know, they are reputational fragile. There‚Äôs a limit to how bad any of their products can be. You know, I bought lots of things from Samsung. Some of them are good. Some of them are very good. Never bought anything from Samsung that‚Äôs terrible, right? Okay. Now, all of those things effectively allow you to command a fairly significant premium in the marketplace. But what we‚Äôre doing is you‚Äôre often comparing one brand versus another competitor brand, whereas, of course, the real value of the brand consists in the fact that you are actually famous, okay? A lot of that is hard. It‚Äôs harder to measure the effect that a brand has on price premium versus sales. So, you know, in many cases, we‚Äôre looking for brand value and completely the wrong place. But the other thing is, don‚Äôt ask what a brand is, ask what it can do. And actually, then you realize that you can use your brand in multiple ways, okay? And I would actually argue, there‚Äôs a very, very astute guy who is called Dale Harrison on LinkedIn, who‚Äôs a B2B marketer and an absolute genius, in my opinion. And one of his points is, it‚Äôs completely wrong to measure marketing investment on the basis of ROI. Yeah. He says, there are lots of areas of business expenditure which you engage in. So he said, if you were building a factory and someone said, we need to put a roof on the factory to stop the machinery getting wet, nobody would say, I need you to give me the ROI on the roof, okay? It is just a necessary component of whatever it is you do. Okay. And consequently, this ROI thing, we effectively thought, wouldn‚Äôt it be great? Wouldn‚Äôt it make our lives so much easier as marketers if we could actually quantify the value of everything we did? Well, unfortunately, the downside of this is that in the act of quantification, we‚Äôre almost certainly undervaluing or misrepresenting the value of everything we do. And we made it impossible to do anything that you can‚Äôt measure. Back to my initial point about direct marketing, you‚Äôre never allowed to do anything you couldn‚Äôt quantify. Yeah. And so you go, hey, I think it would be great. Okay. I think it would be great if we sent our customers a birthday card or a Christmas card. How will we measure the effect on that? Well, you could measure the effect on it. Obviously, you could take 50% of your customers and not send them a birthday card and see if there was any. One very interesting thing, which I don‚Äôt think has been experimented with nearly enough, by the way, is there‚Äôs a small business I buy from in Kent, occasionally buy clothes from. And I suppose I‚Äôm quite a regular customer of theirs. And at Christmas, they literally sent me just a box of goodies. It was probably 20 or 30 pounds worth of goodies. Now, to be honest, if I‚Äôm being really cynical, it might have been stuff they weren‚Äôt going to sell or they weren‚Äôt going to sell very quickly or whatever. But it was nice stuff like water bottles. And actually, you know, I gave some of it to my kids. I kept some of it myself. Now, it occurred to me that I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre testing that to see what effect it has. But it‚Äôs interesting to me that one thing I would like to test for a lot of brands is an act of fairly extreme generosity. Now, obviously, it has to make economic sense over time, okay? But if that means I order four times from that brand every year rather than twice from that brand every year, they‚Äôre in quite a high margin business, to be honest, okay? It‚Äôs sort of relatively expensive clothing or things of that kind. Then actually, that 30-pound investment, which to me was the most amazing bit of marketing I‚Äôve received in about, you know, 10 years, is actually not particularly expensive. You know, it occurs to me that the finance people are going to hate this idea. I think there are a whole load of things in marketing which we‚Äôve never tested that might really, really work. And the reason we‚Äôve never tested them is not because they don‚Äôt work, because it‚Äôs too hard to prove that they do, or too slow to prove that they do. Yeah, yeah, it‚Äôs a major‚Ä¶ We are obsessed with ROI, aren‚Äôt we? Absolutely, in this game. Okay, the other thing is we‚Äôre obsessed with data, but as Roger Martin says, there‚Äôs no data about the future. And strategy fundamentally is about the future. Definitely. There‚Äôs data which is indicative of possible futures, okay? But there‚Äôs no data about the future. And so this quest for certainty and our obsession with avoiding ambiguity and avoiding being in a state of uncertainty and ambiguity is really, really critical because everybody effectively in business now is involved in an arse-covering exercise under the guise of rigor, to be honest. We‚Äôre back with the dragons. Yeah. Yeah, we are. Yeah. Brilliant. Well, look, I know time is virtually up, Rory, and I just want to thank you personally for‚Ä¶ It was great. We met last year in Manchester, and it‚Äôs so kind of you for agreeing to come on on our little show. Final kind of question, if folks want to connect more with you, understand more about your thinking, follow you in any way, like how can we digest Rory Sutherland‚Äôs content? Where do we go to? I mean, YouTube appears to be the repository for most things. TikTok is also searchable if you want short form at me. I also write an article, Fortnightly and the Spectator, which I‚Äôve done for about 15 years. So if you go to spectator.co.uk, you can search by author and you‚Äôll have effectively, two hardback books worth of various spectator writings over the last 12 or 13 years, quite heavily on behavioral science and technology. Because the interplay between them obviously fascinates me because when you think about it, okay, the most interesting thing you can imagine about the mysteries of psychology is, a company as rich as Apple and as intelligent as Apple, can produce the Apple Vision Pro, okay, and literally launch it with absolutely no idea whether the thing is going to be popular or not. Now, I would argue that the only answer to that question of what is, you know, and by the way, I have a very, very interesting take on a lot of those technologies, which is, if you read a book by Andy Clarke called The Experience Machine, his hypothesis is that most of what we perceive is a prediction, and we simply use our optic nerves and our auditory function and smell and everything else to revise for prediction error, okay, very much like a JPEG, you have an expectation value for each pixel, and you only use data to the extent the pixel differs from the expectation value, okay? And that means you need much less bandwidth to actually construct a view of the world, okay? Because you don‚Äôt have to look at everything in raw mode, afresh every millisecond. You can‚Äôt, it‚Äôs impossible, right? It‚Äôs impossible, impossible. You couldn‚Äôt process it, it‚Äôd be a totally inefficient use of bandwidth and data, okay? So instead, we‚Äôve got a JPEG, Consciousness is an SNMPG, you know, at some level, okay? By the way, I think that probably explains why magic works, by the way, magic tricks, why they work. It also, there are some other wonderful demonstrations of things which, there‚Äôs a particular sort of noise, which is totally like white noise, until you put the text underneath and then you can hear the whole sentence, okay? You know, it explains Mondagreens, you know, how you mishear. Have you ever heard, it‚Äôs a Brenda Lee and it‚Äôs a Christmas song, and almost everybody British hears the lyrics as, Later, we‚Äôll have some f***ing pie and do some caroling. It‚Äôs actually pumpkin pie, but my hunch is that because British people aren‚Äôt really familiar with pumpkin pie, we actually hear, I don‚Äôt know whether there‚Äôs a transatlantic difference in terms of that mishearing, but it‚Äôs a prediction, right? What we‚Äôre perceiving is a prediction, right? And so sometimes you want, sometimes I would argue, you want to optimize for surprise and sometimes you want to optimize for predictability depending on what you‚Äôre trying to do. But what was I going to say there? Oh yeah, that once you understand that, you‚Äôll have to look at what we do differently, fundamentally. The reason I bring that back to Apple Vision Pro is I don‚Äôt think 3D vision is actually much of a thing. I think most of the 3D-ness in our environment, if you close one eye, okay, it‚Äôs not like you lose that much perception about your environment. I‚Äôve now got my right eye closed. My right eye is a bit f***ed anyway because I had a detached retina. But with my right eye closed, I can perfectly well see where things are placed in relative. I wouldn‚Äôt be very good at putting a pen top back on close. And I probably wouldn‚Äôt be great at catching certain cricket balls because of that. I‚Äôm not saying that 3D vision is irrelevant. I‚Äôm saying it doesn‚Äôt play that bigger part in our perception. And consequently, actually, I think augmented reality, I think they need to‚Ä¶ If you notice, 3D cinema becomes a thing about every 35 years. And that‚Äôs because a generation grows up who‚Äôs never learned to find it uninteresting. And then it becomes a novelty and then it dies off. And 35 years later, someone else goes, we‚Äôve got to do this 3D. Now, there is an Apple thing called Google Starline, Project Starline, which is 3D video conferencing one-on-one, which is interesting because it may have psychological effects where it‚Äôs less tiring, whatever it may be. I don‚Äôt know. But my argument is that 3D is just not that big a deal in terms of human perception. And actually in a weird kind of way, we don‚Äôt want it. And I think the only way to understand that is understanding Andy Clarke‚Äôs notion that it gets into really deep stuff like free energy principle, which I don‚Äôt know what to think about. I can‚Äôt understand it. But ultimately, I think Andy Clarke‚Äôs book is really accessible and it makes its case very, very well. Amazing. Amazing. Brilliant. Well, look, Rory, thank you so much for giving up your time for coming on. We really appreciate you. I would also add to your comment that folks should get this book, Alchemy, which Rory has written and it‚Äôs fantastic, full of amazing insights around behavioral science and these sort of weird, quirky things that we all do and, you know, irrationally, but actually there is some rationale behind it. No, no, no, there is. Once you understand what the person is trying to do. Once you get it, yeah. The point is, we don‚Äôt always understand what we ourselves are trying to do. So it feels irrational, but there is rationality. Absolutely. So get hold of that book. And Rory, I guess that just leaves us to say thank you and have a lovely rest of your day. Absolutely.

From AI-generated art to chatbots in customer service, every sector is seemingly poised for disruption. It‚Äôs not just in your news feed every day ‚Äì venture capital is pouring in, while CEOs are eager to declare their companies ‚ÄúAI-first‚Äù. But for those who remember the lofty promises of other technologies that have since faded from memory, there‚Äôs an uncanny sense of d√©j√† vu. In 2017, it was blockchain that promised to transform every industry. Companies added ‚Äúblockchain‚Äù to their name and watched stock prices skyrocket, regardless of whether the technology was actually used, or how. Now, a similar trend is emerging with AI. What‚Äôs unfolding is not just a wave of innovation, but a textbook example of a tech hype cycle. We‚Äôve been here many times before. The tech hype cycle, first defined by the research firm Gartner, describes how emerging technologies rise on a wave of inflated promises and expectations, crash into disillusionment and, eventually, find a more realistic and useful application. Recognising the signs of this cycle is crucial. It helps in distinguishing between genuine technological shifts and passing fads driven by speculative investment and good marketing. It can also mean the difference between making a good business decision and a very costly mistake. Meta, for example, invested more than US$40 billion into the metaverse idea while seemingly chasing their own manufactured tech hype, only to abandon it later.

Presented as a revolutionary technology, blockchain offered a decentralised way to record and verify transactions, unlike traditional systems that rely on central authorities or databases. US soft drinks company Long Island Iced Tea Corporation became Long Blockchain Corporation and saw its stock rise 400% overnight, despite having no blockchain product. Kodak launched a vague cryptocurrency called KodakCoin, sending its stock price soaring. These developments were less about innovation and more about speculation, chasing short-term gains driven by hype. Most blockchain projects never delivered real value. Companies rushed in, driven by fear of missing out and the promise of technological transformation. But the tech wasn‚Äôt ready, and the solutions it supposedly offered were often misaligned with real industry problems. Companies tried everything, from tracking pet food ingredients on blockchain, to launching loyalty programs with crypto tokens, often without clear benefits or better alternatives. In the end, about 90% of enterprise blockchain solutions failed by mid-2019. Fast-forward to 2023, and the same pattern started playing out with AI. Digital media company BuzzFeed saw its stock jump more than 100% after announcing it would use AI to generate quizzes and content. Financial services company Klarna replaced 700 workers with an AI chatbot, claiming it could handle millions of customer queries. The results were mostly negative. Klarna soon saw a decline in customer satisfaction and had to walk back its strategy, rehiring humans for customer support this year. BuzzFeed‚Äôs AI content push failed to save its struggling business, and its news division later shut down. Tech media company CNET published AI-generated articles riddled with errors, damaging its credibility. These are not isolated incidents. They‚Äôre signals that AI, like blockchain, was being over hyped. There are three main forces at play: inflated expectations, short-term view and flawed implementation. Tech companies, under pressure from investors and media narratives, overpromise what AI can do. Leaders pitch vague and utopian concepts of ‚Äútransformation‚Äù without the infrastructure or planning to back them up. And many rush to implement, riding the hype wave. They are often hindered by a short-term view of what alignment with the new tech hype can do for their company, ignoring the potential downsides. They roll out untested systems, underestimate complexity or even the necessity, and hope that novelty alone will drive the return on investment. The result is often disappointment ‚Äì not because the technology lacks potential, but because it‚Äôs applied too broadly, too soon, and with too little planning and oversight. Like blockchain, AI is a legitimate technological innovation with real, transformative potential. Often, these technologies simply need time to find the right application. While the initial blockchain hype has faded, the technology has found a practical niche in areas like ‚Äúasset tokenization‚Äù within financial markets. This allows assets like real estate or company shares to be represented by digital tokens on the blockchain, enabling easier, faster and cheaper trading. The same pattern can be expected with generative AI. The current AI hype cycle appears to be tapering off, and the consequences of rushed or poorly thought-out implementations will likely become more visible in the coming years. However, this decline in hype doesn‚Äôt signal the end of generative AI‚Äôs relevance. Rather, it marks the beginning of a more grounded phase where the technology can find the most suitable applications. One of the clearest takeaways so far is that AI should be used to enhance human productivity, not replace it. From people pushing back against the use of AI to replace them, to AI making frequent and costly mistakes, human oversight paired with AI-enhanced productivity is increasingly seen as the most likely path forward. Recognising the patterns of tech hype is essential for making smarter decisions. Instead of rushing to adopt every new innovation based on inflated promises, a measured, problem-driven approach leads to more meaningful outcomes. Long-term success comes from thoughtful experimentation, implementation, and clear purpose, not from chasing trends or short-term gains. Hype should never dictate strategy; real value lies in solving real problems. Write an article and join a growing community of more than 205,600 academics and researchers from 5,226 institutions.
