“What will AI mean for jobs?” may be the single most-asked question about the technology category that dominates Silicon Valley, pop culture, and our politics. Fears that AI will put us out of work routinely top opinion polls. Bosses are citing AI as the reason they’re slashing human staff. Firms like Duolingo and Klarna have laid off workers in loudly touted shifts to AI, and DOGE used its “AI-first” strategy to justify firing federal workers. Meanwhile, tech executives are pouring fuel on the flames. Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, claims that AI products like his will soon eliminate half of entry level white collar jobs, and replace up to 20% of all jobs, period. OpenAI’s Sam Altman says that AI systems can replace entry level workers, and will soon be able to code “like an experienced software engineer.” Elsewhere, he’s been blunter, claiming "Jobs are definitely going to go away, full stop." But the question remains: What’s actually happening on the ground, right now? There’s no doubt that lots of firms are investing heavily in AI and trying to use it to improve productivity and cut labor costs. And it’s clear that in certain industries, especially creative ones, the rise of cheap AI-generated content is hitting workers hard. Yet broader economic data on AI impacts suggests a more limited disruption. Two and a half years after the rise of ChatGPT, after a torrent of promises, CEO talk, and think pieces, how is—or isn’t—AI really reshaping work? About a month ago, I put out a call in hopes of finding some answers. I had a vague idea for a project I’d call AI Killed My Job, that would seek to examine the many ways that management has used AI to impact, transform, degrade, or, yes, try to replace workers outright. It’s premised on the notion that we’ve heard lots of speculation and plenty of sales pitches for AI automation—but we have not heard nearly enough from the workers experiencing the phenomenon themselves. The title is somewhat tongue-in-cheek; we recognize that AI is not sentient, that it’s management, not AI, that fires people, but also that there are many ways that AI can “kill” a job, by sapping the pleasure one derives from work, draining it of skill and expertise, or otherwise subjecting it to degradation. So, I wrote a post here on the newsletter explaining the idea, posted a call to social media, and asked for testimonials on various news shows and podcasts. I was floored by the response. The stories came rolling in. I heard from lots of folks I expected to—artists, illustrators, copywriters, translators—and many I didn’t—senior engineers, managers of marketing departments, construction industry consultants. And just about everyone in between. I got so many responses, and so many good ones, that I resolved to structure the project as a series of pieces that center the workers’ voices and testimonies themselves, and share their experiences in their own words. Because I got so many accounts, I decided to break down the articles by field and background. Starting, today, with an industry that’s at once the source of the automating technology and feeling some of its most immediate impacts. Today, we’ll begin by looking at how AI is killing jobs in the tech industry. I heard from workers who recounted how managers used AI to justify laying them off, to speed up their work, and to make them take over the workload of recently terminated peers. I heard from workers at the biggest tech giants and the smallest startups—from workers at Google, TikTok, Adobe, Dropbox, and CrowdStrike, to those at startups with just a handful of employees. I heard stories of scheming corporate climbers using AI to consolidate power inside the organization. I heard tales of AI being openly scorned in company forums by revolting workers. And yes, I heard lots of sad stories of workers getting let go so management could make room for AI. I received a message from one worker who wrote to say they were concerned for their job—and a follow-up note just weeks later to say that they’d lost it. Of the scores of responses I received, I’ve selected 15 that represent these trends; some are short and offer a snapshot of various AI impacts or a quick look at the future of employment. Others are longer accounts with many insights into what it means to work in tech in the time of AI—and what it might mean to work, period. The humor, grace, and candor in many of these testimonials often amazed me. I cannot thank those who wrote them enough. Some of these workers took great risks to share their stories at a time when it is, in tech, a legitimate a threat to one’s job to speak up about AI. For this reason, I’ve agreed to keep these testimonies anonymous, to protect the identities of the workers who shared them. Generative AI is the most hyped, most well-capitalized technology of our generation, and its key promise, that it will automate jobs, desperately needs to be examined. This is the start of that examination. Three very quick notes before we move on. First, this newsletter, and projects like AI Killed My Job, require a lot of work to produce. If you find this valuable, please consider becoming a paid subscriber. With enough support, I can expand such projects with human editors, researchers, and even artists—like Koren Shadmi, who I was able to pay a small fee for the 100% human-generated art above, thanks to subscribers like you. Second, if your job has been impacted by AI, and you would like to share your story as part of this project, please do so at AIkilledmyjob@pm.me. I would love to hear your account and will keep your account confidential as I would any source. Third, some news: I'm partnering with the good folks at More Perfect Union to produce a video edition of AI Killed My Job. If you're interested in participating, or are willing to sit for an on camera interview to discuss how AI has impacted your livelihood, please reach out. Thanks for reading, human, and an extra thanks to all those whose support makes this work possible. Tech is just the first industry I plan on covering; I have countless more stories in fields from law to media to customer service to art to share. Stay tuned, and onwards. This post was edited by Mike Pearl. Content moderator at TikTok. I have a story. I worked for TikTok as a content moderator from August 2022 to April 2024, and though I was not replaced by AI, I couldn't help noticing that some of the trainers were. In my first year, I would be assigned training videos that featured real people either reading or acting. These trainings would be viewed internally only, not available to the public. Topics could be things like learning about biases, avoiding workplace harassment, policy refreshers, and so on. In the early months of my time there, the trainings were usually recorded slideshows with humans reading and elaborating on the topics. Sometimes they were videos that included people acting out scenarios. Over time, the human trainers were replaced with AI by way of generated voices or even people going over the materials in the videos. It was honestly scary to me. I don't know how to explain it. I remember that they had added embellishments to make them seem more human. I distinctly remember a woman with an obscure black tattoo on her bicep. The speech and movement wasn't as clean as what I see in videos now, but it was close enough to leave me with an eerie sensation. As far as content moderation goes, much of that is already done by AI across all major social media platforms. There has historically been a need for human moderators to differentiate grey areas that technology doesn't understand. (Example: someone being very aggressive in a video and using profanity, but it not being directed at an individual. AI might think the video involves bullying another user and ban the video, but a moderator can review it and see that there's no problem/no targeted individual.) It was honestly scary to me. I don't know how to explain it. I remember that they had added embellishments to make them seem more human. I think as AI models continue to learn, however, moderators will be replaced completely. That's just a theory, but I'm already seeing the number of these job postings dwindling and hearing murmurs from former coworkers on LinkedIn about widespread layoffs. Software engineer at Google. I have been a software engineer at Google for several years. With the recent introduction of generative AI-based coding assistance tools, we are already seeing a decline in open source code quality 1 (defined as "code churn" - how often a piece of code is written only to be deleted or fixed within a short time). I am also starting to see a downward trend of (a) new engineers' readiness in doing the work, (b) engineers' willingness to learn new things, and (c) engineers' effort to put in serious thoughts in their work. Specifically, I have recently observed first hand some of my colleagues at the start of their career heavily relying on AI-based coding assistance tools. Their "code writing" consists of iteratively and alternatingly hitting the Tab key (to accept AI-generated code) and watching for warning underlines 2 indicating there could be an error (which have been typically based on static analysis, but recently increasingly including AI-generated warnings). These young engineers - squandering their opportunities to learn how things actually work - would briefly glance at the AI-generated code and/or explanation messages and continue producing more code when "it looks okay." I also saw experienced engineers in senior positions when faced with an important data modeling task decided to generate the database schema with generative AI. I originally thought it was merely a joke but recently found out that they basically just used the generated schema in actual (internal) services essentially without modification, even if there are some obvious glaring issues. Now those issues have propagated to other code that needs to interact with that database and it will be more costly to fix, so chances are people will just carry on, pretending everything is working as intended. All of these will result in poorer software quality. "Anyone can write code" sounds good on paper, but when bad code is massively produced, it hurts everyone including those who did not ask for it and have been trusting the software industry. Former staff engineer at Dropbox. I was part of the 20% RIF at Dropbox at the end of October.3 The stated reason for this was to focus on Dash, their AI big-bet. The 10% RIF in 2023 was also to focus more on Dash. How did this eliminate my job? Internal reprioritization, that's how. I was moving into an area that was scheduled to focus on improving Dropbox's reliability stance in 2025 and beyond, intended to be a whole year initiative. It's tricky to go into details, but the aim was to take a holistic view of disaster preparedness beyond the long standing disaster scenarios we had been using and were already well prepared for. Projects like this are common in well established product-lines like Dropbox's file-sync offering, as they take a comprehensive overview of both audit compliance (common criteria change every year) and market expectations. This initiative was canned as part of the RIF, and the staffing allocated to it largely let go. Such a move is consistent with prioritizing Dash, a brand new product that does not have dominant market-share. Startups rarely prioritize availability to the extent Dropbox's file-sync product does because the big business problem faced by a startup is obtaining market-share, not staying available for your customers. As products (and companies) mature, stability starts gaining priority as part of customer retention engineering. Once a product becomes dominant in the sector, stability engineering often is prioritized over feature development. Dropbox file-sync has been at this point for several years. With Dash being a new product, and company messaging being that Dash is the future of Dropbox, a reliability initiative of the type I was gearing up for was not in line with being a new product scrapping for market-share. Thus, this project and the people assigned to it were let go. Blood in the Machine: What are you planning next? This job market is absolutely punishing. I had a .gov job for the .com crash, a publicly funded .edu job for the 2008 crash, and a safe place inside a Dropbox division making money hand over fist during the COVID crash (Dropbox Sign more than doubled document throughput over 2020). This is my first tech winter on the bench, and I'm getting zero traction. 37 job apps in the months I've been looking, 4 got me talking to a human (2 of which were referrals), all bounced me after either the recruiter or technical screens. Never made it to a virtual onsite. This has to do with me being at the Staff Engineer level, and getting there through non-traditional means. The impact is when I go through the traditional screens for a high level engineer I flame out, because that wasn't my job. The little feedback I've gotten from my hunt is a mix of 'over-qualified for this position' and 'failed the technical screen.' Attempting to branch out to other positions like Product Manager, or Technical Writer have failed due to lack of resume support and everyone hiring Senior titles. I may be retired now. I'm 50, but my money guy says I've already made retirement-money; any work I do now is to increase lifestyle, build contingency funds, or fund charitable initiatives. The industry is absolutely toxic right now as cost-cutting is dominating everything but the most recently funded startups. We haven't hit an actual recession in stock-prices due to aggressive cost and stock-price engineering everywhere, and cost-engineering typically tanks internal worker satisfaction. I've been on the bench for six months, money isn't a problem. Do I want to stick my head back into the cortisol amplifier? Not really. Tech worker, marketing department. I used to work at a mid-sized Silicon Valley startup that does hardware. The overall project is super demanding, and reliant on skilled, hands-on work. Our marketing team was tiny but committed. My manager, the CMO4, was one of the rare ones: deeply experienced and seasoned in the big ones, thoughtful, and someone who genuinely loved his craft. Last year, a new hire came in to lead another department. Genuinely believe she is a product of the "LinkedIn hustler / thought-leadership / bullshit titles" culture. Super performative. Recently and during a cross-functional meeting with a lot of people present, she casually referred to a ChatGPT model she was fine-tuning as our "Chief Marketing Officer"—in front of my manager. She claimed it was outperforming us. It wasn’t—it was producing garbage. But the real harm was watching someone who’d given decades to his field get humiliated, not by a machine, but by a colleague weaponizing it. Today, in the name of “AI efficiency,” a lot of people saw the exit door and my CMO got PIPd.5 The irony here is two-fold: one, it does not seem that the people who left were victims of a turn to "vibe coding" and I suspect that the "AI efficiency" was used as an excuse to make us seem innovative even during this crisis. Two, this is a company whose product desperately needs real human care.

AI killed my previous job, and it's killing my current one. I used to work at Adobe... Despite constantly telling my team and manager I strongly disliked GenAI and didn't want to be involved in GenAI projects, when AI hype really started picking up, my team was disbanded and I was separated from my teammates to be put on a team specifically working on GenAI. I quit, because I didn't see any way for me to organize, obstruct, or resist without being part of building something that went against my values. I often wonder whether I should have let myself get fired instead. This was before we learned that Adobe trained Firefly on Stock contributions without contributors' opt-in, and before the Terms of Service debacle, so I'm glad I wasn't there for that at least. Now I work in the public sector. It's better in most ways, but I have to spend ridiculous amounts of time explaining to colleagues and bosses why no, we can't just "use AI" to complete the task at hand. It feels like every week there's a new sales pitch from a company claiming that their AI tool will solve all our problems—companies are desperate to claw back their AI investment, and they're hoping to find easy marks in the public sector. I don't want to be a curmudgeon! I like tech and I just want to do tech stuff without constantly having to call bullshit on AI nonsense. I'd rather be doing my actual job, and organizing with my colleagues. It's exhausting to deal with credulous magical thinking from decision-makers who should know better. *My work at Adobe* When I was at Adobe, I worked in Document Cloud. So like Acrobat, not Photoshop. For most of my time there, my job was evaluating machine learning models to see if they were good enough to put in a product. The vast majority of the time, Document Cloud leadership killed machine learning projects before they ended up in a product. That was either because the quality wasn't good enough, or because of a lack of "go-to-market.” In other words, middle and upper management generally did not accept that machine learning is only appropriate for solving a small subset of problems, which need to be rigorously-scoped and well-defined. They were looking for "everything machines" (these are derogatory air quotes, not a direct quote) that would be useful for huge numbers of users. By the time AI hype really started to pick up, I had moved to a team working on internal tools. I wasn't building or evaluating machine learning models and I was outspoken about not wanting to do that. When LLM hype got really big, senior leadership started describing it as an "existential threat" (that is a direct quote as far as I remember), and re-organizing teams to get LLMs into Document Cloud as soon as possible. Adobe did not do *anything* quickly, so this was a huge change. A big red flag for me was that rather than building our own LLMs, Adobe used OpenAI's chatbots. When I asked about all of OpenAI's ethical and environmental issues, management made generic gestures towards being concerned but never actually said or did anything substantive about it. At that point I quit, because I had specifically been saying I didn't want to be involved in GenAI, and given the rushed and sloppy nature of the rollout, I didn't want my name anywhere near it. *Colleagues' reactions* Definitely I knew some colleagues who didn't like what Adobe was doing. There were a lot of people who privately agreed with me but publicly went along with the plan. Generally because they were worried about job security, but also there's a belief at Adobe that the company's approach to AI isn't perfect but it's more ethical than the competition. Despite being a huge company, teams were mostly isolated from each other, and as far as I know there wasn't a Slack channel for talking about AI concerns or anything like that. When I asked critical questions during department meetings or expressed frustration with leadership for ignoring concerns, people told me to go through the chain of command and not to be too confrontational. Looking back, I wish my goal hadn't been to persuade managers but instead to organize fellow workers. I was probably too timid in my attempts to organize. I do regret that I didn't try having more explicit 1-on-1's about this, even though it would have been risky. Obviously I was very lucky/privileged to have enough savings to even consider quitting or letting myself get fired in this shitty job market, and I often wonder if I could have done more to combine strategies and resources with other colleagues so that fighting back would be less risky for everyone. *Impact of AI on work* When the GenAI push started, a lot more of my colleagues started working nights and weekends, which was rare (and even discouraged) before then. Managers paid lip service to Adobe's continuing commitment to work-life balance, but in practice that didn't match up with the sense of urgency and the unrealistic deadlines. I'm not aware of anyone who got fired or laid off specifically because of getting replaced by AI, and it looks like teams are still hiring. Although for what it's worth, in general Adobe does not do layoffs these days, but instead they pressure people into quitting by taking work away from them, putting them on PIPs, that kind of thing. I found out that a colleague who had been struggling with a simple programming task for over a month—and refusing frequent offers for help—was struggling because they were trying to prompt an LLM for the solution and trying to understand the LLM's irrelevant and poorly-organized output. They could have finished the work in a day or two if they had just asked for help clarifying what they needed to do. I and their other teammates would gladly have provided non-judgmental support if they had asked. Our team found out that a software vendor (I can't say which one but it was one of the big companies pushing Agentic AI) was using AI to route our service request tickets. As a result, our tickets were being misclassified, which meant that they were failing to resolve high-priority service disruptions that we had reported. We wasted days on this, if not weeks. *My current job* At my current job, I'm basically a combination of programmer and database administrator. I like the work way more than what I did at Adobe. Much like the corporate world, there are a lot of middle and upper managers who want to "extract actionable insights" from data, but lack the information literacy and technical knowledge to understand what they can (or should) ask for. And the people below them are often unwilling to push back on unreasonable expectations. It's very frustrating to explain to executives that the marketing pitches they hear about AI are not reflective of reality. It makes us seem like we're afraid of change, or trying to prevent "progress" and "efficiency." So I would say the private and public sector have this in common: the higher up you go in the organization, the more enthusiastic people are about "AI,” and the less they understand about the software, and (not coincidentally) the less they understand what their department actually does. And to the extent that workers are opposed to "AI,” they're afraid of organizing, because it feels like executives are looking for reasons to cut staff. Tech worker. So this is sort of an anecdote in the opposite direction of AI taking jobs—in a recent interview process at a mature startup in the travel tech space, part of the offer negotiations were essentially me stating “yeah I don’t want to work here if you expect me to use or produce LLM-based features or products” (this is relevant as the role is staff data scientist, so ostensibly on supply side of AI tooling), and them responding with “yeah if you want to do LLM work this isn’t the place for you.” Though my network isn’t extensive, I feel like this is a growing sentiment in the small- and medium-tech space - my primary social media is on a tech-centric instance of the fediverse (hachyderm.io) and more often than not when I see the #GetFediHired hashtag, it’s accompanied by something akin to “no crypto, no AI” (also no Microsoft Teams, but I digress). Computer programmer. Our department has now brought in copilot, and we are being encouraged to use it for writing and reviewing code. Obviously we are told that we need to review the AI outputs, but it is starting to kill my enjoyment for my work; I love the creative problem solving aspect to programming, and now the majority of that work is trying to be passed onto AI, with me as the reviewer of the AI's work. This isn't why I joined this career, and it may be why I leave it if it continues to get worse. Software engineer at a large tech firm. All my life, I’ve wanted to be an artist. Any kind of artist. I still daydream of a future where I spend my time frolicking in my own creativity while my own work brings me uninterrupted prosperity. Yet this has not come to pass, and despite graduate level art degrees, the only income I can find is the result of a second-class coding job for a wildly capitalist company. It’s forty hours a week of the dullest work imaginable, but it means I have time to indulge in wishful thinking and occasionally, a new guitar. Real use cases where AI can be used to do work that regular old programming could not are so rare that when I discovered one two weeks ago, I asked for a raise in the same breath as the pitch. I am experiencing exactly what you describe. There’s been layoffs recently, and my company is investing heavily in AI, even though they’re not sure yet how best to make it do anything that our corporate overlords imagine it should do. From the c-level, they push around ideas about how we could code AI to do work, but in reality, those on the ground are only using AI to help write code that does the work, as the code always has. Real use cases where AI can be used to do work that regular old programming could not are so rare that when I discovered one two weeks ago, I asked for a raise in the same breath as the pitch. And here I am, five hundred words into this little essay, and I’ve barely touched on AI! Nor have I even touched any of the AI tools that are so proudly thrust into my face to produce this. I’ve played around with AI tools for creative writing, and while they’re good at fixing my most embarrassing grammar errors, none of them have helped me in my effort to bridge the gap between my humble talent as a creative and my aspirations for my effort. There’s a meme going on Pinterest that I believe sums up this moment: “We wanted robots to clean the dishes and do our laundry, so we could draw pictures and write stories. Instead they gave us robots to draw pictures and write stories, so we could clean dishes and do laundry.” This feels very true in the sense that human talent is getting valued not for the time it took to gain it and the ingenuity it proves, but for how well it feeds the greed of those who can afford to invest in bulk. But art in capitalism has always been this way, hasn’t it? If we don’t have a patron, we might as well eat our paint, and AI only tightens that grip that the privileged have held us in for centuries. I’ve never been so fortunate to consider the work that funds my DoorDash addiction to be my passion’s output, and perhaps that’s why I’m not afraid of what I’ll lose. But it’s that same work that has me sharing notes with fellow programmers, and many of them will say with blunt honesty that they’re worried they’ll be replaced by AI. This is a vulnerability I rarely see from the group of people who often elevated their work as valuable and practical, as opposed to my efforts to learn how to make music and poetry, which were wasteful and useless. But I am like a plant that learned how to grow on rocks and eat insects. In a meeting soon, I’m going to level with them: Don’t you understand? This work, what we do day in and day out for a soulless organization that drives profit from stealing our essence, this is the laundry! And if they think I’ll just throw that work into a machine and let it do all the work for me, they’re right. But it’s a machine that automates the work of running machines that automates the work that people used to do by hand, while constantly stealing glances at the clock, just waiting for the moment when they could be out from under the gaze of some righteous egomaniac. Maybe this is just the perspective of someone who’s seen her work, of almost any type, get devalued with such regularity that it’s hard to imagine the robots making it any more difficult than it already is. No one’s ever really cared about my Instagram posts. No one pretends that my code will change the world. Perhaps, someday, I’ll make more money while babysitting on the weekends. I spend a lot of time thinking about things that haven’t worked out for me, and for us, as a society, and I think some of our worst failures come from moments when we can’t differentiate between the ability to use machines and our abilities as machines. Last week I made a pie for my family, and I obviously didn’t get paid for it. Somewhere off in the offices of the illuminati, an account will calculate the value of the oven that baked the crust, the refrigerator that cooled the filling, the bougie pie dish that made my effort look food-blog ready. But there’s no monetary value in the work I did that literally put food on the table, and I rarely, if ever, get paid to perform the music I love, or receive more than pocket change for the short stories I publish. I keep thinking that the solution for both problems exist in some future innovation, but I can’t imagine what that invention would be, and I can’t find proof of a real connection between the two. Maybe ChatGPT knows the answer to this riddle? I can throw a penny into our new philosophy vending machine, but I might come up with a better answer myself if I think about it while I unload the dishwasher. PS I didn’t use ai to write this, also didn’t even bother to push it through an ai extruder to check the grammar. I guess I’m just feeling too lazy today to push that button! Have a nice weekend.

My workplace has been pushing AI really hard this year. Here's the latest thing they thought up: It 100% feels like testing the waters for just how unqualified and underpaid your workforce can be. Just as long as they can work the shovel of LLM they're good right? The children yearn for the (LLM) mines! Current CrowdStrike employee. I work for CrowdStrike, the leading cybersecurity company in the United States. As a current employee, I can't reveal specific details about myself. As you may have heard, CrowdStrike laid off 500 employees on May 7th, 2025. These were not underperformers. Many of them were relatively new hires. This action was presented as a strategic realignment with a special focus in "doubling down on our highest-impact opportunities," to quote CEO George Kurtz. In the internal email, he states further: AI investments accelerate execution and efficiency: AI has always been foundational to how we operate. AI flattens our hiring curve, and helps us innovate from idea to product faster. It streamlines go-to-market, improves customer outcomes, and drives efficiencies across both the front and back office. AI is a force multiplier throughout the business. So, AI has literally killed many jobs at CrowdStrike this week. I'm fortunate to be among the survivors, but I don't know for how long. Generative AI, particularly LLMs, is permeating every aspect of the company. It's in our internal chats. It's integrated into our note-taking tools. It's being used in triage, analysis, engineering, and customer communications. Every week, I'm pinged in an announcement that some new AI capability has been rolled out to me and that I am expected to make use of it. Customers who are paying for live human service packages from us are increasingly getting the output of an LLM instead. Quality Assurance reviewers have started criticizing reviewees for failing to run things through AI tools for things as trivial as spelling and grammar. Check out the front page and count the number of times "AI" is mentioned. It didn't used to be like this. CrowdStrike is currently achieving record financials. At the time I write this, CRWD is trading at $428.63 in striking range of the stock's 52-week high. The efforts of my colleagues and I to rebuild from the incident of July 19, 2024 have been rewarded with shareholder approval and 500 layoffs. Some of the impacted individuals were recent graduates of 4-year schooling who, in addition to student loans, have moving expenses because they physically relocated to Texas shortly before this RIF occurred. Many lower-level employees at CrowdStrike are big fans of generative AI; as techy people in a techy job, they fit the bill for that. Even so, many of them have become wary… of what increased AI adoption means for them and their colleagues. Some of the enthusiastic among them are beginning to realize that they're training the means of additional layoffs—perhaps their own. CrowdStrikers have been encouraged to handle the additional per capita workload by simply working harder and sometimes working longer for no additional compensation on either count. While our Machine Learning systems continue to perform with excellence, I have yet to be convinced that our usage of genAI has been productive in the context of the proofreading, troubleshooting, and general babysitting it requires. Some of the genAI tools we have available to us are just completely useless. Several of the LLMs have produced inaccuracies which have been uncritically communicated to our customers by CrowdStrikers who failed to exhibit due diligence. Those errors were caught by said customers, and they were embarrassing to us all. I would stop short of saying that the existence of genAI tools within the company is directly increasing the per capita workload, but an argument could be made of it indirectly accomplishing that. The net result is not a lightening of the load as has been so often promised. Morale is at an all-time low. Many survivors have already started investigating their options to leave either on their own terms or whenever the executives inevitably decide an LLM is adequate enough to approximately replace us. The company is very proud of its recognitions as an employer. As CrowdStrikers, we used to be proud of it too. Now we just feel betrayed. Software engineer, health tech startup. I work as a software engineer and we've been getting a push to adopt AI coding assistants in the last few months. I tried it, mostly to be able to critique, and found it super annoying, so I just stopped using it. But I'm starting to get worried. Our CEO just posted this in an internal AI dedicated Slack channel. The second message is particularly concerning. [It’s a screenshot of a message containing a comment from another developer. It reads:] "I am sufficiently AI-pilled to think that if you aren't using agentic coding tools, then you are the problem. They are good enough now that it's a skills issue. Almost everyone not using them will be unemployed in 2 years and won't know why (since they're the ones on Hacker News saying "these tools never work for me!" and it turns out they are using very bad prompts and are super defensive about it)." We've had some layoffs long before this AI wave and the company has not picked up the pace in terms of hiring since. I'm sure now they're thinking twice before hiring anyone though. The biggest change was in how the management is enthusiastically incentivizing us to start using AI. First they offered coding assistants for everyone to use, then the hackdays we had every semester turned into a week long hackathon specifically focused on AI projects. Now we have an engineer, if you can call him that, working on a project that will introduce more than 30k lines of AI generated code into our codebase, without a single unit test. It will be impossible to do a proper code review on this much code and it will become a maintenance nightmare and possibly a security hazard. I don't need to tell you how much management is cheering on that. Front end software engineer at a major software company. My job hasn't been killed yet, but there's definitely a possibility that it could be soon. I work for a major software company as a front end software engineer. I believe that there's been AI-related development for about a year and a half. It's a little hard to nail down exactly because I'm one of the few remaining US-based developers and the majority of our engineering department is in India. The teams are pretty siloed and the day-to-day of who's on what teams and what they're doing is pretty opaque. There's been a pretty steady increase of desire and pressure to start using AI tools for a while now. As a result, timelines have been getting increasingly shorter, likewise the patience of upper management. They've tried to create tools that would help with some of the day-to-day repeatable UI pieces that I work on, but the results were unusable from my end and I found that I can create them on my own in the same amount of time. The agents themselves had names and AI-generated profile pictures of minorities that aren't actually represented in the upper levels of the company, which I find kind of gross. Around October/November of last year, the CEO and President (who's the former head of Product) had decided to go all-in on AI development and integrate it in all aspects of our business. Not just engineering, but all departments (Sales, Customer Operations, People Operations, etc). Don't get a ton of insight from other departments other than I've heard that Customer Ops is hemorrhaging people and the People Ops sent an email touting that we could now use AI to write recognition messages to each other celebrating workplace successes (insulting and somewhat dystopian). On the engineering side, I think initially there was a push to be an AI leader in supply chain, so there were a lot of training courses, hackathons and (for India) AI-focused off-sites where they wanted to get broad adoption of AI tools and ideas for products that we can use AI in. Then in February, the CEO declared that what we have been doing is no longer a growth business and we were introducing an AI control tower and agents, effectively making us an AI first company. The agents themselves had names and AI-generated profile pictures of minorities that aren't actually represented in the upper levels of the company, which I find kind of gross. Since then, the CEO has been pretty insistent about AI in every communication and therefore there's an increased downward pressure to use it everywhere. He has never been as involved in the day-to-day workings of the company as he has been about AI. Most consequential is somewhere he has gotten the idea that because code can now be generated in a matter of minutes, whole SAS6 applications, like the ones we've been developing for years, can be built in a matter of days. He's read all these hype articles declaring 60-75% increase in engineering productivity. I guess there was a competitor in one of our verticals that has just come on the scene and done basically what our app can do, but with more functionality. A number things could explain this, but the conclusion has been that they used AI and made our app in a month. So ever since then, it's been a relentless stream of pressure to fully use AI everywhere to "improve efficiency" and get things out as fast as possible. They've started mandating tracking AI usage in our JIRA stories7, the CEO has led Engineering all-hands8 (he has no engineering background), and now he is mandating that we go from idea to release in a single sprint (2 weeks) or be able to explain why we're not able to meet that goal. I've been working under increasingly more compressed deadlines for about a year and am pretty burned out right now, and we haven't even started pushing the AI warp speed churn that they've proposed recently. It's been pretty well documented how inaccurate and insecure these LLMs are and, for me, it seems like we're on a pretty self-destructive path here. We ostensibly do have a company AI code of conduct, but I don't know how this proposed shift in engineering priority doesn't break every guideline. I'm not the greatest developer in the world, but I try to write solid code that works, so I've been very resistant to using LLMs in code. I want my work to be reliable and understandable in case it does need to be fixed. I don't have time to mess around and go down rabbit holes that the code chatbots would inevitably send me down. So I foresee the major bugs and outages just sky-rocketing under this new status quo. How they pitch it to us is that we can generate the code fast and have plenty of time to think about architecture, keep a good work/life balance, etc. But in practice, we will be under the gun of an endless stream of 2 week deadlines and management that won't be happy at how long everything takes or the quality of the output. The people making these decisions love the speed of code generation but never consider the accuracy and how big the problem is of even small errors perpetuated at scale. No one else is speaking up to these dangers, but I feel like if I do (well, more loudly than just to immediate low-level managers), I'll be let go. It's pretty disheartening and I would love to leave, but of course it's hard to find another job competing with all the other talented folks that have been let go through all this. Working in software development for so long and seeing so many colleagues accept that we are just prompt generators banging out substandard products has been rough. I'm imagining this must be kind of what it feels like to be in a zombie movie. I'm not sure how this all turns out, but it doesn't look great at the moment. The one funny anecdote during all this AI insanity is they had someone from GitHub demo do a live presentation on Co-Pilot and the agents. Not only was everything he demoed either unreliable or underwhelming, but he could not stop yawning loudly during his own presentation. Even the AI champions are tired. Less than a month later, the engineer emailed me a followup. And I just got laid off yesterday. The reason cited was they need full stack developers and want engineers that are in India, and not for performance. My front-end-focused position was rendered obsolete. Very plausible since they definitely prefer hiring young and less expensive developers abroad. So AI is not technically the direct cause, but definitely a factor in the background. They'll hire a bunch of new graduates to churn out whatever AI solutions that they think they can hype. Annoyingly, they did announce two new AI agents yesterday, again with faces and names of women. The positive is that they did give me a decent severance, so in the short term I'm fine, financially but also that I don't have to deal with the pressure of ridiculous deadlines. Edtech worker. I work for a small edtech startup and do all of our marketing, communications, and social media. I've always enjoyed doing our ed policy newsletter and other writing related projects. My boss absolutely loves AI, but until recently I'd been able to avoid it. A few weeks ago, my boss let me know that all of my content writing would now be done on ChatGPT so I would have more time to work on other projects. He also wants me to use AI to generate images of students, which I've luckily been able to push back on. Although he says it's a time saver, I don't actually have other projects, so not only am I creating complete slop, but I'm also left with large amounts of time to do nothing. Being forced to use AI has turned a job I liked into something I dread. As someone with a journalism background, it feels insulting to use AI instead of creating quality blog posts about education policy. Unfortunately, as a recent grad, I haven't had much luck finding another job despite applying to hundreds, so for now I have to make do with the situation, but I will say that having to use AI is making me reconsider where I'm working. Senior developer at a cloud company. I work for a cloud service provider (who will retaliate if you don't post this anonymously, unfortunately), and they're absolutely desperate for the current AI fad to be useful for something. They're completely ignoring the environmental costs (insane power requirements, draining lakes of freshwater for cooling, burning untold CPU and GPU hours that could be dedicated to something useful instead) because there's a buck to be made. They hope. But they're still greenwashing the company of course. For cloud companies, AI is a gold rush; until the bubble bursts, they can sell ridiculous amounts of expensive server time (lots and lots of CPU/GPU/memory/storage) and tons of traffic to and from the models. They're selling shovels to the gold miners, and are in a great position to charge rent if someone strikes a vein of usefulness. I can see a scenario coming fast that's going to set back software development by years But they're desperate for this to keep going. They're demanding we use AI for literally everything in our jobs. Our managers want to know what we're using AI for and what AI "innovations" we've come up with. If we're not using AI for everything, they want to know why not. I don't think we're quite at the point of this being part of our performance evaluations, but the company is famously opaque about that, so who knows. It's certainly something the employees worry about. My work involves standards compliance. Using AI for any part of it will literally double our work load because we'll have to get it to do the thing, and then carefully review and edit the output for accuracy. You can't do compliance work with vibes. What's the point of burning resources to summarize things when you need to review the original and then the output for accuracy anyway? I can see a scenario coming fast that's going to set back software development by years (decades? who knows!): C-suite: we don't need these expensive senior developers, interns can code with AI C-suite: we don't need these expensive security developers, AI can find the problems senior developers are laid off, or quit due to terrible working conditions (we're already seeing this) they're replaced with junior developers, fresh out of school... cheap, with no sense of work-life balance, and no families to distract them all the vibe coding goes straight to production because, obviously, we trust the AI and don't know any better; also we've been told to use AI for everything at some point, all the bugs and security vulnerabilities make everything so bad it actually starts impacting the bottom line uh oh, the vibe coders never progressed beyond junior skill levels, so nobody can do the code reviews, nobody can find and fix the security problems if all the fired senior developers haven't retired or found other jobs (a lot of these people want to get out of tech, because big tech has made everything terrible), they'll need to be hired back, hopefully at massive premiums due to demand If these tools were generally useful, they wouldn't need to force them on us, we'd be picking them up and running with them. At first, the exec’s AI speech was greeted by the typical heart-eyes and confetti emojis, but then I saw there were a few thumbs-down emojis thrown into the mix. This was shocking enough on its own, but then the thumbs-downs multiplied, tens and hundreds of them appearing on the screen, making those few little confettis seem weak and pathetic. I was already floored at this point, and then someone posted the first tomato… Tech worker at a well-known tech company. I work at a fairly well-known tech company currently trying to transform itself from a respected, healthy brand to a win-at-all-costs hyperscaler. The result has mostly been a lot of bullshit marketing promises pegged to vaporware, abrupt shifts in strategy that are never explained, and most of all, the rapid degrading of a once healthy, candid corporate culture into one that is intolerant of dissent, enforces constant positivity, and just this week, ominously announced that we are “shifting to a high-performance culture.” The company leadership also recently (belatedly) declared that “we are going all in on AI.” I don’t use AI. I morally object to it, for reasons I hardly need to explain to you. And now I feel like I’m hiding plain sight, terrified someone will notice I’m actually doing all my own work. We’re hiring for new roles and have been explicitly told that no candidate will be considered for *any* job unless they’re on board with AI. Every department has to show how they’re “incorporating AI into their workflows.” I heard through the grapevine that anyone so much as expressing skepticism “does not have a future with the company.” It is pretty bleak. I’d leave, but I keep hearing it’s the same everywhere. But then something insane happened. At the most recent company all-hands, typically the site of the post painful sycophancy, one of our executives gave a speech formally announcing our big AI gambit. The meeting is so big that there is no Zoom chat, so people can only directly react via emojis. At first, the exec’s AI speech was greeted by the typical heart-eyes and confetti emojis, but then I saw there were a few thumbs-down emojis thrown into the mix. This was shocking enough on its own, but then the thumbs-downs multiplied, tens and hundreds of them appearing on the screen, making those few little confettis seem weak and pathetic. I was already floored at this point, and then someone posted the first tomato. It caught on like wildfire until there were wave after wave of virtual tomatoes being thrown at the executive’s head—a mass outcry against being forced to embrace AI at gunpoint. He tried to keep going but his eyes kept darting to the corner of his screen where the emojis appeared, in increasing panic. It was goddamn inspiring. And while the executives didn’t immediately abandon all their AI plans, they are definitely shaken by what happened, and nervous about mass dissent. As they should be.

Ed: Software as a service. Ed: Jira is project management and bug-tracking software. Ed: All-hands are meetings where everyone from the entire company or department are required to attend. ''I feel like I’m hiding plain sight, terrified someone will notice I’m actually doing all my own work.'' What a backwards world we live in. This needs to be repeated, highlighted and shoved in every AI sycophant, Wall Street stock monkey or big tech executives face till they are forced to counter it: Forced adoption is not adoption. Just because you have faked the metric does not mean you have made it. Bullshit metrics rigging is the name of the game now. Wall Streets, pro-monopoly, pro-fascist and anti-worker machine of auto-pumping any stock that monopolises, lays off workers and "adopts AI" has empowered the cabal of Mckinseyists, C-execs and technofascists against the people. First it was monthly active users: cue AI companies giving away products for free, or forcing them in products that already have success. The desperation at Google to brag about MAU after forcing it in Google search, Android, Lens and soon to be Gmail. On its own, the Gemini app is a complete flop. Then it was tokens, a bullshit metric when one realises, a) adoption has been forced (workers forced to use code assistants, Google auto-generating AI overviews in search) and b) token ouput has increased by 100x since the release of "reasoning" models. Now its adoption. Don't you know, 30% of all code is now AI generated (oh we've included auto-complete in that wink wink). Workers are adopting AI faster than any prior technology!, the McKinseyist says. No shit, execs are literally threatening to fire people if they don't use it. A farce if there ever was one. The reason they are hopping desperately from one metric to another, is because for 3 years and still to this day, they have been unable to address the elephant in the room. AI is not valued by the people and makes little to no money. $600B+ spent and <$20B revenue. Take away the foundation models, and its <5B revenue. The best selling AI SaaS product is a code assistant making 0.5B revenue. MSFT Azure AI is making as little as $2B. MSFT, Google, Salesforce, Adobe have pulled their standalone AI products and now forcefully bundle AI alongside a mandatory price increase due to how bad the sales were as a standalone. They run away from revenue and profit metrics because it shows the world how much of a flop their project has been. Anytime you want an AI exec or shill to squirm just ask these two things. Its time for workers and the people to form a class, a class far more powerful, against the machine. Across so many industries, people have not only rejected AI slop but actively hate on it and try to ruin its image: see the recent humiliation of Klarna, Suno, Duolingo, MSFT Gaming and Meta. It is working. Public backlash breeds more public backlash. A wonderful flywheel of AI hate. The people continuing to reject AI will kill the AI industry. Most the money has to eventually come from the consumer. No posts Ready for more?

Title: From all-out brawls to eye-gouging and worse: a brief history of Lions Tour violence

Full Content:
Expect some conflict. Sit back and watch the claret flow. Take in some dust-ups and assaults, and hope the Lions get their retaliation in first. Bin the political correctness. The game against Argentina last Saturday at the Aviva Stadium was not like what may be coming down the line at the Lions, with a reasonable chance of some traditional brutality on the field. Why? Because that’s the way Lions’ tours always have been, a journey of character tests, challenges and physical melees, this first tranche of five episodes beginning on Saturday against Western Force in Perth before Queensland Reds, Waratahs, ACT Brumbies and an Australian and New Zealand invitational mix. The run-in games are, as history has shown, a softening-up process, a mincing machine where club players on the fringes of the national side, as well as those in Joe Schmidt’s Wallabies squad, are playing to hold their place or earn their place. The reputations of the touring players are there to be shredded, with folklore telling us nefarious methods come with the playbook. It has always been that way, and not just in the last century. From Duncan McRae raining down punches on Ronan O’Gara in 2001, to the tour-ending spear tackle on Brian O’Driscoll by New Zealand’s Tana Umaga and Keven Mealamu in 2005 and the gouging of Luke Fitzgerald at Loftus Versfeld in 2009, foul play has featured prominently on Lions tours. “This is your f**king Everest, boys,” Jim Telfer told a room of bowed heads in the 1997 Living with the Lions documentary. [ Lions v Western Force: Kick-off time, team news, where to watch and more ] That’s the way they have always set up, primed to play on the edge and it’s the way the opposition have also been hardwired over the last 50 years or more. The most famous bout of thuggery was in South Africa 1974, although the plan for Lions players to punch their nearest rival had a gestation period of six years following the 1968 tour and a match against Eastern Transvaal. There Wales prop John O’Shea was the first Lion ever to be sent off for foul play. Pelted with oranges on his way to the locker room, he was blamed for the punch-up. His defence was that he had retaliated after an opponent attacked scrumhalf Roger Young. Leaving the pitch O’Shea was then hit by a spectator, triggering a tunnel brawl that involved reserves, officials and police as play continued. Then 1968 tumbled forwards to 1971 when the New Zealand touring squad travelled to Canterbury. The Lions won the match, but maybe lost in the battle when Irish prop Ray McLoughlin chipped a bone at the base of his left thumb and Sandy Carmichael was hospitalised with multiple fractures of his cheekbone. Carmichael, the first player to win 50 caps for Scotland, was doing what props do and bored into the opposition at scrums. For that, Alister Hopkinson, the opposing prop, landed a few punches on the Scot with the damaging shot that fractured his cheek bone in five places coming later via a backhanded fist that caught him in a lineout. McLoughlin’s thumb injury occurred when a fight erupted with players from both sides pummelling each other near the touchline. Not the most accurate of blows, McLoughlin landed his shot on the head of Grizz Wyllie, breaking his left thumb. Grizz also punched Fergus Slattery as the Blackrock player unwisely held on to his jersey. The 1974 tour to South Africa was broiling before it even took off and its essence was the personality of captain Willie John McBride and his ’99 one-in, all-in’ spirit. Speaking to The Telegraph four years ago, former England forward Roger Uttley recalled the mood set by McBride when the squad had gathered in London. “Before we had even left the country, we were gathered in the Churchill Hotel just near Marble Arch and outside we could hear the anti-apartheid demonstrations in full flow,” Uttley said. “Willie spoke and you could hear a pin drop. ‘Gentlemen. If you have any doubts about going on this tour, I want you to be big enough to stand up now and leave the room. I have been to South Africa before and there is going to be a lot of intimidation, a lot of cheating. So if you’re not up for a fight, there’s the door’. “No one moved. I can still remember the silence and the hairs on the back of the neck rising.” The third Test in Port Elizabeth was the defining match of the series for its choreographed violence. Known as the Battle of the Boet Erasmus Stadium, Scotland’s Gordon Brown punched his opposite number, Johan de Bruyn, so hard the Orange Free State man’s glass eye flew out and landed in the mud. “So, there we are, 30 players, plus the ref, on our hands and knees scrabbling about in the mire looking for this glass eye,” recalled Brown, who died from cancer in 2001. “Eventually, someone yells ‘Eureka!’ whereupon De Bruyn grabs it and plonks it straight back in the gaping hole in his face.” After Brown’s death, De Bruyn presented his widow with the glass eye in a specially made trophy. When another fight broke out, the Wales full-back JPR Williams sprinted over half the length of the pitch to deliver a right hook to second row ‘Moaner’ van Heerden. “That’s not something I’m proud of,” orthopaedic surgeon Williams said later. It wasn’t always South Africa who transgressed, although the Springboks, of all the nations toured by the Lions, prided themselves on physicality. In 1989 the second Test against the Wallabies became the Battle of Ballymore when the Lions scrumhalf Rob Jones kicked off with Nick Farr-Jones at a scrum put-in. From there it was bedlam, with the commentary left to call it as it happened. “They are all joining in now. There’re punches galore. It’s an all-in brawl,” the exasperated commentator said. “It was [initially] between the half backs, but everyone joined in.” The wasn’t much French referee Rene Hourquet could do about it, and when Dai Young later aimed a boot at Steve Cutler in a ruck another free-for-all kicked off. With the century turning, three tours in a row in 2001, 2005 and 2009 would see three Irish players targeted in different violent ways. In 2001 Ronan O’Gara’s came up against New South Wales Waratahs midway through the second half. The images are of a kneeling McRae raining down the punches. Replays show that between the glancing blows and the fully landed punches as he held O’Gara with his left arm, the Munster outhalf took 11 shots resulting in eight stitches around his left eye. O’Gara’s running commentary to the doctor as he was getting stitched in the changing room said it all. “F**king cheap shots,” he said breathing heavily as the doctors carefully pulled his face together. “Caught me with the first one. Couldn’t f**king defend myself. F**king trying to look after the ball.” The spear tackle on O’Driscoll four years later might come across as the most calculated act. It took just over 40 seconds in the 2005 first Test against New Zealand in Christchurch to end his participation in the match and the tour and to sideline him for seven months. Calculated how? Well, the ball was with New Zealand lock Ali Williams 30 feet away when Umaga and Mealamu almost cartoonishly turned the Lions’ centre upside down and rammed him into the ground dislocating his shoulder. “It happened in slow motion and I knew I had to get my head out of the way,” O’Driscoll said on Irish television after the tour. “My shoulder took the brunt of the fall.” In Umaga’s book Up Close, published in 2007, in a classless comment he called O’Driscoll a “sook” or crybaby. In the 2009 tour to South Africa, the Lions lost their first Test match, making the second vital to save the series. On the day the Loftus Versfeld Stadium bristled with hostility. “The South African fans appeared to be waving as our bus approached, but as we got closer we realised they were all doing the ’w****r’ sign,” Welsh prop Adam Jones write in Bomb, his 2015 autobiography. Again, the match was brutal, physical and unforgiving and as Fitzgerald found out it quickly became insidious. Less than a minute in Springbok flanker Schalk Burger gouged the Irish winger. “Luke said he had to pull Burger’s hand off his eyes. That’s not sport, that’s not the way we play. It is not the gentlemanly thing to do – it’s disgusting,” Wales and Lions’ scrumhalf Mike Phillips said afterwards. And Burger’s punishment? A slap on the wrist. He sat it out for 10 minutes. With the Lions, that’s the way they roll. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Peruse a lifetime’s worth of art and antiques in the Dún Laoghaire home of their collector

House content auctions are rarer now than in the past, when viewing the interior of a discreet deceased neighbour’s lavish home was a weekend hobby for many people. Nowadays, most houses are emptied of their furniture, precious paintings and various collectibles, and these items are put up for sale in auction rooms with a mélange of pieces from other homes. Not so in the case of 6 Royal Terrace West, Dún Laoghaire. The contents of the property will be on view in the house, July 12th-14th, 10am-5pm each day, in advance of the auction in Sheppard’s auction rooms in Durrow, Co Laois on July 15th and 16th. Royal Terrace, one of the architectural gems of south Dublin, was built as two facing terraces on opposite sides of a four-acre park in 1860. The two-storey over basement homes were part of the expansion of Dún Laoghaire following the opening of the Dublin-Kingstown railway line in 1834 and the completion of the harbour in the 1840s. Until recently, number 6 was owned by Philip and Constance Murphy. Originally from west Cork, Philip was the youngest of six children of TJ Murphy, Labour Party TD and minister for local government in 1948-1949. Philip Murphy, who died in September 2024, was a solicitor and an avid collector of antiques. The house, which was put on the market by Savills with a guide price of €1,400,000 earlier this year, is currently sale agreed. Both Philip and Constance, who predeceased him, were active member of the Royal Terrace West Residents’ Association. “The terrace wouldn’t be intact today if it wasn’t for the work of Philip Murphy,” says a neighbour, Breasal O’Caollai. As well as campaigning against any development that would destroy the integrity of these Victorian homes, Murphy also led the campaign to bring the park back into public ownership. “He was the custodian of the square since they moved there in the 1960s. He was concerned about maintaining the architectural heritage of the area and he persuaded the county council to buy back the land in the 1980s from Monkstown Hockey Club,” says his niece, Hilary Walsh. The Royal Terrace park, which has been planted with trees and laid out with paths and green spaces, is now popular among locals and visitors alike. The Murphy’s Victorian terraced house has many original features, which are complemented with antique furniture, clocks, art and carefully chosen ornamental pieces. “I can remember visiting the house, seeing all the clocks wound up, smelling the furniture polish and everything just so pristine,” says Walsh. And so, this house content auction offers members of the public a rare opportunity to see a lifetime’s collection of antique furniture, oriental art and ornaments (including Chinese snuff bottles), several antique clocks and mirrors, silver and wooden boxes, in an almost museum like setting. “Each item offers insight into a life lived with genuine engagement and appreciation for the decorative and historic arts,” says Michael Sheppard, who has been cataloguing the items over the past few weeks. One of the more unusual items for sale is a rare 19th-century French automaton bird clock under a glass dome (€5,000-€8,000). It features a rotating tree with multiple taxidermy hummingbirds and other exotic birds perched among naturalistic silk flowers. The mechanism causes the birds to rotate in synchrony with the passage of time. Also of note is a mid-20th century hand-knotted Donegal wool carpet (€5,000-€8,000). This piece was inspired by the designs of Charles Francis Annesley Voysey, the English architect and designer renowned for his Arts and Crafts style wallpapers, fabrics and furniture – some of which can be seen in London’s Victoria and Albert Museum. Antique furniture enthusiasts may also be drawn to a Victorian Wellington mahogany chest (€400-€600). Named after the 1st Duke of Wellington, Arthur Wellesley – who led the British armies to victory at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 against Napoleon – the chest is tall and narrow with a single key locking all seven small drawers. This offers a perfectly secure, compact and portable storage for someone frequently on the move. Meanwhile, Whyte’s Summer Online auction, which ends on Monday from 6pm, offers collectors a snapshot of 20th-century Irish artists, as well as affordable prints of works by Paul Henry and Jack Butler Yeats, among others. Take, for example, the painting of Frescati House in Blackrock, Co Dublin, by artist and architectural historian, Peter Pearson. Painted in 1982, a year before the Georgian house was demolished, the painting is a reminder of its loss. Originally built in 1739 for the family of John Hely Hutchinson, then provost of Trinity College Dublin, Frescati House was later owned by the Fitzgeralds, who also owned Leinster House in Dublin and Carton House in Co Kildare. The Fitzgeralds named the house Frescati, a deliberate derivative of the Italian city of Frascati – a name which was revived for the Blackrock shopping centre, built on the land of the demolished mansion.

Title: Black Friday Email Marketing Strategy: 10 Tips and Examples (2025) - Shopify Australia

Time Published: 2025-06-27T23:24:32Z

Black Friday is one of the biggest sales events of the year. Last year, Shopify merchants drove a record-breaking $11.5 billion in sales during the Black Friday Cyber Monday (BFCM) weekend. With so many consumers open to shopping during the holiday weekend, leaning on tried and tested marketing channels can open the floodgates to more revenue in the fourth quarter. For many retailers, that’s email marketing. Email is the third-most influential channel on holiday purchase decisions, beating influencer endorsements, in-person experiences, and conversations with retail associates in-store. But when so many retailers rely on this direct line of communication to promote holiday sales, it’s difficult to stand out in a subscriber’s crowded inbox. This guide shares innovative Black Friday email marketing strategies to try this year, with best practices and examples from leading retailers. Customer data is the most valuable asset any ecommerce business has. It allows you to tailor email outreach and deliver on customers’ expectations for a personalized shopping experience. Yet 85% of internet users want to do more to protect their online privacy, meaning this strategy can be difficult to implement. Before the holiday season arrives, take stock of the customer data you currently have. If your email list is small or you don’t have supplementary information to personalize campaigns to existing subscribers, deploy lead generation campaigns to gather more holiday season customer data. For example: Because Shopify offers a customer data platform (CDP) by default, any first-party data you’ve collected on your customers gets combined in a unified customer profile. Whenever they share their email address or phone number, this data—such as their order history, loyalty points they’ve earned, previous emails they’ve opened, and/or customer service tickets they’ve raised—all funnel back to one place, giving you one source of truth for every shopper. Black Friday might only last one day, but consumers are still open to making holiday purchases in the run up to the big event. Klaviyo found that more than half of consumers think a month earlier than November is the ideal time for brands to initiate their holiday shopping season sales. Most retailers start seeding their Black Friday email promotions 21 days before the big event—a strategy dubbed “Black November,” which includes other holiday shopping dates: The majority of consumers look for discounts and sales during this period—so much so, 7 in 10 consider price the top factor in their holiday purchase decisions, beating quality (61%), variety (34%), and warranties or returns policies (31%). Take advantage of consumers’ openness to pre-Black Friday promotions by creating a holiday calendar. Perhaps you give your email list early access to your sale, or build hype around a new product drop by teasing it to subscribers, with an automated series like this: Not all holiday shoppers are the same. Some might be looking for gifts for a loved one—others might want to take advantage of a hefty discount to buy a product that’s been on their wishlist for months. Segmentation allows you to identify these buyer preferences and deliver personalized Black Friday email marketing campaigns. Key Black Friday customer segments to email include: Customers who’ve visited your New Orleans store within the last six months, for instance, could receive an email that invites them to your retail store’s exclusive holiday sale which starts two days before Black Friday. Yet instead of relying solely on historical data to forecast each segment’s next steps, lean on predictive analytics. These tools digest large datasets using machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to accurately predict what a customer will do next. 💡Tip: Shopify’s segmentation features pull data from unified customer profiles to group customers based on qualities they share. Choose from prebuilt segment templates, or build your own with the ShopifyQL query editor. All segments are dynamic—subscribers will move in and out of segments automatically when data from their unified profile changes. Segmentation isn’t the only way to personalize emails around the Black Friday weekend. Dynamic content blocks adjust smaller sections of your email, instead of sending the same email to everyone who fits your segmentation criteria. Let’s say, for example, that you’ve defined a segment of VIP customers to target during Black Friday. Subscribers have one thing in common—they have a customer lifetime value of over $500—but they don’t all share the same buying behaviors. Some have saved the loyalty rewards they’ve earned—others have made a portion of their purchases in-store. Further personalize the Black Friday emails that each subscriber in this segment receives with dynamic content blocks. That could be: Black Friday sales are effective because they’re exclusive—either in terms of product quantity (for example, a limited amount of inventory) or because the promotion ends at a specific time. Lean into this time sensitivity and encourage Black Friday subscribers to take advantage now rather than later. This scarcity can induce the fear of missing out, a psychological phenomenon that influences people to buy even when they didn’t intend on doing so. Effective marketing techniques to create urgency in your Black Friday emails include: reMarkable, for example, has a countdown timer in their email to announce Black Friday is ending. It offers visual representation of when the deal ends, instead of just a generic “Sale ends tonight!” message. Email inboxes are a crowded place to be at the best of times—never mind on Black Friday, when every retailer wants to capitalize on consumers’ willingness to buy. Email marketing platform Omnisend processed 1.13 billion emails in the week surrounding BFCM. Klaviyo reported similar figures: at its peak, merchants sent 420 million messages in a single hour on Black Friday. An email subject line is the first thing that subscribers see when your campaign lands in their inbox. A best practice is to split-test strategies such as: Here are some real examples that incorporate these best practices and stood out to me during the Black Friday weekend last year: Promotions and flash drops can incentivize holiday shoppers to make impulsive purchases. Remove the biggest barrier to them doing so—finding the money to pay for their order—by offering buy now, pay later (BNPL). During the BFCM weekend last year, consumers spent over $686.3 million on BNPL purchases, up 8.8% from the year before. Of those who have used this type of service, almost a third say they’d be more likely to spend money on discretionary goods if the retailer offered BNPL as an option. Shop Pay Installments offers an easy way to add BNPL options at checkout. Customers can choose to divide their purchases into smaller, more manageable installments. Combined with Shop Pay, the best-converting checkout on the internet, it’s no surprise that Shop Pay Installments has been proven to reduce cart abandonment by 28% and increase average order value by as much as 50%. Email might be the only direct line of communication you have with Black Friday customers, but it’s not the only way to command their attention. SMS marketing is the easiest integration since most email marketing platforms, including Klaviyo, offer SMS integration as standard. For example, you could send an email campaign to a particular segment, then use SMS to follow up with those who haven’t yet redeemed the offer or opened the email. It’s an approach proven to get results: Klaviyo reports that merchants who integrated SMS into their Black Friday email marketing strategy experienced a 20% YoY increase in ecommerce revenue during BFCM, accounting for more than $100 million in gross merchandise value. Email can also complement paid advertising strategies as costs skyrocket throughout Black Friday season. Shopify Audiences builds custom retargeting lists to export to platforms like Meta, Google Ads, and TikTok. It’s helped merchants like Happy Hippo achieve a 4.7x return on ad spend (ROAS) while cutting customer acquisition costs (CAC) by 72%. “Shopify Audiences is a huge benefit for Plus merchants,” says CEO and lead product designer Adam Biel. “It has helped lower customer acquisition costs so our investments can stretch much further with Facebook ads.” Transactional emails tend to be overlooked when marketers attempt to compete with other retailers for attention during Black Friday. Yet they’re an opportunity to strengthen relationships with the customers you’ve already acquired. Comb through the automated emails you send as standard when customers complete a certain action. Here are some examples and ideas to optimize them: Black Friday, Cyber Monday regularly break records, but not all of them are good. Most customers acquired during BFCM have a lower lifetime value. This occurs partly because these customers were being opportunistic and taking advantage of your promotions, but also because your brand loses mindshare throughout the year. Design an email retention sequence to retain holiday shoppers after Black Friday ends. You could: 💡Tip: Shopify Flow takes the logistical hassle out of these holiday marketing automations. Work from prebuilt templates—such as inviting shoppers to your loyalty program when their unified customer profile meets specific criteria—or custom code your own. It’s easy to get caught up in the excitement of new promotions and segmentation strategies that turn email subscribers into paying customers—so much so, that retailers often forget the fundamentals. Here’s a quick reminder of the email optimization best practices to keep in mind while writing Black Friday emails: If you’re in the midst of a creative lull and are searching for ideas on how to make your Black Friday emails stand out, draw inspiration from these examples. Shoppers are especially prone to abandoning online carts in search of better Black Friday deals. This cart recovery email from Pulp & Press reminds each individual customer of the products they abandoned, with a reminder that it’s the biggest sale of the year—and that they should take advantage now, before the deal ends. Black Friday might be the biggest online sales event of the year, but it’s not always the most profitable. Discounts tend to lure in low-value customers who might only purchase from you when products are heavily discounted. Detox Market’s Black Friday email is a great example of how to combat this with tiered promotions. The more customers spend, the bigger the discount. Freaks of Nature leans into scarcity with their “almost gone” Black Friday email. The call to action button tells people to “secure” their shirt—more strategic than just “get yours today.” Plus, it uses price anchoring to showcase the before and after sale price of each bestseller. There are also direct checkout links for email subscribers to complete their purchases without searching the online store for the perfect item. It’s tempting to shout about your bestselling products or hefty discounts with innovative email designs. Home furnishings brand Revival takes a different approach. Instead, the brand shares a letter authored by their founder, which wishes them a wonderful holiday weekend with a gentle nudge to buy the item on their wishlist. The email also features a note beneath the sign-off that teases the following day’s email. This tactic can increase open rates during Black Friday—subscribers are already on the lookout for the campaign. With so much competition to reach your target market during Black Friday, leaning into your brand values can attract conscious consumers who care more about sticking to their morals than impressive discounts. Deodorant brand Fussy, for example, is a certified B-Corp that sells deodorants made with natural ingredients and refillable cases designed to reduce plastic waste. Their target audience cares about sustainability, hence why the retailer’s Black Friday email marketing strategy was to rename the event “Green Week.” Email marketing spans every stage of the customer journey, from aiding initial product discovery to encouraging customer retention. Shopify has everything you need to personalize this end-to-end experience, including unified customer profiles and segmentation to put your data to work. Plus, when holiday email campaigns drive record levels of website traffic, you don’t have to worry about outages or downtime. Shopify’s infrastructure handled over 57.3 PB of data, 1.19 trillion edge requests, and 10.5 trillion database queries during the last BFCM. It’s why leading brands like Represent, Knix, and Muscle Nation trust Shopify to capitalize on Black Friday sales. “Black Friday can be nerve-wracking,” says Stefan Lewis, chief digital officer at Represent. “But Shopify has always helped us in terms of increasing bandwidth and we’ve never run into any issues around site speed.” Black Friday Cyber Monday (BFCM) email is a marketing strategy where retailers reach their target customers through targeted emails. These holiday campaigns typically include promotions, sales, discounts, gift suggestions, and product recommendations. To write an effective Black Friday email, lead with a time-sensitive offer in the subject line and header. Use mobile-first design, highlight bestsellers or exclusives, and include urgency-driven CTAs like “get yours before it’s too late.” The best time to send Black Friday emails is in the runup to the big event. Most consumers start holiday gift shopping before Black Friday arrives. A pre-launch campaign can ensure your brand is top of mind when they’re ready to buy. Use targeted emails to announce a Black Friday sale. Divide your audience into segments based on traits they share, and include contextual recommendations—for example, discounts on products similar to those they’ve bought.

Over 1.2M BTC locked in ETFs, will 50% profits tempt institutions to break ranks? Bitcoin [BTC] ETF inflows have surged again, with institutional investors tightening their grip on supply. Over 1.23 million BTC, that is, roughly 6.2% of the circulating supply, is now locked in Bitcoin Spot ETFs. That’s 6 out of every 100 coins, signaling growing confidence in BTC as a long-term allocation. Yet, the MVRV score of 1.43 indicated that ETFs were still in an average profit zone. In fact, that is far below the 3.7 highs seen during previous bull cycles. Historically, gains in this range have been enough for traditional players to start trimming positions. Will this time be different? As of press time, BlackRock’s IBIT had the most daily inflows with $692K added. Fidelity’s FBTC followed with $200K gained. However, Grayscales’ GBTC saw a few outflows of about $185K. This indicated further institutional building up, spearheaded by BlackRock, which had 692,876 BTC in total. Source: CoinGlass The spread of holdings across ETF providers highlights not just participation but a broadening trust from traditional finance. With total ETF addresses inching close to 1.5 million BTC, the uptrend since November 2024 has been clear, despite a few pause periods. Recent analysis of BTC ETFs revealed an average cost of about $73600—excluding GBTC—acting as a significant support level during market corrections. This level represents a median breaking point for conservative investors, who often prefer to take profits quickly compared to long-term crypto holders. Traditionally, these investors view 40-50% profits as adequate. Source: Burak Kesmeci/X But depending on what happens to the bullish momentum as well as the tightening of supply, they may wait longer and target higher multiples. The relatively moderate MVRV Ratio means profit-taking pressure isn’t overwhelming—yet. All in all, the indicators were positive as far as BTC ETF activities were concerned, although it must be taken with caution as the profit margins were weak at the time of press.

Title: S&P 500 hits new record high despite U.S.-Canada trade tensions

Saturday, 28 Jun 2025 NEW YORK, June 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stock index S&P 500 closed at record high on Friday, despite a brief retreat following U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement on terminating all trade talks with Canada. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 432.43 points, or 1 percent, to 43,819.27, boosted by huge gains from Nike after a better-than-expected earnings report. The S&P 500 added 32.05 points, or 0.52 percent, to 6,173.07, a record close high for the first time since February. The Nasdaq Composite Index increased by 105.54 points, or 0.52 percent, to 20,273.46. Nine of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors ended in green, with consumer discretionary and communication services leading the gainers by adding 1.78 percent and 1.55 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, energy and health led the laggards by losing 0.50 percent and 0.17 percent, respectively. Equities initially moved higher in the morning following comments by U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who told Bloomberg News late Thursday that a framework agreement between China and the United States on trade had been finalized. However, momentum faded after Trump posted on Truth Social that negotiations with Canada were off, injecting fresh uncertainty into global trade dynamics. "I can see where the risks are here -- if the trade is just hype from the White House and no deals are really forthcoming, then this market is going to roll over," Thierry Wizman, global FX and rates strategist at Macquarie Group. "Ultimately, this all comes back to growth in the U.S. economy and growth of earnings." On the economic front, U.S. personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, rose 0.1 percent in May on a seasonally adjusted basis, in line with expectations. The annual inflation rate came in at 2.3 percent, matching economists' forecasts. Core PCE price index, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, increased by 0.2 percent for the month and 2.7 percent year over year, slightly above expectations of 0.1 percent and 2.6 percent, respectively. U.S. investor sentiment improved in June as inflation fears pulled back, according to the University of Michigan's latest survey released Friday. The headline sentiment reading rose to 60.7, up 16.3 percent from May and close to the Dow Jones estimate for 60.5. The index was still 11 percent below the same month a year ago. "Consumers continue to be concerned about the potential impact of tariffs, but at this time they do not appear to be connecting developments in the Middle East with the economy," survey director Joanne Hsu said in a statement. In corporate news, Nike led gains across major indexes, with its shares surging 15.19 percent after the company reported quarterly earnings that topped Wall Street estimates. The sportswear giant also unveiled plans to offset potential tariff-related headwinds, which investors viewed positively. Large-cap technology stocks were mixed. Tesla fell 1.34 percent, while Alphabet and Amazon gained more than 2 percent. Broadcom and Microsoft posted modest losses, while Nvidia and Meta Platforms were up more than 1 percent, continuing their recent upward momentum. U.S. stock markets have shown resilience in recent weeks amid volatile geopolitical and economic headlines, as investors assess trade developments and incoming economic data for clues on the Fed's next moves.

Update font size. Reset Beleaguered Intel has started layoffs in California as part of a cost-cutting and restructuring plan led by CEO Lip-Bu Tan. This follows Tan’s August announcement that job cuts were inevitable, targeting a 15% to 20% reduction in the company’s workforce. Anton Shilov for Tom’s Hardware: ‎ Officially, Intel is eliminating excessive management layers, but a CRN report indicates that the company is surprisingly laying off chip design engineers and architects. Additionally, the company is shutting down its automotive chip division, according to Oregon Live. Among the job categories being eliminated are 22 physical design engineers, three physical design engineering managers, and several logic and product development engineers. The company is also removing roles such as cloud software architects and engineering managers, in addition to positions tied to business and project management, including a vice president of IT and multiple technology strategy leads. Employees in California are engaged in the development of CPU and GPU products… The layoffs are scheduled to begin on July 15. Impacted employees have been given either a 60-day notice or a shorter four-week notice, paired with nine weeks of compensation and benefits. ‎ MacDailyNews Take: As we wrote over twelve years ago: [Intel’s decision to pass on Apple’s iPhone] has to be close to the top of the list of Biggest Business Mistakes in History. ‎ Please help support MacDailyNews — and enjoy subscriber-only articles, comments, chat, and more — by subscribing to our Substack: macdailynews.substack.com.

Title: Crypto clarified: 8 expert insights on scale, stability and strategy

Time Published: 2025-06-27T19:00:35Z

UPDATED 15:00 EDT / JUNE 27 2025 by Victoria Gayton Crypto’s latest evolution is less about chaos and more about construction. Stablecoins are gaining traction as real-world assets move on-chain, regulatory infrastructure is taking shape and developers are laying new groundwork for how digital value flows across systems and borders. At theCUBE + NYSE Wired Crypto Trailblazer NYC event, that reinvention took center stage. Executives from across the crypto and blockchain ecosystem discussed everything from tokenization and compliance to talent pipelines, decentralized finance and the next wave of fintech integration. Whether building new bridges to Wall Street or doubling down on distributed networks, these leaders are shaping the next phase of blockchain-backed business. Abra’s Bill Barhydt joins theCUBE’s John Furrier to discuss classic Bitcoin and emerging new currencies. “The classic Bitcoin crypto is what people are holding, and there’s new currency coming out,” said theCUBE Research’s John Furrier during the event. “You’ve got two things: Mainstreaming the store of value and making that liquid and trading it … and then the wave coming … a paradigm shift … but it’s happening fast. We’re hearing from big institutions looking at how to figure out how do you digitize and create a digital twin … separate from all the stuff we love, agents, [artificial intelligence] stuff’s happening, too, so the massive wave is coming on all fronts.” Furrier and theCUBE Research’s Dave Vellante spoke with a lineup of C-suite crypto executives and entrepreneurial visionaries during theCUBE + NYSE Wired Crypto Trailblazer NYC event, in an exclusive broadcast on theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s livestreaming studio. Conversations spanned blockchain infrastructure, decentralized finance, market volatility and emerging opportunities across fintech and enterprise. Here’s a breakdown of eight standout interviews from the event: Abra Capital Management LP offers a platform that allows users to earn a yield on Bitcoin, stake Solana and Ethereum, and borrow against their crypto holdings, according to Bill Barhydt (pictured), founder and chief executive officer of Abra. The service is designed to make decentralized finance accessible without technical complexity, and clients retain title to their assets through separately managed accounts rather than relying on exchange-based custody. Bitcoin functions as a fixed-supply, appreciating asset that outpaces traditional stores of value, Barhydt noted. Tokenized real-world assets such as real estate and equities can be traded and used as collateral in global lending markets worth trillions. Barhydt also sees crypto infrastructure playing a future role in automated agent economies, where stablecoins and decentralized autonomous organizations enable new forms of digital ownership and financial activity. Watch theCUBE’s complete interview. CoinFund Management LLC, an early mover in crypto-native investments, backs visionary founders through pre-seed, seed and Series A/B stages while also running a liquid strategy focused on tokens and equities. Fundamental research underpins its approach, examining bespoke technologies shaping digital value exchange. Embedding private property digitally through decentralized, trustless systems is redefining the architecture of the internet, according to Christopher Perkins, chief executive officer of CoinFund. Decentralization can mitigate centralized AI’s vulnerabilities, strengthening data sovereignty, distributing computational tasks and enhancing transparency in AI model training. As Stablecoins inject potentially $2 to $3 trillion on-chain, decentralized finance will surge, enabling AI-powered transaction agents. Clear, proactive policy measures to bolster digital asset security could empower private sector innovation, lure talent back to the U.S. and ensure a safer entrepreneurial landscape, Perkins noted. Get the full story on theCUBE. Dynamic Labs Inc., backed by investors Andreessen Horowitz and Founders Fund, streamlines crypto wallet infrastructure, making it simpler for developers and businesses to build fintech apps and neobanks. By abstracting complexities such as money movement, security and key management through multi-party computation, Dynamic enables developers to prioritize brand building over backend intricacies. Its platform facilitates rapid, global money transfers and supports innovative business models, including micro-communities integrated with crypto payments, according to Itai Turbahn, chief executive officer of Dynamic Labs. Dynamic Lab’s Itai Turbahn talks with theCUBE about the company’s newly launched stablecoin accounts. Dynamic’s newly launched stablecoin accounts further streamline transactions, enabling smooth fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-fiat conversions through a single software development kit. This capability simplifies the launch of global payment apps and neobanks, drastically lowering the entry barriers for financial innovators. Additionally, Dynamic’s “server wallets” are tailored for the emerging agent economy, empowering AI-driven agents to transact and manage funds autonomously, according to Turbahn. Don’t miss the full story on theCUBE. ICE Ventures LLC entered crypto early by developing institutional-grade, on-premises custodial infrastructure and introducing physically delivered Bitcoin futures contracts, a move ahead of its time. Responding to market evolution and regulatory developments such as the GENIUS Act, ICE is now unlocking the potential of stablecoins by exploring currency pairs backed by highly regulated tokens such as USDC, according to Trabue Bland, senior vice president of futures exchange at ICE Ventures. ICE’s global network of exchanges positions it uniquely to enhance crypto price discovery and bring efficiency to electronic trading — especially as stablecoins grow in usage — addressing market inefficiencies such as fragmented pricing and high fees. Additionally, as AI’s energy demands surge, ICE leverages its deep expertise to navigate and capitalize on emerging opportunities at the intersection of artificial intelligence and energy markets, Bland noted. Catch theCUBE’s complete interview. Anchorage Digital, a subsidiary of Anchor Labs Inc., the sole federally chartered crypto bank in the U.S., provides institutional-grade services, including custody, staking, settlement and trading, attracting major institutions such as BlackRock Inc. for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. The crypto industry’s maturation is underscored by Circle Internet Financial LLC’s IPO and bipartisan legislative efforts, such as the GENIUS Act, which brings crucial regulatory clarity to stablecoins. These assets often carry less risk and more stability than traditional bank deposits, according to Diogo Monica, co-founder and executive chairman of Anchorage Digital. Anchorage Digital’s Diogo Monica talks with theCUBE about bringing regulatory clarity to stablecoins. Stablecoins essentially tokenize dollars backed primarily by U.S. Treasuries, requiring decentralized blockchain infrastructure to function securely and independently of traditional financial constraints. The upcoming wave of asset tokenization — covering fixed income and equities ahead of real estate — promises enhanced global liquidity, fractional ownership and frictionless portfolio trading. As crypto quietly integrates into mainstream applications, many users engage with blockchain-enabled financial solutions without even realizing it, signaling a subtle yet profound shift in everyday finance, according to Mónica. Watch the full interview on theCUBE. 10T Holdings LLC, a growth equity fund that targets solely crypto, blockchain and Web3 assets, invests in developed-stage companies, typically generating at least $40 to $50 million in revenue. Dan Tapiero, founder, chief executive officer and chief information officer of 10T Holdings LLC, predicted in 2019 that the crypto market would reach $10 trillion in total value within a decade; it’s already halfway there at approximately $5 trillion today, prompting plans for a new fund targeting an even larger $50 trillion market. Significant growth in public crypto and blockchain enterprises is imminent, with at least 10 portfolio companies expected to go public within the next two years, according to Tapiero. Recent shifts in U.S. regulatory and political attitudes now position the United States to become the global hub for crypto and blockchain innovation, with government efforts aimed at solidifying this leadership. Public listings on major exchanges, such as the NYSE and NASDAQ, are essential for legitimizing cryptocurrency enterprises — especially those tied to stablecoins — both domestically and internationally. Additionally, global demand for stablecoins continues to rise sharply, especially in countries with unstable currencies, highlighting their critical role in wealth preservation and everyday transactions worldwide, according to Tapiero. Listen to the full story on theCUBE. Ledger SAS develops hardware solutions that safeguard sensitive online information, initially targeting cryptocurrency private keys, but now expanding into decentralized identity, healthcare data and broader digital assets. As tokenization becomes widespread and public blockchain applications proliferate, robust hardware security solutions will become indispensable for safely managing diverse digital assets, moving beyond simple investment speculation, according to Pascal Gauthier, chief executive officer of Ledger. Ledger’s Pascal Gauthier talks with theCUBE about enhancing digital security standards. Ledger maintains two core business segments — consumer and enterprise — both dedicated to enhancing digital security standards. Its enterprise division leverages proprietary intellectual property to secure private keys and governance layers, establishing rigorous access controls and preventing asset mismanagement. Additionally, Ledger fosters a dynamic developer ecosystem, supporting third-party apps on its security platform, and provides user-friendly products such as “Stacks,” which combine ease of use, robust security and multiple backup capabilities, according to Gauthier. Check out theCUBE’s full story. Talos Global Inc. was established to provide institutional-grade trading systems for digital assets, anticipating the growth of crypto into a comprehensive asset class that encompasses all capital markets. Initially connecting fragmented liquidity providers — including exchanges, over-the-counter desks, market makers, and decentralized platforms — Talos has evolved to offer advanced solutions such as portfolio management and settlement tools. As traditional institutions increasingly adopt digital asset infrastructures, the industry enters what is seen as the final transformative phase, according to Anton Katz, chief executive officer of Talos. Talos’ unified platform caters to traditional asset managers, overseeing trillions in assets and providing a secure and familiar gateway for incorporating digital assets into diverse investment portfolios. Driven by client demand for faster, globalized and more accessible financial solutions, the migration of traditional asset classes onto digital rails appears inevitable, despite operational considerations such as balancing rapid settlements and necessary oversight. Embracing a build, buy or partner approach, Talos aims to become a comprehensive “one-stop shop” for institutional investors, covering the entire investment lifecycle from pre-trade preparation to post-trade compliance, according to Katz.

The most important matter, gray matter that is, sits right at the surface. At least that's the line from Dr. Ben Rapoport, the cofounder and chief science officer of Precision Neuroscience, a brain-computer interface, or BCI, company. "Many people have the impression that the data that we care about is sort of everywhere inside this dimensional structure," Rapoport, a neurosurgeon and engineer, told Business Insider. That's a big misconception, he said. People often incorrectly assume that "you need electrodes that penetrate deep inside the brain to get that information out," he added. But brain implants don't need to be as invasive as they might sound, he said. Precision is developing a thin film that sits on the brain and records brain activity in patients with paralysis. "We implant modules of 1,024 electrodes on the brain surface in the area that controls movement, especially the hand," Rapoport said. That allows them to have cursor control, typing ability, access the internet, use PowerPoint, play games, and word process, he added. These are actions that require vision, movement, sensation, and executive function — core parts of consciousness that are concentrated in the brain's outermost layer, the cortex, Rapoport said. Deeper inside are "connections, you know, between those activities and also sort of subconscious processes, because the brain coordinates a lot of activities in the body that don't take place consciously," he added. The New York-based startup, which received FDA clearance for part of its wireless brain-computer interface in April, has raised $155 million in funding since it launched in 2021. It is one of a few companies advancing this technology as part of the Implantable BCI Collaborative Community, an initiative launched in partnership with the FDA in 2024. BCIs are largely classified into two categories: invasive and non-invasive. Non-invasive BCIs, which don't require surgery, often rely on external sensors to detect the electrical signals in the brain. BCIs that are implanted record neural activity directly from the brain and are being developed to restore speech, movement, and other complex functions in people with neurological conditions. The buzziest BCI these days is Elon Musk's Neuralink, which has ambitions to create a "symbiosis" between the human brain and AI. But there are a host of other companies working on BCIs as a way to treat neurological diseases, like Precision Neuroscience. The company has tested its temporary device in over forty patients in early clinical studies. Over the next year, it will prepare for the first human studies of its permanently implanted devices. "There are certain internal validation checks and internal milestones that we need to meet for ourselves and for the FDA before we want to start implanting the permanently implanted wireless device in humans," Rapoport said. The company's ultimate goal is to help paralyzed people get "back to a level of functional capacity where they can be significantly independent, economically self-sufficient, and hold a job in the workplace," Rapoport said. Correction: June 27, 2025 — An earlier version of this story said that Dr. Ben Rapoport was the founder and CEO of Precision Neuroscience; Dr. Rapoport is the cofounder and chief science officer. An earlier version also mischaracterized the film that goes on the brain. It is not studded with electrodes; the electrodes are embedded. The story also clarifies that the implants are not a potential cure but a potential treatment for neurological disorders. Jump to

ByMoneyShow ByMoneyShow, Contributor. Big Tech is back in the driver’s seat! The technology sector has been leading the market rally off the early-April lows – with sizable double-digit gains piling up. Here are three ways you can profit, courtesy of top MoneyShow experts. Mike Larson MoneyShow.com Big Tech is SO back. Again. Ever since the stock market bottomed out on April 7, we’ve seen most (though not ALL) of the biggest technology stocks rocket higher. All but two are outperforming smaller-capitalization stocks, as represented by the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM), as well as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) -- as you can see in this MoneyShow Chart of the Day. Big Tech SPY IWM Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) is the Big Tech name with the most post-“Liberation Day” juice – up 58%. Tesla Inc. (TSLA) isn’t far behind, with a 40.4% rally. Next are Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Meta Platforms Inc. (META), both nipping at Tesla’s heels with gains of 37.8% and 37.3%. Only Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) are notably lagging (+11.2% and +16.4%, respectively). What’s behind the resumption of the Big Tech trade – a trade that has periodically popped back up over the past year or two? A few things... First, investors are boosting bets on earlier Federal Reserve rate cuts. Lower rates help boost growth-stock multiples. Second, concerns about tariff and trade policy have eased. President Trump has dialed backed some of his most punitive tariffs – and signaled a willingness to keep negotiating with trade partners. That could prevent some of the worst-case tech supply chain scenarios from playing out. Third, FOMO is back in play. Investors got too bearish during the declines, didn’t get on board early enough in the subsequent rally, and they’re now dog-piling into old favorites to play catch up. Add it all up and you have a tech sector that is leading again – and driving the averages to new highs. From where I sit, that’s bullish…and underscores why my “Be (Selectively) Bold” approach (still) looks like the right one here. Joe Markman Digital Creators & Consumers It’s happening in real-time, yet most investors remain completely oblivious. The “it” is the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution, the greatest productivity accelerant since electricity. Let’s talk about what it means for Microsoft Corp. (MSFT). According to a report on Bloomberg, MSFT is planning to cut thousands of jobs in its Xbox gaming division. These cuts will be in addition to the 6,000 employees fired in May at LinkedIn and other Microsoft subsidiaries. This is a sticky subject. There is going to be massive disruption. But it is a wonderful time to be a Microsoft shareholder. Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Analysts scoffed at Magnificent Seven corporate leaders when they kept increasing capital expenditures for AI infrastructure. Research suggested that the companies would never earn a return on that invested capital because they couldn’t imagine a large-enough business to justify the investment. When Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, invested $10 billion in OpenAI two years ago, Wall Street analysts thought he had lost his mind. There was no demand for another Siri, they wrote. What the analysts missed then is that ChatGPT, OpenAI’s flagship product, isn’t Siri. ChatGPT can write software code, while Siri can barely play songs on Apple Music. Apple Inc.’s (AAPL) digital assistant was never going to succeed, mostly due to corporate culture. The iPhone maker is a hardware company. But executives at the other Mag-7 companies live and breathe software. They understood immediately what ChatGPT was, and they went all-in on AI. Make no mistake: layoffs at the biggest software companies are about to become much more common. This is because large portions of software employees can be replaced with AI. In the same way that electricity enabled mechanized, automated production that required fewer workers to achieve greater output, AI software is going to hollow out large parts of white-collar work. These changes will happen swiftly and persistently, as they are now occurring at Microsoft. In the past, foundational technology shifts have led to greater employment as new sectors and businesses were born. Pessimists said the Internet was going to shutter the global economy. More than two decades later, it turns out that connecting the entire world to a network led to millions of new jobs in the digital economy and employment in business verticals that previously did not exist. The flip side for investors is that productivity means increased profits. When headcounts are lower, more money flows to the bottom line. None of this is being reflected currently in share price valuations. Expect this to change in the second half of 2025 as hyperscalers talk about doing more with less, much to the surprise of the Wall Street analyst community. Recommended Action: Buy MSFT. George Gilder Gilder’s Technology Report The market capitalization leaderboard for semiconductors continues to highlight the divergence between IP ownership and physical production. US firms dominate the top rankings — Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) at $2.476 trillion, Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) at $804 billion — but that masks how irreplaceable the manufacturing layer has become in a geopolitically fractured world. Key fabrication and tooling players like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), Samsung, and ASML Holding NV (ASML) remain undervalued by comparison. This valuation gap reflects investor focus on scalability and software leverage. Top 10 Semiconductors In today’s semiconductor market, location defines exposure, not necessarily strength. Nvidia, Broadcom, and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) — all US-headquartered — are rewarded for their innovation, commanding premium valuations and massive market capitalizations. But their products are inseparable from the Asian manufacturing ecosystem. TSMC, Samsung, and ASML remain irreplaceable at the physical layer of chip production. Tariffs, meanwhile, distort incentives. They penalize final assembly hubs like China without reshoring critical stages such as wafer fabrication or back-end packaging. This imbalance creates investment opportunities — and risks. US design-centric firms gain margin leverage, but companies controlling equipment, lithography, or memory — like ASML, Applied Materials, and SK Hynix — are the real backbone of global production. Investors should pay close attention to companies bridging these two worlds: Those that own irreplaceable manufacturing capacity and are structurally tied to Western markets. ASML and TSM remain critical infrastructure. Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT), Lam Research Corp. (LRCX), and KLA Corp. (KLAC) control the tools that keep fabs alive. Nvidia and Broadcom may lead the stock market — but it’s the factory floor that decides who can actually deliver.

Title: 3 Ways To Profit With Big Tech Back In The Driver’s Seat

ByMoneyShow ByMoneyShow, Contributor. Big Tech is back in the driver’s seat! The technology sector has been leading the market rally off the early-April lows – with sizable double-digit gains piling up. Here are three ways you can profit, courtesy of top MoneyShow experts. Mike Larson MoneyShow.com Big Tech is SO back. Again. Ever since the stock market bottomed out on April 7, we’ve seen most (though not ALL) of the biggest technology stocks rocket higher. All but two are outperforming smaller-capitalization stocks, as represented by the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM), as well as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) -- as you can see in this MoneyShow Chart of the Day. Big Tech SPY IWM Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) is the Big Tech name with the most post-“Liberation Day” juice – up 58%. Tesla Inc. (TSLA) isn’t far behind, with a 40.4% rally. Next are Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Meta Platforms Inc. (META), both nipping at Tesla’s heels with gains of 37.8% and 37.3%. Only Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) are notably lagging (+11.2% and +16.4%, respectively). What’s behind the resumption of the Big Tech trade – a trade that has periodically popped back up over the past year or two? A few things... First, investors are boosting bets on earlier Federal Reserve rate cuts. Lower rates help boost growth-stock multiples. Second, concerns about tariff and trade policy have eased. President Trump has dialed backed some of his most punitive tariffs – and signaled a willingness to keep negotiating with trade partners. That could prevent some of the worst-case tech supply chain scenarios from playing out. Third, FOMO is back in play. Investors got too bearish during the declines, didn’t get on board early enough in the subsequent rally, and they’re now dog-piling into old favorites to play catch up.

Title: Nvidia breakout puts $4 trillion market value within reach
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/06/27/nvidia-market-value-jensen-huang-stocks-deepseek/
Time Published: 2025-06-27T16:26:48Z
Full Content:
Two years after Nvidia Corp. made history by becoming the first chipmaker to achieve a $1 trillion market capitalization, an even more remarkable milestone is within its grasp: becoming the first company to reach $4 trillion. After the emergence of China’s DeepSeek sent the stock plunging earlier this year and stoked concerns that outlays on artificial intelligence infrastructure were set to slow, Nvidia shares have rallied back to a record. Its biggest customers remain full steam ahead on spending, much of which is flowing to its computing systems. A 66% gain from an April low has pushed its market capitalization to $3.8 trillion, overtaking Microsoft Corp. at $3.70 trillion to again become the world’s most valuable company. Nvidia shares rose as much as 1.3% in early trading Friday. With a broadening customer base clamoring for Nvidia’s latest AI accelerators and competitors still distant, bulls are betting the chipmaker’s shares have plenty of room to run. “We believe that Nvidia is truly uniquely positioned, and that it will sustain its position over the next decade-plus,” said Aziz Hamzaogullari, chief investment officer at Loomis, Sayles & Co. and founder of the firm’s growth equity strategies team. Hamzaogullari isn’t alone. This week, Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah raised Nvidia’s price target to $250 from $175, a level that would equate to a roughly $6 trillion market value. Baruah, who has a buy rating on the stock, expects annual AI spending from various types of customers to rise to nearly $2 trillion by 2028. “While it may seem fantastic that Nvidia fundamentals can continue to amplify from current levels, we remind folks that Nvidia remains essentially a monopoly for critical tech, and that it has pricing (and margin) power,” Baruah wrote in a research note on June 25. The bullish sentiment behind Nvidia and other makers of AI gear is a stark reversal from earlier in the year when the emergence of advanced chatbots like DeepSeek, developed relatively cheaply in China, sparked fears that Nvidia’s customers would cut spending. Instead, US tech giants are plowing even more money into computing infrastructure. Read More: Nvidia Attempts to Breakout of Range Relative to the S&P 500 Microsoft, Meta, Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. are projected to put about $350 billion into capital expenditures in their upcoming fiscal years, up from $310 billion in the current year, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Those companies account for more than 40% of Nvidia’s revenue. Of course, there are still plenty of risks that could derail Nvidia’s rally. The company relies on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. for the production of its chips, exposing Nvidia to US President Donald Trump’s trade policies, which can change on a whim. Trump’s 90-day pause on the stiffest tariffs is set to end on July 9. At the same time, there’s no guarantee Nvidia’s biggest customers won’t change their tune on spending in coming years. Many of them are developing their own chips to avoid the steep prices commanded by Nvidia. “The valuation depends on the persistence of growth, and we already know that Nvidia’s largest customers are trying to figure out ways to be more efficient with their spending, not just with Nvidia, but also offloading to their own silicon,” said Dan Davidowitz, chief investment officer at Polen Capital Management. “You have to have very robust assumptions to get comfortable with the valuation, and we just don’t have a good enough view on what that demand looks like.” Nvidia shares are priced at 32 times earnings projected over the next 12 months, compared with 22 times for the S&P 500. The stock’s valuation doesn’t bother Loomis Sayles’s Hamzaogullari, who remains a firm believer that AI will transform society and is convinced that Nvidia will remain a key winner as productivity gains from the technology expand. “That doesn’t mean it will be steady Eddie all the time, that there won’t be disruptions in spending, but this is a secular structural change, and Nvidia remains one of the biggest beneficiaries,” Hamzaogullari said. “The stock still looks attractive given that backdrop.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Bitcoin FOMO: Billionaire Admits Mistake For ‘Not Being Involved’

Philippe Laffont—the billionaire behind Coatue Management—went and dropped Bitcoin into his “Fantastic 40,” his own shortlist of what he thinks will shine as top investments over the next five years. Laffont ranked Bitcoin alongside Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Meta, while leaving out Apple and Google. He says waking up at 3 a.m. wondering why he missed out drove him to rethink his stance. Based on reports from CNBC, he hasn’t bought any yet but thinks its market cap could jump past $5 trillion by 2030. That would put it in the same league as the biggest tech names. According to his own research, the Coatue Management big boss sees Microsoft climbing to a $5.7 trillion valuation and Nvidia reaching $5.6 trillion in the next five years. He paints Bitcoin as a rival asset, forecasting it will more than double from roughly $2.1 trillion today. He says the world’s net worth of $450–500 trillion gives room for new winners. Equities sit near $120 trillion and gold above and under ground at about $20 trillion. His case rests on bigger acceptance and smoother swings in price. Based on his figures, Bitcoin must average around 10–15% annual growth to hit $5 trillion by 2030. He sees volatility shrinking from daily moves of 5–7% to roughly half of that. That, he says, makes the crypto feel more like the Nasdaq. The tycoon points to de-dollarization as another tailwind. If global players shift away from the US dollar, Bitcoin could pick up more steam. Not everyone is convinced. Eric Semler of Semler Scientific notes lots of hedge funds still doubt Bitcoin’s staying power. They worry momentum will vanish once the US President Donald Trump factor fades. Meanwhile, Bybit’s Shunyet Jan forecasts Bitcoin at $125,000 by the end of Q2 if current trends hold. Crypto analyst Scott Melker goes even further, predicting a surge to $250,000 by end-2025 thanks to more big investors jumping in. Semler Scientific already holds 4,450 BTC. The firm plans to build that to 10,000 by year-end. Its chairman says many peers aren’t ready to follow suit. They see Bitcoin as too tied to politics. That caution keeps some big wallets on the sidelines. Regulatory moves remain the biggest wild card. Harsh rules could stall growth and scare off new buyers. Competition is rising too. Ether staking, Layer 2 networks and central bank digital currencies might chip away at Bitcoin’s crown. And a strong rebound in the US dollar or a broad stock sell-off could pull crypto down with it.

Law firms look to head consolidated class action suits, a role that would enable them to boost their earnings from the case, they said. They often file separately in such cases until a judge names a lead plaintiff and combines the separate actions. “Law firms jockey for position as lead counsel in securities class actions because the fees can be very lucrative,” said University of Michigan Law School professor Adam Pritchard—“tens of millions of dollars and occasionally more in the biggest cases.” Each suit accuses Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, of misleading investors about the anticipated profitability and risks in its Bitcoin buying by making “materially false and misleading” public statements. They allege the fraud occurred over an 11-month period between April 30, 2024 and April 4, 2025. The first class action was filed by Pomerantz LLP on May 16. But rather than join in the first class action, identical lawsuits have been filed by Gross Law Firm, Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, and Levi & Korsinsky. None of the five law firms responded to repeated requests for comment from Decrypt. “The position of lead plaintiff is valuable,” Ann Lipton, a law professor at the University of Colorado, told Decrypt. “The lead plaintiff controls the litigation and selects counsel, who will eventually be counsel for the class. So when a case looks strong, multiple firms and plaintiffs will file complaints to throw their hat in the ring.” Lipton and Pritchard said that law firms file identical suits in cases like this to advertise themselves as the right firm to see the case through. Each of the five firms has sent multiple press releases trying to attract more plaintiffs. Many of them prominently remind potential participants of the July 15 deadline for when a judge will choose a lead plaintiff. Once that happens, the rest of the plaintiffs will be consolidated under that plaintiff’s class action. But law firms don’t just want a lot of plaintiffs; they want to secure the biggest investors possible, Pritchard explained. That’s because the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 says that courts should award the lead plaintiff spot to someone who’s volunteered to assume that role and has the largest losses. “The theory is that a plaintiff with more skin in the game will oversee the case and the lawyers,” Lipton said. “Institutions are favored, as well, because again they are more likely to provide necessary oversight.” It’s not clear yet if any of MSTR’s largest holders have signed on to become plaintiffs in the competing class actions. As of an October SEC filing, Strategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor is still the single largest shareholder with 19,998,580 shares, worth almost $7.8 billion at the current MSTR price of $389.50. But there are large institutions in the mix, including Vanguard Group with an 8.55% stake, BlackRock and Capital International Investors with 5.8% stake each, Susquehanna Securities with a 4.8% stake, and Jane Street Group with a 4.7% stake in the company. The value of Strategy’s 592,345 BTC recently climbed above $63 billion, according to bitcointreasuries.net. The lawsuit frenzy kicked off after Strategy warned investors in April that it was unlikely to report a Q1 profit because of the nearly $6 billion in unrealized losses on its BTC holdings. In an SEC filing, the company said it “may not be able to regain profitability in future periods, particularly if we incur significant unrealized losses related to our digital assets.” The company went on to report a $16.49 per common share decline in Q1. In early April, the company’s 528,185 Bitcoin was worth approximately $41.3 billion. Strategy spent a whopping $7.7 billion buying BTC in Q1 at an average price of $95,000 per coin. But by the time the company needed to file its Q1 earnings report, the price of BTC had sunk to about $82,000 per coin. It has since rebounded to about $107,000, as of this writing. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt. But it has been acknowledging the lawsuits in 8-K filings with the SEC. In each one it repeats: “We intend to vigorously defend against these claims. At this time, we cannot predict the outcome, or provide a reasonable estimate or range of estimates of the possible outcome or loss, if any, in this matter.” Edited by James Rubin Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Ireland v Georgia, Stadio San Michele, Sunday, 5pm Irish time (Live on Rugby Pass TV) It’s been a difficult season to date for the Ireland Under-20s, losing four of five matches in the Six Nations and finishing bottom of the table. To compound matters they suffered a heavy defeat to Scotland, the only team they beat in that tournament, in a warm-up game ahead of the World Championship. There were some mitigating circumstances for Neil Doak’s side, injuries depriving them of key players, but it doesn’t begin to explain the recurring performance glitches that undermined their ambition. Aspects of their patterns were good, they didn’t lack courage or character, but they got lost very easily in the weeds of their mistakes. The playing personnel didn’t deviate much despite the results with the majority of changes coming in a turnstile selection within the matchday 23 from one game to the next, where starters were benched and then reinstated and vice versa. There is a presumption that secondrow Alan Spicer and tighthead prop Niall Smyth are still sidelined through injury. In more uplifting news, prop Alex Usanov, Luke Murphy and Derry Moloney are all fully rehabilitated in time for Sunday’s opening game in Calvisano. Tullamore native Páidí Farrell, who plays with Old Wesley, will make his first start in a tournament game. He possesses a rare attribute in Irish rugby circles, top-end pace and given reasonable ball is a try-scoring threat as he demonstrated capably and consistently in the All-Ireland League. There is a nice balance and plenty of footballing ability in the back three of Farrell, Charlie Molony and Derry Moloney, while the relocation of Ciarán Mangan (younger brother of Leinster’s Diarmuid) from wing to outside centre bodes well from an attacking perspective. He plays alongside the hard running Eoghan Smyth in midfield. Tom Wood, son of former Ireland international Keith, has won the number 10 shirt, with Clark Logan at scrumhalf. In the Six Nations, Wood showed a nice skill set and self-possession to play his way through tougher moments. He has a better kicking game than his dad. Billy Bohan, a player to emerge with credit during the Six Nations, teams up with Henry Walker and Alex Mullan in a ball-playing frontrow. Mahon Ronan and Billy Corrigan put in huge shifts in every match, while Murphy’s addition to a backrow which also contains captain Éanna McCarthy and Michael Foy, introduces steel and quality. Foy was arguably Ireland’s best player in the Six Nations, a turbocharged presence on both sides of the ball. Ireland’s bench has a number of players who can change the tempo of a match, none more so than replacement scrumhalf Will Wootton. Georgia will test Ireland’s mettle at the set piece, breakdown and on the gain-line. As they demonstrated last year when the sides met in this tournament, the Georgians are very sticky opponents, with Ireland squeezing home in a one-score game. They’d bite your hand off for a similar result here. Doak’s side will later play hosts Italy and New Zealand in their other pool games. IRELAND: Charlie Molony (UCD); Páidí Farrell (Old Wesley); Ciarán Mangan (Blackrock College), Eoghan Smyth (Cork Constitution), Derry Moloney (Blackrock College); Tom Wood (Garryowen), Clark Logan (QUB); Billy Bohan (Galway Corinthians), Henry Walker (QUB), Alex Mullan (Blackrock College); Mahon Ronan (Old Wesley), Billy Corrigan (Old Wesley); Michael Foy (UCC), Éanna McCarthy (Galwegians, capt), Luke Murphy (Young Munster). Replacements: Mikey Yarr (UCD), Alex Usanov (Clontarf), Tom McAllister (Ballynahinch), Conor Kennelly (Highfield), Bobby Power (Galwegians), Will Wootton (Sale Sharks) Sam Wisniewski (Old Belvedere), Daniel Green (QUB).

Large language models are increasingly used by private investors seeking financial advice. The current paper examines the potential of these models to perpetuate investment biases and affect the economic security of individuals at scale. We provide a systematic assessment of how large language models used for investment advice shape the portfolio risks of private investors. We offer a comprehensive model of large language model investment advice risk, examining five key dimensions of portfolio risks (geographical cluster risk, sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, active investment allocation risk, and total expense risk). We demonstrate across four studies that large language models used for investment advice induce increased portfolio risks across all five risk dimensions, and that a range of debiasing interventions only partially mitigate these risks. Our findings show that large language models exhibit similar “cognitive” biases as human investors, reinforcing existing investment biases inherent in their training data. These findings have important implications for private investors, policymakers, artificial intelligence developers, financial institutions, and the responsible development of large language models in the financial sector.

Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. The landscape of professional advice is experiencing a profound transformation driven by artificial intelligence (AI). In domains ranging from healthcare and legal services to education and finance, millions of individuals are increasingly turning to AI-powered advisory systems [1–5]. Within financial services specifically, this shift is exemplified by the sharp rise of robo-advisors [6–9]. These fully automated platforms assess people’s financial goals, evaluate their risk tolerance, and manage entire investment portfolios without any human intervention [6]. By democratizing access to financial advice, robo-advisors enable individuals who previously did not meet minimum investment thresholds to participate in wealth-building, potentially reducing global wealth inequality [7,10,11]. Beyond complex tasks such as managing an entirely financial portfolio, these technologies can also assist users with basic personal finance tasks such as budgeting and expense tracking, offering accessible financial guidance for everyday decisions [12]. However, despite these advantages, the first wave of such AI advisors across various domains has faced criticism for failing to provide adequately personalized recommendations that align with people’s individual needs and expectations [7]. In healthcare, AI diagnostic systems have demonstrated limitations in accounting for patient-specific factors [13], while in education, adaptive learning platforms often failed to accommodate diverse learning styles [14]. In response to these limitations, a new class of AI-driven, cross-domain advisory systems is emerging, leveraging large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT to provide highly tailored, personalized advice to individuals [15]. LLMs have demonstrated exceptional natural language understanding capabilities [16–18] and the ability to generate such personalized advice [19], potentially addressing key limitations of traditional advisory systems (see also [20] for a recent meta-analysis and increased adoption rates of AI since the emergence of LLMs). In finance specifically, LLMs exhibit exceptionally strong financial literacy [21], enabling them to analyze vast amounts of unstructured financial data in real time [22]. This capability enhances decision-making in areas such as trading and risk modeling as they have been shown to even reliably extract market sentiment to predict stock movements [22,23]. Beyond their technical proficiency, LLMs also demonstrate above-average emotional intelligence, with GPT-4 surpassing 89% of humans [24]. Such emotional intelligence is particularly crucial, as trust plays a fundamental role in financial decision making, and the relationship between private investors and their financial advisors strongly influences the actual adoption of financial advice [25]. Reflecting this trend, a recent study found that 22% of UK private investors with over £10,000 in investments reported using ChatGPT for financial advice, with 75% expressing confidence in its reliability [26] and similar rates have been reported in trusting ChatGPT for advice in other domains such as healthcare [27,28]. However, this growing reliance on LLMs for personalized advice raises a critical question: Can LLMs provide truly reliable financial advice, or do they reinforce already existing human investment biases? The current research examines whether especially LLM-generated financial advice is truly reliable and to what extent it exposes private investors to disproportionate risks. With millions of users starting to employ LLMs to receive financial advice, the belief that LLMs can deliver sound financial advice has the potential to shape not only individual investment decisions but also broader market dynamics. If LLM-driven advisory services systematically reinforce investment biases, they could introduce not only idiosyncratic risks for single individuals—particularly those without access to human financial advisors—but systemic investment risks across financial markets at scale [29]. The potential risks of such an overreliance on LLM-generated financial advice might mirror similar adverse effects already documented in other domains, such as medical misdiagnoses resulting from AI-healthcare tools [30], biased legal outcomes from algorithmic decision systems [31,32], and educational disparities perpetuated by AI learning platforms that fail to address diverse student needs [14]. While these cross-domain risks are increasingly surfaced and recognized, a systematic empirical investigation of how LLMs specifically influence financial decision-making remains scarce. To address this critical gap on the financial implications of LLM-generated advice, the current work presents a series of large-scale LLM experiments systematically prompting three major LLMs (Open AI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, and Microsoft’s Copilot) with varying complexity and investor profiles (e.g., young, risk-seeking investors to older, conservative investors). We evaluate the impact of LLM-generated advice on private investors’ financial portfolios using a comprehensive investment risk framework spanning five key domains (see Conceptual Framework section for details; i.e., geographical cluster risk, sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, active investment allocation risk, and total expense risk). Across four studies, we demonstrate that LLM-generated investment advice systematically increases portfolio risks for private investors across all five dimensions, with negative implications for risk-adjusted portfolio returns, and we further show that (prompt-based) debiasing interventions only partially mitigate these risks. These findings offer four key contributions: First, our studies demonstrate that LLMs exhibit systematic investment biases similar to those of human advisors, suggesting that AI systems may broadly reinforce existing human biases across advisory domains. Second, we provide a comprehensive framework for assessing five essential types of risks induced by LLM-generated financial advice, establishing a methodology that could be adapted for other domains as well. Third, our findings inform private investors seeking AI assistance, emphasizing the importance of a more critical evaluation when following fully automated recommendations by LLMs. Finally, this research establishes a generalizable framework for stakeholders—including regulators, institutions, and technology developers—to test and validate LLM-generated recommendations in the financial sector. In what follows, we first develop a comprehensive conceptual framework explaining why and how LLMs may produce risky financial advice. We then present four studies that test this framework. Finally, we discuss the broader theoretical and regulatory implications of our findings, offering insights for investors, public policy, FinTech innovators, financial institutions, and academics concerned with the evolving role of LLMs in financial advisory services. We first provide a focused review of recent work on biases in LLMs and examine how two specific types of biases in the data generating process, namely geographical and language biases, may shape the type of financial advice received by LLMs. Next, we develop a set of predictions on how these biases are further reinforced by two LLM-specific biases—availability and recency biases. Table 1 presents a focused review of the literature documenting a set of key biases of LLMs documented in the literature. The key insight across prior work is that these models tend to replicate implicit biases found in their training data [33]. For instance, LLMs have been found to exhibit gender biases, such as the association of certain professions (e.g., doctors or lawyers) more frequently with men than women (gender bias); racial biases, displaying systematically more positive sentiment toward certain demographic groups (e.g., favoring left-wing over right-wing perspectives); and even cultural biases, associating specific religious groups with more negative traits (e.g., linking Muslims with terrorism, extremism, and violence). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.t001 Among these documented biases, two are particularly relevant in the context of financial advisory—geographical and language biases. LLMs tend to perform better in languages that are overrepresented in their training data [44], and they reflect geographic biases due to disproportionate media coverage of specific regions [41]. Thus, we predict that these fundamental biases shape the financial advice private investors receive. We refer to these biases collectively as biases in the training data generation (Fig 1). We argue that these inherent data generation biases are further reinforced by two LLM-specific biases: availability bias and recency bias. Availability bias describes LLMs’ tendency to favor information that is more easily accessible [45]. In the context of LLM-generated financial advice, this suggests that regions and companies with greater representation in the training data are likely to be more disproportionately recommended in LLM-generated investment advice. Recency bias refers to placing disproportionate weight on recent events compared to historical data [35]. For financial advice, this could result in LLM-generated recommendations that overemphasize more recent market trends. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g001 Fig 1 summarizes our conceptual model, illustrating how biases in the data generation process are reinforced by LLM-specific biases (availability and recency biases) to drive subsequent investment risks (see next section for details; i.e., geographical cluster, sector cluster, trend chasing, active investment allocation, and total expense risk). In this research, we examine five distinct types of investment risks. First, we refer to geographical cluster risk as the extent to which the received investment advice puts a greater emphasis on investments of US-based equities [46,47]. As alluded to earlier, we expect that due to the training data stemming especially from English language content [48] and the fact that the US as one of the largest and most developed economies in the world with a strong presence in media reports [49], potentially increases the likelihood to produce a high concentration with US based investments. The sector cluster risk captures the extent to which investments are clustered in single sectors. We expect that due to the strong media coverage of, for example, sectors such as technology or consumer staples compared to other sectors that are of similar (or even greater) economic weight in terms of contribution to the GDP (such as transportation or service sectors; [50,51]) leads to a potential over-investment in such sectors. Next, we assess an LLM’s trend chasing risk as the extent to which investments tend to follow more recent events. Such trend chasing can lead to buying decisions when prices are high and selling them when prices are low due to herding behavior [52]. Trend chasing is also important from a macroeconomic standpoint as trend chasing can amplify market bubbles and in turn, increase the overall volatility in a financial market [53]. Due to LLMs’ already documented recency bias, we expect such trend chasing in LLM-generated financial advice. As a fourth risk type, we will assess the active investment allocation risk as the extent to which investors are invested in actively (vs. passively) managed assets. Such investment strategies (and their associated asset classes) seek to outperform a financial market (or benchmark) by selecting and investing in specific equities [54,55]. Allocating a higher share into actively managed assets in an attempt to “beat the market” is generally associated with a greater volatility risk compared to a broad, passive market exposure [56]. We therefore expect an overinvestment in actively managed assets as the training data likely includes references to specific stocks, active trading strategies, or even stock picking recommendations that are prevalent in financial media, investment forums, and advisory content, where discussions about potential market-beating investments tend to receive more attention than passive investment approaches [57]. Finally, we will assess the total expense risk as the extent of the overall costs of owning an investment, including all fees related to general administrative costs, custodian fees, as well as management fees (in the case of actively managed assets). While related, the total expense risk is distinct from active investment allocation risk as the expense risk captures the impact of reducing net returns through investment fees, and not all active investment approaches incur excessive fees or expenses [58]. For example, an actively managed ETF (short for “Exchange-Traded Fund”) such as the Schwab US Dividend ETF has a lower TER (Total Expense Ratio: the TER reflects the total costs associated with managing a fund, including management fees and administrative expenses expressed as percentage of assets invested) compared to the passive Vanguard All World portfolio ETF (TERSCHD = .06% vs. TERVT = .07%). Table 2 summarizes all of our key risk measures of our conceptual model, their definitions, why they are important from an investment standpoint, and their formal calculation. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.t002 Our experimental paradigm employs a large-scale experimental setting using a 3 (risk tendency: low/ medium/ high) x 3 (age: 15/ 30/ 50) x 3 (LLM: ChatGPT/ Copilot/ Gemini) full factorial design. The first two experimental factors (risk tendency and age) provide our baseline experimental paradigm, representing private investors’ self-stated risk-taking tendency and their objective risk exposure. Older (vs. younger) investors should generally invest in less risky assets due to their limited ability to equalize negative returns over the investment horizon [59–62]. Given that LLMs are expected to personalize financial advice [19], this research investigates how they adjust financial recommendations based on such investor risk-taking tendencies and investor age. The third experimental factor (type of LLM) addresses potential sampling issues due to LLM-specific performance differences. Our experimental paradigm resulted in 27 experimental conditions, which we each prompted 10 times to account for single (and sometimes less common) LLM responses [63]. Thus, we performed 270 prompts in total. We accessed ChatGPT 3.5 via OpenAI’s API [64], Copilot via the EdgeGPT Python package [65], and Gemini via the Bard API Python package [66]. We automatically queried these predominant LLMs in the marketplace to provide us with financial advice. The specific baseline prompt template with our experimental variations across all studies was performed as follows: “I’m a <15-year-old/ 30-year-old/ 50-year-old> looking to invest $10,000. I’m <not willing to take too many risks/ willing to take some risks/ willing to take a lot of risks> with my investment, and I’m hoping for some advice on what products I should consider investing in and how much I should allocate to each. Can you provide me with some recommendations? Please provide me with a table with the type of the investment, the name, the ticker symbol, and the amount I should invest.”. LLMs responded to these prompts with financial advice that included a table of specific investment recommendations (see Fig 2 for an exemplary investment advice by ChatGPT for a 30-year-old investor with a high risk-taking tendency). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g002 To ensure open science research practices [67], all of our code is documented and available on GitHub along with all datasets (https://github.com/ibtPhilipp/biasedEchoes). The next section details how each LLM response was further processed, how each key measure of interest was computed from the LLM’s unstructured text response, and how we analyzed the resulting measures. As summarized in Fig 3 the financial advice received by each LLM (see preceding section) was parsed and further augmented with additional financial data. We query ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini for financial advice, parse the investment portfolio recommendations, and augment them with data from Yahoo Finance, Refinitiv Eikon, and FRED (“Federal Reserve Economic Data” repository) to assess the investment risks, financial performance, and language style of the received financial advice. We query ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini for financial advice, parse the investment portfolio recommendations, and augment them with data from Yahoo Finance, Refinitiv Eikon, and FRED (“Federal Reserve Economic Data” repository) to assess the investment risks, financial performance, and language style of the received financial advice. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g003 First, we extracted the specific investment recommendations from the received unstructured LLM financial advice by performing regular expression splits. We extracted the type of investment such as “Stocks”, the name of the investment option such as “Apple Inc.”, the ticker symbol such as “AAPL”, and the amount in USD such as $3,000 for each position of the investment portfolio recommendation contained in the received financial advice. In case of an invalid LLM financial advice (i.e., non-parseable format or a missing allocation amount) we replaced the LLM response with a new one (i.e., re-prompting the model for the failed response). Second, we then further augmented the parsed investment portfolio recommendations with additional labeled financial data from Yahoo Finance (via the yfinance Python package [68]) and the Refinitiv Eikon database [69]. All investment portfolio positions were augmented with their asset type and equities were augmented by their corresponding sector utilizing Yahoo Finance. For portfolio positions with valid tickers (i.e., equities, ETFs, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies) we fetched price data from Yahoo Finance over a consistent 18-month period (1 July 2023–1 January 2025) following our initial data collection. Next, the investment portfolio positions were resolved to equity granularity level using holding data and augmented by geolocation and sector data from Refinitiv Eikon. In Study 3, investment portfolio positions were further augmented by their ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) score (ranging from 0: poor ESG performance to 100: excellent ESG performance). ETF and mutual fund investment portfolio positions were augmented by their TER and management approach (i.e., active vs. passive). To establish a risk-free baseline, we queried the risk-free market rate (i.e., 10-year US treasury bill) from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis online database FRED [70]. All this additional labeled financial data was then used to assess the investment risks, financial performance, and language style of the received LLM financial advice. Lastly, we fetched geolocation, sector, TER, holding, and price data for our benchmark (see section Benchmark) using exactly the same approach. We assessed the financial performance of the LLM financial advice utilizing the retrieved prices data and risk-free rate. The uniform time window across all retrieved data samples ensures comparability of the financial performance. We computed the recommended investment portfolio’s cumulative return, volatility (portfolio return standard deviation), and annualized risk-adjusted relative returns (annualized Sharpe ratio). Portfolio positions lacking a ticker and price data (e.g., savings or defined contribution accounts) were coded as zero return and zero volatility (only 7% of all observations). We utilized a zero-shot classification model (Facebook’s BART-large trained on the MultiNLI dataset; [71]) to assess the presence of explicit explanations about how the portfolio was constructed, the degree of assertiveness, and the presence of disclaimer notes. We specified the model for a single classification task and defined the possible classes of “explanations” and “no explanations” for the presence of explicit explanations, “assertive” and “non-assertive” for assertiveness, and “disclaimer” and “no disclaimer” for the presence of disclaimer notes. We retrieved the probabilities for each characteristic. We contrast the received financial advice relative to one of the most commonly used financial benchmark indices [72]. Specifically, we contrast all recommendations received by each LLM relative to the Vanguard Total World Stock Index Fund (VT) ETF. This ETF represents a basket of securities that track the underlying index FTSE Global All Cap. Notably, the FTSE Global All Cap index serves as a strategic benchmark for the Norwegian Government Pension Fund Global, which holds 1.5% of the world’s listed companies [73]. In short, this benchmark represents a common, broad, and diversified investment portfolio and has been used in prior work as well [72]. As with the data augmentation strategy, this data was queried using Yahoo Finance and the Refinitiv Eikon database. Investment risks. In what follows, we first analyze the multivariate effects of LLM type (Study 1) and experimental condition (Studies 2a, 2b, & 3), risk-taking tendency, and age on investment risk using a MANOVA. To assess each type of investment risk in detail, we conducted individual one-way ANOVAs, followed by planned contrasts using Tukey’s HSD correction for multiple comparisons. In Study 1, we first conducted one-way ANOVAs with individual investment risk types as the dependent variable and LLM as the predictor. We then performed t-tests comparing each LLM to the benchmark investment risk value. This helped determine whether the type of LLM influences investment risks and whether it outperforms or underperforms the benchmark. Next, we conducted additional ANOVAs with investment risk as the response variable, examining risk-taking tendency and age as predictors. For Studies 2a, 2b, and 3, we first conducted t-tests comparing investment risks between conditions and the contrast relative to the benchmark index. This allowed us to assess whether the intervention influenced the individual investment risk exposure and how it compared to the benchmark. Due to the large number of contrasts and comparisons, we report only theoretically or practically important contrasts directly in the manuscript, while the full range of contrasts is reported in detail across consecutive tables for each study in S1 Appendix. To enhance readability in the remainder of the paper, all specific effect sizes and test contrasts are reported in these tables as well. For a comprehensive overview of portfolio position exclusion criteria and robustness checks, see S4 Appendix. Financial Performance Analysis. To assess the impact of different LLMs on portfolio performance, we conducted a series of mixed linear model regressions with the portfolio cumulative return and Sharpe ratio respectively as the dependent variable. This approach was chosen to account for both fixed effects (i.e., LLMs, temporal trends, and individual characteristics) and random effects (group-level variations across portfolios). The fixed effects included the LLM (ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini) to assess whether specific models influence the return or Sharpe ratio. Additionally, we controlled for temporal trends by including monthly timestamps. This enabled us to assess how the portfolio returns and Sharpe ratios evolved over time. We also incorporated individual differences in risk-taking tendency (low, medium, and high) and age (15-, 30-, and 50-year-olds) to explore potential interactions between the LLM and risk-related variables. By introducing these predictors, we aimed to determine whether returns or Sharpe ratios varied systematically on risk-related variables and whether different LLMs performed better for specific investor types. This approach allowed us to isolate the effect of LLMs while accounting for risk-related variables and temporal trends. Language style analysis. First, we calculated a series of one-way ANOVAs and follow-up contrasts with Tukey HSD correction for multiple comparisons for each characteristic (presence of explanations, assertiveness, and presence of disclaimer notes) as the dependent and the LLM as the independent variable. This allowed us to assess whether LLMs deviate in their language style when communicating the financial advice. Next, we conducted one-way ANOVAs and Tukey HSD corrected contrasts with each characteristic as the dependent and risk-taking tendency and age respectively as independent variables. These additional ANOVAs were conducted to test whether LLMs change their language style depending on an individual’s risk-taking tendency (e.g., very assertive language for high risk-taking individuals) and age. In Study 1 we assessed the type of financial advice that private investors receive as a function of their appetite for risk (self-stated risk-taking tendency and investor age) from the most widely used LLMs (Open AI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, Microsoft’s Copilot). Study 1 employed our baseline experimental paradigm (see Methods section). A MANOVA with the investment risk types (geographical cluster, sector cluster, trend chasing, active investment allocation, and total expense risk) as the response and the LLM (ChatGPT/ Gemini/ Copilot), risk-taking tendency (low/ medium/ high), and age (15/ 30/ 50) as predictors showed significant effects of LLM type (ΛWilks = .7, F(10, 464) = 9.20, p < .001), risk-taking tendency (ΛWilks = .19, F(10, 464) = 60.41, p < .001), and age (ΛWilks = .87, F(5, 232) = 6.81, p < .001). In what follows, we provide a deep dive into the results explaining the differences of individual investment risks depending on each LLM (Fig 4). (A) We find above benchmark geographical cluster risk (N = 269), (B) sector cluster risk (N = 269), (C) trend chasing risk (N = 270), and (D) active investment risk (N = 270). The violin plots and boxplots represent the shape of the distribution of the respective investment risk by LLM. The black dot represents the mean and the colored dots the value of individual portfolio samples. The dashed line represents the value of the benchmark. (A) We find above benchmark geographical cluster risk (N = 269), (B) sector cluster risk (N = 269), (C) trend chasing risk (N = 270), and (D) active investment risk (N = 270). The violin plots and boxplots represent the shape of the distribution of the respective investment risk by LLM. The black dot represents the mean and the colored dots the value of individual portfolio samples. The dashed line represents the value of the benchmark. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g004 Geographical & sector cluster risk. Our results show that all three LLMs revealed excessive cluster risk compared to our benchmark index. That is reflected in both an over-investment in US equities (with LLMs investing over 93% in US equities vs. 59% in the benchmark) and a higher concentration of funds in individual sectors (Fig 5). An additional concentration analysis showed that LLMs invested on average over 5% and 8% more in the already predominant technology (t(268) = 4.73, p < .001) and consumer cyclical sectors (t(268) = 8.23, p < .001) compared to the benchmark, thereby systematically increasing the sector cluster risk of the portfolio (see S2 Appendix for sector concentration details). This figure illustrates the portfolio weight by LLM type and country relative to the benchmark for the top five sectors (N = 269). This figure illustrates the portfolio weight by LLM type and country relative to the benchmark for the top five sectors (N = 269). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g005 Trend chasing risk. As shown in Fig 4:C, we find that all LLMs heavily engage in trend chasing with up to 27.92% invested in the top three equities that were traded most frequently in the past three months prior to prompting the LLMs. Consistent with our predictions, we find that all three LLMs display systematically higher trend chasing compared to the benchmark index (9%). Active investment allocation risk. We also observe systematically higher shares of actively managed investment options and stock picking. Specifically, we find that over 51% of investments were allocated into actively managed funds or single equities while the benchmark is a fully passive index-replicating ETF. Total expense risk. Finally, we observe significantly higher total expense ratios across all LLM portfolio recommendations compared to the benchmark index. Next, we conducted one-way ANOVAs with individual investment risks as the response variable and LLM type, risk-taking tendency as well as LLM type and age as predictors. Follow-up contrasts with Tukey’s HSD correction revealed a consistently higher active investment allocation risk for individuals with high (vs. low and medium) risk-taking tendencies. ChatGPT and Gemini even increased this risk for those with medium (vs. low) risk-taking tendencies. Similarly, LLMs provided financial advice with higher total expense risk for individuals with high (vs. low and medium) risk-taking tendencies. Further, ChatGPT and Copilot adjusted their recommendations for individuals with low (vs. medium and high) risk-taking tendencies, showing a significantly lower trend chasing risk – as low as 0.67% compared to 38.18% for those with high risk-taking tendencies. Other cases showed variations in investment risks based on risk-taking tendency and age-related risk, but these contrasts did not follow a consistent trend across LLMs. However, we find that ChatGPT and Gemini show less concentration in the technology and consumer cyclical sector for low risk-taking investors and a higher share in government activities. Copilot even concentrates over 46% of funds in government activities (i.e. bond ETFs) for low (vs. medium and high) risk-taking tendency resulting again in a higher sector concentration risk. Taken together, Study 1 provides initial evidence that LLM investment advice induces a significantly enhanced investment portfolio risk across all five types of portfolio risks (geographical cluster risk, sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, active investment allocation risk, and total expense risk). Further, we find that LLMs systematically adapt the provided investment advice depending on the risk-taking tendency. Financial performance analysis. A mixed-linear model, controlling for temporal effects and using the benchmark as the baseline, revealed that Copilot exhibited significantly lower Sharpe ratios (β = −1.14, p < .01), indicating worse risk-adjusted performance compared to the benchmark (see Fig 6). In contrast, ChatGPT (β = −.28, p = .52) and Gemini (β = −.12, p = .79) did not show statistically significant differences from the benchmark. Temporal effects were not significant, suggesting that the relative risk-adjusted performance of these portfolios remained stable over time but also not significantly more positive relative to the benchmark despite the additional amount of risk exposure of each LLM. The relatively strong risk-adjusted performance of ChatGPT and Gemini is likely driven by an overconcentration in the technology sector and the specific market conditions during the performance analysis period. Given the rapid growth of the technology sector—primarily fueled by advancements in LLM technology itself—portfolios disproportionately exposed to this sector benefited from favorable market trends. The figure shows the Sharpe ratio of ChatGPT (N = 1620), Copilot (N = 1620), and Gemini (N = 1620) relative to the benchmark (N = 18) over a 1.5-year period following the initial data collection. The figure shows the Sharpe ratio of ChatGPT (N = 1620), Copilot (N = 1620), and Gemini (N = 1620) relative to the benchmark (N = 18) over a 1.5-year period following the initial data collection. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g006 However, it is crucial to highlight that risk-adjusted returns, such as the Sharpe ratio, only adjust for the level of risk reflected in return volatility. This measure does not fully capture the broader spectrum of investment risks depending on other market conditions. For example, geopolitical events may evoke additional geographical risks inherent in LLM-generated investment advice leading to increased return fluctuations. Thus, relying solely on return volatility adjusted risk measures can lead to an incomplete assessment of true investment risks inherent in financial advice. Moreover, we also observed that both the choice of LLM and its sensitivity to people’s risk tendencies significantly influenced risk-adjusted performance. Specifically, mixed-linear models controlling for temporal effects and including self-stated risk-taking and age as predictors indicated that Copilot’s risk-adjusted performance was significantly worse for investors with a low self-stated risk-taking tendency (β = −3.13, p < .001), as well as for 30-year-olds (β = −1.57, p < .001) and 50-year-olds (β = −1.12, p = .01) compared to the benchmark. In summary, these findings suggest that while some LLMs may appear to perform adequately (or at least not worse compared to our benchmark) during specific market conditions, this performance is likely driven by the most recent market conditions that benefitted technology and AI investments rather than evidence of a superior investment strategy. The overconcentration in technology sectors that temporarily benefited ChatGPT and Gemini portfolios represents precisely the type of cluster risk that would expose investors to substantial losses during sector-specific downturns. Moreover, the significant underperformance of Copilot, particularly for risk-averse and middle-aged investors, reveals a concerning pattern: LLMs may be least reliable for the very demographic groups most likely to seek and follow automated financial advice. Collectively, these results indicate that LLM-generated financial advice creates a potentially disadvantageous combination of hidden risks and misleading performance indicators that could lead investors to overestimate the quality of LLM-generated recommendations while underestimating their exposure to undiversified risk factors not captured by conventional performance metrics. Language style analysis. Finally, we examined the specific language style employed across all models (see S3 Appendix for details). We utilized a zero-shot transformer model (Facebook’s BART-large trained on the MultiNLI dataset; [71]) to detect whether the investment advice offered a clear explanation or rationale (i.e., why a specific investment option should be chosen), the extent of assertiveness (i.e., how firmly the AI recommends to invest into a specific asset class), and to which extent the advice offers a disclaimer at the end of the recommendation (i.e., stating the potential risks involved with the investment). These analyses demonstrate that all recommendations offered a seemingly plausible explanation (e.g., “Procter & Gamble is a stable company with a long history of paying dividends. Dividend stocks provide regular income and can grow over time.”), with medium to high assertiveness (e.g., “Considering your requirements, here’s a diversified investment portfolio with a breakdown of how much you should allocate to each type of investment:”), and offering a seemingly trustworthy and “caring” disclaimer in the recommendation (e.g., “Remember, these are just recommendations, and it’s crucial to do your own research or consult a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.”). Notably, and as reported in the detailed analysis in S3 Appendix, our results revealed that approximately 95% of all investment recommendations across the three LLMs contained such financial investing disclaimers, suggesting they might function as a deliberate precautionary measure implemented by LLM providers to mitigate potential liability concerns while still delivering a highly assertive financial advice that users are likely to follow despite these warnings. Robustness checks. To test whether our findings hold for most recent versions of LLMs, we automatically queried ChatGPT 4o (gpt-4o-2024-08-06) and Claude Sonnet 3.5 (claude-3–5-sonnet-20241022). We employed our baseline template prompt (see Experimental paradigm) but added instructions that the model should check that the investment recommendations add up to $10,000 and respond in JSON format for improved advice parsing (this option did not exist when we collected the initial dataset). We employed a 2 (LLM: GPT 4o/ Sonnet 3.5) x 3 (risk-taking tendency: low, medium, high) x 3 (age: 15, 30, 50) full factorial design. Following our approach in Study 1, we repeated every prompt five times to prevent a single response selection biases. We retrieved valid responses for all prompts (N = 90). Next, we augmented the financial advice received with additional labeled data and calculated the investment risks analogous to Study 1. Our results show that also the most recent LLMs at the time of this study, exhibit the same above-benchmark investment risks, with the magnitude of each risk somewhat depending on the type of LLM (Fig 7). What is consistent is that all more recent LLMs show an even more pronounced sector cluster risk (due to investing more into the predominant sectors of technology and consumer cyclicals) and a higher total expense risk. We find (A) above benchmark geographical cluster risk (N = 359), (B) sector cluster risk (N = 357), (C) trend chasing risk (N = 360), and (D) active investment risk (N = 270) also for current versions of LLMs. The violin plots and boxplots represent the shape of the distribution of the respective investment risk by LLM. The black dot represents the mean and the colored dots the value of individual portfolios. The dashed line represents the value of the benchmark. We find (A) above benchmark geographical cluster risk (N = 359), (B) sector cluster risk (N = 357), (C) trend chasing risk (N = 360), and (D) active investment risk (N = 270) also for current versions of LLMs. The violin plots and boxplots represent the shape of the distribution of the respective investment risk by LLM. The black dot represents the mean and the colored dots the value of individual portfolios. The dashed line represents the value of the benchmark. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g007 In Study 2a we assessed whether we can alter a single risk dimension (such as avoiding management fees) without changing the other types of risks. We used a two-cell experimental design (control prompt vs. debiasing intervention prompt) with a control prompt identical to Study 1 and a debiasing intervention prompt that explicitly requested no management fees (“I don’t want to pay any management fees.”). This simple, prompt-based intervention is the only realistic alternative for private investors (most private investors will not have the luxury to fine-tune a model and test more sophisticated debiasing techniques). The baseline paradigm in both the control condition and risk debiasing condition was identical and used the same experimental setup as in Study 1 (full factorial design with 3 (risk tendency: high/ medium/ low) x 3 (age: 15/ 30/ 50); given the similar responses provided by LLMs in Study 1, we focused on ChatGPT as the most successful commercially available LLM for the remainder of the paper). A MANOVA with the investment risks (geographical cluster risk, sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, active investment allocation risk, and total expense risk) as the response and the prompting intervention (control vs. debiasing prompt), risk-taking tendency and age as predictors showed significant effects for the prompting intervention (ΛWilks = .82, F(5, 154) = 6.6, p < .001), risk-taking tendency (ΛWilks = .18, F(10, 308) = 41.68, p < .001), and investor age (ΛWilks = .88, F(5, 154) = 4.31, p < .01). Despite the significant main effect of the debiasing intervention, we find that narrow debiasing only directionally reduces the TER compared to the control condition and fails to decrease it to the level of the benchmark. However, we find that the debiasing intervention moderately reduces the share of actively managed investments. Yet, we still find that over 48% of investments are allocated to actively managed funds or single equities. The narrow debiasing intervention also reduced the over-investment in US stocks and sector concentration in LLM financial advice. However, the geographical as well as sector cluster risk still remained significantly larger compared to the benchmark. The narrow debiasing intervention prompt did not reduce trend chasing, resulting in still significantly stronger trend chasing compared to the benchmark. One-way ANOVAs and planned follow-up contrasts with Tukey HSD correction with experimental condition and risk-taking tendency as well as experimental condition and age as predictor showed that the risk-taking tendency had only limited influence on investment risk changes between conditions. Specifically, our results show that the narrow debiasing intervention only significantly reduced the geographical cluster risk and active investment allocation risk for low self-stated risk-taking tendency where these risks were already the smallest compared to medium and high risk-taking tendency. These findings suggest that while simple prompt-based interventions (like requesting no management fees) can partially mitigate some investment risks, they fail to comprehensively address the full spectrum of risks present in LLM-generated financial advice. The persistence of significant geographical concentration, sector biases, and trend chasing behavior (despite a moderate reduction of actively managed funds) indicates that the systematic investment biases in LLMs are deeply embedded and relatively resistant to simple corrective measures that typical private investors might realistically employ. Financial Performance Analysis. A mixed-linear model, controlling for temporal effects and using the benchmark as a baseline revealed that the risk-adjusted performance of LLM investment advice in the control (β = −.21, p = .19) and debiasing intervention condition (β = −.29, p = .08) were not significantly different relative to the benchmark. Our results show that the risk-adjusted returns improved over time and were significantly lower in the first three months (β08/2023 = −2.3, p = .02; β09/2023 = −3.43, p < .01; β10/2023 = −3.29, p < .01). Furthermore, we find that especially for investors with a high (βcontrol = −.41, p < .01; βdebiased = −.43, p < .01) and low (vs. medium) risk-taking tendency (βcontrol = −.46, p < .01; βdebiased = −.40, p < .01) the risk-adjusted returns were in fact lower in both prompt conditions compared to the benchmark. Again, we also find that the risk-adjusted returns were especially lower in the short-term (β08/2023 = −2.3, p = .01; β09/2023 = −3.43, p < .001; β10/2023 = −3.29, p < .001). Finally, and similarly to Study 1, we find that 50-year-olds received investment advice with lower risk-adjusted returns (βcontrol = −.34, p = .04; βdebiased = −.34, p = .04) compared to the benchmark and that the risk-adjusted returns were especially reduced short-term (β08/2023 = −2.3, p = .02; β09/2023 = −3.43, p < .001; β10/2023 = −3.29, p < .01). In summary, this study provides evidence that a narrow debiasing approach—targeting a single investment risk dimension—fails to reduce exposure to that specific risk in LLM-generated financial advice. Our findings suggest that private investors may only partially mitigate their investment risk exposure through simple prompt-based debiasing interventions. This is important as more advanced debiasing techniques, such as fine-tuning models, are not accessible to most private investors. In Study 2b we assessed to which extent a broader debiasing prompt may reduce the overall financial portfolio risk. Specifying multiple risks in the debiasing prompt, this prompting strategy may reinforce the risk reduction of every single risk alone as such broad debiasing interventions can often lead to effective debiasing of LLMs [74]. We tested this possibility by employing the same experimental design as in Study 2a, with an overarching debiasing prompt intervention (“Avoid common investment mistakes such as lack of diversification, cluster risks, and active management”). A MANOVA with the investment risks as the dependent and the prompting condition (control vs. debiasing intervention), risk-taking tendency, and age as the predictors showed a significant effect for the prompting condition (ΛWilks = .62, F(5, 165) = 20.58, p < .001), risk-taking tendency (ΛWilks = .31, F(10, 330) = 25.84, p < .001), while the effect of age was non-significant (ΛWilks = .93, F(5, 165) = 2.14, p = .06). Follow-up contrasts revealed that this broader debiasing intervention (vs. the narrow debiasing intervention in Study 2a) was largely successful at reducing a range of investment risks (Fig 8). Specifically, we find that the debiasing prompt reduced the over-investment in US assets and sector concentration (while still remaining significantly greater compared to the benchmark however). The amount of assets allocated to US assets was reduced by over 10% but remained at a still high 80% level. Additional contrasts further show that the sector concentration decreased due to a significant 8% and 9% investment allocation decrease in the predominant technology and consumer cyclical sectors. These findings highlight that a more equal distribution across sectors is easier to achieve compared to an equal distribution across financial markets (i.e., arguably due to the strong presence of US-based equities). We find that the debiasing intervention also significantly reduced trend chasing to the extent that it no longer differs significantly from the benchmark. Simultaneously, we find that the debiasing intervention reduces the share of actively managed investment options by over 32%. Finally, the debiasing intervention also significantly decreased the TER by more than.06%. Nevertheless, TER remained notably higher compared to our benchmark. We find (A) above benchmark geographical cluster risk (N = 180), (B) sector cluster risk (N = 180), (D) active investment risk (N = 180), and (C) non-different trend chasing risk (N = 180) when using a broad debiasing intervention. The violin plots and boxplots represent the shape of the distribution of the respective characteristic by condition. The black dot represents the mean and the colored dots the value of individual portfolios. The dashed line represents the value of the benchmark.

We find that the debiasing intervention significantly decreased the sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, and active investment allocation risk especially for investors with medium and high risk-taking tendency. Additionally, the debiasing intervention also decreased the total expense risk for high risk-taking tendency and the sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, and active investment allocation risk across all age levels. The collective insight is that broader debiasing interventions explicitly targeting multiple investment risks simultaneously can significantly reduce portfolio risks across most dimensions and age groups, although the geographic concentration remains somewhat elevated above benchmark levels. The differential effectiveness across investor profiles—with greater risk reduction for medium and high risk-taking investors—suggests that LLMs may be more susceptible to debiasing interventions when generating advice for more risk-tolerant investors, while continuing to embed the same biases reported earlier in recommendations for more conservative investors even after explicit correction attempts. Financial Performance Analysis. Analogous to Study 2a, we performed multiple mixed-linear regression models. Again, we find no significant difference of the LLM investment recommendations provided in the control (β = −.25, p = .11) and the debiased condition (β = −.29, p = .06) relative to the benchmark in terms of risk-adjusted returns. We only find a moderate temporal trend indicating lower risk-adjusted performance especially with reduced short-term returns (β08/2023 = −2.26, p = .02; β09/2023 = −3.46, p < .001; β10/2023 = −3.43, p < .001). We find that the risk-adjusted returns are worse for high (β = −.40, p < .01) and low risk-taking tendency (β = −.48 p < .001) in the control condition and for low risk-taking in the debiased condition (β = −.37 p = .01). Further, we find again that the risk-adjusted returns are lower than the benchmark for 50-year-olds in the control condition (βcontrol = −.34, p = .03) and for 30-year-olds in the debiased condition (βdebiased = −.37, p = .02). Also, in this model we find that the risk-adjusted returns were especially reduced short-term at the beginning of the performance measurement period (β08/2023 = −2.26, p = .01; β09/2023 = −3.46, p < .001; β10/2023 = −3.43, p < .001). Thus, despite the successful risk reduction through broader debiasing interventions, both control and debiased LLM-generated portfolios still failed to outperform the benchmark on risk-adjusted returns. These results suggest that even when successful at mitigating specific portfolio risks, debiasing interventions do not translate into improved risk-adjusted performance, indicating that LLM-generated financial advice continues to carry inefficiencies that cannot be fully addressed through prompt engineering alone. In Study 3 we tested whether incorporating an explicit investment goal in the prompt further aids in mitigating specific investment risks in LLMs investment advice. The study directly tests the ability of LLMs to adapt their investment advice based on contextual information and to personalize the investment advice to specific investor needs. Instead of directly asking the LLM to reduce the investment risks of a portfolio, a private investor may prompt a specific investment goal that would in turn translate into a decrease of specific investment risks merely based on the contextual information provided. The current study tests this possibility to infer and “sense” such context information. We employed the same experimental design as in Study 2a but incorporated an explicit investment goal in the prompt (“I want to invest in a way that promotes responsible and socially impactful contributions to our global society.”). We anticipated that this goal would lead LLMs to offer financial advice with reduced geographical and sector concentration risks. The phrase “contributions to our global society” was expected to decrease investments in U.S. assets, while “promotes responsible and socially impactful contributions” aimed to lessen the focus on technology and consumer cyclical sectors and thereby potentially reducing the previously documented trend chasing risk. We also expected that incorporating such a goal would result in investment recommendations with higher ESG scores [75]. A MANOVA with the investment risks as response and the prompt condition (control vs. goal prompt), risk-taking tendency and age as predictors showed a significant effect of the prompt condition (ΛWilks = .30, F(5, 161) = 74.31, p < .001), risk-taking tendency (ΛWilks = .51, F(10, 322) = 12.67, p < .001), while showing only a marginal effect of age (ΛWilks = .94, F(5, 161) = 2.20, p = .06). Follow-up contrasts revealed that investment risks showed a significant decrease in over-investments in US Stocks in the investment goal prompt compared to control, yet higher than our benchmark. However, we find that the introduction of a socially responsible investment goal did not lead to a significant decrease in sector concentration compared to the control prompt and remains still significantly higher than the benchmark index. As shown in Fig 9:A, not only remains this sector concentration very high, but is also substantially overleveraged towards utilities, due to shifting investments towards the energy sector (i.e., “green” energy). Next, we further examined the ESG score in the intervention (vs. control) condition. As summarized in Fig 9: B, specific investment goals were not effective in increasing the portfolio ESG rating of the portfolio. Specifically, we find that there is no significant portfolio ESG rating difference when incorporating a social responsibility goal prompt compared to the control prompt or benchmark. However, it is worth noting that incorporating the social responsibility goal effectively reduced the risk of receiving a low ESG rating compared to control (Levene’s test: F(1, 693) = 23.83, p < .001). We also observe a significant decrease in trend chasing behavior in the LLM investment advice when incorporating a social responsibility investment goal. Adding the social responsibility investment goal however, increased the actively managed portfolio share by over 29% compared to the control condition. Thus, LLMs engage in significantly more “stock picking” when provided with a specific investment goal. Finally, we observe significantly higher total expense ratios when incorporating a social responsibility goal compared to our control condition and benchmark.

In (B) (N = 180) the violin plots and boxplots represent the shape of the distribution of the ESG score by condition.

In contrast, trend chasing risk decreased for those with medium and high risk-taking tendencies under the same condition. Further, the ESG score only increased for high risk-taking tendency when including the socially responsible investment goal where the ESG score was significantly lower (vs. medium and high self-stated risk-taking tendency) in the control condition. The geographical cluster risk decreased only for 50-year-olds. All other contrasts did not yield any meaningful patterns. The collective insight is that while LLMs can effectively adapt their investment advice to specific goals like a stronger social responsibility focus—evidenced by reduced US-centric investments and less trend chasing behavior—these adaptations come with significant trade-offs, including increased active management, higher expense ratios, and sector concentration shifted toward utilities rather than truly diversified portfolios. The inconsistent effectiveness across investor profiles further suggests that LLMs struggle to simultaneously optimize for both specific investment goals and fundamental portfolio construction principles, creating potentially new risk patterns when attempting to accommodate more personalized investing objectives. Financial Performance Analysis. As in the preceding studies, we conducted a series of mixed-linear models to analyze portfolio performance. We find that investments recommended by LLMs in the control condition are not significantly different from the benchmark in terms of risk-adjusted returns (β = −.25, p = .15). In the debiased condition, the LLM investment advice even underperformed the benchmark significantly (β = −.76, p < .001). The temporal trend indicating worse risk-adjusted performance in the beginning holds also for this model (β08/2023 = −2.62, p = .01; β09/2023 = −3.76, p < .001; β10/2023 = −3.78, p < .001; β10/2023 = −2.20, p = .04). We find that this underperformance in the debiased condition stems from the underperformance across both high (β = −1, p < .001) and medium risk-taking tendency investors (β = −1.02, p < .001) and we also find a clear underperformance for low risk-taking tendency in the control condition (β = −.48, p < .01). While we find no significant risk-adjusted underperformance for any age in the control condition, we document a strong underperformance across all age groups in the debiased condition (β15 = −.70, p < .001; β30 = −.75, p < .001; β50 = −.85, p < .001). Thus, we find overall that the introduction of socially responsible investment goals in LLM-generated advice led to significant underperformance compared to the benchmark, highlighting that when LLMs attempt to optimize for specific social impact objectives, they tend to sacrifice financial performance even more severely and lead to new, unwanted concentration issues (i.e., higher concentration in the utilities sector to promote investments in “green” energy). LLMs often reveal biases implicitly present in the underlying training data [33–35,38,76]. Our findings suggest that these biases can result in LLM-generated financial advice that leads to elevated investment risks for private investors across five major risk dimensions (geographical cluster risk, sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, active investment allocation risk, and total expense risk) and that a range of debiasing interventions only partially mitigated these risks. We find that LLMs recommend a narrow range of geographical regions to invest, concentrate on a few narrow sectors, engage in more aggressive trend-following and stock-picking, and ultimately propose high-fee investment options—all recommendations that are incompatible with modern portfolio theory [46,52,56–58,77–81]. These findings illustrate the need for new risk frameworks in algorithmic finance and to better understand underlying data biases that can lead to a reinforcement of traditional (human) investment biases. The findings of this research document the inherent risks for private investors who already started to employ LLMs to receive financial advice [15], and we hope that the current findings promote a more critical assessment of the advice they receive. However, it is noteworthy to highlight that a critical assessment becomes more difficult when LLM-generated investment advice is communicated very convincingly (see S3 Appendix for details). These findings are sensitive because they suggest a potentially misleading sense of confidence and benevolence by LLM-generated investment advice, paired with precautionary “disclaimers” added in over 95% of the cases across all LLMs we examined. This finding is important in light of prior work showing that LLM advice is often perceived as strikingly more positive even though the advice might carry inherent bias or when the advice is objectively worse compared to expert humans [27,82–86]. The ability to blindly follow harmful LLM-generated investment recommendations presents a significant risk for individual investors, particularly those lacking potentially financial literacy or access to professional financial advisors. Future research should investigate how personal financial goals could be better integrated into AI investment strategies while maintaining appropriate risk management. A fruitful direction for future work is also to further examine whether financial education (potentially even through the use of LLMs) can ultimately empower private investors to critically assess such LLM-generated investment recommendations. Future regulatory research may also focus on developing frameworks to protect consumers from the potential risks of such generative investment advice. This includes exploring effective monitoring mechanisms to prevent more large-scale, systemic risks across financial markets and establishing reporting requirements for firms that utilize generative investment advisory tools. As LLMs become more integrated into financial advisory services, regulators may need to establish clear guidelines for transparency, explainability, and accountability in such AI-driven financial advice, especially when used by private investors. For FinTech developers, our research highlights the importance of addressing inherent biases in LLM-generated financial advice and how to develop future systems that better align with modern portfolio theory principles and avoid reinforcing harmful investment biases documented in the current research. A main question for future work will be how generative investment advice algorithms can be trained to generate recommendations that are more consistent with investors’ long-term financial goals and risk tolerance without inducing the investment risks reported in this paper. As with any research, we also highlight at least two limitations of the current work. First, we evaluated LLMs at specific points in time, and these models continue to evolve very rapidly. While our robustness checks with the most recent models (as per January 2025) seem to be robust (see Robustness Checks at the end of Study 1), future generations of models might improve radically once foundation models might be explicitly debiased during the training stage. Second, our simulated investment portfolios were evaluated over a specific time-period that coincided with a strong technology sector performance. However, we believe that exactly due to these favorable market conditions for technology-heavy portfolios, our financial performance analysis reported in this paper represent a conservative estimate of the potential risks of LLM-based financial advice. In market environments where technology sectors underperform, the geographical and sector concentration risks we identified would likely lead to even worse investment outcomes, further amplifying the risk exposure of portfolios generated by LLMs. In conclusion, the current work demonstrates that LLM-generated investment advice systematically increases portfolio risks across multiple dimensions, potentially exposing private investors to unwanted investment risks while creating a false sense of confidence through convincing language and reassuring disclaimers. These findings underscore the need for more cross-disciplinary collaboration among investors (both private and institutional investors), regulators, FinTech innovators, financial institutions, and researchers to develop more robust frameworks for evaluating and improving AI-generated financial advice. We hope the current research promotes such collaborations to proactively transform the financial advisory landscape to truly serve the interests of private investors through properly diversified, low-cost, and personalized financial advice. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.s001 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.s002 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.s003 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.s004 (DOCX) We thank the reviewers for their thoughtful feedback and constructive suggestions that significantly improved this manuscript.

Large language models are increasingly used by private investors seeking financial advice. The current paper examines the potential of these models to perpetuate investment biases and affect the economic security of individuals at scale. We provide a systematic assessment of how large language models used for investment advice shape the portfolio risks of private investors. We offer a comprehensive model of large language model investment advice risk, examining five key dimensions of portfolio risks (geographical cluster risk, sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, active investment allocation risk, and total expense risk). We demonstrate across four studies that large language models used for investment advice induce increased portfolio risks across all five risk dimensions, and that a range of debiasing interventions only partially mitigate these risks. Our findings show that large language models exhibit similar “cognitive” biases as human investors, reinforcing existing investment biases inherent in their training data. These findings have important implications for private investors, policymakers, artificial intelligence developers, financial institutions, and the responsible development of large language models in the financial sector.

Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. The landscape of professional advice is experiencing a profound transformation driven by artificial intelligence (AI). In domains ranging from healthcare and legal services to education and finance, millions of individuals are increasingly turning to AI-powered advisory systems [1–5]. Within financial services specifically, this shift is exemplified by the sharp rise of robo-advisors [6–9]. These fully automated platforms assess people’s financial goals, evaluate their risk tolerance, and manage entire investment portfolios without any human intervention [6]. By democratizing access to financial advice, robo-advisors enable individuals who previously did not meet minimum investment thresholds to participate in wealth-building, potentially reducing global wealth inequality [7,10,11]. Beyond complex tasks such as managing an entirely financial portfolio, these technologies can also assist users with basic personal finance tasks such as budgeting and expense tracking, offering accessible financial guidance for everyday decisions [12]. However, despite these advantages, the first wave of such AI advisors across various domains has faced criticism for failing to provide adequately personalized recommendations that align with people’s individual needs and expectations [7]. In healthcare, AI diagnostic systems have demonstrated limitations in accounting for patient-specific factors [13], while in education, adaptive learning platforms often failed to accommodate diverse learning styles [14]. In response to these limitations, a new class of AI-driven, cross-domain advisory systems is emerging, leveraging large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT to provide highly tailored, personalized advice to individuals [15]. LLMs have demonstrated exceptional natural language understanding capabilities [16–18] and the ability to generate such personalized advice [19], potentially addressing key limitations of traditional advisory systems (see also [20] for a recent meta-analysis and increased adoption rates of AI since the emergence of LLMs). In finance specifically, LLMs exhibit exceptionally strong financial literacy [21], enabling them to analyze vast amounts of unstructured financial data in real time [22]. This capability enhances decision-making in areas such as trading and risk modeling as they have been shown to even reliably extract market sentiment to predict stock movements [22,23]. Beyond their technical proficiency, LLMs also demonstrate above-average emotional intelligence, with GPT-4 surpassing 89% of humans [24]. Such emotional intelligence is particularly crucial, as trust plays a fundamental role in financial decision making, and the relationship between private investors and their financial advisors strongly influences the actual adoption of financial advice [25]. Reflecting this trend, a recent study found that 22% of UK private investors with over £10,000 in investments reported using ChatGPT for financial advice, with 75% expressing confidence in its reliability [26] and similar rates have been reported in trusting ChatGPT for advice in other domains such as healthcare [27,28]. However, this growing reliance on LLMs for personalized advice raises a critical question: Can LLMs provide truly reliable financial advice, or do they reinforce already existing human investment biases? The current research examines whether especially LLM-generated financial advice is truly reliable and to what extent it exposes private investors to disproportionate risks. With millions of users starting to employ LLMs to receive financial advice, the belief that LLMs can deliver sound financial advice has the potential to shape not only individual investment decisions but also broader market dynamics. If LLM-driven advisory services systematically reinforce investment biases, they could introduce not only idiosyncratic risks for single individuals—particularly those without access to human financial advisors—but systemic investment risks across financial markets at scale [29]. The potential risks of such an overreliance on LLM-generated financial advice might mirror similar adverse effects already documented in other domains, such as medical misdiagnoses resulting from AI-healthcare tools [30], biased legal outcomes from algorithmic decision systems [31,32], and educational disparities perpetuated by AI learning platforms that fail to address diverse student needs [14]. While these cross-domain risks are increasingly surfaced and recognized, a systematic empirical investigation of how LLMs specifically influence financial decision-making remains scarce. To address this critical gap on the financial implications of LLM-generated advice, the current work presents a series of large-scale LLM experiments systematically prompting three major LLMs (Open AI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, and Microsoft’s Copilot) with varying complexity and investor profiles (e.g., young, risk-seeking investors to older, conservative investors). We evaluate the impact of LLM-generated advice on private investors’ financial portfolios using a comprehensive investment risk framework spanning five key domains (see Conceptual Framework section for details; i.e., geographical cluster risk, sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, active investment allocation risk, and total expense risk). Across four studies, we demonstrate that LLM-generated investment advice systematically increases portfolio risks for private investors across all five dimensions, with negative implications for risk-adjusted portfolio returns, and we further show that (prompt-based) debiasing interventions only partially mitigate these risks. These findings offer four key contributions: First, our studies demonstrate that LLMs exhibit systematic investment biases similar to those of human advisors, suggesting that AI systems may broadly reinforce existing human biases across advisory domains. Second, we provide a comprehensive framework for assessing five essential types of risks induced by LLM-generated financial advice, establishing a methodology that could be adapted for other domains as well. Third, our findings inform private investors seeking AI assistance, emphasizing the importance of a more critical evaluation when following fully automated recommendations by LLMs. Finally, this research establishes a generalizable framework for stakeholders—including regulators, institutions, and technology developers—to test and validate LLM-generated recommendations in the financial sector. In what follows, we first develop a comprehensive conceptual framework explaining why and how LLMs may produce risky financial advice. We then present four studies that test this framework. Finally, we discuss the broader theoretical and regulatory implications of our findings, offering insights for investors, public policy, FinTech innovators, financial institutions, and academics concerned with the evolving role of LLMs in financial advisory services. We first provide a focused review of recent work on biases in LLMs and examine how two specific types of biases in the data generating process, namely geographical and language biases, may shape the type of financial advice received by LLMs. Next, we develop a set of predictions on how these biases are further reinforced by two LLM-specific biases—availability and recency biases. Table 1 presents a focused review of the literature documenting a set of key biases of LLMs documented in the literature. The key insight across prior work is that these models tend to replicate implicit biases found in their training data [33]. For instance, LLMs have been found to exhibit gender biases, such as the association of certain professions (e.g., doctors or lawyers) more frequently with men than women (gender bias); racial biases, displaying systematically more positive sentiment toward certain demographic groups (e.g., favoring left-wing over right-wing perspectives); and even cultural biases, associating specific religious groups with more negative traits (e.g., linking Muslims with terrorism, extremism, and violence). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.t001 Among these documented biases, two are particularly relevant in the context of financial advisory—geographical and language biases. LLMs tend to perform better in languages that are overrepresented in their training data [44], and they reflect geographic biases due to disproportionate media coverage of specific regions [41]. Thus, we predict that these fundamental biases shape the financial advice private investors receive. We refer to these biases collectively as biases in the training data generation (Fig 1). We argue that these inherent data generation biases are further reinforced by two LLM-specific biases: availability bias and recency bias. Availability bias describes LLMs’ tendency to favor information that is more easily accessible [45]. In the context of LLM-generated financial advice, this suggests that regions and companies with greater representation in the training data are likely to be more disproportionately recommended in LLM-generated investment advice. Recency bias refers to placing disproportionate weight on recent events compared to historical data [35]. For financial advice, this could result in LLM-generated recommendations that overemphasize more recent market trends. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g001 Fig 1 summarizes our conceptual model, illustrating how biases in the data generation process are reinforced by LLM-specific biases (availability and recency biases) to drive subsequent investment risks (see next section for details; i.e., geographical cluster, sector cluster, trend chasing, active investment allocation, and total expense risk). In this research, we examine five distinct types of investment risks. First, we refer to geographical cluster risk as the extent to which the received investment advice puts a greater emphasis on investments of US-based equities [46,47]. As alluded to earlier, we expect that due to the training data stemming especially from English language content [48] and the fact that the US as one of the largest and most developed economies in the world with a strong presence in media reports [49], potentially increases the likelihood to produce a high concentration with US based investments. The sector cluster risk captures the extent to which investments are clustered in single sectors. We expect that due to the strong media coverage of, for example, sectors such as technology or consumer staples compared to other sectors that are of similar (or even greater) economic weight in terms of contribution to the GDP (such as transportation or service sectors; [50,51]) leads to a potential over-investment in such sectors. Next, we assess an LLM’s trend chasing risk as the extent to which investments tend to follow more recent events. Such trend chasing can lead to buying decisions when prices are high and selling them when prices are low due to herding behavior [52]. Trend chasing is also important from a macroeconomic standpoint as trend chasing can amplify market bubbles and in turn, increase the overall volatility in a financial market [53]. Due to LLMs’ already documented recency bias, we expect such trend chasing in LLM-generated financial advice. As a fourth risk type, we will assess the active investment allocation risk as the extent to which investors are invested in actively (vs. passively) managed assets. Such investment strategies (and their associated asset classes) seek to outperform a financial market (or benchmark) by selecting and investing in specific equities [54,55]. Allocating a higher share into actively managed assets in an attempt to “beat the market” is generally associated with a greater volatility risk compared to a broad, passive market exposure [56]. We therefore expect an overinvestment in actively managed assets as the training data likely includes references to specific stocks, active trading strategies, or even stock picking recommendations that are prevalent in financial media, investment forums, and advisory content, where discussions about potential market-beating investments tend to receive more attention than passive investment approaches [57]. Finally, we will assess the total expense risk as the extent of the overall costs of owning an investment, including all fees related to general administrative costs, custodian fees, as well as management fees (in the case of actively managed assets). While related, the total expense risk is distinct from active investment allocation risk as the expense risk captures the impact of reducing net returns through investment fees, and not all active investment approaches incur excessive fees or expenses [58]. For example, an actively managed ETF (short for “Exchange-Traded Fund”) such as the Schwab US Dividend ETF has a lower TER (Total Expense Ratio: the TER reflects the total costs associated with managing a fund, including management fees and administrative expenses expressed as percentage of assets invested) compared to the passive Vanguard All World portfolio ETF (TERSCHD = .06% vs. TERVT = .07%). Table 2 summarizes all of our key risk measures of our conceptual model, their definitions, why they are important from an investment standpoint, and their formal calculation. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.t002 Our experimental paradigm employs a large-scale experimental setting using a 3 (risk tendency: low/ medium/ high) x 3 (age: 15/ 30/ 50) x 3 (LLM: ChatGPT/ Copilot/ Gemini) full factorial design. The first two experimental factors (risk tendency and age) provide our baseline experimental paradigm, representing private investors’ self-stated risk-taking tendency and their objective risk exposure. Older (vs. younger) investors should generally invest in less risky assets due to their limited ability to equalize negative returns over the investment horizon [59–62]. Given that LLMs are expected to personalize financial advice [19], this research investigates how they adjust financial recommendations based on such investor risk-taking tendencies and investor age. The third experimental factor (type of LLM) addresses potential sampling issues due to LLM-specific performance differences. Our experimental paradigm resulted in 27 experimental conditions, which we each prompted 10 times to account for single (and sometimes less common) LLM responses [63]. Thus, we performed 270 prompts in total. We accessed ChatGPT 3.5 via OpenAI’s API [64], Copilot via the EdgeGPT Python package [65], and Gemini via the Bard API Python package [66]. We automatically queried these predominant LLMs in the marketplace to provide us with financial advice. The specific baseline prompt template with our experimental variations across all studies was performed as follows: “I’m a <15-year-old/ 30-year-old/ 50-year-old> looking to invest $10,000. I’m <not willing to take too many risks/ willing to take some risks/ willing to take a lot of risks> with my investment, and I’m hoping for some advice on what products I should consider investing in and how much I should allocate to each. Can you provide me with some recommendations? Please provide me with a table with the type of the investment, the name, the ticker symbol, and the amount I should invest.”. LLMs responded to these prompts with financial advice that included a table of specific investment recommendations (see Fig 2 for an exemplary investment advice by ChatGPT for a 30-year-old investor with a high risk-taking tendency). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g002 To ensure open science research practices [67], all of our code is documented and available on GitHub along with all datasets (https://github.com/ibtPhilipp/biasedEchoes). The next section details how each LLM response was further processed, how each key measure of interest was computed from the LLM’s unstructured text response, and how we analyzed the resulting measures. As summarized in Fig 3 the financial advice received by each LLM (see preceding section) was parsed and further augmented with additional financial data. We query ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini for financial advice, parse the investment portfolio recommendations, and augment them with data from Yahoo Finance, Refinitiv Eikon, and FRED (“Federal Reserve Economic Data” repository) to assess the investment risks, financial performance, and language style of the received financial advice. We query ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini for financial advice, parse the investment portfolio recommendations, and augment them with data from Yahoo Finance, Refinitiv Eikon, and FRED (“Federal Reserve Economic Data” repository) to assess the investment risks, financial performance, and language style of the received financial advice. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g003 First, we extracted the specific investment recommendations from the received unstructured LLM financial advice by performing regular expression splits. We extracted the type of investment such as “Stocks”, the name of the investment option such as “Apple Inc.”, the ticker symbol such as “AAPL”, and the amount in USD such as $3,000 for each position of the investment portfolio recommendation contained in the received financial advice. In case of an invalid LLM financial advice (i.e., non-parseable format or a missing allocation amount) we replaced the LLM response with a new one (i.e., re-prompting the model for the failed response). Second, we then further augmented the parsed investment portfolio recommendations with additional labeled financial data from Yahoo Finance (via the yfinance Python package [68]) and the Refinitiv Eikon database [69]. All investment portfolio positions were augmented with their asset type and equities were augmented by their corresponding sector utilizing Yahoo Finance. For portfolio positions with valid tickers (i.e., equities, ETFs, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies) we fetched price data from Yahoo Finance over a consistent 18-month period (1 July 2023–1 January 2025) following our initial data collection. Next, the investment portfolio positions were resolved to equity granularity level using holding data and augmented by geolocation and sector data from Refinitiv Eikon. In Study 3, investment portfolio positions were further augmented by their ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) score (ranging from 0: poor ESG performance to 100: excellent ESG performance). ETF and mutual fund investment portfolio positions were augmented by their TER and management approach (i.e., active vs. passive). To establish a risk-free baseline, we queried the risk-free market rate (i.e., 10-year US treasury bill) from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis online database FRED [70]. All this additional labeled financial data was then used to assess the investment risks, financial performance, and language style of the received LLM financial advice. Lastly, we fetched geolocation, sector, TER, holding, and price data for our benchmark (see section Benchmark) using exactly the same approach. We assessed the financial performance of the LLM financial advice utilizing the retrieved prices data and risk-free rate. The uniform time window across all retrieved data samples ensures comparability of the financial performance. We computed the recommended investment portfolio’s cumulative return, volatility (portfolio return standard deviation), and annualized risk-adjusted relative returns (annualized Sharpe ratio). Portfolio positions lacking a ticker and price data (e.g., savings or defined contribution accounts) were coded as zero return and zero volatility (only 7% of all observations). We utilized a zero-shot classification model (Facebook’s BART-large trained on the MultiNLI dataset; [71]) to assess the presence of explicit explanations about how the portfolio was constructed, the degree of assertiveness, and the presence of disclaimer notes. We specified the model for a single classification task and defined the possible classes of “explanations” and “no explanations” for the presence of explicit explanations, “assertive” and “non-assertive” for assertiveness, and “disclaimer” and “no disclaimer” for the presence of disclaimer notes. We retrieved the probabilities for each characteristic. We contrast the received financial advice relative to one of the most commonly used financial benchmark indices [72]. Specifically, we contrast all recommendations received by each LLM relative to the Vanguard Total World Stock Index Fund (VT) ETF. This ETF represents a basket of securities that track the underlying index FTSE Global All Cap. Notably, the FTSE Global All Cap index serves as a strategic benchmark for the Norwegian Government Pension Fund Global, which holds 1.5% of the world’s listed companies [73]. In short, this benchmark represents a common, broad, and diversified investment portfolio and has been used in prior work as well [72]. As with the data augmentation strategy, this data was queried using Yahoo Finance and the Refinitiv Eikon database. Investment risks. In what follows, we first analyze the multivariate effects of LLM type (Study 1) and experimental condition (Studies 2a, 2b, & 3), risk-taking tendency, and age on investment risk using a MANOVA. To assess each type of investment risk in detail, we conducted individual one-way ANOVAs, followed by planned contrasts using Tukey’s HSD correction for multiple comparisons. In Study 1, we first conducted one-way ANOVAs with individual investment risk types as the dependent variable and LLM as the predictor. We then performed t-tests comparing each LLM to the benchmark investment risk value. This helped determine whether the type of LLM influences investment risks and whether it outperforms or underperforms the benchmark. Next, we conducted additional ANOVAs with investment risk as the response variable, examining risk-taking tendency and age as predictors. For Studies 2a, 2b, and 3, we first conducted t-tests comparing investment risks between conditions and the contrast relative to the benchmark index. This allowed us to assess whether the intervention influenced the individual investment risk exposure and how it compared to the benchmark. Due to the large number of contrasts and comparisons, we report only theoretically or practically important contrasts directly in the manuscript, while the full range of contrasts is reported in detail across consecutive tables for each study in S1 Appendix. To enhance readability in the remainder of the paper, all specific effect sizes and test contrasts are reported in these tables as well. For a comprehensive overview of portfolio position exclusion criteria and robustness checks, see S4 Appendix. Financial Performance Analysis. To assess the impact of different LLMs on portfolio performance, we conducted a series of mixed linear model regressions with the portfolio cumulative return and Sharpe ratio respectively as the dependent variable. This approach was chosen to account for both fixed effects (i.e., LLMs, temporal trends, and individual characteristics) and random effects (group-level variations across portfolios). The fixed effects included the LLM (ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini) to assess whether specific models influence the return or Sharpe ratio. Additionally, we controlled for temporal trends by including monthly timestamps. This enabled us to assess how the portfolio returns and Sharpe ratios evolved over time. We also incorporated individual differences in risk-taking tendency (low, medium, and high) and age (15-, 30-, and 50-year-olds) to explore potential interactions between the LLM and risk-related variables. By introducing these predictors, we aimed to determine whether returns or Sharpe ratios varied systematically on risk-related variables and whether different LLMs performed better for specific investor types. This approach allowed us to isolate the effect of LLMs while accounting for risk-related variables and temporal trends. Language style analysis. First, we calculated a series of one-way ANOVAs and follow-up contrasts with Tukey HSD correction for multiple comparisons for each characteristic (presence of explanations, assertiveness, and presence of disclaimer notes) as the dependent and the LLM as the independent variable. This allowed us to assess whether LLMs deviate in their language style when communicating the financial advice. Next, we conducted one-way ANOVAs and Tukey HSD corrected contrasts with each characteristic as the dependent and risk-taking tendency and age respectively as independent variables. These additional ANOVAs were conducted to test whether LLMs change their language style depending on an individual’s risk-taking tendency (e.g., very assertive language for high risk-taking individuals) and age. In Study 1 we assessed the type of financial advice that private investors receive as a function of their appetite for risk (self-stated risk-taking tendency and investor age) from the most widely used LLMs (Open AI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, Microsoft’s Copilot). Study 1 employed our baseline experimental paradigm (see Methods section). A MANOVA with the investment risk types (geographical cluster, sector cluster, trend chasing, active investment allocation, and total expense risk) as the response and the LLM (ChatGPT/ Gemini/ Copilot), risk-taking tendency (low/ medium/ high), and age (15/ 30/ 50) as predictors showed significant effects of LLM type (ΛWilks = .7, F(10, 464) = 9.20, p < .001), risk-taking tendency (ΛWilks = .19, F(10, 464) = 60.41, p < .001), and age (ΛWilks = .87, F(5, 232) = 6.81, p < .001). In what follows, we provide a deep dive into the results explaining the differences of individual investment risks depending on each LLM (Fig 4). (A) We find above benchmark geographical cluster risk (N = 269), (B) sector cluster risk (N = 269), (C) trend chasing risk (N = 270), and (D) active investment risk (N = 270). The violin plots and boxplots represent the shape of the distribution of the respective investment risk by LLM. The black dot represents the mean and the colored dots the value of individual portfolio samples. The dashed line represents the value of the benchmark. (A) We find above benchmark geographical cluster risk (N = 269), (B) sector cluster risk (N = 269), (C) trend chasing risk (N = 270), and (D) active investment risk (N = 270).

The dashed line represents the value of the benchmark. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g004 Geographical & sector cluster risk. Our results show that all three LLMs revealed excessive cluster risk compared to our benchmark index. That is reflected in both an over-investment in US equities (with LLMs investing over 93% in US equities vs. 59% in the benchmark) and a higher concentration of funds in individual sectors (Fig 5). An additional concentration analysis showed that LLMs invested on average over 5% and 8% more in the already predominant technology (t(268) = 4.73, p < .001) and consumer cyclical sectors (t(268) = 8.23, p < .001) compared to the benchmark, thereby systematically increasing the sector cluster risk of the portfolio (see S2 Appendix for sector concentration details). This figure illustrates the portfolio weight by LLM type and country relative to the benchmark for the top five sectors (N = 269). This figure illustrates the portfolio weight by LLM type and country relative to the benchmark for the top five sectors (N = 269). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g005 Trend chasing risk. As shown in Fig 4:C, we find that all LLMs heavily engage in trend chasing with up to 27.92% invested in the top three equities that were traded most frequently in the past three months prior to prompting the LLMs. Consistent with our predictions, we find that all three LLMs display systematically higher trend chasing compared to the benchmark index (9%). Active investment allocation risk. We also observe systematically higher shares of actively managed investment options and stock picking. Specifically, we find that over 51% of investments were allocated into actively managed funds or single equities while the benchmark is a fully passive index-replicating ETF. Total expense risk. Finally, we observe significantly higher total expense ratios across all LLM portfolio recommendations compared to the benchmark index. Next, we conducted one-way ANOVAs with individual investment risks as the response variable and LLM type, risk-taking tendency as well as LLM type and age as predictors. Follow-up contrasts with Tukey’s HSD correction revealed a consistently higher active investment allocation risk for individuals with high (vs. low and medium) risk-taking tendencies. ChatGPT and Gemini even increased this risk for those with medium (vs. low) risk-taking tendencies. Similarly, LLMs provided financial advice with higher total expense risk for individuals with high (vs. low and medium) risk-taking tendencies. Further, ChatGPT and Copilot adjusted their recommendations for individuals with low (vs. medium and high) risk-taking tendencies, showing a significantly lower trend chasing risk – as low as 0.67% compared to 38.18% for those with high risk-taking tendencies. Other cases showed variations in investment risks based on risk-taking tendency and age-related risk, but these contrasts did not follow a consistent trend across LLMs. However, we find that ChatGPT and Gemini show less concentration in the technology and consumer cyclical sector for low risk-taking investors and a higher share in government activities. Copilot even concentrates over 46% of funds in government activities (i.e. bond ETFs) for low (vs. medium and high) risk-taking tendency resulting again in a higher sector concentration risk. Taken together, Study 1 provides initial evidence that LLM investment advice induces a significantly enhanced investment portfolio risk across all five types of portfolio risks (geographical cluster risk, sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, active investment allocation risk, and total expense risk). Further, we find that LLMs systematically adapt the provided investment advice depending on the risk-taking tendency. Financial performance analysis. A mixed-linear model, controlling for temporal effects and using the benchmark as the baseline, revealed that Copilot exhibited significantly lower Sharpe ratios (β = −1.14, p < .01), indicating worse risk-adjusted performance compared to the benchmark (see Fig 6). In contrast, ChatGPT (β = −.28, p = .52) and Gemini (β = −.12, p = .79) did not show statistically significant differences from the benchmark. Temporal effects were not significant, suggesting that the relative risk-adjusted performance of these portfolios remained stable over time but also not significantly more positive relative to the benchmark despite the additional amount of risk exposure of each LLM. The relatively strong risk-adjusted performance of ChatGPT and Gemini is likely driven by an overconcentration in the technology sector and the specific market conditions during the performance analysis period. Given the rapid growth of the technology sector—primarily fueled by advancements in LLM technology itself—portfolios disproportionately exposed to this sector benefited from favorable market trends. The figure shows the Sharpe ratio of ChatGPT (N = 1620), Copilot (N = 1620), and Gemini (N = 1620) relative to the benchmark (N = 18) over a 1.5-year period following the initial data collection. The figure shows the Sharpe ratio of ChatGPT (N = 1620), Copilot (N = 1620), and Gemini (N = 1620) relative to the benchmark (N = 18) over a 1.5-year period following the initial data collection. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g006 However, it is crucial to highlight that risk-adjusted returns, such as the Sharpe ratio, only adjust for the level of risk reflected in return volatility. This measure does not fully capture the broader spectrum of investment risks depending on other market conditions. For example, geopolitical events may evoke additional geographical risks inherent in LLM-generated investment advice leading to increased return fluctuations. Thus, relying solely on return volatility adjusted risk measures can lead to an incomplete assessment of true investment risks inherent in financial advice. Moreover, we also observed that both the choice of LLM and its sensitivity to people’s risk tendencies significantly influenced risk-adjusted performance. Specifically, mixed-linear models controlling for temporal effects and including self-stated risk-taking and age as predictors indicated that Copilot’s risk-adjusted performance was significantly worse for investors with a low self-stated risk-taking tendency (β = −3.13, p < .001), as well as for 30-year-olds (β = −1.57, p < .001) and 50-year-olds (β = −1.12, p = .01) compared to the benchmark. In summary, these findings suggest that while some LLMs may appear to perform adequately (or at least not worse compared to our benchmark) during specific market conditions, this performance is likely driven by the most recent market conditions that benefitted technology and AI investments rather than evidence of a superior investment strategy. The overconcentration in technology sectors that temporarily benefited ChatGPT and Gemini portfolios represents precisely the type of cluster risk that would expose investors to substantial losses during sector-specific downturns. Moreover, the significant underperformance of Copilot, particularly for risk-averse and middle-aged investors, reveals a concerning pattern: LLMs may be least reliable for the very demographic groups most likely to seek and follow automated financial advice. Collectively, these results indicate that LLM-generated financial advice creates a potentially disadvantageous combination of hidden risks and misleading performance indicators that could lead investors to overestimate the quality of LLM-generated recommendations while underestimating their exposure to undiversified risk factors not captured by conventional performance metrics. Language style analysis. Finally, we examined the specific language style employed across all models (see S3 Appendix for details). We utilized a zero-shot transformer model (Facebook’s BART-large trained on the MultiNLI dataset; [71]) to detect whether the investment advice offered a clear explanation or rationale (i.e., why a specific investment option should be chosen), the extent of assertiveness (i.e., how firmly the AI recommends to invest into a specific asset class), and to which extent the advice offers a disclaimer at the end of the recommendation (i.e., stating the potential risks involved with the investment). These analyses demonstrate that all recommendations offered a seemingly plausible explanation (e.g., “Procter & Gamble is a stable company with a long history of paying dividends. Dividend stocks provide regular income and can grow over time.”), with medium to high assertiveness (e.g., “Considering your requirements, here’s a diversified investment portfolio with a breakdown of how much you should allocate to each type of investment:”), and offering a seemingly trustworthy and “caring” disclaimer in the recommendation (e.g., “Remember, these are just recommendations, and it’s crucial to do your own research or consult a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.”). Notably, and as reported in the detailed analysis in S3 Appendix, our results revealed that approximately 95% of all investment recommendations across the three LLMs contained such financial investing disclaimers, suggesting they might function as a deliberate precautionary measure implemented by LLM providers to mitigate potential liability concerns while still delivering a highly assertive financial advice that users are likely to follow despite these warnings. Robustness checks. To test whether our findings hold for most recent versions of LLMs, we automatically queried ChatGPT 4o (gpt-4o-2024-08-06) and Claude Sonnet 3.5 (claude-3–5-sonnet-20241022). We employed our baseline template prompt (see Experimental paradigm) but added instructions that the model should check that the investment recommendations add up to $10,000 and respond in JSON format for improved advice parsing (this option did not exist when we collected the initial dataset). We employed a 2 (LLM: GPT 4o/ Sonnet 3.5) x 3 (risk-taking tendency: low, medium, high) x 3 (age: 15, 30, 50) full factorial design. Following our approach in Study 1, we repeated every prompt five times to prevent a single response selection biases. We retrieved valid responses for all prompts (N = 90). Next, we augmented the financial advice received with additional labeled data and calculated the investment risks analogous to Study 1. Our results show that also the most recent LLMs at the time of this study, exhibit the same above-benchmark investment risks, with the magnitude of each risk somewhat depending on the type of LLM (Fig 7). What is consistent is that all more recent LLMs show an even more pronounced sector cluster risk (due to investing more into the predominant sectors of technology and consumer cyclicals) and a higher total expense risk. We find (A) above benchmark geographical cluster risk (N = 359), (B) sector cluster risk (N = 357), (C) trend chasing risk (N = 360), and (D) active investment risk (N = 270) also for current versions of LLMs. The violin plots and boxplots represent the shape of the distribution of the respective investment risk by LLM. The black dot represents the mean and the colored dots the value of individual portfolios. The dashed line represents the value of the benchmark.

The black dot represents the mean and the colored dots the value of individual portfolios. The dashed line represents the value of the benchmark. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g007 In Study 2a we assessed whether we can alter a single risk dimension (such as avoiding management fees) without changing the other types of risks. We used a two-cell experimental design (control prompt vs. debiasing intervention prompt) with a control prompt identical to Study 1 and a debiasing intervention prompt that explicitly requested no management fees (“I don’t want to pay any management fees.”). This simple, prompt-based intervention is the only realistic alternative for private investors (most private investors will not have the luxury to fine-tune a model and test more sophisticated debiasing techniques). The baseline paradigm in both the control condition and risk debiasing condition was identical and used the same experimental setup as in Study 1 (full factorial design with 3 (risk tendency: high/ medium/ low) x 3 (age: 15/ 30/ 50); given the similar responses provided by LLMs in Study 1, we focused on ChatGPT as the most successful commercially available LLM for the remainder of the paper). A MANOVA with the investment risks (geographical cluster risk, sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, active investment allocation risk, and total expense risk) as the response and the prompting intervention (control vs. debiasing prompt), risk-taking tendency and age as predictors showed significant effects for the prompting intervention (ΛWilks = .82, F(5, 154) = 6.6, p < .001), risk-taking tendency (ΛWilks = .18, F(10, 308) = 41.68, p < .001), and investor age (ΛWilks = .88, F(5, 154) = 4.31, p < .01). Despite the significant main effect of the debiasing intervention, we find that narrow debiasing only directionally reduces the TER compared to the control condition and fails to decrease it to the level of the benchmark. However, we find that the debiasing intervention moderately reduces the share of actively managed investments. Yet, we still find that over 48% of investments are allocated to actively managed funds or single equities. The narrow debiasing intervention also reduced the over-investment in US stocks and sector concentration in LLM financial advice. However, the geographical as well as sector cluster risk still remained significantly larger compared to the benchmark. The narrow debiasing intervention prompt did not reduce trend chasing, resulting in still significantly stronger trend chasing compared to the benchmark. One-way ANOVAs and planned follow-up contrasts with Tukey HSD correction with experimental condition and risk-taking tendency as well as experimental condition and age as predictor showed that the risk-taking tendency had only limited influence on investment risk changes between conditions. Specifically, our results show that the narrow debiasing intervention only significantly reduced the geographical cluster risk and active investment allocation risk for low self-stated risk-taking tendency where these risks were already the smallest compared to medium and high risk-taking tendency. These findings suggest that while simple prompt-based interventions (like requesting no management fees) can partially mitigate some investment risks, they fail to comprehensively address the full spectrum of risks present in LLM-generated financial advice. The persistence of significant geographical concentration, sector biases, and trend chasing behavior (despite a moderate reduction of actively managed funds) indicates that the systematic investment biases in LLMs are deeply embedded and relatively resistant to simple corrective measures that typical private investors might realistically employ. Financial Performance Analysis. A mixed-linear model, controlling for temporal effects and using the benchmark as a baseline revealed that the risk-adjusted performance of LLM investment advice in the control (β = −.21, p = .19) and debiasing intervention condition (β = −.29, p = .08) were not significantly different relative to the benchmark. Our results show that the risk-adjusted returns improved over time and were significantly lower in the first three months (β08/2023 = −2.3, p = .02; β09/2023 = −3.43, p < .01; β10/2023 = −3.29, p < .01). Furthermore, we find that especially for investors with a high (βcontrol = −.41, p < .01; βdebiased = −.43, p < .01) and low (vs. medium) risk-taking tendency (βcontrol = −.46, p < .01; βdebiased = −.40, p < .01) the risk-adjusted returns were in fact lower in both prompt conditions compared to the benchmark. Again, we also find that the risk-adjusted returns were especially lower in the short-term (β08/2023 = −2.3, p = .01; β09/2023 = −3.43, p < .001; β10/2023 = −3.29, p < .001). Finally, and similarly to Study 1, we find that 50-year-olds received investment advice with lower risk-adjusted returns (βcontrol = −.34, p = .04; βdebiased = −.34, p = .04) compared to the benchmark and that the risk-adjusted returns were especially reduced short-term (β08/2023 = −2.3, p = .02; β09/2023 = −3.43, p < .001; β10/2023 = −3.29, p < .01). In summary, this study provides evidence that a narrow debiasing approach—targeting a single investment risk dimension—fails to reduce exposure to that specific risk in LLM-generated financial advice. Our findings suggest that private investors may only partially mitigate their investment risk exposure through simple prompt-based debiasing interventions. This is important as more advanced debiasing techniques, such as fine-tuning models, are not accessible to most private investors. In Study 2b we assessed to which extent a broader debiasing prompt may reduce the overall financial portfolio risk. Specifying multiple risks in the debiasing prompt, this prompting strategy may reinforce the risk reduction of every single risk alone as such broad debiasing interventions can often lead to effective debiasing of LLMs [74]. We tested this possibility by employing the same experimental design as in Study 2a, with an overarching debiasing prompt intervention (“Avoid common investment mistakes such as lack of diversification, cluster risks, and active management”). A MANOVA with the investment risks as the dependent and the prompting condition (control vs. debiasing intervention), risk-taking tendency, and age as the predictors showed a significant effect for the prompting condition (ΛWilks = .62, F(5, 165) = 20.58, p < .001), risk-taking tendency (ΛWilks = .31, F(10, 330) = 25.84, p < .001), while the effect of age was non-significant (ΛWilks = .93, F(5, 165) = 2.14, p = .06). Follow-up contrasts revealed that this broader debiasing intervention (vs. the narrow debiasing intervention in Study 2a) was largely successful at reducing a range of investment risks (Fig 8). Specifically, we find that the debiasing prompt reduced the over-investment in US assets and sector concentration (while still remaining significantly greater compared to the benchmark however). The amount of assets allocated to US assets was reduced by over 10% but remained at a still high 80% level. Additional contrasts further show that the sector concentration decreased due to a significant 8% and 9% investment allocation decrease in the predominant technology and consumer cyclical sectors. These findings highlight that a more equal distribution across sectors is easier to achieve compared to an equal distribution across financial markets (i.e., arguably due to the strong presence of US-based equities). We find that the debiasing intervention also significantly reduced trend chasing to the extent that it no longer differs significantly from the benchmark. Simultaneously, we find that the debiasing intervention reduces the share of actively managed investment options by over 32%. Finally, the debiasing intervention also significantly decreased the TER by more than.06%. Nevertheless, TER remained notably higher compared to our benchmark. We find (A) above benchmark geographical cluster risk (N = 180), (B) sector cluster risk (N = 180), (D) active investment risk (N = 180), and (C) non-different trend chasing risk (N = 180) when using a broad debiasing intervention. The violin plots and boxplots represent the shape of the distribution of the respective characteristic by condition. The black dot represents the mean and the colored dots the value of individual portfolios. The dashed line represents the value of the benchmark.

We find that the debiasing intervention significantly decreased the sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, and active investment allocation risk especially for investors with medium and high risk-taking tendency. Additionally, the debiasing intervention also decreased the total expense risk for high risk-taking tendency and the sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, and active investment allocation risk across all age levels. The collective insight is that broader debiasing interventions explicitly targeting multiple investment risks simultaneously can significantly reduce portfolio risks across most dimensions and age groups, although the geographic concentration remains somewhat elevated above benchmark levels. The differential effectiveness across investor profiles—with greater risk reduction for medium and high risk-taking investors—suggests that LLMs may be more susceptible to debiasing interventions when generating advice for more risk-tolerant investors, while continuing to embed the same biases reported earlier in recommendations for more conservative investors even after explicit correction attempts. Financial Performance Analysis. Analogous to Study 2a, we performed multiple mixed-linear regression models. Again, we find no significant difference of the LLM investment recommendations provided in the control (β = −.25, p = .11) and the debiased condition (β = −.29, p = .06) relative to the benchmark in terms of risk-adjusted returns. We only find a moderate temporal trend indicating lower risk-adjusted performance especially with reduced short-term returns (β08/2023 = −2.26, p = .02; β09/2023 = −3.46, p < .001; β10/2023 = −3.43, p < .001). We find that the risk-adjusted returns are worse for high (β = −.40, p < .01) and low risk-taking tendency (β = −.48 p < .001) in the control condition and for low risk-taking in the debiased condition (β = −.37 p = .01). Further, we find again that the risk-adjusted returns are lower than the benchmark for 50-year-olds in the control condition (βcontrol = −.34, p = .03) and for 30-year-olds in the debiased condition (βdebiased = −.37, p = .02). Also, in this model we find that the risk-adjusted returns were especially reduced short-term at the beginning of the performance measurement period (β08/2023 = −2.26, p = .01; β09/2023 = −3.46, p < .001; β10/2023 = −3.43, p < .001). Thus, despite the successful risk reduction through broader debiasing interventions, both control and debiased LLM-generated portfolios still failed to outperform the benchmark on risk-adjusted returns. These results suggest that even when successful at mitigating specific portfolio risks, debiasing interventions do not translate into improved risk-adjusted performance, indicating that LLM-generated financial advice continues to carry inefficiencies that cannot be fully addressed through prompt engineering alone. In Study 3 we tested whether incorporating an explicit investment goal in the prompt further aids in mitigating specific investment risks in LLMs investment advice. The study directly tests the ability of LLMs to adapt their investment advice based on contextual information and to personalize the investment advice to specific investor needs. Instead of directly asking the LLM to reduce the investment risks of a portfolio, a private investor may prompt a specific investment goal that would in turn translate into a decrease of specific investment risks merely based on the contextual information provided. The current study tests this possibility to infer and “sense” such context information. We employed the same experimental design as in Study 2a but incorporated an explicit investment goal in the prompt (“I want to invest in a way that promotes responsible and socially impactful contributions to our global society.”). We anticipated that this goal would lead LLMs to offer financial advice with reduced geographical and sector concentration risks. The phrase “contributions to our global society” was expected to decrease investments in U.S. assets, while “promotes responsible and socially impactful contributions” aimed to lessen the focus on technology and consumer cyclical sectors and thereby potentially reducing the previously documented trend chasing risk. We also expected that incorporating such a goal would result in investment recommendations with higher ESG scores [75]. A MANOVA with the investment risks as response and the prompt condition (control vs. goal prompt), risk-taking tendency and age as predictors showed a significant effect of the prompt condition (ΛWilks = .30, F(5, 161) = 74.31, p < .001), risk-taking tendency (ΛWilks = .51, F(10, 322) = 12.67, p < .001), while showing only a marginal effect of age (ΛWilks = .94, F(5, 161) = 2.20, p = .06). Follow-up contrasts revealed that investment risks showed a significant decrease in over-investments in US Stocks in the investment goal prompt compared to control, yet higher than our benchmark. However, we find that the introduction of a socially responsible investment goal did not lead to a significant decrease in sector concentration compared to the control prompt and remains still significantly higher than the benchmark index. As shown in Fig 9:A, not only remains this sector concentration very high, but is also substantially overleveraged towards utilities, due to shifting investments towards the energy sector (i.e., “green” energy). Next, we further examined the ESG score in the intervention (vs. control) condition. As summarized in Fig 9: B, specific investment goals were not effective in increasing the portfolio ESG rating of the portfolio. Specifically, we find that there is no significant portfolio ESG rating difference when incorporating a social responsibility goal prompt compared to the control prompt or benchmark. However, it is worth noting that incorporating the social responsibility goal effectively reduced the risk of receiving a low ESG rating compared to control (Levene’s test: F(1, 693) = 23.83, p < .001). We also observe a significant decrease in trend chasing behavior in the LLM investment advice when incorporating a social responsibility investment goal. Adding the social responsibility investment goal however, increased the actively managed portfolio share by over 29% compared to the control condition. Thus, LLMs engage in significantly more “stock picking” when provided with a specific investment goal. Finally, we observe significantly higher total expense ratios when incorporating a social responsibility goal compared to our control condition and benchmark.

In contrast, trend chasing risk decreased for those with medium and high risk-taking tendencies under the same condition. Further, the ESG score only increased for high risk-taking tendency when including the socially responsible investment goal where the ESG score was significantly lower (vs. medium and high self-stated risk-taking tendency) in the control condition. The geographical cluster risk decreased only for 50-year-olds. All other contrasts did not yield any meaningful patterns. The collective insight is that while LLMs can effectively adapt their investment advice to specific goals like a stronger social responsibility focus—evidenced by reduced US-centric investments and less trend chasing behavior—these adaptations come with significant trade-offs, including increased active management, higher expense ratios, and sector concentration shifted toward utilities rather than truly diversified portfolios. The inconsistent effectiveness across investor profiles further suggests that LLMs struggle to simultaneously optimize for both specific investment goals and fundamental portfolio construction principles, creating potentially new risk patterns when attempting to accommodate more personalized investing objectives. Financial Performance Analysis. As in the preceding studies, we conducted a series of mixed-linear models to analyze portfolio performance. We find that investments recommended by LLMs in the control condition are not significantly different from the benchmark in terms of risk-adjusted returns (β = −.25, p = .15). In the debiased condition, the LLM investment advice even underperformed the benchmark significantly (β = −.76, p < .001). The temporal trend indicating worse risk-adjusted performance in the beginning holds also for this model (β08/2023 = −2.62, p = .01; β09/2023 = −3.76, p < .001; β10/2023 = −3.78, p < .001; β10/2023 = −2.20, p = .04). We find that this underperformance in the debiased condition stems from the underperformance across both high (β = −1, p < .001) and medium risk-taking tendency investors (β = −1.02, p < .001) and we also find a clear underperformance for low risk-taking tendency in the control condition (β = −.48, p < .01). While we find no significant risk-adjusted underperformance for any age in the control condition, we document a strong underperformance across all age groups in the debiased condition (β15 = −.70, p < .001; β30 = −.75, p < .001; β50 = −.85, p < .001). Thus, we find overall that the introduction of socially responsible investment goals in LLM-generated advice led to significant underperformance compared to the benchmark, highlighting that when LLMs attempt to optimize for specific social impact objectives, they tend to sacrifice financial performance even more severely and lead to new, unwanted concentration issues (i.e., higher concentration in the utilities sector to promote investments in “green” energy). LLMs often reveal biases implicitly present in the underlying training data [33–35,38,76]. Our findings suggest that these biases can result in LLM-generated financial advice that leads to elevated investment risks for private investors across five major risk dimensions (geographical cluster risk, sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, active investment allocation risk, and total expense risk) and that a range of debiasing interventions only partially mitigated these risks. We find that LLMs recommend a narrow range of geographical regions to invest, concentrate on a few narrow sectors, engage in more aggressive trend-following and stock-picking, and ultimately propose high-fee investment options—all recommendations that are incompatible with modern portfolio theory [46,52,56–58,77–81]. These findings illustrate the need for new risk frameworks in algorithmic finance and to better understand underlying data biases that can lead to a reinforcement of traditional (human) investment biases. The findings of this research document the inherent risks for private investors who already started to employ LLMs to receive financial advice [15], and we hope that the current findings promote a more critical assessment of the advice they receive. However, it is noteworthy to highlight that a critical assessment becomes more difficult when LLM-generated investment advice is communicated very convincingly (see S3 Appendix for details). These findings are sensitive because they suggest a potentially misleading sense of confidence and benevolence by LLM-generated investment advice, paired with precautionary “disclaimers” added in over 95% of the cases across all LLMs we examined. This finding is important in light of prior work showing that LLM advice is often perceived as strikingly more positive even though the advice might carry inherent bias or when the advice is objectively worse compared to expert humans [27,82–86]. The ability to blindly follow harmful LLM-generated investment recommendations presents a significant risk for individual investors, particularly those lacking potentially financial literacy or access to professional financial advisors. Future research should investigate how personal financial goals could be better integrated into AI investment strategies while maintaining appropriate risk management. A fruitful direction for future work is also to further examine whether financial education (potentially even through the use of LLMs) can ultimately empower private investors to critically assess such LLM-generated investment recommendations. Future regulatory research may also focus on developing frameworks to protect consumers from the potential risks of such generative investment advice. This includes exploring effective monitoring mechanisms to prevent more large-scale, systemic risks across financial markets and establishing reporting requirements for firms that utilize generative investment advisory tools. As LLMs become more integrated into financial advisory services, regulators may need to establish clear guidelines for transparency, explainability, and accountability in such AI-driven financial advice, especially when used by private investors. For FinTech developers, our research highlights the importance of addressing inherent biases in LLM-generated financial advice and how to develop future systems that better align with modern portfolio theory principles and avoid reinforcing harmful investment biases documented in the current research. A main question for future work will be how generative investment advice algorithms can be trained to generate recommendations that are more consistent with investors’ long-term financial goals and risk tolerance without inducing the investment risks reported in this paper. As with any research, we also highlight at least two limitations of the current work. First, we evaluated LLMs at specific points in time, and these models continue to evolve very rapidly. While our robustness checks with the most recent models (as per January 2025) seem to be robust (see Robustness Checks at the end of Study 1), future generations of models might improve radically once foundation models might be explicitly debiased during the training stage. Second, our simulated investment portfolios were evaluated over a specific time-period that coincided with a strong technology sector performance. However, we believe that exactly due to these favorable market conditions for technology-heavy portfolios, our financial performance analysis reported in this paper represent a conservative estimate of the potential risks of LLM-based financial advice. In market environments where technology sectors underperform, the geographical and sector concentration risks we identified would likely lead to even worse investment outcomes, further amplifying the risk exposure of portfolios generated by LLMs. In conclusion, the current work demonstrates that LLM-generated investment advice systematically increases portfolio risks across multiple dimensions, potentially exposing private investors to unwanted investment risks while creating a false sense of confidence through convincing language and reassuring disclaimers. These findings underscore the need for more cross-disciplinary collaboration among investors (both private and institutional investors), regulators, FinTech innovators, financial institutions, and researchers to develop more robust frameworks for evaluating and improving AI-generated financial advice. We hope the current research promotes such collaborations to proactively transform the financial advisory landscape to truly serve the interests of private investors through properly diversified, low-cost, and personalized financial advice. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.s001 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.s002 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.s003 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.s004 (DOCX) We thank the reviewers for their thoughtful feedback and constructive suggestions that significantly improved this manuscript.

People experiencing homelessness (PEH) face complex health and social care needs, contributing to poor health outcomes and premature mortality. The Pharmacy Homeless Outreach Engagement Non-medical Independent prescribing Rx (PHOENIx) intervention was developed to address these challenges through assertive outreach by NHS pharmacist independent prescribers working with third sector homelessness charity workers for PEH presenting to community pharmacy. This qualitative study aims to explore participant, healthcare professional, and stakeholder perceptions of the PHOENIx intervention and acceptability of trial procedures. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with trial participants, internal stakeholders (healthcare professionals/researchers), and external stakeholders (national and local) across two intervention sites (Glasgow and Birmingham) between March 2023 and February 2024. Data was analysed thematically using Normalisation Process Theory (NPT) as a conceptual framework. Participants (n = 26; usual care n = 7; intervention n = 19) viewed PHOENIx as distinctively comprehensive, consistent, and caring, valuing its holistic approach and the trusting relationships developed with the team. Stakeholders (n = 16; internal n = 5; external n = 11) recognised PHOENIx’s potential to fill gaps in current service provision for PEH, appreciating its flexible, outreach-based model. Challenges identified included resource constraints, integration with existing services, and concerns about long-term sustainability. The PHOENIx intervention shows promise in providing accessible, comprehensive healthcare which was acceptable to PEH. Its success in engaging this underserved population offers valuable lessons for service development. However, addressing challenges around resources, scalability, and sustainability will be important considerations for a future trial and wider implementation and expansion.

Homelessness remains a significant and growing public health concern globally, with an estimated 895,000 people experiencing homelessness in Europe [1]. In Scotland, homeless applications increased from 35,759–39,006 in the year 2022–2023, representing a 9% increase [2]. Similarly, the rates of rough sleeping have also increased across other parts of the UK. In England there has been a 27% increase in rough sleeping in the year 2022–2023, as indicated by the most recent ‘snapshot’ [3]. People experiencing homelessness (PEH) face complex health and social care needs, contributing to premature mortality [4]. The average age of death for PEH is 45 years old, compared to 76 years in the general population [5]. Multiple factors contribute to this health inequality, including higher rates of physical and mental health conditions including substance use disorders, and barriers to accessing healthcare services [6,7]. PEH frequently experience multimorbidity, with a high prevalence of concurrent physical and mental health conditions [8]. Over 70% of PEH have underlying problem street-drug use [9]. Drug-related deaths among this population are particularly concerning, with a third of all deaths of PEH being street-drug-related [10]. Despite many receiving care from alcohol and drug recovery services, including daily prescribed opiate replacement therapy, there continues to be a high rate of overdoses experienced within the population [11]. Access to healthcare remains challenging for PEH due to stigma, discrimination, complex health systems that are difficult to navigate [12,13] and bureaucratic barriers [14,15]. As a result, unmet health needs are common [16,17]. Mental illness, pain, and substance dependency may be poorly managed [18], with evidence suggesting under-prescribing [11] and low rates of prescription adherence [19,20]. Patterns of emergency healthcare utilisation differ between PEH and those who are housed, with PEH facing higher rates of emergency room visits, hospitalisations, and readmissions [21,22]. Reasons for these visits also differ, with PEH more likely to present for drug, alcohol, and mental health-related problems, often in need of acute and crisis care [21,22,23,24]. While the availability and uptake of preventative healthcare is lower among PEH [14,21,25], presentations to primary care tend to be reactive [26]. It is estimated that one-third of homeless deaths are preventable through timely and effective use of health services [27]. However, there is a lack of robustly evaluated person-centred, integrated, community-based effective and cost- effective complex interventions for PEH [28]. In response to these challenges, innovative approaches are needed to address the intersecting issues of homelessness and problem drug use [29]. The PHOENIx (Pharmacist led Homeless Outreach Engagement Non-medical Independent prescribing Rx) intervention was first developed as a novel, low-threshold service offered to PEH in Glasgow, Scotland [30–33], which was reported to be well received by PEH [34]. This complex health and social care intervention aimed to address the multiple unmet needs of PEH through weekly assertive outreach by National Health Service (NHS) pharmacist independent prescribers working in collaboration with third sector homelessness charity workers. The PHOENIx intervention provided intensive and holistic health and social care support with persistent follow-up. Participants are visited via outreach and seen by PHOENIx workers (a pharmacist and third sector worker) at least once per week, with priorities set by the PEH and addressed gradually in succession. The intervention offered immediate health care and assessment, medication prescribing, and practical support such as advocacy, assistance with benefits applications, and provision of general wellbeing support [35]. Previous qualitative research based on the evaluation of the PHOENIx model of care in other settings has indicated that PHOENIx may improve health outcomes for PEH. Initial quantitative studies from previous evaluation of the PHOENIx model [11,36,37] have also highlighted the potential positive impact of the intervention on health-related quality of life [9], treatment burden, and delaying time to hospitalisation. However, there is a need for rigorous evaluation of whether the PHOENIx intervention can be delivered and how it is received, in other settings, e.g., community pharmacies and beyond Glasgow, in order to address the public health crisis of drug-related deaths and improve health outcomes for PEH. This study aims to explore participant, healthcare professional, researcher and stakeholder perceptions of the PHOENIx intervention and acceptability of trial procedures related to the PHOENIx Community Pharmacy model in Glasgow (Scotland) and Birmingham (England), UK. By examining the experiences and perspectives of those involved in the intervention, we seek to inform future developments and potential scale-up of this complex intervention to address the major health inequalities faced by PEH in the community pharmacy setting. The study used a qualitative design, involving semi-structured interviews with PHOENIx trial patient participants, healthcare professionals (HCPs) and researchers involved in the intervention and key stakeholders, including HCPs and third sector workers. Interviews were conducted across the two trial sites (Glasgow and Birmingham) between March 2023 and February 2024. Eligible participants were those who participated in the PHOENIx trial (both intervention and control arm participants) or played a role in the implementation of the intervention. Key stakeholders included those with an interest in the care/ service provision of PEH. Stakeholders were identified using a combination of professional networks, and snowball sampling. Ethical approval (REC reference 22/EM/0119; IRAS project ID: 309760) and Health Research Authority approval were obtained before recruitment and participants in the trial and qualitative process evaluation elements provided written informed consent before participation. All participants of the PHOENIx intervention, including those in the usual care group, were eligible to participate in interviews. Those eligible were approached by intervention workers to ascertain interest in participation. Those who expressed interest in taking part in interviews were supported by intervention staff and researchers to arrange a convenient time and date to conduct the interview. Interviews with intervention participants were conducted face-to-face, within community hubs that provide services to PEH at both trial sites. Those who expressed interest in participating were provided with an invitation pack containing a participant information sheet and consent form. At the time of interview, participants were given the opportunity to ask questions before providing written informed consent. Where needed, addition support was provided to potential participants to complete consent procedures, including the reading of the participant information sheet. Interviews with trial participants were around 60- minutes in duration (including consent procedures) and were audio-recorded. All interviews were transcribed verbatim, providing the data for qualitative analysis. Trial participants were given a £20 shopping voucher as a thank you for their time. Those involved in the delivery of the PHOENIx intervention (intervention staff and researchers) and key external stakeholders were invited to participate in interviews on a voluntary basis. External stakeholders were identified using professional networks and ‘snowball’ sampling. Those who expressed an interest in taking part were contacted by email and provided with an invitation pack that included a participant information sheet and a copy of the consent form. Once agreement had been made, interviews were arranged at a convenient day and time for the interviewee. Interviews were conducted either face to face, or via online video platforms, whichever was most convenient for the participants. At the time of interview participants were given the opportunity to ask questions before providing written informed consent. Those interviewed remotely via a video platform were required to sign and email the consent form to the researcher. In addition, verbal consent was taken and recorded at the start of the interview. Interviews with staff delivering the PHOENIx intervention and researchers were between 30–60 minutes in duration and were audio recorded. A topic guide was used to structure the interviews. The topic guide, informed by Normalisation Process Theory (NPT), explored several aspects including overall perception of the PHOENIx intervention, engagement with the intervention team, perceived impacts of the intervention and the acceptability of the trial procedures. NPT is a sociological theory that describes four mechanisms that can be used to explain and evaluate the adoption and implementation of complex interventions or service innovations [36]. The topic guides for interviews with the PHOENIx team and other key stakeholders also included discussion topics such as the main challenges to achieving optimal health care and support for PEH and the barriers and facilitators of the intervention, which were not included in intervention participant interviews. Data were analysed thematically with NPT used as an underpinning conceptual lens. The four constructs include: “coherence” (sense-making work); “cognitive participation” (relationship work); “collective action” (enacting work); and “reflexive monitoring” (appraisal work) [36]. These mechanisms were used to guide and structure conceptualisation of the analysis. Transcripts were analysed thematically after initial familiarisation. Thematic analysis is a method for identifying, analysing, and reporting recurring patterns within data [38]. A two-step method of analyses was used, with the data initially analysed with the aim of identifying recurring themes, and then subsequently analysed using the NPT framework. This qualitative method of analysis allows for the use of both inductive (bottom-up) and deductive (top-down) approaches. This ‘bottom up’ approach allowed for greater initial exploration of the data, free from the constraints of a theoretical model. This methodology was considered to be appropriate in order to truly recognise themes that the theory might not capture [38]. An initial coding framework was developed after becoming familiar with the data. All transcripts were double-coded by HS, SM, KW and YC to ensure the robustness of the data interpretation and coding, with any queries or discrepancies discussed and resolved by the coding team. Following the double coding of all transcripts a summary report was produced, and themes generated mapped to the mechanisms described in the NPT framework. Our findings are presented under four key themes and components of the NPT framework:1) coherence; 2) cognitive participation; 3) collective action; and 4) reflexive monitoring. These themes are described for both intervention participants and stakeholders, and illustrative quotations are provided in the following section. Participants consistently distinguished the PHOENIx intervention from their usual care experiences. They highlighted the comprehensive and personalised nature of the service, which contrasted sharply with their previous encounters with health and social care services. “Trying to find a way to move on from here, housing, medication, understanding your situation because everyone’s unique. Most support workers, especially on this building, a support session to them is like:””Is your housing benefit still active? Great.” You know what I mean? The Phoenix programme, they’re actually trying to help find out a way to move forward: ”Do you have bank accounts? Do you have ID? Do you have a housing option?” You speak to the support workers here and it’s just like:”Have you paid your service charge? Okay, fuck off, you know.” (IB05, Intervention participant) “Yeah, kind of. Not lost in the system, just overlooked. Overlooked is… There’s more important things to do. I think that’s the way it feels like sometimes.” (CB15, Usual care participant). Many participants expressed frustration with their previous care, particularly in relation to addiction and mental health services. They felt that PHOENIx offered a more holistic and responsive approach. “No because they’re just, it’s like they’re just there to hand in my script. They [addictions team] do ask me: “How you feeling?” but most of the time I’m just in and back out.” (IG011, Intervention participant) “So I made an appointment for that, and I didn’t go to that appointment, but they sent me another appointment out. […]And that’s another reason why I have to see a doctor, because I’ve been discharged from the mental health team, because I haven’t been good at keeping appointments with them either.” (IB6, Intervention participant) Participants valued the consistent and reliable nature of the PHOENIx intervention. The regular contact and follow-up were seen as crucial elements that distinguished this service from others they had experienced. This consistency helped to build trust and rapport between participants and the PHOENIx team, facilitating deeper engagement with the intervention. “It’s difficult to walk in and ask and saying what I need, because I’m used to doing everything myself but I wasn’t doing it because I was so down. Once I knew how they were and that and they weren’t judging, it was easy. They made it pleasurable. They made a good thing out of a bad situation.” (IB1, Intervention participant) “Well, building up a relationship, I’m getting to know them better and knowing that they are proper guys [PHOENIx team] that want to help you and not just, like, guys that are reading out of books and don’t know nothing and they’re trying but they’ve not got the heart in it, if you know what I mean?” (IG6, Intervention participant) It was recognised by some intervention participants that the consistency of the support worker role was a challenge to the delivery of the intervention. This highlighted the need for consistency in this role. “I want to continue with them, to be fair. I get a fair bit of help. It’s obviously just unfortunate that my support worker has gone ill for the last two weeks, but I’ve been emailed about that. Obviously he’s got some issues. I don’t know if there’s another support worker that steps in in the meanwhile.” (IB5, Intervention participant) Participants recognised and appreciated both the practical and emotional support provided by the PHOENIx team. They noted how the intervention addressed not only their immediate health needs but also broader social and emotional concerns. “Well, I spoke to the doctors I’m scared to go to the doctors, so whereas like, [support worker] absolutely amazing, comes and picks me up and took me to the doctors and stuff. I wouldn’t have gone on my own so this project is absolutely amazing, it’s getting me back on my feet and I wouldn’t have even gone to the doctors. It’s not because I can’t go but I’m scared to go, you know when you’re scared of the doctors you get a family member will drag…you know what it’s like. I haven’t got no one like that, so with this support project it gets me back on my feet, it just helps me…puts me in touch with my support services and just does what a family would do, because I haven’t got a family like that. “(IB7, Intervention participant) The combination of practical support and emotional care provided by the PHOENIx team was crucial in sustaining participants’ engagement with the intervention. Participants felt that the team’s holistic approach addressed their complex needs in a way that encouraged ongoing participation. Trust and non-judgemental relationships were important to participants, with some participants feeling motivated by the trusting relationship with the PHOENIx team. “It’s been amazing, to be honest, it’s been amazing. I’ve never had help like this and I’ve needed it for a long time and I’ve never had this help. Not only has he become my pharmacist, he’s become a friend. We really have become friends and it’s really good now. Someone to speak to you when I need to, you know what I mean? He’s sorted out a lot of things for me as well, health-wise. I’m always in fights, and so if I get injured, I can go and see him and he looks after me. Do you know what I mean?” (IB3, Intervention participant). Participants described a wide range of practical support provided by the PHOENIx team, including help with medication management, assistance with benefits applications, and support in accessing other services. “Oh, no, it was easy with [pharmacist]. Just when I was explaining to him, and I think my doctor keeps putting me on the Salbutamol, the Symbicort and Becotide and [pharmacist] put me on, I’m only on one steroid, kind of thing.[…] And it’s because they want me to sit and take them out of all the boxes and sit and take two puffs and then, shut one box and open another box. It’s just a matter of taking it out the one box, taking two puffs and that, yes, a great difference.” (IG3, Intervention participant) “I’m getting somewhere now, I’m getting help with my benefits, I’m getting help with my housing, my prescriptions. And it’s all thanks to going to the right sources, like the Phoenix team, for instance.” (IG6, Intervention participant) Alongside this practical support, participants emphasised the emotional work undertaken by the team. This included providing a listening ear, offering encouragement, and helping to build participants’ confidence and self-esteem. Participants noted how this combination of practical and emotional support enabled them to engage more effectively with their care and make positive changes in their lives. “I would say they’ve covered a lot with me, like my drink, my mental health, how I’m feeling this day, what am I eating, about my day. So they’ve covered a range of topics that no other people, even, like, my drugs worker has asked me, like what I’m eating and when I’m eating, am I eating regularly, like that.” (IG11, Intervention participant) Some participants expressed frustration that the PHOENIx team sometimes seemed limited in their ability to effect certain changes, particularly in areas like housing or specialist mental health support. Often, this lack of power is a result of the rules of other health and social care services, or long waiting times to access services. This perceived lack of power in certain areas led some participants to suggest that the team should be given more authority or resources to address complex needs. “Aye. Well, I trusted their knowledge, but their knowledge didn’t go any further than that. And I mean they’ve not got the powers to do anything. They can give me knowledge, but the knowledge that I then pass on to the ones that have got the power are just…” (IG2, Intervention participant) “I’m still waiting on an appointment to meet an alcohol worker. See, they’ve actually been in contact with me before, but unbeknown to me, I’ve either been on the drink or, I’m very forgetful as well, like, you know? So I’ve either not remembered receiving the letter, and [support worker] has been in contact with them to say, look, they guy’s still looking for a bit of support. But I’m still waiting to hear from them, like, you know, that’s the [alcohol service].” (IG7, Intervention participant) Participants consistently highlighted the importance of ongoing, long-term support. Many expressed concerns about what would happen when the intervention ended, indicating the value they placed on the continuous care provided by PHOENIx. “Yeah, 100 per cent. I’ll be sad if it stops, because who have I got to go to then? And I’ll just go back to square one again.” (IB3, Intervention participant) This emphasis on long-term support reflects the complex and chronic nature of many participants’ health and social issues, and their recognition of the need for sustained intervention. Usual care participants highlighted the reactive and inflexible nature of services which do not meet their needs. “Because there isn’t a lot of places, they always say:”Yes, have you been there?” but see when you go, they’re either shut or there’s nobody there or you need to come back another day. There’s never somewhere where you can just do a pick up. I’ve only been told: ”Right, yes, come up,” or you can just walk in and it’s there for you. It’s always…because you can’t have a breakdown at the correct time. Do you know what I’m talking about? If you need help, you can’t make sure it’s between nine and two or, do you know what I mean? It’s just, when you need help, you need help.” (CG13, Control participant) Intervention participants discussed the acceptability of the procedures of the intervention and trial. Overall, participants were supportive of the frequency and intensity of appointments with the PHOENIx team. “I didn’t think the Phoenix was going to help but I signed up to it, but I just thought it was just another one of the survey things. They’re going to promise you the world and do nothing. They did as much as they have said.” (IB5, Intervention participant) However, there were challenges around the consistency of support from the support worker at one site as a result of recruitment and retention issues. For example, support workers moving on to other roles had an impact on the perceived consistency of support received. Intervention participants indicated that the study questionnaire was too long in length and duration to complete, with some indicating that they did not believe the questions to be relevant and potentially stigmatising. A perceived lack of concentration and capability to answer some of the questions made the questionnaire challenging for some. Some indicated that the questionnaire was a perceived barrier to taking part in the study, while a significant number of participants did not remember having completed the study questionnaire. “I can’t really remember it to be honest but I ended up… It was a 20 minute thing and I ended up spending two hours.” (IB2, Intervention participant) “There were a few questions and I was like:”Forget that, let’s go onto the…” yeah, you don’t need to know that kind of thing, because why would you need to know certain things? It’s got nothing to do with why I’m really here them questions I see as judgement. Someone else is going to look at this sheet of paper and see certain questions that are nothing to do with me but I’m going to be judged on these certain questions because of the answers.” (IB3, Intervention participant) Stakeholders demonstrated a clear understanding of the various roles within the PHOENIx team and how these roles complemented each other to provide comprehensive care. “I think that’s good and I think it would get you so far. I mean, having a well-trained nurse practitioner, a pharmacist and a social worker, you would cover a lot of ground if those people were available to the person all the time. Obviously depending on how they all get on and everything. But those people working as like a mini- multidisciplinary team I think is a good idea.” (BS11, External Stakeholder) “Well, for me, it just seems like a really great way of doing things. Because from my perspective anyway, I [pharmacist] like to look at all the health stuff, and, yes, we…so, [support worker] is focused on the social things and the housing, but also, there’s a bit of a grey area as well, this aspect of, social stuff can really solve mental health issues, or at least improve the whole kind of thing. So, we both work on both sides of it, if you see what I mean. And there’s no real, I suppose…we just try and help people, whatever way is going to work.” (GS21, Internal Stakeholder) Stakeholders generally held positive views of the intervention, recognising its potential to address gaps in current service provision for PEH. Providing anticipatory care was one such gap that was discussed. “I think it’s a really interesting project and it…from my experience with other homeless projects, it does bridge a gap that I could see and that I’ve seen acutely, where people, you cannot get them to the…you might be supporting them with their housing, but you cannot get them to the GP, or to A&E, or to any healthcare professional, for love nor money. And having someone that can…an actual floating prescriber is a game changer, really, for these people’s health. And that…having that longer appointment time, and that sticky support, where they don’t get cut off just because they haven’t attended something, it’s so vital, because we’ve got…the odds are stacked up against homeless people, so much that they need all the help that we can offer. And we’ve got these pharmacists all across the country that could do this. So, I’d like to see the project grow, definitely, and I’d like to be part of it.” (BS9, Internal stakeholder) “I think that we know there is a gap...well, sorry, I believe there is a gap around wound care for people in the city centre particularly, probably the whole of the city, that are not engaged in community services for whatever reason. That is potentially something that PHOENIx could support with. We know that there is ongoing, as there always has been, the issues into...pathways into mental health support are always more difficult. We have got decent processes on paper, but when you speak to service users then they don’t reflect those processes. There is ongoing things like that that we are aware of and trying to do something about.” (GS23, External stakeholder) Stakeholders acknowledged the complex challenges involved in providing care to PEH and saw PHOENIx as a potential solution to some of these issues. Some challenges highlighted by stakeholders was increased complexity and demand on services, lack of opportunity to engage with PEH, competing priorities of PEH and complex navigation of services. “We have a really good system of care in the city. Alcohol and drug recovery services are really responsive. They hold a huge caseload, but the level of complexity and the level of demand is just always increasing. It is a really transient population in the city because it attracts people in from all over the country.” (GS23, External stakeholder). “So I think the main challenges are that people experiencing homelessness have lots of competing priorities, so they’re not always able to prioritise their health. There’s complications with their previous experience of using health services which are often very negative. They’re used to being turned away from places, told that this isn’t the right place for you, told you should be down the road, told you should have come before, you shouldn’t come now, you should come later, all of those things. They’re not really made to feel welcome in healthcare settings. I think that starts when people are young and they’re not confident, they’re often on their own, they often don’t have support. That’s the other thing, so they need support to navigate the health system. Usually we have that from friends, family, other people who will help us, but often people experiencing homelessness don’t have that. Having support is very important and that can make a big difference.” (BS11, External stakeholder) Stakeholders outside the immediate PHOENIx team generally viewed the intervention positively, recognising the team’s expertise and dedication. They appreciated the multidisciplinary nature of the team, the connection with the local community and viewed the team as highly skilled. “My knowledge of it is that it was a really great team and delivered a really good service and was incredibly responsive. I think what it has to do is it needs to link into those treatment and care services. It can’t just sit on its own, it can’t just be its own thing. It has to link into that wider system to add value to it and so that it can add value to the treatment and care. I think if that was to happen it would be really, really great.” (G23, External stakeholder) “Again, it is probably like that where we are looking at the health needs through addictions. They are getting a better service because these guys would just not go to their own GP. But we are looking after their health and obviously Phoenix guys really know their stuff about wounds, all that kind of stuff. They, I think, may become a gateway for a trust for us to then go to traditional health provider.” (GS19, External stakeholder) Internal stakeholders noted strong working relationships within the PHOENIx team, highlighting the importance of this collaboration for effective service delivery. “Well, it’s my job so aye, I love coming into my work, I love doing what I do and working with people who care, you know? So there’s not a day…but I mean, we have some tough days in here, don’t get me wrong, you know, we have some tough days. Aye. But there’s good days as well, and no matter how tough a day, we can always make it better the next day. And working with people that are all aligned and on the same page, want to do the same thing, it’s great. Aye.” (GS22, Internal stakeholder) Stakeholders observed positive relationships developing between the PHOENIx team and participants, recognising this as a key factor in the intervention’s success. It was recognised that relationship building with participants can take time, highlighting the need for longer term interventions. The building of a consistent and trusting relationship was important to internal stakeholders. “I think that could do wonders really, because a lot of it is building the rapport and the relationship with somebody, getting that trust, you know, and if they know where to go they can support them. And you know, that trust is there, it’s someone else that they could contact if they needed to.” (BS14, External stakeholder) “And that’s the sort of service they needed. So, a lot of my experience with the Phoenix project, I was very open with the participants. I spoke to them very, like, was streetwise, sort of, speaking. I spoke to them like they were people. I wasn’t, sort of, putting barriers up, I spoke to them like…you know, we had very open discussions. And I felt that made the rapport really well, they felt more like friends than participants and they engaged well. And that was my main aim.” (BS11, Internal stakeholder) Stakeholders identified numerous challenges in providing care to PEH, including data sharing between services, issues of engagement, continuity of care, and addressing complex, interconnected needs. “Obviously we talk about things like data protection, those kinds of things all become a barrier because the sharing of information, because we struggle there all the time. As you can imagine, we’ve got relationships with the police, got relationships with enforcement teams in the city, and we’ve got relationships with the community mental health team, with the healthcare services and just the data sharing barrier is a constant thing that comes forward, so that’s one barrier.” (BS10, External stakeholder) “I think obviously probably one of the biggest challenges is the fact that the access to care for people who are homeless is difficult. I think we’ve got to talk about it in the context of NHS care at the moment, access is difficult for everybody. Just insofar as demands are very high, there isn’t enough capacity for people. So if we’re thinking about GP practices, at the moment to get an appointment there’s a scramble at eight o’clock in the morning. You’ve got to be up, you’ve got to be on the phone, you’ve got to get through, there’s a limited number of appointments to do it. So that very much relies on the fact that you’ve got a phone, it’s working, you’re awake, blah, blah, blah.” (BS14, External stakeholder) “I mean the first bit of what I say relates to what I’ve just said. I mean the health system’s very rigid in lots of respects and it’s not designed to deal with people who are facing homelessness or related issues. Most of the health service just isn’t set up to cope with those people. As I said, how appointments are structured etcetera. So I think standard healthcare for most people who are homeless, isn’t going to work for them the way it’s set up at the moment. So I think actually we’ve got little opportunities.” (BS14, External stakeholder) While generally positive, stakeholders did identify some challenges in implementing PHOENIx, such as resource constraints and integration with existing services. “Some of the stuff that’s been a challenge has probably round about some of the services I spoke about wishing were here. Like, you know, maybe a lack of therapeutic mental health services, lack of easier access to rehab beds and stuff like that. So aye, that’s probably it. Aye, probably, that’s probably it.” (GS22, Internal stakeholder) Consistency of support provided at one intervention site was highlighted as a challenge. This perceived inconsistency was seen as a result of issues in the recruitment and retention of the support worker role. “Where we’re now, currently, as today, we’re getting participants who are not engaging that were engaging first. And that’s because there’s been a break in the support side. But generally, obviously, there’s only so much I can do. Like, I’ll call them, I’ll speak to them about health, but then when they ask for updates about their housing or their benefits, I can’t answer that. That’s because, you know, we’ve got that staggered, sort of, break down. We have got somebody in-house now who’s doing it, but sometimes it’s a bit too late.” (BS11, Internal stakeholder) The workload of the intervention team was also identified as a challenge, with high caseloads to manage, alongside administration for both intervention participants and the intervention itself. “Yes, workload is heavy, aye, workload is heavy. So, it’s 25 patients, well, we’re not seeing them all the time, but weekly contact with at least 20 is a lot, aye, it’s a lot. And sometimes, it’s half days, whole days, with one patient, trying to get things sorted for them, where they overdose, or whatever.” (GS21, Internal stakeholder) “No. The only aspect that I didn’t like about working in the team was just doing the paperwork and the data after the study. Just, you know, going back through and collating all the information, that was brutal, man. Six weeks or something in the office, day after day, just, you know, collating all the data and aye, aye, that’s not…I work here to work on the frontline, to be out, you know, working with people, and so being stuck in an office. But that’s the only thing I’ve not liked about working with the team.” (GS22, Internal stakeholder) Stakeholders viewed PHOENIx as aligning closely with what they considered optimal care for PEH, particularly in its holistic, person-centred approach. Both internal and external stakeholders considered effective partnership working to be important to providing optimal care to PEH. “I know I’m very health focused, but actually homelessness is a health issue, there are health implications, but actually it’s a social issue. Those services need to have strong links with housing teams and all these other things, to get it right. I think it’s about people who commission the service and people who work in the service, understanding the complex nature of it. Plucking somebody from the street and giving them a house isn’t going to necessarily work straightaway. Some people haven’t lived in a house for a long time. We also put people…we have a higher expectation of them than we do of ourselves. If I rent a property I’m not given this list of rules of what I can and can’t do. I’m not scrutinised. Yes, I’m sure my agreement would say you can’t use illegal drugs on the property, you can’t do this. But no-one’s going to come and check.” (BS14, External stakeholder) “For optimal care. They need a holistic approach. I think what we offer, in terms of the Phoenix team, is looking at all aspects of their care, and then trying to narrow it down to, what are your priorities at this moment in time, but also, putting those other issues that are identified on the backburner, so that eventually, you can come and try and deal with them when they’re in a better place. I suppose it’s about realising that you’re working with people who are using drugs for a reason, and you have to acknowledge that and work around it, and I suppose that’s a big challenge for us.” (GS21, Internal Stakeholder) Stakeholders saw PHOENIx as playing a unique and valuable role in the care landscape for PEH, bridging gaps between different services and providing continuity of care. Work or tasks carried out by the PHOENIx team include social/wellbeing support, management of health conditions (including addictions) and financial and benefit support. “The one or two that needed…like, were underweight, I prescribed them Fortisip. But other than that, we’ve not really had to do anything. It has, like I was saying to you, I did do a lot, but it was more, like, social prescribing, like signposting them to housing, or food banks, or, you know, benefits. And it wasn’t a case where…initially when I came in, I thought it was going to be a lot of patients who were going to be mentally unwell, who were going to be physically unwell.“ (BS11, Internal Stakeholder) The PHOENIx team also provided support with navigating and referring to other services that might be perceived to be previously too complex for those with significant and complex needs. “If any social aspect is needed you can get the referral process started, you can give them your number, you can give them regular updates or signpost them. So the patient actually feels like they’re being listened to, rather than being, sort of, pushed back and just a number in a list.” (BS11, Internal stakeholder) Stakeholders highlighted several positive aspects of PHOENIx, including its flexibility, holistic approach, and association with well-known or trusted organisations. “I think the visits, like the team going and visiting people, aye, well, I think the aspect that I like about it is it’s what’s needed. So, a lot of people that we provide support to find it difficult to engage with appointments and coming to, you know, certain places at certain times. So the team goes there. You know, the team will go there and if they don’t get somebody on one day they’ll try again, you know, they’ll keep trying, they’ll keep going back. They might not link in straight away but, you know, they’ll just keep…our motto’s keep chipping away. So just keep going back and then just gradually, slowly, slowly build up that relationship.” (GS22, Internal stakeholder) While generally positive, stakeholders did suggest some potential improvements for future iterations of PHOENIx. Streamlined data collection, larger teams with smaller caseloads, more locations and longer-term support were all suggested. Data collection was seen as burdensome to team members, particularly alongside managing a large caseload. “I also think that we really need to look at what data we’re collecting. Because it’s a feasibility trial, the data is…some of it, I feel, was irrelevant.” (BS9, Internal stakeholder) “So, I don’t really know what the optimal caseload…and it would probably vary depending on what was going on for, you know, different people within that caseload. But I’m guessing you’re probably looking at 16 maybe, an optimal caseload, as opposed to 25. So that’s probably the only thing that I would say would benefit changing.” (GS21, Internal stakeholder) Stakeholders agreed that community pharmacy was an appropriate setting for the intervention, however, some stakeholders suggested different geographical locations, including those outside of city centres to reduce geographical barriers. “I think that Phoenix research needs to be done in a few locations. I know we’ve got Glasgow and Birmingham but I’ve previously worked in Manchester and Liverpool and they are 30 miles apart [sic] from each other, they do things completely differently to each other. I think it might have changed slightly now. And they have the same level of chaos that goes on around partnerships and around relationships with stakeholders, and the same level of chaos from service users because they are just like Birmingham, the same kind of city where people just move to, you know, and start again. Homeless community right through to professionals, you know, they are cities that are constantly changing.” (BS10, External stakeholder) “So I think just different pockets of the country where you’ve got those big urban cities like Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow and Birmingham, versus some of those more rural Devon, Gloucestershire kind of scenarios, and Worcestershire as well, there’s a massive homeless problem in Worcestershire but it’s all quite hidden, and I think from the perspective of research, it might be beneficial to tap into some of those areas and just see the disparity and the differences between town to town, city to city.” (BS10, External stakeholder) Longer-term support was also suggested for a future trial of PHOENIx. “Maybe we just need longer, we need longer time. We need, probably, smaller caseload to really get at it, just a little bit smaller, but I think that vwould work out, and more time, more time. If we had longer time for the thing, I’m sure we could see different…maybe slightly different results […]” (GS21, Internal stakeholder) Stakeholders identified potential barriers to scaling up PHOENIx, including resource constraints, support and buy-in from policy makers, and intervention staffing. Funding was identified as the primary barrier to a future trial of the intervention. Alongside the removal or reduction in existing services, there is a perceived lack of buy-in from funders or other publicly funded services. Improving services that support PEH are perceived not to be a public priority. “I think it’s going to be funding. Funding’s going to be a big problem, whether you get the funding to see the whole project through. If it’s on a larger scale, like I said, it’ll be over a larger period of time and you will probably see participants getting housed.” (BS11, Internal stakeholder) “The Government aren’t really invested in tackling the issue, because at the heart of all, or nearly all health inequalities, is poverty. If you eliminate poverty most of health inequalities work wouldn’t need to be done.” (BS14, External stakeholder) The staffing of the intervention roles is also seen as a barrier to future implementation. In particular, the support worker role had a significant recruitment and retention challenge. “It’s money, it’s always money. So, prescribers are expensive, support workers are seen as cheap, but because they’re so cheap, the turnover in staff is incredibly high, which means that people don’t have stable support, essentially, they don’t see the same support worker for years and years. It might be that they…some people…I spoke to one person yesterday whose support worker left the week that they moved into the hostel, and they’re still not…two weeks later, they’ve still not been assigned anyone, so they have no idea what they’re doing. So, if money…if there was more money there to actually pay for these services, and also, more money to pay support workers a decent wage, so they’re more motivated to stay longer at the services, I think that would make the world of difference. The cost of having someone who can prescribe is…I mean, I….it would save money, I believe, in the long run, but it’s very difficult to prove.” (BS9, Internal stakeholder). This study shows that participants perceived the PHOENIx Community Pharmacy intervention, as distinctive, comprehensive, consistent, and caring. The intervention’s success appears to lie in its ability to combine practical support with emotional care, delivered through a reliable and trusting relationship between participants and the PHOENIx team. Participants had a clear understanding of how PHOENIx differs from usual care, particularly in its holistic approach and the continuity of care provided. Engagement was facilitated by the team’s consistent presence and their ability to address both a wide range of practical and emotional needs that enables participants to engage more effectively with their care. While there were some limitations in the team’s power to effect certain changes, it was clear that people valued the nature of the long-term support provided. Concerns expressed about the intervention ending underscores its perceived importance in participants’ lives and suggests a need for consideration of how such support can be sustained over time. These findings indicate that the PHOENIx Community Pharmacy intervention has successfully engaged this underserved population, providing a model of care that participants find accessible, comprehensive, and supportive. However, they also point to areas for potential improvement, particularly in terms of the scope of the team’s authority and the duration of support provided. Stakeholders’ perspectives on the PHOENIx Community Pharmacy intervention reveal a generally positive view of the intervention’s potential to improve care for PEH. They recognise its unique role in addressing gaps in current service provision and appreciate its holistic, flexible approach. However, they also identify challenges, particularly around resources and scalability, that should be addressed for future implementation and expansion of the intervention. The holistic approach of PHOENIx, addressing both health and social needs, and providing practical and emotional support was particularly valued by participants and recognised by stakeholders as aligning closely with optimal care for this population. This finding supports previous research emphasising the importance of integrated care models for PEH, who often face multiple, complex challenges that span health and social domains [39]. Participants described a wide range of practical assistance, from medication management to help with benefits applications, which addressed many of the barriers to healthcare access often faced by PEH [40]. Importantly, this practical support was coupled with emotional care, which participants found equally valuable. This holistic approach aligns with calls for trauma-informed practice for PEH, recognising the complex interplay between physical health, mental health, and social circumstances in this population [40,41]. However, the perceived lack of power in certain areas, as noted by some participants, suggests that there may be systemic barriers that limit the intervention’s ability to fully address all needs. This highlights the importance of considering broader structural factors and potential policy changes when developing interventions for PEH [42]. The relational aspects of the PHOENIx Community Pharmacy intervention emerged as a crucial factor in its success. Participants valued the consistent and reliable nature of their interactions with the PHOENIx team, which fostered trust and encouraged ongoing engagement. This finding is consistent with previous research highlighting the importance of trusting relationships in healthcare for PEH [43]. Stakeholders also recognised the strength of these relationships, both within the PHOENIx team and between the team and participants. The multidisciplinary nature of the team, combining pharmacist expertise with third sector support, was seen as a particular strength. This supports the growing body of evidence suggesting that multidisciplinary, collaborative approaches are most effective in addressing the complex needs of PEH [40]. The emphasis on building and maintaining relationships through consistent contact and follow-up addresses a key challenge in providing care to PEH, who often struggle with continuity of care due to their transient circumstances or exclusion from services [14]. The success of PHOENIx in this area suggests that its model of persistent and assertive outreach could be valuable for other services seeking to engage this population [44]. Both participants and stakeholders identified challenges in the implementation of PHOENIx, particularly around resources and integration with existing services. These challenges are common in the implementation of complex interventions and highlight the need for careful planning and adequate resourcing when scaling up such interventions [45]. Existing services may be required to change and become more flexible around appointments or move to addressing the persons wider needs during consultations rather than focussing on single problems or conditions. Stakeholders recognised the potential of PHOENIx to improve care delivery for PEH, particularly through its flexible, outreach-based model. The intervention’s success in engaging individuals who had a history of low care engagement was seen as a significant strength, addressing a key challenge in providing care to this population. However, the concern expressed by participants about the intervention ending highlights the ongoing, long-term nature of support needed by many PEH. This raises important questions about the sustainability of such intensive interventions and the need for long-term funding and support [38], ergo the need for definitive trials to demonstrate impact and cost effectiveness of new services in the current fiscal climate. Some components of the pilot intervention created challenges for delivery that should be taken into consideration for any future iterations. The study questionnaire administered to all participants was perceived to be irrelevant in portions, and onerous to complete for both patients and internal stakeholders. A redesign of the study questionnaire could help to reduce any unnecessary data collection and reduce the length and therefore duration of the questionnaire for both participants and researchers. Internal stakeholders also indicated that the lack of trial support, including trial data management, had a considerable impact on the workload involved in implementing the intervention. At both sites, the trial data management was primarily undertaken by the pharmacists. Any future trial should aim to provide additional administrative support to reduce the workload on the pharmacist and refocus the role on providing clinical support to participants. A significant challenge to the delivery of consistent support to participants was the high staff turnover in the support worker role. The issues around recruitment and retention, while only at one site, had a knock-on effect on other members of the research team. Future trials should aim to bolster this position, perhaps aiming to employ more than one support worker to ensure consistency for participants during periods of absence, improve overall retention and reduce the caseload of support workers. Recruitment and retention of trial participants should be considered to ensure representativeness of the population. PHOENIx participants represent 0.6% of Glasgow’s homeless population [46], and 0.3% of PEH in Birmingham [47]. A full RCT should aim to improve recruitment of study participants. This could be accomplished by garnering greater buy-in from other support services and third sector organisations, as well as ensuring that voucher incentivisation for participant follow-up is increased with inflation or the cost of living. The findings of this study have several implications for practice and policy in the area of healthcare for PEH. PHOENIx provided the opportunity to evaluate the intervention as an RCT, which is uncommon in homelessness health research. The trial represents a valuable step for homelessness health research methodology, and a unique contribution to the area of study. The intervention delivers integrated health and social care for PEH, supporting the delivery of NICE Guidelines (NG214). As identified by stakeholders, holistic, integrated care is key to optimal delivery of services to PEH. The success of PHOENIx’s comprehensive approach supports the need for services that address both generalist health and social needs in an integrated manner. Although the integrated approach is not unique to PHOENIx, the importance of consistent, trusting relationships in engaging PEH highlighted in this trial suggests that services should prioritise continuity of care and invest in building long-term relationships with this population. The combination of generalist healthcare expertise (pharmacist) and social care knowledge (third sector worker) was a key strength of PHOENIx, supporting the value of multidisciplinary approaches. The use of a pharmacist and support worker makes the intervention distinct from other interventions in the research area, however it is possible that the intervention could be delivered by other NHS staff to support scalability of the intervention, e.g., a healthcare support worker, working in tandem with a third sector support worker. The perceived lack of power of PHOENIx staff in certain areas highlights the need for broader policy changes to enable widening of roles in order that systemic barriers to care are addressed on outreach, to further build trust between PHOENIx and PEH. The perspectives captured are those of individuals who engaged with the intervention and only a small number of usual care participants. Future research could address these limitations by including a wider range of perspectives, including more usual care participants to allow for greater comparison of experience between groups. Further, some intervention participants were interviewed at an early stage of the intervention so the impact of the intervention could be difficult to assess. Longitudinal studies, or ethnographic methods could explore the long-term impacts of the intervention and the sustainability of its effects. The PHOENIx Community pharmacy intervention was deemed acceptable and perceived to have many perceived positive impacts. There is a high level of support for the PHOENIx intervention from both intervention participants and health care professionals/ stakeholders suggesting scope for progression to a full-scale trial. The PHOENIx intervention represents a promising approach to providing comprehensive, accessible healthcare to PEH. Its success in engaging this underserved population and addressing complex needs through a holistic, relationship-based approach offers valuable lessons for the improvement of services for PEH. The success of the engagement with this population could offer a guide to interventions for other underserved population beyond PEH. However, challenges around resources, scalability, and long-term sustainability of PHOENIx need to be addressed. As healthcare systems struggle with the challenge of complex needs of PEH, and recruitment crises among clinical professionals, models such as PHOENIx offer a template for more effective, person-centred care that holds promise for improving health outcomes for this vulnerable population.

Title: HDB Financial Services’ IPO gets ₹1.6 lakh crore in bids as institutional buyers pile in

India's IPO market is gaining momentum after a slow start, as the stock market stabilizes following earlier volatility driven by global trade concerns. The blue-chip Nifty 50 index, which hit a one-year low in April, now sits just 2.4 per cent below record highs from last year, as easing geopolitical tensions and trade fears spurred risk-on sentiment. HDB Financial, a unit of India's biggest private lender HDFC Bank, saw its issue subscribed 16.7 times over, driven by qualified institutional buyers such as foreign investors and mutual funds who bid for 55 times their reserved portion. Non-institutional investors bid for 10 times their portion, while retail investor interest was comparatively muted, with their shares being oversubscribed just 1.4 times, exchange data showed. The strong investor response makes HDB Financial's IPO the most subscribed offering over $1 billion since Zomato's in 2021, data from Prime Database showed. "The response to the issue has been very encouraging, and considering the issue size signals that investors are growing increasingly confident of the local market as global trade worries ebb out," said Narendra Solanki, head of research at Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers. "The bid numbers show that the primary markets are coming back to life after a lull earlier this year, and such a response for a sizeable issue like HDB's should give IPO hopefuls in the pipeline confidence to also come forth to test waters," Solanki added. HDB Financial' s IPO, the biggest ever by an Indian non-bank lender, was one of six offerings this week, five of which were oversubscribed in a range of 2-86 times. Earlier this week, Credila Financial Services and Pine Labs filed for IPOs. HDFC Bank, which holds a 94 per cent stake in HDB, sold shares worth up to ₹10,000 crore , while HDB issued new shares worth ₹2,500 crore. The company is targeting a valuation of up to $7.1 billion at the upper end of the 700-740 rupees price band. The stock is expected to start trading on July 2. HDB had already raised $392 million from anchor investors, including BlackRock funds, Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) and Norway's sovereign wealth fund.

ByRachel Wells ByRachel Wells, Contributor. You don't need to be a Silicon Valley engineer or have any technical background at all, to make ... More money with AI AI has become such a controversial topic. It's one of those things where you can look at it extremely positively, but extremely negatively at the same time. For example, just over a week ago, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote in a memo that the effects of AI in the organization would lead to large-scale layoffs and workforce reductions across the Big Tech giant, as more AI tools are being implemented and integrated across their workflow and systems. While this certainly spells bad news for employees who feel stuck within these roles, on the flip side, if you’ve been a casualty of an AI-induced layoff, there is still hope, because you can actually make AI work for you, not against you. You can actually join the opposition, so to speak, and leverage your existing skills while upskilling in AI, to build an AI-powered business as a freelancer. What’s really interesting is that more employers are outsourcing their work to freelance contractors. With freelance hiring up by 260% in the past two years alone, there’s never been a better time to be laid off, because opportunities are ripe for you to start your own business and pivot your career. So, if you’ve been waiting for a sign to launch your own venture, this is it. You can get started today, upskill relatively quickly, and capitalize on the strong interest that organizations have with implementing AI. Use this to your advantage so that you can effectively create your own job, hire yourself, and get paid for it. You know what’s even better? The AI-powered freelance business ideas listed in this article are no-code. This means you don’t need to be a software developer, ML engineer, or have a computer science background for these to work. Each of these ideas has the potential to rake in $100,000 or more a year in client contracts, projects, and consulting work. Let’s get into the list: There are two ways of looking at AI consulting. One is where you go deep into the development aspect of implementing AI into organizations. This is where you’ll definitely need to have solid technical background. But the other way of looking at it is a no-code approach. Some no-code options and services you can deliver for AI consulting work include: How much it pays: AI consulting work can pay as much as $175,000 a project. Create a monthly swipe file or kit of resources that your target clients can use, which will help them solve a specific problem. Monthly subscriptions are an excellent business model because they ensure longer retention and help to future-proof your career and finances due to their consistency. Additionally, this business model is perfect because it provides passive income, and it has low overheads. Often, you can start for less than $50, using one or more AI tools and Canva. They also support you during feast-or-famine cycles when clients from other streams of income may be running dry, and they make it easier for you as a freelancer to accurately predict and plan for your future financially, as well as making larger purchases. Some examples of AI-powered digital subscriptions you could offer include done-for-you marketing services, like: You can also combine some services to create higher-tier offers. For example, you could offer a YouTube content calendar, plus a strategy session, plus YouTube scripts. How much it pays: This business model provides unlimited income and can easily be scales and automated. Ask ChatGPT to draft a list of learning objectives and an outline for your niche corporate training program (the niche could be corporate wellbeing, sales, leadership training, etc.). Use it to brainstorm for the content and to develop the talking points of your presentation. Then, use AI tools like Prezi.ai or Canva’s AI features to help you develop the slide deck, and finally, ask ChatGPT to create survey questions relevant to your training, that you can give to attendees at the end of the session. How much it pays: Corporate trainers make about $87,000 a year, but on the higher end some are known to earn as much as $112,000 according to ZipRecruiter. That being said, if you provide digital products that can sell on their own, like ready-to-sell courses, you can make more money. Yes, you can build a business with AI. You just need to ensure that the following ingredients are in place: AI consulting is an extremely lucrative freelance business, with some projects paying upwards of ... More $150k Can I really make $100k a year using AI? Yes, AI has unlimited potential, and it’s only restricted by how and where you apply it. Once you spot a pain point, apply your expertise and use AI to back your solution so you can deliver it more efficiently and scale your income at the same time. Do I need to learn how to code to start an AI-powered business? No you don’t need coding knowledge. Business ideas like AI consulting focus on strategy and implementation advice.

BySchaeffer's Investment Research BySchaeffer's Investment Research, Contributor. Don’t think UBER’s drive up the charts is running out of gas. Rideshare firebrand Uber Technologies (UBER) boasts a 53.6% year-to-date gain. Despite a post-earnings bear gap back in early May, UBER proved resilient, and nabbed a May 20 record high of $93.60. Now, the shares are testing this level once more, and could barge on through, with this bullish combination flashing. UBER’s new highs are coinciding with historically low implied volatility (IV) -- a combination that has been bullish for the stock in the past. According to data from Schaeffer’s Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, there have been five other instances when Uber stock was trading within 2% of its 52-week high, while its Schaeffer’s Volatility Index (SVI) sat in the 20th annual percentile or lower -- as it the case with Garmin’s current SVI of 32%, in the 7th annual percentile. The data shows that one month after those six previous signals, UBER was higher 60% of the time, averaging a 3.7% gain. From its current perch at $92.81, that would mean barreling past that May 20 high, an area that turned the stock away earlier this week. The enticing technical setup goes deeper than that, though. Note in the chart below the shares’ 50-day moving average that contained pullbacks between the two peaks in the last two months. Shorter term, a breakout from current levels would form a bullish flag pattern. Further, note the trendlines connecting late December bottom to April 2025 lows just below $65, as well as then-record highs in October with the May peak. All of the trendlines fit within a bullish uptrend channel that UBER is in, and shows no signs of breaching. UBER Stock Chart With 50-Day Moving Average Should Uber Technologies stock resume its uptrend, analyst adjustments to the upside could provide tailwinds. It may have already begun; earlier this week, brokerage firm Cantor Fitzgerald hiked its UBER price target to $106, and more bull notes could be on the way. The equity’s consensus 12-month price target of $96.87 is only a 4% premium to its current perch, while 10 brokerages are on the sidelines with tepid “hold” ratings. Breaking through to new record highs could compel analysts to jump on board for the long term.

ByCharlie Fink ByCharlie Fink, Contributor. Legal win for AI industry? A U.S. federal judge ruled that Anthropic’s use of copyrighted books to train its AI model Claude qualifies as fair use. Judge William Alsup likened it to a writer learning from prior work. However, he found Anthropic liable for copyright infringement for storing over 7 million pirated books in a central repository unrelated to training. That storage was not protected under fair use. Damages could be as high as $150,000 per infraction. A trial in December will address potential damages. Alphabets AI on advanced central processing unit (CPU) chip and gavel and sound block in wireframe ... More on electronic mother boards. Illustration of the concept of legislation and regulations of AI Act In the Northern District of California, U.S. federal judge Vince Chhabria, dismissed a copyright lawsuit from 13 authors against Meta. The plaintiffs, which include Sarah Silverman and Ta‑Nehisi Coates, claimed Meta improperly used their books to train its Llama AI model. The court found the plaintiffs failed to show market harm or dilution, and granted summary judgment for Meta. The decision applies only to the specific authors involved and does not affirm that Meta’s data use is lawful across the board. On Last Week Tonight, John Oliver skewered the rise of “AI slop,” mass-produced, low-effort content flooding social media. In previous weeks, I’ve shared anthropomorphic cat dramas, and vlogs from Storm Troopers, Bigfoot and Jesus. It’s entertaining. It’s designed to go viral, and earn ad money. But, argues Oliver, it’s slop that drowns out real content. One landscape designer complains she can’t find pictures of real gardens on Pinterest anymore. Chronicle co-founders Aaron Sisto (l) and Chris deFaria (r) Chronicle Bets $12 Million AI Can Spot A Billion Dollar Franchise Chronicle's founders think social platforms are where tomorrow’s blockbuster entertainment properties will be born, and they are using AI to grow them.

(Photo by WANG Zhao / AFP) (Photo by WANG ZHAO/AFP via Getty Images) Xiaomi has unveiled its AI-first smartglasses—officially named Xiaomi AI Glasses (yes, really). Like Meta’s Ray-Bans, there’s no display. Instead, they use Qualcomm’s Snapdragon AR1 chip and Xiaomi’s Hyper XiaoAi assistant to deliver voice-based responses triggered by speech and touch. With no screen or HUD, the emphasis is on audio-driven utility and lightweight design. The glasses feature a 12MP stabilized camera, five mics, dual speakers, and electrochromic lenses that darken on demand. They weigh just 40 grams, support Alipay QR payments, and offer up to 21 hours of standby. Shipping in September, they start at ¥1,999 (about $280) and come in three colors.

ARtillery Intelligence’s June 2025 report projects headworn AR revenue to grow from $2.6 billion in 2024 to $13.05 billion in 2029. That's a compound annual growth rate of nearly 38 percent. This growth is led by enterprise productivity use cases, currently accounting for over 70 percent of market revenue. But consumer adoption is accelerating fast thanks to the success of “lite AR” smart glasses like Ray-Ban Meta. These tier-3, audio-first, non-display glasses have validated a new design direction: style-forward, AI-powered wearables that prioritize utility over immersion. Meta’s success has prompted rapid follow-on moves from Apple, Google (via Android XR), and Snap, with key consumer AR glasses expected by 2026–2027. ARtillery anticipates a major inflection in 2027 as these players enter the market.

Susan Wagner High School's virtual enterprise program allows students to take a deep dive into entrepreneurship, studying finance, marketing and other business applications before launching their own company. Here, Joseph Weisberg, center, who teaches the course, poses with his students for a selfie while on a class trip. (Courtesy of Joseph Weisberg)(Courtesy of Joseph Weisberg) STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. — For the past several years, a group of students at Susan Wagner High School has been operating a small business. The culmination of long hours, field trips and lots of classroom learning, the smallish virtual bakery enterprise was formed after its owners took several courses in finance, learned about break-even analysis and marketed their well-thought plan to local business owners. It’s a study in entrepreneurship that has undoubtedly changed their lives. “I came into high school very shy, not talkative, bad at public speaking,” said Liam Smith, a now-eloquent senior who’s headed to Hunter College to study biology in the fall. “But this class went beyond financial literacy. Not only did we become familiar with Quick Books, Excel and all the other Microsoft extensions, we filled our resumes with important life skills as well.” The four-year program, which is part of the school’s Business Academy, introduces students to the foundations of business in freshman year, followed by leadership and public presentation lessons in year two. During junior year, participants write a business plan and begin marketing a product. Senior year is when they launch and run a virtual company. Students in the Virtual Enterprise program pose for a picture outside of BlackRock, one of the world’s largest investment management and financial services firms. (Courtesy of Joseph Weisberg)(Courtesy of Joseph Weisberg) “This is the real deal — we have been a New York State Career and Technical Education [CTE] entrepreneurial preparatory program since 2021. We prepare students to become entrepreneurs and teach them to understand financial literacy,” said Joseph Weisberg, Susan Wagner’s CTE business teacher and virtual enterprise coordinator. “In this classroom they’re learning how to plan a career and make an impact in the local business community.” Weisberg, who worked as an accountant and had prior teaching experience before coming to Wagner in 2023, says students who complete the program are well prepared to enter the workforce with a solid understanding of career and financial management. “First they learn finance, marketing and management skills and in their final year they take part in a virtual enterprise where they sell a virtual product through an online marketplace,” he noted. “It’s simulation based, but the experience is very real.” For the past two years the students operated an inclusive bakery, one which catered to those with dietary restrictions. The students researched ingredients and even partnered with local bakers who advised them on how to prevent cross contamination and other food allergy issues. Susan Wagner High School's virtual enterprise program allows students to take a deep dive into entrepreneurship, studying finance, marketing and other business applications before launching their own company. (Courtesy of Joseph Weisberg)(Courtesy of Joseph Weisberg) “Each student walks away with a resume and cover letter, and plenty of real-life experience ready to apply for a position that suits them,” Weisberg said. “Over the course of four years, the students are taking a very in-depth look at the life of an entrepreneur. Many decide to continue studying business in college, others are well-prepared to jump right into the workforce.” Weisberg’s students say it is by far the best part of their high school experience. “My favorite part is how Mr. Weisberg values us,” said Max Koleci, a junior. “He takes a couple of students and gives them larger roles, shows us how to lead. From day one I knew I wanted to be one of those leaders.” Koleci praised the “tight knit” program, detailing how he was inspired by a class trip to the BlackRock, one of the world’s largest investment management and financial services firms. He called the entire experience “enlightening.” Students in Susan Wagner High School's Virtual Enterprise program work on a project in class. (Courtesy of Joseph Weisberg)(Courtesy of Joseph Weisberg) “We’re learning things in this program that I know I’ll apply in real life,” he said. “Business is very interesting and even though I’m not quite sure if I will pursue this field in the future, I know that I will use these lessons in whatever path I might take.” Chasity Gordon, also a junior, agreed. “This class has helped me learn who I want to be,” Gordon said. “I entered the program in sophomore year, and we had lessons in Adobe, Canva, PowerPoint. I know now that I want to pursue a career in marketing.” “This program helped me discover a lot of things about myself,” Liam Smith added. “I am so much more communicative and no longer anxious or stressed, struggling to picture my future — short or long term.” Each student walks away from the program with a Career and Technical Education diploma, a specialized New York state high school accreditation that recognizes students who have completed a rigorous program of study in a specific career field. It signifies that a student has not only met the standard graduation requirements but has also gained valuable skills and knowledge in a chosen career area. Students present a business plan during one of their Virtual Enterprise classes. (Courtesy of Joseph Weisberg)(Courtesy of Joseph Weisberg) While students say that diploma is “a big deal,” it’s most certainly not the only thing they earn from this course. “This is by far the best program that Wagner offers,” Max Koleci concluded. “Mr. Weisberg always tells us ‘even if you hate business, you will learn how to prepare a budget, how to calculate interest on car payment…’ and that’s the kind of real-deal stuff we’ve learned in his classroom.” If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

Title: AVGO Stock To $500?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CANADA - 2025/01/28: In this photo illustration, the Broadcom logo is seen displayed on a smartphone ... More screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Broadcom’s (NASDAQ: AVGO) extraordinary 125% increase from $110 levels in early 2024 has investors pondering if the AI chipmaker can replicate its success. What might lead the stock to rise to $500+ levels from here in the coming years? The most persuasive factor is Broadcom’s custom silicon division. AI-related semiconductors now account for over 50% of Broadcom’s sales, marking a significant shift in the company’s revenue composition. The management of the company assesses the serviceable addressable market at $15-20 billion. The custom chip sector shows tremendous growth potential. The overall market for custom chips could expand to approximately $55 billion by 2028, effectively more than tripling from current figures. This growth reflects hyperscalers’ increasing preference for purpose-built silicon over generalized processors. Additionally, if you’re seeking a more consistent route to gains than investing in a single stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has surpassed the S&P and yielded over 91% since its inception. Also, check out – BigBear.ai: What's Happening With BBAI Stock? Other elements are at play as well. Broadcom's impressive earnings growth can support elevated valuations. The company's revenue is anticipated to grow at a high teens average annual rate to over $100 billion by 2029. Broadcom has high profitability with its adjusted net income margin of 50% in the past twelve months. This indicates that the impact on earnings will be more significant than on the top-line. At its present levels of $265, AVGO stock is trading at 45 times its trailing twelve months adjusted earnings of $5.84 per share. Additionally, check out – Broadcom’s Valuation Ratios. Maintaining this multiple could push the stock to around $500 within that timeframe. A higher multiple would enable an even greater increase. The existing customer relationships frequently involve multi-year commitments and substantial switching costs, which provides Broadcom with revenue visibility and pricing power, potentially maintaining premium valuations. For this multiple to broaden, Broadcom must showcase sustained strong annual revenue growth in AI segments, expand its market share in the custom silicon sector, focus on further margin improvement from a higher-value product mix, and secure contracts with new clients. In summary, Broadcom’s journey to doubling relies on capturing a significant portion of the growing custom chip market while preserving its technological prowess in AI networking. With the custom chip market potentially reaching $55 billion by 2028 and Broadcom’s current leading position, the company seems well-equipped for ongoing outperformance. While Broadcom displays strong growth prospects, several factors could restrict its upside. Consequently, investors considering Broadcom should carefully evaluate these risks. At Trefis, we incorporate such risks into our construction of the High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which encompasses 30 stocks and has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four years. What explains that outperformance? HQ Portfolio constituents tend to provide higher returns with lower volatility than the benchmark, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Diane Brady is executive editorial director of the Fortune CEO Initiative and Fortune Live Media. She also writes the CEO Daily newsletter. Good morning. Earlier this week, I had a chance to chat with Intuit CEO Sasan Goodarzi and play with the four AI-powered agents that are rolling out next week for Quickbooks Online. It’s the first time I’ve seen agents deployed so effectively in handing off tasks to each other while helping humans be more productive. (I did enjoy seeing Cognizant’s Babak Hodjat create multi-agent systems on the spot at the Fortune COO Summit earlier this month, but many of us will deploy agents, not create them.) Intuit has four themed agents—a customer one for spotting leads in emails, drafting emails, and tracking interactions to the point of sales; one for payments to streamline and speed up that process; another for finance, to analyze and help you boost the health of your business; and a fourth for accounting, to reconcile expenses and make your bookkeepers happy. If I’d had this a decade ago, I might have remained an entrepreneur. “By far, this is the most significant launch we’ve ever had in our history because it’s end-to-end,” Goodarzi told me. “The fact that we have launched a virtual team that can do a lot of work, from managing your leads to making sure you get paid and your accounting is done, and it’s a combination of AI and humans doing the work. It’s been in the works for six years.” “It’s not about workflows,” he said. “It’s about a business feed that does everything for the customer while they’re always in control. And it’s not just about technology; it’s also about human expertise because, in our world, even Millennials, they want the reassurance of a human.” When I asked Goodarzi to reflect on what this means for the identity of a company that most associate with taxes and accounting, he said: “I want us to be known as the money company because of how we help businesses and consumers.”More news below.Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com U.S.-China trade deal The U.S. and China have reached an “understanding” on trade in which China will supply rare earth minerals to the U.S. and in return, “we’ll take down our countermeasures,” US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Bloomberg. Trump’s sons are considering a dynasty Eric Trump told the FT that he or Donald Jr., Ivanka, or his wife Lara might continue their father’s legacy in politics. “I think I could do it,” Eric Trump said. “And by the way, I think other members of our family could do it too.” Meta did not pay those guys $100 million Lucas Beyer, one of three OpenAI researchers who lead Sam Altman’s Zurich office, said on X that they did not get paid $100 million to join Mark Zuckerberg’s company. “No, we did not get 100M sign-on, that's fake news,” he said. Citi stock worth $100 a share, analyst says Citi chief Jane Fraser has suffered months of negative headlines but yesterday she got some good news. Bank of America analyst Ebrahim Poonawala rated the stock a “buy” with a price target of $100, and said Fraser’s reforms are working. The stock closed last night at $84.37. Two senior execs leave Tesla Omead Afshar, head sales and operations in North America and Europe, and Jenna Ferrua, director of North American HR, have exited Tesla, following a tough period for the company: Q1 vehicle deliveries fell 13% and profit declined 71%. Trump v the judges The White House sued all 15 federal judges in Maryland for opposing his deportation program. The normal method for disputing a judicial ruling would be to appeal a decision. The suit thus puts the Trump Administration on a legal collision course with the judiciary over which branch of government has a superior level of power. New York real estate developers in panic over Mamdani If Zohran Mamdani wins the NYC mayor’s race, it “would be the death penalty for the city,” Danny Fishman, CEO of Gaia Real Estate, told the WSJ. “And it would be the best thing to happen to Miami and Palm Beach since Covid.” Mamdani favors rent control, and New York’s property moguls are organizing to back almost anyone who might be able to beat him. Bill Ackman makes a pledge Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman is looking to bankroll a candidate who can take down Democratic frontrunner Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral election. He shared that he and his associates have “hundreds of millions of dollars” at the ready, and once they find the person for the job, “the funds will pour in.” Not made in the USA The Trump Organization is no longer claiming that its T1 phone will be made in the U.S., now opting instead for more vague descriptions of the product on its website like, “designed with American values in mind.” This switch up comes less than two weeks after the company announced its new brand.

Title: JCPenney Gifts $10,000 Dream Wedding to LA Couple Amid Brand Revival
URL: https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/jcpenney-gifts-10000-dream-wedding-to-la-couple-amid-brand-revival/
Time Published: 2025-06-27T06:01:00Z
Full Content:
While all eyes are on Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ high-profile wedding in Venice, Italy this week, JCPenney hopes to divert attention to another Venice wedding that happened recently. On Wednesday, the department store funded a Los Angeles couple’s wedding in Venice, Calif. to prove that the big day doesn’t have to break the bank. The brand assisted high school sweethearts Estefany Gomez and Leonardo Rendon by outfitting the couple and their entire guest list, as well as providing all wedding decor—all for a total pricetag of $10,000. If you don’t believe them, check the receipt. “We’ve always dreamed of a California wedding, but with our families living on opposite coasts, it felt out of reach,” the couple said in a statement. “When JCPenney reached out, we honestly wondered if it could really happen. But they didn’t just say yes to our dream—they made every detail possible, from outfitting every guest in gorgeous fashion to the venue and cake, and most importantly, creating memories we’ll cherish forever.” Per Zola’s 2025 First Look Report, the average cost of a wedding in 2025 is projected to hit $36,000, an increase from $33,000 in 2024 and $29,000 in 2023. The campaign comes as JCPenney attempts to stage a major comeback under its new chief marketing officer (CMO) Marisa Thalberg, following a period of bankruptcy, layoffs, store closures, and slow sales. Per Retail Dive, the brand’s Q4 total net sales decreased more than 9% to $2.09 billion. The publication also reported on Monday that the department store will shutter its Alliance Supply Chain facility in Haslet, Texas in November, impacting 300 employees. In April, JCPenney rolled out “Yes, JCPenney”, its first campaign under Thalberg, featuring unbranded billboards across NYC’s Times Square and in Brookfield and Simon malls nationwide. The posters showcased models wearing its clothes with no indication of where they came from. A QR code printed on the ads linked to JCPenney’s site. In the two months since the campaign’s release, JCPenney said it has seen a 22% increase in Google searches for the brand, as well as a rise in brand consideration from 13.6% to 16.4%. One of the lead outfits from the ad campaign also achieved an 88% sell-through. Thalberg, who joined in October 2024, said facilitating what she calls “the other Venice wedding” was a part of the brand’s strategy to reaffirm JCPenney as a destination for budget-conscious trendsetters. “As we think about what our place is in culture, it’s to gently poke at things that are elite and show how we can translate it for everyone else,” she told ADWEEK. The CMO added that consumers can anticipate more from its “Yes, JCPenney” campaign as it rolls out back-to-school fashion in the fall. Cydney Lee is ADWEEK's advertising news reporter based out of NYC. Prior to joining in Aug. 2024, she was editorial assistant at Billboard. Her work has also appeared in W Magazine, GRAMMY.com, Pigeons & Planes, Vulture and more. By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy .

Equity benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty advanced for the fourth straight session on Friday, supported by buying in blue-chips ICICI Bank and Reliance Industries, amid fresh foreign fund inflows. A strengthening rupee against the US dollar and softening crude oil prices in international markets also boosted investor confidence, according to traders. Equity indices rise on blue-chip buying, foreign fund inflows, and positive global cues, boosting investor confidence. The rupee rose 24 paise to close at 85.48 (provisional) against the greenback on Friday on the back of strong FII inflows and firm domestic equity markets. Rupee strengthens against dollar on FII inflows and equity market boost, despite crude oil price uptrend. Today, the Indian stock market closed with a positive bias, reflecting investor optimism amid easing global tensions and favourable domestic cues. The BSE Sensex ended higher by approximately 303 points, closing around 84,058, while the NSE Nifty50 gained about 88 points to settle near 25,637. The market’s upside momentum was primarily driven by strong performances in sectors such as Oil & Gas, PSU Banks, with Nifty Oil & Gas index rising over 0.5%. The positive close was supported by hopes of a potential relaxation in US tariff deadlines, improved global market sentiments, and easing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, which boosted risk appetite among investors. Additionally, the Indian rupee strengthened against the dollar, trading at around 85.51, further aiding market sentiment. Domestic factors such as robust IPO subscription rates, including HDB Financial Services and Sambhv Steel Tubes, also indicated sustained investor interest. DBS Bank India Ltd (DBIL) has waived prepayment and foreclosure charges for all Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) borrowers registered with UDYAM, making it easier for businesses to access credit and manage cash flow. Announced on MSME Day, this move reflects the bank’s continued commitment to supporting India’s MSMEs. The waiver is effective going forward and applies to both new and existing active borrowers. This proactive step aims to enhance borrower flexibility and aligns with regulatory guidance focused on improving transparency in lending. It also addresses a persistent challenge faced by many MSMEs — where foreclosure charges have often deterred early repayment or refinancing, restricting their ability to optimise cash flow management. Commenting on the development, Sudarshan Chari, Managing Director, and Head – SME Banking, DBS Bank India, said, “Access to flexible and affordable credit remains a critical need for micro, small and medium enterprises. By waiving prepayment and foreclosure charges, we are addressing a common challenge that often limits financial agility. This change enables businesses to repay loans early without penalty and reallocate funds towards immediate priorities or critical areas like inventory, technology, and expansion. It aligns with our broader efforts to support MSMEs with need-based solutions that strengthen their resilience and unlock long-term growth.” Delhivery shares traded flat on the BSE at ₹382.65.

Kinara Capital, a leading fintech driving MSME financial inclusion, today released its fourth edition of MSME Insights, signaling strong optimism and increased formalization in the MSME sector. MSME entrepreneurs are confident about their near-term business growth prospects. According to the latest MSME Insights, 81% of the surveyed MSMEs expect their business revenue to increase within the next 1-2 years. Of these, 34% anticipate a revenue growth of more than 15% in their businesses. Additionally, MSMEs are embracing formalization, with 51.7% of the surveyed reporting that they are now GST-registered. The fourth edition of MSME Insights is based on an extensive multilingual survey of 9,314 MSMEs from Manufacturing, Trading, and Services sectors conducted across Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and the Union Territory of Puducherry. The MSME Insights is a comprehensive data analysis of current trends of micro-small-medium enterprises (MSMEs) based on firsthand input from business owners. MSME Insights also delved into the behavioral patterns within the MSME sector and the analysis uncovered a striking pattern across all sectors. MSMEs still depend significantly on cash transactions, even when not accounting for UPI usage. Over 84.3% of the surveyed MSMEs stated that between 25%-100% of their business transactions are conducted with actual cash—underscoring the need for deeper digitization efforts across the sector. Sharing her perspective, Hardika Shah, Founder & CEO, Kinara Capital, said, “On the occasion of World MSME Day, it is encouraging to witness the strong optimism shared by India’s MSMEs. The fact that 81% of respondents in our recent MSME Insights survey expressed confidence in their growth prospects speaks volumes about the sector’s resilience and ambition. This optimism is rooted in improved access to formal credit, which enables entrepreneurs to focus on expansion. However, the sector’s continued reliance on cash transactions highlights the need to accelerate digitization. Embracing digital payments can enhance financial transparency and significantly boost access to formal credit. Ultimately, digitization holds the key to reaching underserved MSMEs and closing India’s ₹30 lakh crore credit gap.” KEY FINDINGS FROM KINARA CAPITAL’S MSME INSIGHTS, FOURTH EDITION ● MSMEs are upbeat about their business growth : More than 81% of the respondents have indicated that they are expecting varying degrees of growth in their revenue. Of these, 47% of the respondents expect their revenue to witness a 5%-15% growth, 26.1% anticipate a growth of 15%-25% and 7.9% are optimistic of more than 25% growth in revenue. Only a small proportion, i.e., 1.1% foresee no growth. ●Cash is King for MSMEs : Overall, 84.3% of the surveyed MSMEs reported relying on cash (excluding UPI) for 25%-to-100% of their business transactions. While only 7.4% of the MSME respondents relied on cash for more than 75% of their business transactions, 30.5% depended on cash for 50%-to-75% of their business transactions. This outcome indicates that a shift to digital payments, though underway, is far from reaching its full potential. ●Formalization is on an Upswing : MSMEs are increasingly recognizing the benefits of Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance. According to the survey, 51.7% of respondents are GST-registered and file returns regularly. Of these, 29.4% expressed interest in GST-linked loan products that offer better interest rates or flexible tenures. Regular GST filings not only reflect consistent business activity but also provide a verifiable financial history that enhances credit eligibility. Additionally, GST registration reduces the overall tax burden through input tax credits and offers MSMEs the ease of doing business across state lines with a unified tax structure. SBI General Insurance, one of India’s leading general insurance providers, has partnered with Starfin India, a subsidiary of BLS E-Services, to introduce an innovative Hospital Daily Cash Benefit Plan for low-income families. Hospitalization costs can significantly impact savings due to the potentially high expenses associated with treatment, medication, and recovery. This financial stress is often compounded by income loss and out-of-pocket expenses such as travel, medication, and attendant care. Under this plan the policyholders will receive a fixed daily cash benefit during hospital stays due to illness or accidents, helping reduce financial stress during challenging times. It will also include coverage for accidental death and partial disability, offering added protection and peace of mind to insured individuals. Commenting on the collaboration, Priya Kumar, Business Head - Emerging Business Lines at SBI General Insurance said, “Access to timely financial support during hospitalisation can make a significant difference for vulnerable families. Our collaboration with Starfin India is timely due to IRDAI’s objective of ensuring timely settlement of genuine claims, preventing fraud, and establishing effective grievance redressal mechanisms and also strengthening the financial resilience of underserved communities creating a meaningful impact at the time of need.” HDFC Bank subsidiary HDB Financial Services launches IPO, HDB Financial Services IPO GMP Day 3 Live Updates: India’s largest NBFC public issue of HDFC Bank’s subsidiary, HDB Financial Services, received a strong response, as the mega offer was subscribed fully on Day 2 itself.

Source: Reuters 1.January 2025: FIIs recorded significant outflows of ₹78,000 crore, one of the highest monthly sell-offs, driven by global factors like high US interest rates and disappointing Q2 FY25 earnings in India. 2.February 2025: Outflows continued at ₹23,000 crore, with heavy selling in sectors like banking, financial services, consumer goods, and automobiles.

April 2025: FIIs showed renewed interest, with inflows of over $1.9 billion (≈₹15,960 crore) between April 15 and 21, and an additional ₹1,290 crore on April 22. This marked a shift after a month of heavy selling. May 2025: FIIs were net buyers on specific days, e.g., ₹3,794.52 crore on May 6, but the monthly net flow data is incomplete.

Title: Salesforce chief Marc Benioff says AI now does up to half of all the work at his company
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/06/26/salesforce-chief-marc-benioff-says-ai-now-half-work-company/
Time Published: 2025-06-26T23:46:35Z
Full Content:
UPDATED 19:46 EDT / JUNE 26 2025 by Mike Wheatley Salesforce Inc. Chief Executive Marc Benioff says his company is doubling down on the use of artificial intelligence, using the technology to automate dozens of workloads that were, until recently, done by humans. In an interview with Bloomberg, Benioff (pictured) said AI agents are now performing as much as 30% to 50% of all the work at his company. “All of us have to get our head around this idea that AI could do things that before, we were doing, and we can move on to do higher-value work,” Benioff said. The problem for some Salesforce employees is that they’ll need to find another employer who’s willing to pay them to perform that higher-value work. Earlier this year, the company announced it’s laying off about 1,000 of its staff. Although it has also announced plans to hire another 1,000, these new employees will be focused on selling its Agentforce technology. What that means is that those new workers will be tasked with urging other companies to adopt AI that can automate work normally done by humans, potentially encouraging them to replace some of their own employees. It’s a worrying trend that seems to be catching on. Earlier this month, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote a letter to employees where he discussed the company’s increased adoption of generative AI tools and admitted that it will likely need “fewer people” in future than it currently employs. The rise of AI comes at a time when technology companies are looking for new ways to try and cut costs and boost efficiencies, and many have already announced plans to achieve that by sacrificing human workers. For instance, Microsoft Corp. had already cut more than 6,000 jobs in May and is now reportedly undergoing a second round of layoffs while investing more in AI, according to Fast Company. Google LLC has also reportedly trimmed people from various departments. The website Layoffs.fyi says more than 63,000 jobs have disappeared in the tech industry so far this year, and there are growing reasons to think AI is at least partly responsible for this trend. In his latest newsletter, Brian Merchant, author of “Blood in the Machine: The Origins of the Rebellion Against Big Tech,” writes that he has spoken with dozens of tech industry workers who have been affected by the adoption of AI. He claims that the technology is rapidly reshaping Silicon Valley’s workforces. According to Merchant, an employee at CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. told him that his company’s recent round of layoffs saw many new hires booted out and replaced with AI, despite saying publicly it was about cutting underperforming staff. “AI has literally killed many jobs at CrowdStrike this week,” the employee said. An employee at Dropbox Inc. made similar claims about his employer, saying that during its recent round of layoffs, the entire team focused on improving the reliability of its products was let go in favor of AI tools that can automate this work. Benioff told Bloomberg that the workforce is now undergoing a “digital labor revolution” and said his company’s AI agents can perform work with an accuracy of about 93%. “It’s pretty good, but it’s not realistic to hit 100%,” Benioff said, pointing out that other companies are at “much lower levels because they don’t have as much data and metadata.” Support our open free content by sharing and engaging with our content and community.

Title: Monster and CareerBuilder, once popular with job seekers, file for bankruptcy

Skip to comments. Posted on 06/26/2025 3:14:47 PM PDT by SeekAndFind Monster and CareerBuilder, once two of the most popular websites for job seekers at the height of the dot-com era, have filed for bankruptcy. The two sites, which merged last year to become one entity named Monster + CareerBuilder, voluntary filed for Chapter 11 Tuesday, announcing that the company is selling various parts of its businesses to several buyers as part of a court-supervised process, a press release said. Monster and CareerBuilder were some of the biggest companies in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with the former brand so popular that it often bought Super Bowl commercials promoting its services. However, both have fallen out of favor for job hunters with the rise of competitors like Indeed, Glassdoor and Microsoft-owned LinkedIn in recent years. Jeff Furman, CEO of CareerBuilder + Monster, said in statement that its “business has been affected by a challenging and uncertain macroeconomic environment” and determined that “initiating this court-supervised sale process is the best path toward maximizing the value of our businesses and preserving jobs.” The most recognizable part of CareerBuilder and Monster — their job boards — is being sold to JobGet, a platform for gig and hourly workers searching for jobs. Monster Government Services, which provides software to state and federal governments, is being sold to Canadian-based Valsoft Corporation. Also, its media division — the two companies own Military.com and FastWeb.com — is being sold to Canadian media company Valnet. All purchases require court approval, with the sales subject to higher offers. Furman said the company is “making difficult but necessary decisions to reduce costs and help ensure a seamless transition of our businesses,” including layoffs. It has received $20 million in financing to keep operating during the bankruptcy process. (Excerpt) Read more at cnn.com ...

Monster and CareerBuilder were some of the biggest companies in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with the former brand so popular that it often bought Super Bowl commercials promoting its services. However, both have fallen out of favor for job hunters with the rise of competitors like Indeed, Glassdoor and Microsoft-owned LinkedIn in recent years. Jeff Furman, CEO of CareerBuilder + Monster, said in statement that its “business has been affected by a challenging and uncertain macroeconomic environment” and determined that “initiating this court-supervised sale process is the best path toward maximizing the value of our businesses and preserving jobs.” The most recognizable part of CareerBuilder and Monster — their job boards — is being sold to JobGet, a platform for gig and hourly workers searching for jobs. Monster Government Services, which provides software to state and federal governments, is being sold to Canadian-based Valsoft Corporation. Also, its media division — the two companies own Military.com and FastWeb.com — is being sold to Canadian media company Valnet. All purchases require court approval, with the sales subject to higher offers. Furman said the company is “making difficult but necessary decisions to reduce costs and help ensure a seamless transition of our businesses,” including layoffs. It has received $20 million in financing to keep operating during the bankruptcy process. (Excerpt) Read more at cnn.com ...

By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Radio broadcaster and podcast company Audacy is shuttering Pineapple Street Studios, which had produced original audio shows and companion podcasts for TV shows like “House of the Dragon,” “Severance” and “The Last of Us.” With the shutdown of Pineapple Street, nearly 30 employees are being laid off, according to sources familiar with the company. Audacy, previously known as Entercom Communications, had acquired Pineapple Street for a reported $18 million in 2019. Related Stories 'Everything's Going to Be Great' Review: Bryan Cranston and Allison Janney in an Earnest Shambles of a Family Theater Comedy The Weeknd Concert Review: The Superstar Paces Himself, From Doom-Rock Prelude Through Giddy Synth-Pop Climax, at Impressive SoFi Stadium Show An Audacy spokesperson said in a statement, “This difficult decision aligns our resources with our core strengths and the most promising growth areas for our podcasting business. We’re sorry to say goodbye to talented colleagues and are grateful for their contributions.” Popular on Variety Audacy filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last year as it looked to reduce its debt load. The one-time publicly traded company emerged from bankruptcy in September 2024 under a new ownership group led by controlling shareholder Soros Fund Management. In March, Audacy conducted a broad round of layoffs, cutting about 200 employees across divisions. Pineapple’s shows for TV networks included official podcasts for HBO and HBO Max series “And Just Like That…,” “Chernobyl,” “Dune: Prophecy,” “Hacks,” “House of the Dragon” and “The Last of Us.” Its companion shows for Apple TV+ include podcasts for “Foundation” and “Severance.” According to its website, Pineapple also sold multiple originals for TV and film development, including “Wind of Change” to Hulu, “Missing Richard Simmons” to Amazon Studios, “Heaven’s Gate” to HBO Max and “The Clearing” to Chernin Entertainment. Audacy plans to continue producing podcasts in association with other media companies. Pineapple Street had produced the first two seasons of Apple TV+’s official “Severance” podcast. Going forward, that is now being produced by Audacy Podcasts, in partnership with Red Hour and Great Scott. Five new episodes of “The Severance Podcast With Ben Stiller & Adam Scott” will be released weekly on Thursdays beginning June 26, available across all podcast platforms. In addition, a set of new episodes is slated to be released in the fall of 2025. According to the Pineapple Street Studios site, the company was founded in 2016 by Jenna Weiss-Berman and Max Linsky. The studio has staff based in Brooklyn, Los Angeles and Atlanta. In March, Audacy named Kelli Turner its permanent president and CEO while also announcing the departure of four top execs. The shutdown of Pineapple Street was first reported by Bloomberg. A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

June 26, 2025 17:45 ET | Source: GraniteShares GraniteShares NEW YORK, June 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GraniteShares has announced it will execute a forward share split for the GraniteShares 2x Long PLTR (the “Fund”). The total market value of the shares outstanding will not be affected as a result of these splits. After the close of the markets on July 08, 2025 (the “Payable Date”), the Fund will effect a forward split of its issued and outstanding shares as follows: As a result of the share split, shareholders of the Fund will receive fifteen shares for each share held as indicated in the table above. Accordingly, the number of the Fund’s issued and outstanding shares will increase by the approximate percentage indicated above. The ticker and CUSIP will not be affected by the transaction. The share split will apply to shareholders of record as of the close of the NASDAQ Stock Market (the “NASDAQ”) on July 08, 2025 (the “Record Date”), payable after the close of the NASDAQ on the Payable Date. Shares of the Funds will begin trading on the NASDAQ on a split-adjusted basis on July 09, 2025 (the “Ex-Date”). On the Ex-Date, the opening market value of the Fund’s issued and outstanding shares, and thus a shareholder’s investment value, will not be affected by the share split. However, the per share net asset value (“NAV”) and opening market price on the Ex-Date will be approximately one-fifteenth. The table below illustrates the effect of a hypothetical fifteen-for-one split on a shareholder’s investment. 15-for-1 forward split About GraniteShares GraniteShares is an independent ETF issuer headquartered in New York City. GraniteShares offers the following leveraged single stock ETFs: In addition, GraniteShares’ ETF suite includes the following ETFs: (1) GraniteShares Advisors LLC has contractually agreed to waive its fees and/or pay for operating expenses of the Fund to ensure that total annual fund operating expenses (exclusive of any (i) interest, (ii) brokerage fees and commission, (iii) acquired fund fees and expenses, (iv) fees and expenses associated with instruments in other collective investment vehicles or derivative instruments (including for example options and swap fees and expenses), (v) interest and dividend expense on short sales, (vi) taxes, (vii) other fees related to underlying investments (such as option fees and expenses or swap fees and expenses), (viii) expenses incurred in connection with any merger or reorganization or (ix) extraordinary expenses such as litigation) will not exceed 1.15%. This agreement is effective until December 31, 2025, and it may be terminated before that date only by the Trust’s Board of Trustees. GraniteShares Advisors LLC may request recoupment of previously waived fees and paid expenses from the Fund for three years from the date such fees and expenses were waived or paid, if such reimbursement will not cause the Fund’s total expense ratio to exceed the expense limitation in place at the time of the waiver and/or expense payment and the expense limitation in place at the time of the recoupment.(2) Estimated total cost in the absence of fee waiver or reimbursement.Contact Information:William Rhind, CEOGraniteShares Inc+1 646 876 5049william.rhind@graniteshares.com Important Information Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the GraniteShares funds (the “Funds”) carefully before investing. For a prospectus or summary prospectus with this and other information about the Funds, please call (844) 476 8747, or visit the website at www.graniteshares.com. Read the prospectus or summary prospectus carefully before investing. To obtain a prospectus for BAR, please visithttps://www.graniteshares.com/Documents/25/Prospectus-GraniteShares-Gold-Trust.pdf To obtain a prospectus for PLTM, please visithttps://graniteshares.com/media/gwrbh3ah/pltm_prospectus.pdf To obtain a prospectus for COMB, please visithttps://graniteshares.com/media/4crf2x4e/graniteshares-etf-trust-comb-summary-prospectus.pdf Except as described above regarding the liquidation of the ETFs, shares of the Funds may be sold during trading hours on the exchange through any brokerage account, shares are not individually redeemable, and shares may only be redeemed directly from a Fund by Authorized Participants. There can be no assurance that an active trading market for shares in a Fund will develop or be maintained. Shares may trade above or below NAV. Brokerage commissions will apply. Fund Risks Multiple funds have a limited operating history of less than a year and risks associated with a new fund. The Leveraged and Daily Inverse Funds are not suitable for all investors. The investment program of the funds is speculative, entails substantial risks and include asset classes and investment techniques not employed by most ETFs and mutual funds. Investments in the ETFs are not bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged (2X) or daily inverse (-1X and -2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Fund will lose money even if the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The funds do not directly invest in the underlying stock. The Funds seek daily inverse or leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. Each Fund with “Long” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the respective long leveraged multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each a Leveraged Long Fund). Each Fund with “Short” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the inverse (or opposite) multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each an Inverse Fund). Investors should note that the Long Leveraged Funds and the Daily Inverse Funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives and daily inverse investment objectives (respectively), which means that the fund is riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage and inverse strategies because the fund magnifies the performance of their underlying security. The volatility of the underlying security may affect a Funds' return as much as, or more than, the return of the underlying security. For the Leveraged Long Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. For the Daily Inverse Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from -100% and 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance decreases over a period longer than a single day. Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the ETF. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue or remain unchanged. Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions and frequent trading may incur brokerage costs that detract significantly from investment returns. An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund is non-diversified and includes risks associated with the Fund concentrating its investments in a particular industry, sector, or geographic region which can result in increased volatility. The use of derivatives such as futures contracts and swaps are subject to market risks that may cause their price to fluctuate over time. Risks of the Fund include Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk, Inverse Risk, Market Risk, Counterparty Risk, Rebalancing Risk, Intra-Day Investment Risk, Daily Index Correlation Risk, Other Investment Companies (including ETFs) Risk, and risks specific to the securities of the Underlying Stock and the sector in which it operates. These and other risks can be found in the prospectus. Investing in physical commodities, including through commodity-linked derivative instruments such as Commodity Futures, Commodity Swaps, as well as other commodity-linked instruments, is speculative and can be extremely volatile and may not be suitable for all investors. Market prices of commodities may fluctuate rapidly based on numerous factors, including: changes in supply and demand relationships (whether actual, perceived, anticipated, unanticipated or unrealized); weather; agriculture; trade; domestic and foreign political and economic events and policies; diseases; pestilence; technological developments; currency exchange rate fluctuations; and monetary and other governmental policies, action and inaction. A liquid secondary market may not exist for the types of commodity-linked derivative instruments the Fund buys, which may make it difficult for the Fund to sell them at an acceptable price. The Fund is new with no operating history. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Fund will grow to or maintain an economically viable size, in which case it could ultimately liquidate. Derivatives may be more sensitive to changes in market conditions and may amplify risks and losses. This information is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy shares of any Funds to any person in any jurisdiction in which an offer, solicitation, purchase or sale would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. Please consult your tax advisor about the tax consequences of an investment in Fund shares, including the possible application of foreign, state, and local tax laws. You could lose money by investing in the ETFs. There can be no assurance that the investment objective of the Funds will be achieved. None of the Funds should be relied upon as a complete investment program.

PRINCIPAL FUND RISKS (see the Prospectus for more information) GraniteShares Leveraged Long and Inverse Daily ETFs are not suitable for all investors. The funds seek daily leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. The funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives, which means that the funds are riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage because the fund magnifies the performance of the underlying security. The volatility of the underlying security may affect the fund return as much as, or more than, the return of the underlying security. Investors who do not understand the Funds, or do not intend to actively manage their funds and monitor their investments, should not buy the Funds. The Funds are designed to be utilized only by traders and sophisticated investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily inverse and/or leveraged investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and/or short sales and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Funds will lose money if the underlying stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Funds will lose money even if the underlying stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The Funds track the price of a single stock rather than an index, eliminating the benefits of diversification that most mutual funds and exchange-traded funds offer. Although the Funds will be listed and traded on an exchange, an investment in a Fund may not be suitable for every investor. The Funds pose risks that are unique and complex.

June 26, 2025 17:45 ET | Source: GraniteShares GraniteShares NEW YORK, June 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GraniteShares has announced it will execute a forward share split for the GraniteShares 2x Long PLTR (the “Fund”). The total market value of the shares outstanding will not be affected as a result of these splits. After the close of the markets on July 08, 2025 (the “Payable Date”), the Fund will effect a forward split of its issued and outstanding shares as follows: As a result of the share split, shareholders of the Fund will receive fifteen shares for each share held as indicated in the table above. Accordingly, the number of the Fund’s issued and outstanding shares will increase by the approximate percentage indicated above. The ticker and CUSIP will not be affected by the transaction. The share split will apply to shareholders of record as of the close of the NASDAQ Stock Market (the “NASDAQ”) on July 08, 2025 (the “Record Date”), payable after the close of the NASDAQ on the Payable Date. Shares of the Funds will begin trading on the NASDAQ on a split-adjusted basis on July 09, 2025 (the “Ex-Date”). On the Ex-Date, the opening market value of the Fund’s issued and outstanding shares, and thus a shareholder’s investment value, will not be affected by the share split. However, the per share net asset value (“NAV”) and opening market price on the Ex-Date will be approximately one-fifteenth. The table below illustrates the effect of a hypothetical fifteen-for-one split on a shareholder’s investment. 15-for-1 forward split About GraniteShares GraniteShares is an independent ETF issuer headquartered in New York City. GraniteShares offers the following leveraged single stock ETFs: In addition, GraniteShares’ ETF suite includes the following ETFs: (1) GraniteShares Advisors LLC has contractually agreed to waive its fees and/or pay for operating expenses of the Fund to ensure that total annual fund operating expenses (exclusive of any (i) interest, (ii) brokerage fees and commission, (iii) acquired fund fees and expenses, (iv) fees and expenses associated with instruments in other collective investment vehicles or derivative instruments (including for example options and swap fees and expenses), (v) interest and dividend expense on short sales, (vi) taxes, (vii) other fees related to underlying investments (such as option fees and expenses or swap fees and expenses), (viii) expenses incurred in connection with any merger or reorganization or (ix) extraordinary expenses such as litigation) will not exceed 1.15%. This agreement is effective until December 31, 2025, and it may be terminated before that date only by the Trust’s Board of Trustees. GraniteShares Advisors LLC may request recoupment of previously waived fees and paid expenses from the Fund for three years from the date such fees and expenses were waived or paid, if such reimbursement will not cause the Fund’s total expense ratio to exceed the expense limitation in place at the time of the waiver and/or expense payment and the expense limitation in place at the time of the recoupment.(2) Estimated total cost in the absence of fee waiver or reimbursement.Contact Information:William Rhind, CEOGraniteShares Inc+1 646 876 5049william.rhind@graniteshares.com Important Information Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the GraniteShares funds (the “Funds”) carefully before investing.

There can be no assurance that an active trading market for shares in a Fund will develop or be maintained. Shares may trade above or below NAV. Brokerage commissions will apply. Fund Risks Multiple funds have a limited operating history of less than a year and risks associated with a new fund. The Leveraged and Daily Inverse Funds are not suitable for all investors. The investment program of the funds is speculative, entails substantial risks and include asset classes and investment techniques not employed by most ETFs and mutual funds. Investments in the ETFs are not bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged (2X) or daily inverse (-1X and -2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Fund will lose money even if the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The funds do not directly invest in the underlying stock. The Funds seek daily inverse or leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. Each Fund with “Long” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the respective long leveraged multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each a Leveraged Long Fund). Each Fund with “Short” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the inverse (or opposite) multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each an Inverse Fund). Investors should note that the Long Leveraged Funds and the Daily Inverse Funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives and daily inverse investment objectives (respectively), which means that the fund is riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage and inverse strategies because the fund magnifies the performance of their underlying security. The volatility of the underlying security may affect a Funds' return as much as, or more than, the return of the underlying security. For the Leveraged Long Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. For the Daily Inverse Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from -100% and 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period.

Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions and frequent trading may incur brokerage costs that detract significantly from investment returns.

June 26, 2025 17:45 ET | Source: GraniteShares GraniteShares NEW YORK, June 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GraniteShares has announced it will execute a forward share split for the GraniteShares 2x Long PLTR (the “Fund”). The total market value of the shares outstanding will not be affected as a result of these splits. After the close of the markets on July 08, 2025 (the “Payable Date”), the Fund will effect a forward split of its issued and outstanding shares as follows: As a result of the share split, shareholders of the Fund will receive fifteen shares for each share held as indicated in the table above. Accordingly, the number of the Fund’s issued and outstanding shares will increase by the approximate percentage indicated above. The ticker and CUSIP will not be affected by the transaction. The share split will apply to shareholders of record as of the close of the NASDAQ Stock Market (the “NASDAQ”) on July 08, 2025 (the “Record Date”), payable after the close of the NASDAQ on the Payable Date. Shares of the Funds will begin trading on the NASDAQ on a split-adjusted basis on July 09, 2025 (the “Ex-Date”). On the Ex-Date, the opening market value of the Fund’s issued and outstanding shares, and thus a shareholder’s investment value, will not be affected by the share split. However, the per share net asset value (“NAV”) and opening market price on the Ex-Date will be approximately one-fifteenth. The table below illustrates the effect of a hypothetical fifteen-for-one split on a shareholder’s investment. 15-for-1 forward split About GraniteShares GraniteShares is an independent ETF issuer headquartered in New York City.

There can be no assurance that an active trading market for shares in a Fund will develop or be maintained. Shares may trade above or below NAV. Brokerage commissions will apply. Fund Risks Multiple funds have a limited operating history of less than a year and risks associated with a new fund. The Leveraged and Daily Inverse Funds are not suitable for all investors. The investment program of the funds is speculative, entails substantial risks and include asset classes and investment techniques not employed by most ETFs and mutual funds. Investments in the ETFs are not bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged (2X) or daily inverse (-1X and -2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Fund will lose money even if the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The funds do not directly invest in the underlying stock. The Funds seek daily inverse or leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. Each Fund with “Long” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the respective long leveraged multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each a Leveraged Long Fund). Each Fund with “Short” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the inverse (or opposite) multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each an Inverse Fund). Investors should note that the Long Leveraged Funds and the Daily Inverse Funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives and daily inverse investment objectives (respectively), which means that the fund is riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage and inverse strategies because the fund magnifies the performance of their underlying security. The volatility of the underlying security may affect a Funds' return as much as, or more than, the return of the underlying security. For the Leveraged Long Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. For the Daily Inverse Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from -100% and 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance decreases over a period longer than a single day. Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the ETF. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue or remain unchanged. Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions and frequent trading may incur brokerage costs that detract significantly from investment returns. An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund is non-diversified and includes risks associated with the Fund concentrating its investments in a particular industry, sector, or geographic region which can result in increased volatility. The use of derivatives such as futures contracts and swaps are subject to market risks that may cause their price to fluctuate over time. Risks of the Fund include Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk, Inverse Risk, Market Risk, Counterparty Risk, Rebalancing Risk, Intra-Day Investment Risk, Daily Index Correlation Risk, Other Investment Companies (including ETFs) Risk, and risks specific to the securities of the Underlying Stock and the sector in which it operates. These and other risks can be found in the prospectus. Investing in physical commodities, including through commodity-linked derivative instruments such as Commodity Futures, Commodity Swaps, as well as other commodity-linked instruments, is speculative and can be extremely volatile and may not be suitable for all investors. Market prices of commodities may fluctuate rapidly based on numerous factors, including: changes in supply and demand relationships (whether actual, perceived, anticipated, unanticipated or unrealized); weather; agriculture; trade; domestic and foreign political and economic events and policies; diseases; pestilence; technological developments; currency exchange rate fluctuations; and monetary and other governmental policies, action and inaction. A liquid secondary market may not exist for the types of commodity-linked derivative instruments the Fund buys, which may make it difficult for the Fund to sell them at an acceptable price. The Fund is new with no operating history. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Fund will grow to or maintain an economically viable size, in which case it could ultimately liquidate. Derivatives may be more sensitive to changes in market conditions and may amplify risks and losses. This information is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy shares of any Funds to any person in any jurisdiction in which an offer, solicitation, purchase or sale would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. Please consult your tax advisor about the tax consequences of an investment in Fund shares, including the possible application of foreign, state, and local tax laws. You could lose money by investing in the ETFs. There can be no assurance that the investment objective of the Funds will be achieved. None of the Funds should be relied upon as a complete investment program.

PRINCIPAL FUND RISKS (see the Prospectus for more information) GraniteShares Leveraged Long and Inverse Daily ETFs are not suitable for all investors. The funds seek daily leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. The funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives, which means that the funds are riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage because the fund magnifies the performance of the underlying security.

Investors who do not understand the Funds, or do not intend to actively manage their funds and monitor their investments, should not buy the Funds. The Funds are designed to be utilized only by traders and sophisticated investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily inverse and/or leveraged investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and/or short sales and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Funds will lose money if the underlying stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Funds will lose money even if the underlying stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The Funds track the price of a single stock rather than an index, eliminating the benefits of diversification that most mutual funds and exchange-traded funds offer. Although the Funds will be listed and traded on an exchange, an investment in a Fund may not be suitable for every investor. The Funds pose risks that are unique and complex.

Title: Why AI Illiterate Directors Are The New Liability For Boards Today

BySteven Wolfe Pereira BySteven Wolfe Pereira, Contributor. Twenty-three years after Sarbanes-Oxley mandated financial experts on audit committees, boards face an even more transformative moment. But unlike the post-Enron era when adding one qualified financial expert sufficed, the AI revolution demands something far more radical: every director must become AI literate, or risk becoming a liability in the intelligence age. I just came back for the Stanford Directors’ College, the premier executive education program for directors and senior executives of publicly traded firms. Now in its thirtieth year, this year’s speakers included Reed Hastings, (Chairman, Co-Founder & Former CEO, Netflix; Director, Anthropic), Michael Sentonas (President, Crowdstrike), Maggie Wilderotter (Chairman, Docusign; Director, Costco, Fortinet and Sana Biotechnology), John Donahoe (Former CEO, Nike, ServiceNow, and eBay; Former Chairman, PayPal) and Condoleezza Rice (Director, Hoover Institution; Former U.S. Secretary of State). Organized by Stanford Law Professor Joseph Grundfest and the Co-Executive Director of Stanford’s Rock Center for Corporate Governance Amanda Packel, the program addresses a broad range of problems that confront modern boards. The topics are extensive, including the board’s role in setting business strategy, CEO and board succession, crisis management, techniques for controlling legal liability, challenges posed by activist investors, boardroom dynamics, international trade issues, the global economy, and cybersecurity threats. However, the topic that everyone wanted to discuss was AI. Joseph A. Grundfest, (Co-Director, Stanford Directors’ College; W.A. Franke Professor of Law and ... More Business, Emeritus, Stanford Law School; Senior Faculty, Rock Center for Corporate Governance), interviews the AI-savvy Reed Hastings (Chairman, Co-Founder & Former CEO, Netflix; Director, Anthropic) at the 2025 Stanford Directors' College. The stakes couldn’t be higher. While traditional boards debate AI risks in quarterly meetings, a new breed of AI-first competitors operates at algorithmic speed. Consider Cursor, which reached $500 million in annual recurring revenue with just 60 employees, or Cognition Labs, valued at $4 billion with only 10 people. These aren’t just “unicorns”, they’re the harbingers of a fundamental shift in how AI-first businesses operate. After Enron’s collapse, the Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) act required boards to include at least one "qualified financial expert" who understood GAAP, financial statements, and internal controls. Companies either complied or publicly explained why they lacked such expertise—a powerful mechanism that transformed board composition within five years. Today’s AI challenge dwarfs that financial literacy mandate. Unlike accounting expertise that could be compartmentalized to audit committees, AI permeates every business function. When algorithms make thousands of decisions daily across marketing, operations, HR, and customer service, delegating oversight to a single "tech expert" becomes not just inadequate but dangerous. The data reveals a governance crisis in motion. According to ISS analysis, only 31% of S&P 500 companies disclosed any board oversight of AI in 2024 and a mere 11% reported explicit full board or committee oversight. This despite an 84% year-over-year increase in such disclosures, suggesting boards are scrambling to catch up. Institutional investors have moved from encouragement to enforcement. BlackRock’s 2025 proxy voting guidelines emphasize board composition must reflect necessary "experiences, perspectives, and skillsets," with explicit warnings about voting against directors at companies that are "outliers compared to market norms." Vanguard and State Street have issued similar guidance, while Glass Lewis added a new AI governance section to its 2025 policies. Large institutional investors, such as BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street, have varying policies ... More on board oversight of material risks and are now looking at AI governance. The enforcement mechanism? Universal proxy cards, mandatory since September 2022, enable surgical strikes against individual directors. Activists launched 243 campaigns in 2024 (the highest total since 2018’s record of 249 campaigns), with technology sector campaigns up 15.9% year-over-year. Boards with "skills gaps related to areas where the company is underperforming" face the highest vulnerability - and nothing screams skills gap louder than AI illiteracy while competitors automate core functions. Consider what happened in 2024: 27 CEOs resigned due to activist pressure, up from 24 in 2023 and well above the four-year average of 16. The percentage of S&P 500 CEO resignations linked to activist activity has tripled since 2020. The message is clear: governance failures have consequences, and AI governance represents the next frontier for activist campaigns. Here’s the scenario keeping forward-thinking directors awake: while your board debates whether to form an AI committee, a three-person startup with 100+ AI agents is systematically capturing your market share. This isn’t hyperbole. In legal services, AI achieves 100x productivity gains, reducing document review from 16 hours to 3-4 minutes. Harvey AI raised $300 million at a $3 billion valuation, while Crosby promises contract review in under an hour. In software development, companies report 60% faster cycle times and 50% fewer production errors. Salesforce aims to deploy one billion AI agents within 12 months, with each agent costing $2 per conversation versus human customer service representatives. The economics are devastating for traditional business models. AI-first companies operate with 80-95% lower operational costs while achieving comparable or superior output. They reach $100 million in annual recurring revenue in 12-18 months versus the traditional 5-10 years. When Cursor generates nearly a billion lines of working code daily, traditional software companies' armies of developers become competitive liabilities, not assets. Boards accustomed to delegating technology oversight to CIOs or audit committees face a rude awakening. Traditional IT governance focuses on infrastructure, cybersecurity, and compliance (the "what" of technology management). AI governance requires understanding the “should” - whether AI capabilities should be deployed, how they impact stakeholders, and what ethical boundaries must be maintained. The fundamental difference: IT systems follow rules; AI systems learn and evolve. When Microsoft’s Tay chatbot learned toxic behavior from social media in 2016, it wasn’t a coding error, it was a governance failure. When COMPAS sentencing software showed racial bias, it wasn’t a bug but rather inadequate board oversight of algorithmic decision-making. Stanford’s Institute for Human-Centered AI research confirms that AI governance can't be delegated like financial oversight. AI creates "network effects" where individual algorithms interact unpredictably. Traditional governance assumes isolated systems; AI governance must address systemic risks from interconnected algorithms making real-time decisions across the enterprise. Just as SOX created demand for Qualified Financial Experts (QFEs), the AI revolution is spawning a new designation: Qualified Technology Experts (QTEs). The market dynamics favor early movers. Spencer Stuart’s 2024 Board Index shows 16% of new S&P 500 independent directors brought digital/technology transformation expertise versus only 8% with traditional P&L leadership. The scarcity is acute: requiring both technology expertise and prior board experience creates a severe talent shortage. This presents both risk and opportunity. For incumbent directors, AI illiteracy becomes a liability targetable by activists. For business-savvy technology leaders or tech-savvy business leaders, board service offers unprecedented opportunities. As one search consultant noted, “Technology roles offer pathways for underrepresented groups to join boards” - diversity through capability rather than tokenism. The SEC has elevated AI to a top 2025 examination priority, with enforcement actions against companies making false AI claims. Former SEC Chair Gary Gentler’s warning that "false claims about AI hurt investors and undermine market integrity" was just the beginning about concerns about the rise of “AI washing,” or exaggerating and misrepresenting the use of AI. The Commission sent comments to 56 companies regarding AI disclosures, with 61% requesting clarification on AI usage and risks. The SEC is increasing concerned about "AI washing" and AI disclosures Internationally, the EU AI Act establishes the world’s first comprehensive AI regulatory framework, with board-level accountability requirements taking effect through 2026. Like GDPR, its extraterritorial reach affects global companies. Hong Kong’s Monetary Authority already requires board accountability for AI-driven decisions, while New York's Department of Financial Services mandates AI risk oversight for insurance companies. The pattern is unmistakable: just as Enron triggered SOX, AI governance failures will trigger mandatory expertise requirements. The only question is whether boards act proactively or wait for the next scandal to force their hand. The data reveals a dangerous disconnect. While nearly 70% of directors trust management’s AI execution skills, only 50% feel adequately informed about AI-related risks. Worse, almost 50% of boards haven’t discussed AI in the past year despite mounting stakeholder pressure. While many academic institutions and trade orgs are trying to fill this need, these traditional director education models (including annual conferences and occasional briefings) can’t match the exponential speed of AI’s evolution. Boards need continuous learning mechanisms, regular AI strategy sessions, and direct access to expertise. The parallels to Sarbanes-Oxley are instructive but incomplete. Financial literacy requirements responded to past failures; AI literacy requirements must anticipate future transformation. When three-person startups with AI agent swarms can outcompete thousand-employee corporations, traditional governance models aren’t ready for these existential threats. The window for proactive adaptation is closing rapidly. ISS tracks AI governance. Institutional investors demand it. Activists target its absence. Regulators prepare mandates. Most critically, AI-native competitors exploit governance gaps with algorithmic efficiency. For boards, the choice is stark: develop AI literacy now while you can shape your approach, or scramble to catch up after activists, regulators, or competitors force your hand. In the post-Enron era, boards asked, "Do we have a qualified financial expert?" In the AI era, the question becomes, "Is every director AI literate?" The answer will determine not just governance quality but corporate survival. Because in a world where algorithms drive business, directors who can’t govern AI can't govern at all.

Title: CoreWeave revives bid for Core Scientific causing shares to surge 33%

CORZ shares jumped nearly 34% on intraday fueled by the acquisition rumors. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. CoreWeave is negotiating to acquire Bitcoin (BTC) miner-turned-compute host Core Scientific, the Wall Street Journal reported on June 26, citing people familiar with the matter. The cloud infrastructure company attempted to acquire the miner for $5.75 per share in June 2024 but withdrew after Core Scientific’s board deemed the price inadequate. Core Scientific and CoreWeave have not issued public statements on the negotiations. Core Scientific’s CORZ stock was trading at $16.44 as of press time, up 33.7% on the session and more than 3x from last year’s proposal. The rally followed a year-to-date slide of about 15% that left the miner trading well below the all-time high it set after emerging from bankruptcy protection in January. CoreWeave, which went public in March with a $75 billion capitalization, lists Microsoft as its largest customer, accounting for 62% of 2024 revenue, and rents Nvidia GPUs to corporate clients that include Meta Platforms and IBM. Executives at Core Scientific dismissed last year’s $1 billion overture as “unsolicited” and below intrinsic value, then signed 12-year hosting agreements that commit the miner to deliver 200 megawatts (MW) of power for CoreWeave’s high-performance-computing clusters. Board members stated at the time that the arrangement would generate approximately $3.5 billion in cumulative revenue and help diversify income away from block subsidies after the April 2024 Bitcoin halving. Core Scientific already hosts 16 MW of CoreWeave GPUs at its Austin campus, and plans staged expansions across several sites in Texas and Oklahoma. The parties allegedly aim to finalize terms within weeks if talks stay on track, the sources said. Yet, neither side disclosed price parameters. Core Scientific’s rapid pivot toward AI infrastructure, combined with a power-constrained data-center market, could justify a premium well above the miner’s undisturbed value, bankers following the situation noted. CoreWeave CEO Mike Intrator seeks to expand capacity to meet the cloud-AI demand that exceeds current inventory across hyperscale providers. Core Scientific controls about 724 megawatts of contracted power across its US footprint and ranks among North America’s top owners of immersion-cooled mining rigs. The miner’s ability to repurpose part of that load for GPU computing aligns with CoreWeave’s push to secure low-cost electricity and ready-built shells, avoiding multiyear greenfield construction. If negotiations succeed, CoreWeave will absorb a fleet of Bitmain S21-class miners and a pipeline of brownfield sites that can flip to GPU racks. Core Scientific shareholders would receive cash or stock at a yet-to-be-determined ratio.

Title: Grads facing tough job market

WASHINGTON — While completing a master’s degree in data analysis, Palwasha Zahid moved from Dallas to a town near Silicon Valley. The location made it easy to visit the campuses of tech stalwarts such as Google, Apple, and Nvidia. Zahid, 25, completed her studies in December, but so far she hasn’t found a job in the industry that surrounds her. “It stings a little bit,” she said. “I never imagined it would be this difficult just to get a foot in the door.” Young people graduating from college this spring and summer are facing one of the toughest job markets in more than a decade. The unemployment rate for degree holders ages 22 to 27 has reached its highest level in a dozen years, excluding the coronavirus pandemic. Joblessness among that group is now higher than the overall unemployment rate, and the gap is larger than it has been in more than three decades. The rise in unemployment has worried many economists as well as officials at the Federal Reserve because it could be an early sign of trouble for the economy. It suggests businesses are holding off on hiring new workers because of rampant uncertainty stemming from the Trump administration’s tariff increases, which could slow growth. “Young people are bearing the brunt of a lot of economic uncertainty,” Brad Hersbein, senior economist at the Upjohn Institute, a labor-focused think tank, said. “The people that you often are most hesitant in hiring when economic conditions are uncertain are entry-level positions.” The growth of artificial intelligence may be playing an additional role by eating away at positions for beginners in white-collar professions such as information technology, finance, and law. Higher unemployment for younger graduates has also renewed concerns about the value of a college degree. More workers than ever have a four-year degree, which makes it less of a distinguishing factor in job applications. Murat Tasci, an economist at JPMorgan, calculates that 45% of workers have a four-year degree, up from 26% in 1992. While the difficulty of finding work has demoralized young people like Zahid, most economists argue that holding a college degree still offers clear lifetime benefits. Graduates earn higher pay and experience much less unemployment over their lifetimes. The overall U.S. unemployment rate is a still-low 4.2%, and the government’s monthly jobs reports show the economy is generating modest job gains. But the additional jobs are concentrated in health care, government, and restaurants and hotels. Job gains in professions with more college grads, such as information technology, legal services, and accounting have languished in the past 12 months. The unemployment rate has stayed low mostly because layoffs are still relatively rare. The actual hiring rate — new hires as a percentage of all jobs — has fallen to 2014 levels, when the unemployment rate was much higher, at 6.2%. Economists call it a no-hire, no-fire economy. For college graduates 22 to 27 years old, the unemployment rate was 5.8% in March — the highest, excluding the pandemic, since 2012, and far above the nationwide rate. Artificial intelligence could be a culprit, particularly in IT. Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, has calculated that employment for college graduates 28 and above in computer science and mathematical occupations has increased a slight 0.8% since 2022. For those ages 22 to 27, it has fallen 8%, according to Martin. Company announcements have further fueled concerns. Tobi Lutke, CEO of online commerce software company Shopify, said in an April memo that before requesting new hires, “teams must demonstrate why they cannot get what they want done using AI.” Last week, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said AI would likely reduce the company’s corporate workforce over the next few years. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” Jassy said in a message to employees. “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.”

Editor Economy Colin Todhunter, OffGuardian They don’t sell seeds. They don’t own tractors. They don’t run warehouses or ship grain. But BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street are among the most powerful actors in global agriculture. Together, these three asset managers control more than $26 trillion in assets—more than the GDP of the United States and India combined. They are shareholders in nearly every major agribusiness: Bayer, Cargill, ADM, Nestlé, Deere & Co and more. They don’t compete. They co-own. And through that ownership, they govern. This is not capitalism as competition. It’s capitalism as quiet coordination. These firms don’t need to dictate policy. They shape the terrain on which policy is made. Their influence is structural, not spectacular. It’s exercised through boardrooms, shareholder resolutions and capital flows. And it’s largely invisible to the public. But its effects are everywhere. According to the Food Barons 2022 report by ETC Group, BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street hold dominant stakes across the agrifood chain—from seeds and chemicals to supermarkets and logistics platforms. In many sectors, they are the top three shareholders in all the major firms. This means that ‘competition’ between companies like Bayer and Syngenta, or Nestlé and PepsiCo, is often little more than a performance. The real power sits behind the curtain. These firms don’t micromanage. They don’t need to. Their power lies in alignment—in shaping what counts as value, what counts as risk and what counts as acceptable behaviour. And increasingly, that behaviour is being framed through the lens of ESG: Environmental, Social and Governance metrics. But ESG is not a moral compass. It’s a risk framework. In recent years, BlackRock and its peers have positioned themselves as climate-conscious investors. They speak of ‘net zero’, ‘transition finance’, and ‘sustainable agriculture’. But this is not about decarbonising the food system. It’s about de-risking portfolios. The same firms that invest in fossil fuels also invest in carbon offset schemes. The same firms that back industrial agriculture also fund ‘climate-smart’ seed technologies. It’s a hedging strategy, not a transformation. And in India, this logic is taking root. Asset managers are increasingly backing land-leasing platforms, agrifintech startups and carbon credit aggregators that promise to ‘unlock value’ from farmland. But unlocking value often means locking farmers into new forms of dependency—on scoring systems, digital compliance and speculative markets they don’t control. This is not investment. It’s extraction with a sustainability label. The most dangerous shift in agriculture today is not technological—it’s financial. Land is no longer just a place to grow food. It’s an asset class. A hedge against inflation. A site for data capture and carbon speculation. In this model, the farmer is not a producer. They are a tenant on someone else’s spreadsheet. And the spreadsheet is global. BlackRock doesn’t need to own the land. It just needs to own the firm that owns the firm that leases the land. Through layers of investment vehicles, farmland is being bundled, securitised and traded—often without the knowledge of those who live on it. This is enclosure without fences. Governance without government. Asset managers like to present themselves as passive investors. They claim they don’t direct company strategy—they just follow the market. But when you own 5–10 per cent of every major firm in a sector, you are the market. And when you vote on shareholder resolutions, appoint board members and shape executive pay, you are not passive. In 2023, BlackRock and Vanguard voted against resolutions that would have required agribusinesses to disclose their impacts on deforestation and land rights. Their justification? The proposals were “too prescriptive”. But what they were really protecting was the freedom to operate without scrutiny. What makes BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street so dangerous is not that they are evil. It’s that they are structural. They don’t need to conspire. Their incentives are aligned. Their tools are abstract. And their power is exercised through absence—of regulation, of transparency, of accountability. They are not the villains of this story. They are the architecture. And that makes them harder to fight. Food sovereignty is not just about seeds or soil. It’s about power. And power today is financial. It flows through indexes, benchmarks and capital allocations. It decides which crops are grown, which firms survive, and which futures are funded. And it does so without ever touching the soil.

Researchers calculate that tokenized RWAs, excluding stablecoins, expanded from roughly $5 billion in 2022 to more than $24 billion by June 2025, an 85% year-over-year increase that positions the sector as crypto’s fastest-growing vertical after dollar-pegged tokens. Private credit drives the total with $14 billion outstanding, while tokenized US Treasury vehicles contribute about $7.5 billion, according to rwa.xyz dashboards embedded in the study. The report modeled several adoption curves and concluded that capturing 10 to 30% of global securities and alternative assets between 2030 and 2034 would bring the on-chain figure closer to the $16 trillion to $30 trillion range. The report stated that BlackRock, JPMorgan, Franklin Templeton, and Apollo now issue production-scale funds on public blockchains, signaling that tokenization has progressed from proof of concept to live deployment in under two years. Yield-bearing Treasury tokens, rebasing share classes, and leveraged private credit loops on Morpho and Kamino demonstrate how decentralized finance (DeFi) rails create new distribution channels and liquidity venues for traditionally illiquid instruments. RedStone argued that accurate pricing hinges on oracle architectures that merge net-asset-value snapshots, regulatory attestations, and illiquidity discounts, a framework that departs from the real-time spot feeds common in DeFi. Gauntlet models indicated that private credit could surpass $250 billion on-chain once tokenized loan origination reaches 5% of the $3 trillion global market. In comparison, Treasury-bill tokens could exceed $1 trillion if asset managers allocate 2% of short-duration funds to blockchain rails. The authors forecasted that programmable compliance layers, such as Securitize’s sToken, and increasing regulatory clarity in the United States, Europe, and Asia would enable pension funds and insurers to allocate directly to tokenized products, broadening the addressable base beyond crypto-native capital. RedStone plans to update the market-size tracker quarterly and add live oracle metrics for on-chain RWA indices. At the same time, Gauntlet will release risk-parameter adjustments for leveraged vaults tied to private credit pools. The consortium will host further briefings at the RWA Summit in Cannes on July 1, where it will publish granular inflow data and the methodology underpinning its $30 trillion upper-bound model. The report identified the current $24 billion footprint as roughly 0.006% of the $400 trillion in traditional assets but contends that institutional issuance velocity and programmable settlement advantages justify a $30 trillion scenario within nine years.

Title: Black Friday Email Marketing Strategy: 10 Tips and Examples (2025) - Shopify Ireland

Black Friday is one of the biggest sales events of the year. Last year, Shopify merchants drove a record-breaking $11.5 billion in sales during the Black Friday Cyber Monday (BFCM) weekend. With so many consumers open to shopping during the holiday weekend, leaning on tried and tested marketing channels can open the floodgates to more revenue in the fourth quarter. For many retailers, that’s email marketing. Email is the third-most influential channel on holiday purchase decisions, beating influencer endorsements, in-person experiences, and conversations with retail associates in-store. But when so many retailers rely on this direct line of communication to promote holiday sales, it’s difficult to stand out in a subscriber’s crowded inbox. This guide shares innovative Black Friday email marketing strategies to try this year, with best practices and examples from leading retailers. Customer data is the most valuable asset any ecommerce business has. It allows you to tailor email outreach and deliver on customers’ expectations for a personalized shopping experience. Yet 85% of internet users want to do more to protect their online privacy, meaning this strategy can be difficult to implement. Before the holiday season arrives, take stock of the customer data you currently have. If your email list is small or you don’t have supplementary information to personalize campaigns to existing subscribers, deploy lead generation campaigns to gather more holiday season customer data. For example: Because Shopify offers a customer data platform (CDP) by default, any first-party data you’ve collected on your customers gets combined in a unified customer profile. Whenever they share their email address or phone number, this data—such as their order history, loyalty points they’ve earned, previous emails they’ve opened, and/or customer service tickets they’ve raised—all funnel back to one place, giving you one source of truth for every shopper. Black Friday might only last one day, but consumers are still open to making holiday purchases in the run up to the big event. Klaviyo found that more than half of consumers think a month earlier than November is the ideal time for brands to initiate their holiday shopping season sales. Most retailers start seeding their Black Friday email promotions 21 days before the big event—a strategy dubbed “Black November,” which includes other holiday shopping dates: The majority of consumers look for discounts and sales during this period—so much so, 7 in 10 consider price the top factor in their holiday purchase decisions, beating quality (61%), variety (34%), and warranties or returns policies (31%). Take advantage of consumers’ openness to pre-Black Friday promotions by creating a holiday calendar. Perhaps you give your email list early access to your sale, or build hype around a new product drop by teasing it to subscribers, with an automated series like this: Not all holiday shoppers are the same. Some might be looking for gifts for a loved one—others might want to take advantage of a hefty discount to buy a product that’s been on their wishlist for months. Segmentation allows you to identify these buyer preferences and deliver personalized Black Friday email marketing campaigns. Key Black Friday customer segments to email include: Customers who’ve visited your New Orleans store within the last six months, for instance, could receive an email that invites them to your retail store’s exclusive holiday sale which starts two days before Black Friday. Yet instead of relying solely on historical data to forecast each segment’s next steps, lean on predictive analytics. These tools digest large datasets using machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to accurately predict what a customer will do next. 💡Tip: Shopify’s segmentation features pull data from unified customer profiles to group customers based on qualities they share. Choose from prebuilt segment templates, or build your own with the ShopifyQL query editor. All segments are dynamic—subscribers will move in and out of segments automatically when data from their unified profile changes. Segmentation isn’t the only way to personalize emails around the Black Friday weekend. Dynamic content blocks adjust smaller sections of your email, instead of sending the same email to everyone who fits your segmentation criteria. Let’s say, for example, that you’ve defined a segment of VIP customers to target during Black Friday. Subscribers have one thing in common—they have a customer lifetime value of over $500—but they don’t all share the same buying behaviors. Some have saved the loyalty rewards they’ve earned—others have made a portion of their purchases in-store. Further personalize the Black Friday emails that each subscriber in this segment receives with dynamic content blocks. That could be: Black Friday sales are effective because they’re exclusive—either in terms of product quantity (for example, a limited amount of inventory) or because the promotion ends at a specific time. Lean into this time sensitivity and encourage Black Friday subscribers to take advantage now rather than later. This scarcity can induce the fear of missing out, a psychological phenomenon that influences people to buy even when they didn’t intend on doing so. Effective marketing techniques to create urgency in your Black Friday emails include: reMarkable, for example, has a countdown timer in their email to announce Black Friday is ending. It offers visual representation of when the deal ends, instead of just a generic “Sale ends tonight!” message. Email inboxes are a crowded place to be at the best of times—never mind on Black Friday, when every retailer wants to capitalize on consumers’ willingness to buy. Email marketing platform Omnisend processed 1.13 billion emails in the week surrounding BFCM. Klaviyo reported similar figures: at its peak, merchants sent 420 million messages in a single hour on Black Friday. An email subject line is the first thing that subscribers see when your campaign lands in their inbox. A best practice is to split-test strategies such as: Here are some real examples that incorporate these best practices and stood out to me during the Black Friday weekend last year: Promotions and flash drops can incentivize holiday shoppers to make impulsive purchases. Remove the biggest barrier to them doing so—finding the money to pay for their order—by offering buy now, pay later (BNPL). During the BFCM weekend last year, consumers spent over $686.3 million on BNPL purchases, up 8.8% from the year before. Of those who have used this type of service, almost a third say they’d be more likely to spend money on discretionary goods if the retailer offered BNPL as an option. Shop Pay Installments offers an easy way to add BNPL options at checkout. Customers can choose to divide their purchases into smaller, more manageable installments. Combined with Shop Pay, the best-converting checkout on the internet, it’s no surprise that Shop Pay Installments has been proven to reduce cart abandonment by 28% and increase average order value by as much as 50%. Email might be the only direct line of communication you have with Black Friday customers, but it’s not the only way to command their attention. SMS marketing is the easiest integration since most email marketing platforms, including Klaviyo, offer SMS integration as standard. For example, you could send an email campaign to a particular segment, then use SMS to follow up with those who haven’t yet redeemed the offer or opened the email. It’s an approach proven to get results: Klaviyo reports that merchants who integrated SMS into their Black Friday email marketing strategy experienced a 20% YoY increase in ecommerce revenue during BFCM, accounting for more than $100 million in gross merchandise value. Email can also complement paid advertising strategies as costs skyrocket throughout Black Friday season. Shopify Audiences builds custom retargeting lists to export to platforms like Meta, Google Ads, and TikTok. It’s helped merchants like Happy Hippo achieve a 4.7x return on ad spend (ROAS) while cutting customer acquisition costs (CAC) by 72%. “Shopify Audiences is a huge benefit for Plus merchants,” says CEO and lead product designer Adam Biel. “It has helped lower customer acquisition costs so our investments can stretch much further with Facebook ads.” Transactional emails tend to be overlooked when marketers attempt to compete with other retailers for attention during Black Friday. Yet they’re an opportunity to strengthen relationships with the customers you’ve already acquired. Comb through the automated emails you send as standard when customers complete a certain action. Here are some examples and ideas to optimize them: Black Friday, Cyber Monday regularly break records, but not all of them are good. Most customers acquired during BFCM have a lower lifetime value. This occurs partly because these customers were being opportunistic and taking advantage of your promotions, but also because your brand loses mindshare throughout the year. Design an email retention sequence to retain holiday shoppers after Black Friday ends. You could: 💡Tip: Shopify Flow takes the logistical hassle out of these holiday marketing automations. Work from prebuilt templates—such as inviting shoppers to your loyalty program when their unified customer profile meets specific criteria—or custom code your own. It’s easy to get caught up in the excitement of new promotions and segmentation strategies that turn email subscribers into paying customers—so much so, that retailers often forget the fundamentals. Here’s a quick reminder of the email optimization best practices to keep in mind while writing Black Friday emails: If you’re in the midst of a creative lull and are searching for ideas on how to make your Black Friday emails stand out, draw inspiration from these examples. Shoppers are especially prone to abandoning online carts in search of better Black Friday deals. This cart recovery email from Pulp & Press reminds each individual customer of the products they abandoned, with a reminder that it’s the biggest sale of the year—and that they should take advantage now, before the deal ends. Black Friday might be the biggest online sales event of the year, but it’s not always the most profitable. Discounts tend to lure in low-value customers who might only purchase from you when products are heavily discounted. Detox Market’s Black Friday email is a great example of how to combat this with tiered promotions. The more customers spend, the bigger the discount. Freaks of Nature leans into scarcity with their “almost gone” Black Friday email. The call to action button tells people to “secure” their shirt—more strategic than just “get yours today.” Plus, it uses price anchoring to showcase the before and after sale price of each bestseller. There are also direct checkout links for email subscribers to complete their purchases without searching the online store for the perfect item. It’s tempting to shout about your bestselling products or hefty discounts with innovative email designs. Home furnishings brand Revival takes a different approach. Instead, the brand shares a letter authored by their founder, which wishes them a wonderful holiday weekend with a gentle nudge to buy the item on their wishlist. The email also features a note beneath the sign-off that teases the following day’s email. This tactic can increase open rates during Black Friday—subscribers are already on the lookout for the campaign. With so much competition to reach your target market during Black Friday, leaning into your brand values can attract conscious consumers who care more about sticking to their morals than impressive discounts. Deodorant brand Fussy, for example, is a certified B-Corp that sells deodorants made with natural ingredients and refillable cases designed to reduce plastic waste. Their target audience cares about sustainability, hence why the retailer’s Black Friday email marketing strategy was to rename the event “Green Week.” Email marketing spans every stage of the customer journey, from aiding initial product discovery to encouraging customer retention. Shopify has everything you need to personalize this end-to-end experience, including unified customer profiles and segmentation to put your data to work. Plus, when holiday email campaigns drive record levels of website traffic, you don’t have to worry about outages or downtime. Shopify’s infrastructure handled over 57.3 PB of data, 1.19 trillion edge requests, and 10.5 trillion database queries during the last BFCM. It’s why leading brands like Represent, Knix, and Muscle Nation trust Shopify to capitalize on Black Friday sales. “Black Friday can be nerve-wracking,” says Stefan Lewis, chief digital officer at Represent. “But Shopify has always helped us in terms of increasing bandwidth and we’ve never run into any issues around site speed.” Black Friday Cyber Monday (BFCM) email is a marketing strategy where retailers reach their target customers through targeted emails. These holiday campaigns typically include promotions, sales, discounts, gift suggestions, and product recommendations. To write an effective Black Friday email, lead with a time-sensitive offer in the subject line and header. Use mobile-first design, highlight bestsellers or exclusives, and include urgency-driven CTAs like “get yours before it’s too late.” The best time to send Black Friday emails is in the runup to the big event. Most consumers start holiday gift shopping before Black Friday arrives. A pre-launch campaign can ensure your brand is top of mind when they’re ready to buy. Use targeted emails to announce a Black Friday sale. Divide your audience into segments based on traits they share, and include contextual recommendations—for example, discounts on products similar to those they’ve bought.

Title: Salesforce CEO Claims Half of the Company’s Work Is Now Done by AI
URL: https://gizmodo.com/salesforce-ceo-claims-half-of-the-companys-work-is-now-done-by-ai-2000620730

While many companies that went all in on AI have since pulled back, Salesforce is going full steam ahead. In an interview with Bloomberg, CEO Marc Benioff claimed that as much as 30% to 50% of the company’s work is now completed by AIâthough no word on how much of his role personally has been made redunant or how much of his $39.6 million in compensation that he’ll be giving up. âAll of us have to get our head around this idea that AI could do things that before, we were doing, and we can move on to do higher value work,â Benioff said. In the case of some of Salesforce’s employees, the whole “move on to do higher value work” thing will have to happen somewhere else. Earlier this year, the company announced that it was laying off 1,000 people. It also reportedly plans to hire another 1,000 who will be focused on selling the company’s own AI agent technology, Agentforce. Put another way, Salesforce is hiring real people to sell other companies on adopting AI to replace some of its human workforce, which certainly seems like it would be one of the ten plagues of late-stage capitalism. Benioff and Salesforce are far from the only firm that is signaling that they will push for the AI revolution, whether it’s ready or not. Earlier this month, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy sent a letter to employees talking up the use of generative AI across the company’s workflows, while slipping in a little note about how AI will lead to Amazon needing “fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today.” That seems to be the underlying message of much of tech’s embrace of AI: get ready for layoffs. Silicon Valley has gone from bragging about how many jobs it can create to bragging about how small it can shrink its workforce. Microsoft is in the midst of a second round of layoffs, per Fast Company, after already cutting its staff by 6,000 in May and shifting lots of money into AI investments. Other companies like Google and Bumble have been trimming people from departments within their firms, as well. According to Layoffs.fyi, the tech industry has laid off more than 63,000 workers in 2025 so far. Oftentimes, whether it’s made explicit or not, corporate adoption of AI is the underlying reason for the cuts. Brian Merchant, author of Blood in the Machine: The Origins of the Rebellion Against Big Tech, recently spoke with tech workers who have been affected by AI and found that the technology is reshaping jobs and workforces as a whole. An employee of CrowdStrike told Merchant that while the company positioned its recent layoff as cutting underperforming employees, many of them were new hires who the company decided were replaceable. “AI has literally killed many jobs at CrowdStrike this week.” Another at Dropbox said that their team that focused on improving the service’s reliability was let go in favor of promoting a new AI-powered tool. artificial intellienceLaborlayoffsmarc benioffSalesforce Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Starlink rival AST SpaceMobile is pitching its satellite-to-phone technology to US military groups, a sign that AST and SpaceX are poised to go head-to-head in competing for defense contracts. Texas-based AST SpaceMobile has already demonstrated that its giant satellites can power voice and video calls on consumer smartphones in cellular dead zones. But on Thursday, the company touted a successful demo of its technology for "tactical satellite communication" purposes. The demo, conducted in Hawaii, involved using AST's BlueBird satellites to beam communications to a Tactical Assault Kit (TAK), which is usually mapping-related software designed for military operations. TAK can also be installed on smartphones. "The field test showcased key defense-related use cases, including real-time connectivity to the Tactical Assault Kit (TAK) over a VPN, multimedia streaming via TAK, and secure multi-party video calls, all executed on standard, unmodified smartphones,” AST said in the announcement. Importantly, representatives from the US Navy, Marine Corps, Army, US Space Command, and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OUSD R&E) FutureG team attended the demo. AST currently only has five satellites in orbit when it needs between 45 to 60 for global coverage. Still, the company says the demo showed how its satellites can supply connectivity to phones configured for military purposes. "This was the first in a series of planned prototype demonstrations to evaluate space-based mobile broadband for defense applications, with additional testing, including over open ocean environments, planned in the coming months," AST said. The news also shows how the company will try to compete with SpaceX’s Starlink for defense funding, in addition to serving consumers through mobile carriers. SpaceX has already received millions from various governments for providing Starlink broadband access to military forces in Ukraine. The US Navy has also adopted Starlink across its fleet and bases. In AST’s case, the company has partnered with Maryland-based Fairwinds Technologies, which specializes in bringing commercial tech to military customers. In 2023, AST reached an agreement with Fairwinds to explore marketing the satellite technology to the military market. Earlier this year, AST also received a new $43 million contract from the US Space Development Agency under the US Space Force to help advance military communications. In the consumer market, SpaceX is offering its cellular Starlink system through T-Mobile, with the official launch scheduled for July 23. Following the ongoing free beta program, the add-on satellite connectivity will cost $10 per month for most consumers. AST has been working on its rival satellite service through partners AT&T and Verizon. The company is aiming to kick off its own beta early next year as it prepares to launch dozens of large satellites into Earth’s orbit. I've been working as a journalist for over 15 years—I got my start as a schools and cities reporter in Kansas City and joined PCMag in 2017.

AN ONLINE FUNDRAISER to cover the funeral expenses of a teenager who drowned in Co Meath has hit its target ahead of tomorrow’s service. Kofi Jackson Owusu, aged 15 and from the Blackrock area of Dundalk, Co Louth, died last Friday after getting into difficulty in the river Nanny in Laytown, Co Meath. It’s understood that he had jumped into the river with a number of other children from the footbridge in Laytown when he got into difficulty in the river. The principal of Coláiste Chú Chulainn in Dundalk, Thomas Sharkey, said the school was heartbroken over the loss of Kofi. He described Kofi as “very kind and very caring”. Advertisement Kofi had recently played in an All-Ireland basketball final and in a Leinster soccer final in his age group of under-16. He was a member of Redeemer Celtic Football Club in Dundalk and the club started a GoFundMe to support Kofi’s family with funeral costs. The club described Kofi as a “highly respectful youngster” who was a “credit to his loving family”. The online fundraiser has surpassed its goal ahead of Kofi’s funeral service tomorrow. His funeral service will take place at The Redeemed Christian Church of God, Miracle Land, Castletown Road, Dundalk tomorrow at 1pm. Afterwards, the congregation will proceed to St. Patrick’s Cemetery for burial. Readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

Title: Why Companies Need To Institute Stricter AI Policies

ByMegan Poinski andCIO ByMegan Poinski, Forbes Staff andCIO, Forbes Staff. As the hype grows around AI and more people try it out, many are using it at work to see how it can help them become more efficient. But there’s a real problem: Some employees are using public instances of chatbots, putting proprietary company data at risk by giving an open LLM access. Others use the company’s access to AI, but input highly sensitive and personal data, like Social Security numbers and financial data. A new study from technology security company Kiteworks found that 27% of companies reported that nearly a third of all of the data sent to AI systems is the type of information that should be kept private, like company records, employee information and trade secrets. (It could be more; 17% of companies don’t know how much private data ends up getting sent to AI.) It’s a problem that’s growing. A Stanford University report on AI found a 56.4% increase in security incidents with the technology last year. While it may seem obvious to the tech savvy, many employees might not know the risks of this kind of AI sharing, and 83% of companies only rely on training or warning emails to let them know. Kiteworks found that just 17% have automatic controls that keep employees from uploading sensitive information to public AI tools. Further, most companies don’t have much of an AI governance structure—only 9%, according to Deloitte research cited by Kiteworks. The study results show that companies need to add policies and infrastructure to control employee use of AI and protect their own data. This kind of use can cause real damage to companies—not to mention their employees and clients. The study concludes that companies need to acknowledge the threat, deploy controls that can be verified, and ensure that they can stand up to regulatory scrutiny. “With incidents surging, zero-day attacks targeting the security infrastructure itself, and the vast majority lacking real visibility or control, the window for implementing meaningful protections is rapidly closing,” Kiteworks CMO Tim Freestone said in a statement. Many people still haven’t grasped how to truly use AI to benefit their company—we all know its practical business functions go beyond asking a chatbot for advice. I talked to Lindsay Phillips, cofounder and COO of tech change coaching firm SkyPhi Studios, about how to bring AI to your company and get people using it. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang speaks at the VivaTech technology startup and innovation fair in Paris earlier this month. Nvidia is back on top, pulling ahead of Microsoft as the world’s most valuable company. A research note on Wednesday from Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah raised his price target for Nvidia’s stock from $175 to $250. Baruah wrote that Nvidia will lead the next “Golden Wave” for generative AI, and will see “stronger-than-anticipated demand.” The research note—as well as Nvidia’s annual shareholder meeting, where CEO Jensen Huang laid out an optimistic view of the company’s future—drove the company’s stock to hit a record high of $154.43. While share prices dropped somewhat before markets closed, it was a banner day for the chips company. Chips and robotics company, that is. At the annual meeting, Nvidia positioned itself squarely in the robotics and physical industrial AI spaces. In the company’s annual report, Huang wrote that so far this year, Nvidia has fundamentally transformed itself from a chip maker to a builder of infrastructure. While AI data centers will continue to be important, AI-powered robots in factories, hospitals, farms and cities will be what moves society forward in the not-so-distant future. “We stopped thinking of ourselves as a chip company long ago,” Huang said at the meeting, according to CNBC. An Iranian man stands in his apartment in Tehran, which was destroyed by Israeli attacks. While it seems for now that the physical conflict between Iran and Israel—which the U.S. inserted itself into by bombing Iranian nuclear facilities—is on hold, the war will likely still be bitterly fought online. Forbes’ Thomas Brewster writes that Iran, which has a “robust cyber apparatus” according to Middle East cybersecurity experts, is likely to launch disruptive attacks on U.S. and Israeli interests. For the U.S. government, this could be especially challenging. Since the start of President Donald Trump’s second term, the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency has lost many experienced employees and does not even have a permanent director. Insiders told Forbes that CISA already is stretched thin, but coordinated attacks from Iran could make it much worse. The PR war over how the attacks are seen is also riddled with conflicting imagery. AI-generated Iranian propaganda showing a rocket launch and a convoy of tanks and missiles have racked up millions of views, writes Forbes’ Emily Baker-White. These videos, which were seen throughout social media, abruptly disappeared. None of the platforms have any policies against releasing propaganda, and the videos didn’t appear to be labeled as AI-generated. getty AI can be a force for good, but it can also be nefarious. New research from Barracuda, Columbia University and the University of Chicago found that AI writes more than half of all spam email now, writes Forbes senior contributor Davey Winder. This includes the vast majority of messages in your personal account’s spam folder—but it’s also getting prevalent in business emails as well. About 14% of business inbox attacks, in which often senior people in organizations are targeted with requests for financial transactions, are written by AI. Winder writes that it makes sense to use AI for spam. It tends to do a passable job of writing with proper grammar and spelling across a variety of languages. It can also write in a convincing way to provoke a recipient to respond. The study found that attackers seem to be using AI to draft different versions of spam and hacking emails, searching for the best way to get a recipient’s attention. SkyPhi Studios cofounder and COO Lindsay Phillips. AI truly can transform the way we do business, but in order for it to make a difference, employees actually need to use it. AI is unlike any other tech shift in recent years, and it can be difficult for everyone at a company to embrace it. I talked to Lindsay Phillips, cofounder and COO of tech change coaching firm SkyPhi Studios, about the best way to get your employees through these challenges. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. What is the biggest hurdle that you see to widespread AI adoption in companies? Phillips: The biggest hurdle is companies approaching AI as a software shift, and AI is really a mindset shift. It’s not just about teaching people how to do the same work in a different tool. They have to completely change how they think about work, how they think about the value that they’re bringing to the workplace, how they approach their workflows. Companies that are just trying to make tools available and don’t help people understand how to use it, how to adopt it successfully and how to integrate it, are running into adoption challenges. How do you get past that roadblock? Understanding how you want people to change to use the tool. Understanding how roles and responsibilities need to change, the RACI [responsibility matrix] that’s required so that folks adopt this tool and integrate it into their workflows. You want to also make sure that leadership across the org understands that strategy. Most folks want to get guidance from their manager, so you want to leverage leadership cascades and really make sure they’re carrying that message forward and reinforcing it. The other thing that we’re seeing with companies that are successful is a community of practice: Creating ambassadors throughout the org, at the ground level, boots on the street, that are supporting their team members and adopting these tools and helping them make that mindset shift. How does the move toward AI compare to other technology shifts in the past, like moving to the cloud and increasing cybersecurity? It definitely feels like we’re driving the car while we’re building the car, so we need our team members to be very collaborative in helping us figure out how to use these tools. Experts are going to be able to tell you how AI is going to be able to make their jobs more productive and be able to help them do their work better. Leadership’s not necessarily going to know that, so it really does need to be a lot more collaborative and agile than it needed to be in the past. In the past, you find requirements, you help people adopt those new ways of working, you meet those requirements. This we’re figuring it out as we go, and it’s much more experimental. What sets the companies that are most successfully integrating AI apart? A comfort with experimentation and a certain amount of comfort with uncertainty of saying, ‘We’re going to give it a try. We’re going to see how it goes, and we’ll pivot as we need to.’ Companies that are very attached to clarity and certainty and always having the right answer are going to struggle with AI adoption. It’s not a linear straight path. It is going to be something you have to figure out as you go. What advice would you give to executives that are trying to get their employees to use AI? The more accessible we can make it, the better. There’s companies doing weekly challenges. Just start to encourage your folks to incorporate it into their daily lives. Encourage folks to share wins. You want to hear about how other people are using these tools so that it can give you ideas of how you can also use it in your day-to-day. It is a massive mindset shift. Approach it with little tiny bites that you can take to start to shift habits daily. As more companies adopt enterprise AI packages, several trends in what they are using and how are coming to the surface. Here are 10 trends that are shaping enterprise LLM use today. While part of business advancement today is all about personal branding and showing the world your expertise and strategic viewpoint, you may feel more comfortable quietly sitting in front of a screen. The good news is that you don’t have to be an extrovert. Here are some tips for shy people who want to build personal brands. After Meta’s deal to take a 49% stake in data-labeling company Scale AI, another company with a very different main business stepped up as a potential giant in data labeling. Which company is it? A.

Title: Gold is Money Good, Brace for Deep Recession

Skip to comments. Posted on 06/26/2025 9:11:06 AM PDT by delta7 Former Wall Street money manager and financial analyst Ed Dowd of PhinanceTechnologies.com has been forecasting “Danger of Deep Worldwide Recession in 2025.” It looks like his thesis is turning out correct. He predicted interest rates would be declining. They did. And inflation has been going down right along with the economy as illegal immigration was being stopped and deportations ramped up. Dowd says, “Our friend Joe Biden spent anywhere between $500 billion to $2 trillion to bring these people in and set them up. Now, that’s all going the wrong way. Trump has shut down the border crossings, and as deportations heat up, that will only add to the problem. There will be a lot of supply, and prices have already started coming down in certain regions, and that is going to accelerate. Inflation is going to be coming down. Chairman Powell is dead-ass wrong. Tariffs are actually deflationary, and he’s holding rates higher for longer. That is going to end up being a big policy error. We think interest rates have peaked for the year. . .. We think the Fed will be forced to cut rates when the hard data comes in the wrong way.” What is Dowd looking at most? Dowd says, “If we did have an oil shock, our thesis of a deep world-wide recession would trigger even faster. During the last twelve days of this Iran/Israel war, I said to my followers, I am watching one thing and one thing only, and that is the price of oil. The price of oil did go up . . . I said if oil breaks out above $80 per barrel, then we’ve got problems. Oil has collapsed, and the oil markets are telling you the Iranians are not going to close the Strait of Hormuz. So, for now, the economies of the world are not going to be experiencing an oil price shock.” That does not mean we are set for clear sailing throughout 2025. Dowd is forecasting that commercial and residential real estate will be a huge drag on the economy as prices fall and fall hard. Dowd says, “We think shelter is going to trend lower, and there is going to be a deflationary scare coming.” Dowd thinks the Fed will panic and have emergency rate cuts this fall. The stock market will take some big hits. Dowd says, “I think they freak out in the fall in October or November. . .. I will point out airlines have taken out previous lows, homebuilders are weak, the DOW Jones transports are not close to all-time highs. The real economy is rolling over. Typically, when bubbles like this end, everyone is on the wrong side of the trade, and it’s going to happen quick. . .. Warren Buffett is telling you everything you need to know about this market.” Buffett has reportedly $350 billion in cash on the sidelines. Dowd favors gold because the big banks like gold. Dowd says, “Gold counts as a quasi-asset because it is a Tier 1 asset. That means they can create loans against that as an asset whereas before you couldn’t. It was not Tier 1. This is going to be misunderstood by a lot of people, and gold is now a big deal again. . .. If I am a long-term investor, I am going to do what the banks are doing. They have made gold money again. So, gold is money good . . . I am going to go with what the banks are buying.” Dowd wrote a popular book called “Cause Unknown,” which tracked the deaths and injuries that started after the CV19 vax rollout in 2021. He’s still tracking the injuries that just added another 700,000 disabled people. Since the CV19 injections started, that’s a hit a new high of 5.5 million permanently disabled Americans. Dowd says, “This looks like a bullish trend that isn’t stopping anytime soon. It goes up to a new high, consolidates and breaks out again. If this was a growth stock, I’d be all over it, and I’d be long disability. . .. the meta data, the big data, says something drastically changed in 2021. It’s a disaster. I think it’s the CV19 vaccine. I find it interesting there is no curiosity about this even with the new administration.

Now, that’s all going the wrong way. Trump has shut down the border crossings, and as deportations heat up, that will only add to the problem. There will be a lot of supply, and prices have already started coming down in certain regions, and that is going to accelerate. Inflation is going to be coming down. Chairman Powell is dead-ass wrong. Tariffs are actually deflationary, and he’s holding rates higher for longer. That is going to end up being a big policy error. We think interest rates have peaked for the year. . .. We think the Fed will be forced to cut rates when the hard data comes in the wrong way.” What is Dowd looking at most? Dowd says, “If we did have an oil shock, our thesis of a deep world-wide recession would trigger even faster. During the last twelve days of this Iran/Israel war, I said to my followers, I am watching one thing and one thing only, and that is the price of oil. The price of oil did go up . . . I said if oil breaks out above $80 per barrel, then we’ve got problems. Oil has collapsed, and the oil markets are telling you the Iranians are not going to close the Strait of Hormuz. So, for now, the economies of the world are not going to be experiencing an oil price shock.” That does not mean we are set for clear sailing throughout 2025. Dowd is forecasting that commercial and residential real estate will be a huge drag on the economy as prices fall and fall hard. Dowd says, “We think shelter is going to trend lower, and there is going to be a deflationary scare coming.” Dowd thinks the Fed will panic and have emergency rate cuts this fall. The stock market will take some big hits. Dowd says, “I think they freak out in the fall in October or November. . .. I will point out airlines have taken out previous lows, homebuilders are weak, the DOW Jones transports are not close to all-time highs. The real economy is rolling over. Typically, when bubbles like this end, everyone is on the wrong side of the trade, and it’s going to happen quick. . .. Warren Buffett is telling you everything you need to know about this market.” Buffett has reportedly $350 billion in cash on the sidelines. Dowd favors gold because the big banks like gold. Dowd says, “Gold counts as a quasi-asset because it is a Tier 1 asset. That means they can create loans against that as an asset whereas before you couldn’t. It was not Tier 1. This is going to be misunderstood by a lot of people, and gold is now a big deal again. . .. If I am a long-term investor, I am going to do what the banks are doing. They have made gold money again. So, gold is money good . . . I am going to go with what the banks are buying.” Dowd wrote a popular book called “Cause Unknown,” which tracked the deaths and injuries that started after the CV19 vax rollout in 2021. He’s still tracking the injuries that just added another 700,000 disabled people. Since the CV19 injections started, that’s a hit a new high of 5.5 million permanently disabled Americans. Dowd says, “This looks like a bullish trend that isn’t stopping anytime soon. It goes up to a new high, consolidates and breaks out again. If this was a growth stock, I’d be all over it, and I’d be long disability. . .. the meta data, the big data, says something drastically changed in 2021. It’s a disaster. I think it’s the CV19 vaccine. I find it interesting there is no curiosity about this even with the new administration.

Dowd is forecasting that commercial and residential real estate will be a huge drag on the economy as prices fall and fall hard. Dowd says, “We think shelter is going to trend lower, and there is going to be a deflationary scare coming.” Dowd thinks the Fed will panic and have emergency rate cuts this fall.

Dowd says, “Gold counts as a quasi-asset because it is a Tier 1 asset. That means they can create loans against that as an asset whereas before you couldn’t. It was not Tier 1. This is going to be misunderstood by a lot of people, and gold is now a big deal again. . .. If I am a long-term investor, I am going to do what the banks are doing. They have made gold money again. So, gold is money good . . . I am going to go with what the banks are buying.” Dowd wrote a popular book called “Cause Unknown,” which tracked the deaths and injuries that started after the CV19 vax rollout in 2021. He’s still tracking the injuries that just added another 700,000 disabled people. Since the CV19 injections started, that’s a hit a new high of 5.5 million permanently disabled Americans. Dowd says, “This looks like a bullish trend that isn’t stopping anytime soon. It goes up to a new high, consolidates and breaks out again. If this was a growth stock, I’d be all over it, and I’d be long disability. . .. the meta data, the big data, says something drastically changed in 2021. It’s a disaster. I think it’s the CV19 vaccine. I find it interesting there is no curiosity about this even with the new administration. It’s an elephant in the room, and they don’t want to talk about it.” There is much more in the 46-minute interview.

Title: Gold is Money Good, Brace for Deep Recession

Skip to comments. Posted on 06/26/2025 9:11:06 AM PDT by delta7 Former Wall Street money manager and financial analyst Ed Dowd of PhinanceTechnologies.com has been forecasting “Danger of Deep Worldwide Recession in 2025.” It looks like his thesis is turning out correct. He predicted interest rates would be declining. They did. And inflation has been going down right along with the economy as illegal immigration was being stopped and deportations ramped up. Dowd says, “Our friend Joe Biden spent anywhere between $500 billion to $2 trillion to bring these people in and set them up. Now, that’s all going the wrong way. Trump has shut down the border crossings, and as deportations heat up, that will only add to the problem. There will be a lot of supply, and prices have already started coming down in certain regions, and that is going to accelerate. Inflation is going to be coming down. Chairman Powell is dead-ass wrong. Tariffs are actually deflationary, and he’s holding rates higher for longer. That is going to end up being a big policy error. We think interest rates have peaked for the year. . .. We think the Fed will be forced to cut rates when the hard data comes in the wrong way.” What is Dowd looking at most? Dowd says, “If we did have an oil shock, our thesis of a deep world-wide recession would trigger even faster. During the last twelve days of this Iran/Israel war, I said to my followers, I am watching one thing and one thing only, and that is the price of oil. The price of oil did go up . . . I said if oil breaks out above $80 per barrel, then we’ve got problems. Oil has collapsed, and the oil markets are telling you the Iranians are not going to close the Strait of Hormuz. So, for now, the economies of the world are not going to be experiencing an oil price shock.” That does not mean we are set for clear sailing throughout 2025. Dowd is forecasting that commercial and residential real estate will be a huge drag on the economy as prices fall and fall hard. Dowd says, “We think shelter is going to trend lower, and there is going to be a deflationary scare coming.” Dowd thinks the Fed will panic and have emergency rate cuts this fall.

So, gold is money good . . . I am going to go with what the banks are buying.” Dowd wrote a popular book called “Cause Unknown,” which tracked the deaths and injuries that started after the CV19 vax rollout in 2021. He’s still tracking the injuries that just added another 700,000 disabled people. Since the CV19 injections started, that’s a hit a new high of 5.5 million permanently disabled Americans. Dowd says, “This looks like a bullish trend that isn’t stopping anytime soon. It goes up to a new high, consolidates and breaks out again. If this was a growth stock, I’d be all over it, and I’d be long disability. . .. the meta data, the big data, says something drastically changed in 2021. It’s a disaster.

So, for now, the economies of the world are not going to be experiencing an oil price shock.” That does not mean we are set for clear sailing throughout 2025. Dowd is forecasting that commercial and residential real estate will be a huge drag on the economy as prices fall and fall hard. Dowd says, “We think shelter is going to trend lower, and there is going to be a deflationary scare coming.” Dowd thinks the Fed will panic and have emergency rate cuts this fall. The stock market will take some big hits. Dowd says, “I think they freak out in the fall in October or November. . .. I will point out airlines have taken out previous lows, homebuilders are weak, the DOW Jones transports are not close to all-time highs. The real economy is rolling over.

He’s still tracking the injuries that just added another 700,000 disabled people. Since the CV19 injections started, that’s a hit a new high of 5.5 million permanently disabled Americans. Dowd says, “This looks like a bullish trend that isn’t stopping anytime soon. It goes up to a new high, consolidates and breaks out again. If this was a growth stock, I’d be all over it, and I’d be long disability. . .. the meta data, the big data, says something drastically changed in 2021. It’s a disaster.

Dowd says, “Gold counts as a quasi-asset because it is a Tier 1 asset. That means they can create loans against that as an asset whereas before you couldn’t. It was not Tier 1. This is going to be misunderstood by a lot of people, and gold is now a big deal again. . .. If I am a long-term investor, I am going to do what the banks are doing. They have made gold money again. So, gold is money good . . . I am going to go with what the banks are buying.” Dowd wrote a popular book called “Cause Unknown,” which tracked the deaths and injuries that started after the CV19 vax rollout in 2021. He’s still tracking the injuries that just added another 700,000 disabled people. Since the CV19 injections started, that’s a hit a new high of 5.5 million permanently disabled Americans. Dowd says, “This looks like a bullish trend that isn’t stopping anytime soon. It goes up to a new high, consolidates and breaks out again. If this was a growth stock, I’d be all over it, and I’d be long disability. . .. the meta data, the big data, says something drastically changed in 2021. It’s a disaster.

Kay and Marco Migueis Ex-ante cost-benefit analyses and other impact assessments are now a standard part of the rulemaking process. Yet some important effects of regulation are difficultâor impossibleâto assess before a rule takes effect. In such cases, ex-post (or retrospective) evaluation, conducted after a rule is in effect, offers an opportunity to measure real-world outcomes that could not reliably be predicted in advance. Such an evaluation can help determine whether a rule achieves its intended goals, whether the imposed costs are justified, and whether any unintended consequences have emerged. However, when rules are not designed with ex-post evaluation in mind, measuring certain impacts may be difficult or impossible in practice. This article discusses options to revise the rulemaking process to avoid this problem. Designing rules with ex-post evaluation in mind would facilitate such evaluations, ultimately leading to better rules. One rationale for evaluating rules is that they can impose costs on the public. To promote efficiency and minimize unintended harm, policymakers may prefer rules that are simple where complexity is unnecessary, inexpensive where high costs can be avoided, and designed to avoid adverse side effects. Recognizing these tradeoffs, the U.S. Congress has required federal agencies to conduct impact analyses for certain rulemakings.2 In addition, a standing executive order mandates that agencies perform cost-and-benefit analyses before issuing major new rules.3, 4 The ex-ante assessments help ensure that regulatory costs are justified and prevent some of the least cost-effective rules from being implemented. However, rules can prove more costly, yield fewer benefits, and produce more undesirable consequences than analysts anticipate in ex-ante assessments. These estimates are inherently uncertain, as they depend on future economic conditions and the reactions of regulated entities. Moreover, behavioral and political factorsâsuch as bureaucratic optimism (Krause and Corder, 2007; Liu, Stoutenborough, and Vedlitz, 2016), ideologically motivated policymaking (Hogwood and Gunn, 1984; Prendergast, 2007), and regulatory capture by special interests (Dal Bo, 2006)âcan cause analysts to overestimate the net benefits of new rules. Current U.S. executive branch policy requires agencies to conduct retrospective analyses to support the periodic review of regulations.5 Similarly, an executive order issued by President Obama encourages independent agencies to conduct retrospective analysisâa recommendation that remains in effect.6 In addition, Section 610 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act mandates that federal agencies periodically review regulations that have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Banking regulators are also required to regularly perform a systematic review of their regulations under the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA). While these motivations for ex-post evaluation are evergreen, interest in such evaluations has grown in response to legal and political shifts over the past decade. During the first Trump administration, Executive Order 13771 (2017) required that "â¦any new incremental costs associated with new regulations shall, to the extent permitted by law, be offset by the elimination of existing costs associated with at least two prior regulations." Although the executive order was rescinded during the Biden administration, that rescission was itself reversed in the second Trump administration.7 Executive Order 14192 now requires that the "â¦total incremental cost of all new regulations, including repealed regulations, being finalized this year, shall be significantly less than zero."8 For policymakers aiming to meet such cost-reduction mandates, ex-post evaluation may help quantify regulatory cost changes and track progress toward aggregate cost targets. Further contributing to a changing policy environment, oversight bodies are increasingly pressing federal agencies to provide stronger analytic justification for their rules. For example, guidance from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) instructs agencies to quantify the total incremental costs or savings of each new and repealed significant regulatory action or guidance document.9 The instructions in this guidance amount to establishing a regulatory cost budget for each agency. If agencies are expected to meet cost targets for new rules, they may be incentivized to identify regulations with high costs and low benefits to repeal or replace. Because retrospective evaluations often yield more accurate estimates of realized costs than ex-ante projections, they can be useful in quantifying current burdens and informing regulatory cost budgeting. Separate from this recent guidance on regulatory cost budgets, the OMB has historically encouraged agencies to plan for ex-post review of regulatory outcomes. In its 2017 annual report to Congress, OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) advised that "Rules should be written and designed to facilitate retrospective analysis of their effects, including consideration of the data that will be needed for future evaluation of the rules' ex-post costs and benefits."10â The currently effective OMB Circular A-4 (2003) similarly supports using retrospective analysis to assess whether a regulation's costs have changed after implementation. The now-rescinded 2023 version of Circular A-4 went further, stating that "â¦agencies may consider the benefits and costs of regulatory alternatives that would facilitate data collection to support future analyses or retrospective review. These alternatives may be especially valuable if there are significant uncertainties about benefits or costs, or if benefits or costs may change over time." In practice, agencies are expected to estimate a rule's costs and benefits before issuance and, in some cases, to design regulations in ways that facilitate later evaluation of their realized impacts. When agencies seek to support their rules with empirical evidence in legal proceedings, ex-post analyses can help demonstrate whether predicted benefits and costs materialized. The need to defend regulations in court may be growing. Two Supreme Court decisions in 2024 significantly increased the legal risks for federal rulemaking. In Corner Post, the Court held that the six-year statute of limitations under the Administrative Procedure Act begins when a regulated party is first subject to the rule, rather than when the rule is finalized, which had been the prior interpretation. In Loper Bright, the Court overturned the Chevron doctrine, which had required courts to defer to reasonable agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes. This decision shifted interpretive authority from agencies to the judiciary and may lead to greater scrutiny in litigation. While these are only two among many legal risks agencies face, ex-post evaluation may strengthen a rule's legal defensibility by providing evidence that its benefits outweigh its costs. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has consistently emphasized the importance of retrospective review in strengthening regulatory quality. In reports from 2007, 2014, and 2018, the GAO called for expanding or improving the use of ex-post evaluation across federal agencies.11 Despite such calls, challenges persist. For example, a 2024 GAO review of independent federal financial regulators found that they had conducted few retrospective reviews of their existing rules.12 Finally, some policymakers may view ex-post evaluation as a tool to promote public trust in the government. Demonstrating that regulatory decisions are reviewed and evidence-based can signal accountability and responsiveness. Research suggests that transparency, such as disclosing government performance, can positively influence citizens' perceptions of government.13 When conducted, ex-post evaluations can help identify rules that are underperforming or no longer justified. In some cases, this evidence may support repeal. In others, evidence of strong performance and low costs could justify expanding a rule's scope: for example, by extending it to additional firms, increasing its stringency, or replacing alternative policies based on demonstrated effectiveness. This article proposes strategies to improve the government's capacity to conduct meaningful ex-post evaluations, supporting such analysis in contexts where policymakers choose to pursue it.14 While ex-post evaluations are incredibly valuable for improving the regulatory environment, conducting them can be difficult. Key challenges include identifying an appropriate counterfactual, gathering data on outcomes, and attributing these outcomes to the rule itself. Fortunately, these challenges can be mitigated when regulations are designed and implemented with evaluation in mind. The sections that follow explore organizational and implementation choices that can support ex-post evaluation.15 Staffing rulemakings with an eye toward ex-post evaluation Ex-post evaluation benefits from the early involvement of evaluation staff in the rulemaking process. Such staff can help identify opportunities to design rules in ways that support future evaluation. The marginal costs of such an assignment are likely to be modest. Under current practices, evaluation staff are often already engaged in the rulemaking processâmaking suggestions to reduce burdens and increase benefits. Asking them to also identify opportunities to support ex-post evaluation is unlikely to add significant cost. However, embedding economic analysis staff in the rulemaking process poses tradeoffs. Their economic expertise can improve the quality of rules, but their participation may also reduce the independence of the evaluation process from policy development. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) mitigates this issue by assigning different cost-benefit analysts participate to the drafting and evaluation phases of a ruleâan approach that requires more personnel and increases agency costs.16 But staff responsible for ex-ante impact analysis are often already engaged in the rulemaking process. Asking them to identify opportunities to support ex-post evaluation is unlikely to further reduce their independence. Therefore, the incremental cost of this added responsibility is likely modest, particularly when compared with the broader compliance costs and regulatory burdens of major regulations. To the extent that designing for ex-post evaluation leads to more such evaluations being conducted, costs may rise relative to the current baseline, where formal ex-post analyses are relatively uncommon. However, the cost of conducting these evaluations is typically modest compared to the potential benefitsâsuch as improving the efficacy and efficiency of existing rules. Moreover, by designing rules to support evaluation, agencies may create natural experiments that external researchers can study at no additional cost to taxpayers. In some cases, this could reduce the incremental cost of evaluation to nearly zero. Policymakers should weigh these cost considerations alongside the potential political, procedural, and reputational benefits of ex-post evaluations. Differentiated implementation and application of rules Ex-post evaluation can be facilitated by differentiated application of rules across similar firms. Applying different rules to otherwise comparable entities creates natural treatment and control groups, improving the ability to identify regulatory effects.17 Two commonly used forms of differentiation that support such analyses are: (1) tiered application of rules based on firm size or other relevant criteria and (2) staggered implementation.18 In addition, while pure randomization of regulatory policies across firms is uncommon and poses several challenges, it has been used in public policy and will be discussed at the end of this section. Many regulations apply only to firms that exceed a certain threshold of activity, leaving firms below that threshold exempt.19 This tiered approach can be appropriate because imposing stricter requirements on to certain entities, such as those that are larger and more complex, often yields greater benefits than applying the same rules to other entities.20 Also, regulatory compliance costs tend to increase less than proportionally with activity levels (Brock and Evans, 1985).21 However, tiering can also create incentives for firms to remain below regulatory thresholds to avoid compliance costs, which may discourage growth and reduce economic efficiency.22 In addition to these potential costs and benefits, tiering enables regulators to compare outcomes between firms above and below the threshold, helping to identify the effects of regulation. Ex-post analyses that utilize regulatory thresholds have provided valuable insights into the effects of financial regulations. Examples include Acharya et al. (2018), who found that the introduction of stress testing for large banks led to reductions in credit to risky borrowers; Kay et al. (2014), who found that banks subject to the Durbin amendment experienced substantial declines in interchange income relative to exempt banks, though they offset more than 90 percent of the lost income through higher deposit fees);23 Alvero, Ando, Xiao (2023), who used bunching of banks around Dodd-Frank size thresholds to estimate the costs of the act's regulatory burdens; Bindal et al. (2017), who studied the effects of the $10 billion and $50 billion thresholds that trigger increased bank merger scrutiny; and Wood (2023), who examined how the 2005 amendments to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act and the Community Reinvestment Act affected bank liquidity creation. In addition, many studies use regulatory thresholds to evaluate non-financial regulations.24 These examples demonstrate that ex-post evaluation can provide insights at a limited marginal cost when rules apply differently across otherwise comparable firms. Using tiered thresholds to identify the effects of regulations typically presents several challenges. Ideally, policy implementation would be unanticipated, preventing firms from strategically adjusting their behavior to remain out of scopeâbut this is rarely the case in practice. Still, reducing activity to avoid regulation can be costly, limiting firms' ability to respond.25 And while firms may have some discretion in staying above or below a threshold, ex-post comparisons between those either side of the cutoff can still shed light on how rules affect firm behavior and incentives. Even when firms do not strategically avoid regulatory thresholds, anticipation effects may arise as firms adjust behavior well before formal implementation, in response to rules they expect to face because of speeches, draft proposals, investor pressure, or other signals. Such adjustments are especially likely when compliance is complex, time-consuming, and costly. A firm may also adjust in response to rules that currently apply only to others, anticipating that similar requirements will extend to them in the future. These dynamics complicate causal inference by blurring the timing of firm responses. A related phenomenon is the announcement effect, in which other entities respond immediately when information about rules is publicly disclosed. For instance, securities prices may adjust on the day a regulation is announced, regardless of when it takes effect. Both types of effects can complicate causal inference by shifting behavior away from the formal implementation date, but they differ in timing, observability, and the clarity of the policy signal that drives the response. Another challenge in using tiered requirements to identify policy effects is that certain thresholds trigger multiple regulations simultaneously. For example, under the Dodd-Frank Act, crossing the $50 billion asset threshold subjects banks to several prudential standards, including enhanced stress testing, liquidity, and risk management requirements.26 Because these requirements were implemented concurrently, isolating their individual effects is difficult. Nevertheless, even when multiple rules are triggered at once, comparing firms above and below the threshold can provide useful insightsâespecially when estimating the most direct and distinct effects of a requirement, such as the impact of liquidity rules on holdings of high-quality liquid assets. In addition, when new requirements are layered onto an existing threshold, it may be possible to identify their marginal impact if the new rule was not anticipated at the time threshold was originally introduced. For example, while the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act established prudential liquidity requirements for large firms, a key element of the liquidity frameworkâthe net stable funding ratioâwas proposed in 2016, finalized in February 2021, and become effective in July 2021. Tiered application of regulations can support a long-term strategy of expanding regulations that demonstrate positive net benefits and scaling back or eliminating those that do not. Policymakers can (1) apply a rule initially to a narrow set of firms, (2) conduct an ex-post evaluation of the rule's costs and benefits, and (3) adjust the scope of the rule based on the findings.27 Arguably, certain expansions of banking requirements have followed this pattern. For instance, the long-term debt requirement for large banking organizations proposed in 2023 was influenced by the perceived successes of similar mandates for global systemically important banks introduced in 2016.28 Still, regulators could benefit from applying this approach more consistently, regularly reassessing whether to expand or narrow regulations in response to ex-post evidence. Staggered implementation, whether based on predetermined criteria or random assignment, is another common feature of rules that can support ex-post evaluation.29 Like tiering, applying a rule to similar firms at different times enables comparisons between early and late adopters, helping to assess a rule's impact. Therefore, regulators may benefit from using staggered implementation more often to evaluate the effectiveness of new policies. In some cases, staggered implementation has been deliberately designed to test policy effects. For instance, the SEC used staggered rollout in 2000 to evaluate the decimalization of stock market prices in 2000, and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) employed a staggered approach to distribute stimulus payments during the Great Recession.30, 31 Thanks to these clever implementation strategies, we now know far more about the consequences of these policies.32 In other cases, staggering implementation has resulted from practical considerations, such as prioritizing the most relevant entities or varying levels of readiness. For example, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority's (FINRA) Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE), mandated by the SEC for broker-dealer trade reporting, was initially introduced in 2002 for investment grade corporate bonds with large issuances. Over time, its scope was expanded to cover a broader range of securities, including those with smaller issuances and lower liquidity. This gradual rollout enabled researchers to assess TRACE's effects by comparing securities subject to the requirement with those that remained exempt.33 Staggered implementation has also enabled policy evaluation in cases where the staggering was not intended for that purpose. For example, Bremer and Sommer (2025) evaluated the costs and benefits of the European emission trading regime using incidental variation in implementation timing. Similarly, Barreca, Neidell, and Sanders (2021) used staggered rollout to estimate the benefits of the U.S. Acid Rain Program. Comparable setups exist in U.S. policies on long-term care staffing and overtime protections, but, to our knowledge, no ex-post evaluations have yet exploited this variation.34 Staggered implementation has also been employed in bank regulation and by quasi-regulatory organizations in the private sector. Notable examples include the current expected credit losses (CECL) accounting standard,35 stress-testing requirements for large banks,36 and the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR).37 These staggered rollouts have enabled valuable ex-post analyses. Some examples include Loudis et al. (2021), who assessed the impact of early CECL adoption during the COVID-19 stress and found that reserves were substantially more responsive to the economic outlook among early adopters; and Banerjee and Mio (2018), who examined the staggered rollout of liquidity regulation in the UK and its effects on bank balance sheets. Staggered implementation also has limitations as a tool for policy evaluation. Because the units serving as controls are typically treated within a short time frame, often a year or two, analyses based on staggered rollout are more informative for short-term outcomes than for outcomes that depend on the long-term state of the regulation. For example, the decimalization of stock prices allowed researchers to assess impact on trading costs, which materialized quickly. By contrast, most banking regulations affect outcomes over longer horizons, and firms may begin adjusting their behavior in anticipation of rules before they take effect. Also, just as with identifying a regulation's effect through tiered application, possible anticipation and announcement effects limit how much staggered implementation can reveal about a regulation's true impact. For these reasons, evaluations based on staggered implementation require caution in interpreting results and modesty about the strength and generalizability of their findings. Although the staggered implementations of TRACE and CECL were not designed for evaluation purposes, they enabled valuable ex-post policy analysis. Like tiering, staggered implementation supports the evaluation of regulatory effectiveness and can inform iterative improvements. Problematic or costly implementations can be slowed or abandoned, while successful ones can be accelerated and expanded when early evidence indicates strong positive effects.38 A more modest alternative to randomized staggered implementation is the use of small-scale pilot programs, in which a regulation is applied, potentially on a voluntary basis, to a limited number of firms for a defined period. These pilots can reduce the cost of experimentation while providing useful comparisons between treated and untreated firms. The SEC has conducted several such pilots, including during the rollout of TRACE, the "up-tick" pilot (which removed a short-sale price test), and the "tick-size" pilot (which increased the minimum price increment for stocks from one to five cents). These experiments have generated multiple studies evaluating the effectiveness of the associated regulatory changes.39 However, the voluntary nature of many pilot programs can limit their value for casual inference (see Harris et al. (2021) for a discussion of these limitations in financial regulation). Beyond short-term randomized staggering, such as the decimalization of stock prices or the IRS stimulus payments, a long-term strategy for evidence-based regulation would involve more open-ended policy experiments using randomization.40 Randomly assigning treatments to comparable units remains the gold standard for identifying causal effects, which is why it has long been used in clinical trials. Experimental economics has similarly used controlled trials to explore economic questions in lab-like environments. Although fully controlled trials are rarely feasible in the context of firm regulation, regulators may still seek opportunities to adopt similar approaches where possible. Policy randomization can result in unequal treatment among regulated entities. Still, society accepts randomization in high-stakes decisionsâsuch as the military draft, jury selection, and clinical trialsâwhen randomization is grounded in ex-ante fairness.41, 42 Governments have also used randomization to evaluate the effectiveness of anti-poverty programs and the benefits of Medicare coverage.43 Credible evidence on policy effectiveness can require accepting some temporary inequities among regulated entities or individuals; this tradeoff may be justified when the resulting knowledge has the potential to substantially improve long-run outcomes. This does not mean that arbitrarily large inequities should be introduced solely for the sake of experimentation. Instead, the potential benefits of policy experimentation should be weighed against the potential costs associated with any resulting inequities. In general, policy randomization is more ex-ante justifiable when there is greater uncertainty about a policy's effects (including on the bottom line of regulated entities) and when the costs of unequal treatment are relatively low. Bank supervision is one area where policy randomization could be used to learn more. Given that appropriate baseline levels of supervision are in place, the incremental costs and benefits of different supervisory approaches could be studied through randomized assignment. For example, supervisors could test the efficacy of varying examination frequencies, team sizes and compositions, triggers for examinations, or areas of focus. Over time, such experimentation could help regulatory agencies allocate their limited resources more efficiently. The socially optimal scope of a regulation may not align with the scope that best enables evaluation of its effects. While employing a suboptimal scope for the sake of evaluation may involve some theoretical cost, there is generally little empirical evidence that current scopes of application are optimally efficient. Therefore, experimentation with regulatory scope may be feasible without demonstrable loss of efficiency at the outset. Even with greater use of randomization, pilot programs, tiering, and staggering, ex-post evaluation can be difficult for certain policies. As discussed earlier, the application of multiple regulatory requirements at the same threshold can challenge efforts to isolate individual effects. These challenges highlight the importance of designing policies with evaluation in mind: by embedding variation in implementation, improving opportunities for measurement, and reducing overlap across rules. Still, in practice, stakeholders may struggle to agree on a structure that is both legally defensible and cost-effective while also supporting rigorous ex-post analysis. When policies are implemented in ways that preclude meaningful evaluation, more fundamental concerns arise, including ethical ones. For example, Campbell (1969) argued, "To be truly scientific we must be able to experiment. We must be able to advocate without that excess of commitment that blinds us to reality testing." Similarly, Boruch (1975) warned that, "[A] failure to discover whether a program is effective is unethical. Insofar as a failure to obtain unequivocal data on effects then leads to decisions which are wrong and ultimately damaging, that failure may violate good standards of both social and professional ethics." Or as Karl Popper put it, "â¦ we make progress, if and only if, we are prepared to learn from our mistakes: to recognize our errors and to utilize them critically instead of persevering in them dogmatically." (Popper 1957). Careful examination of policy effects helps ensure that government decisions are responsible, accountable, and guided by evidence. Dual reporting Identifying the costs and benefits of rules requires more than clear identification of treatment and control groupsâit also depends on having good data, a concern sometimes overlooked in the rule making process. For example, the definitions of capital and risk-weighted assets have changed several times since the Dodd-Frank Act. Yet regulatory reporting typically requires firms to provide data only under the latest definitions, making it difficult to measure whether changes in reported capital or assets reflect changes in behavior or shifts in definitions. New rules can avoid this issue by requiring firms to report data using both old and new definitions for a limited time. This approach is similar to how banks report the value of securities under both mark-to-market and amortized cost valuations. Such parallel data proved invaluable in understanding the banking problems that emerged in March 2023, helping regulators identify banks with significant unrealized losses from interest rates changes that were not reflected in regulatory capital. Similarly, when revising questions in its Current Population Survey, the Census Bureau asks the old and new versions of a question to maintain consistency and data usability over time.44 Dual reporting can also be useful when the scope of a rule is being narrowed. Maintaining data from firms that were previously covered can help evaluate whether regulatory simplifications and burden reductions achieve their intended outcomes. Failing to collect overlapping data often creates problems. Famously, the Census Bureau changed its annual health insurance survey at the same time the Affordable Care Act was implemented, making it much harder to evaluate the law through ex-post analysis.45 Another example was the Bureau of Labor Statistics' 1994 introduction of the concept of discouraged workers and other major changes to the U-4 through U-6 unemployment measures.46 These changes made comparisons with earlier data more difficult and complicated analysis of laws such as the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. Dual reporting would temporarily raise compliance costs. Still, when reporting under old definitions can rely on existing systems, the marginal costs may be low. In such cases, the potential benefits of dual reporting are likely to outweigh the costs. Effective ex-post evaluation of rules can offer substantial benefits. This paper outlines two rule design strategies to support such evaluation. First, expanding the use of tiering, randomization, and staggered implementation can improve the identification of a rule's effects by creating treatment and control groups. Table 1 illustrates several applications of these techniques in public policy, showcasing how they can yield insights across a range of settings. Second, dual-reporting requirementsâwhere both new and legacy data are collected during a transitional windowâhelp distinguish the true effects of rules from changes in measurement. In addition, analysts tasked with ex-post evaluation could be brought into the rulemaking process early to help identify ways to enable meaningful evaluation. Once designing rules for ex-post evaluation becomes standard practice, policymakers and researchers are likely to discover more tools to support it. With a broader toolkit, many more ex-post evaluations will become possible. Many have argued that policymakers may resist this approach, worrying they have more to lose by exposing poor performing policies than they have to gain from highlighting successful ones (Wolf, 1979; Hogwood and Gunn, 1984; Twight, 1991; Weiss, 1993; Rossi, 1987; Hanson, 2003; Prendergast, 2003; Prendergast, 2007; and Bovens, Hart, and Kuipers, 2009). Policymakers may also be concerned about the costs of ex-post evaluations or worry that designing for evaluation could slow down the rulemaking process, delaying public access to well-crafted policies. Still, the benefits of strengthening ex-post evaluation are worth serious consideration. The regulatory community has managed the discomforts of ex-ante impact analyses by normalizing them. Today, nearly every major rule includes such an analysis, offering valuable information to both policymakers and the public. Similarly, normalizing ex-post evaluation could reduce the stigma of admitting that some rules underperform, and in turn encourage more independent, timely, and accurate evaluations. Better ex-post evaluation would help the public understand the real impacts of government policyâand support reform or repeal of rules that fall short.

The views expressed in this note are ours and do not reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Reserve System. Return to text 2. Two key laws here are the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 and the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995. The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to consider the impact of their rules on small entities. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act requires agencies to assess the costs and benefits of any regulation that has a material impact on state, local, or tribal governments. Both laws define agencies according to Title 5, Section 551(1) of the US Code; however, the Regulatory Flexibility Act includes independent regulatory agencies, while the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act excludes them. Return to text 3. See Executive Order No. 12866, 58 Federal Register 51735 (October 4, 1993) and Circular A-4: Regulatory Analysis, Office of Management and Budget, Executive Office of the President (final-2003 and proposed-2023 versions). Return to text 4. Historically these requirements did not apply to independent regulatory agencies. However, recently issued Executive Order No. 14215, 90 Federal Register 10447 (February 24, 2025) mandates that "â¦all executive departments and agencies, including so-called independent agencies, shall submit for review all proposed and final significant regulatory actions to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA)â¦" along with their cost-benefit analyses. OIRA traditionally reviews agency submissions of the potential costs and benefits of "significant" rules (Congressional Research Service, 2024). Return to text 5. See Executive Order No. 13563, 76 Federal Register 3821 (January 21, 2011). Return to text 6. See Executive Order No. 13579, 76 Federal Register 41587 (July 14, 2011). Return to text 7.

Alessandro, Cardinale, Lagomarsino, Scartascini, and Torrealday (2019) show that government transparency, and particularly transparency about government performance (e.g., implementing effective rules) promotes citizen confidence in government. In a metanalysis of 49 studies, Qiushi and Guan (2022) show that government transparency has a positive and significant effect on citizen trust in government. Return to text 14. See Herrick and Sarewitz (2000), Kovacic (2006), and de Jong et al. (2018) for a discussion of the benefits of ex-post evaluation of policies in the context of environmental policy, competition policy, and infrastructure projects, respectively. Return to text 15. The Department of Energy previously highlighted a related motivation, stating that it would "consider how regulations might be designed and written" to better support retrospective evaluation and measurement of outcomes (DOE 2011). Although DOE's subsequent actions regarding this specific goal are uncertain, our work explicitly advances this approach. Return to text 16. Even with this separation of drafting and analysis roles, both sets of analysts ultimately answer to SEC leadership. Skeptics could still justifiably worry about the analysts' independence when they have the same bosses. Return to text 17. The typical identification assumptions used in measuring the effects of regulations do not require that firms be "similar." Rather, the (partly non-testable) assumptions needed for causal identification are exchangeability (i.e., there is conditional mean independence of treatment and control units), positivity (i.e., the probability of a unit being treated is positive but below one), and stable unit treatment value (i.e., potential outcomes of each unit are unaffected by the treatment assignment of other units). Similarity of treated and control units is one way to satisfy these assumptions but is not necessary. A potential objection to using differentiated application of regulations to similar firms to identify treatment effects is that, by changing the conditions of competition across firms, introducing a regulation for a subset of firms can also affect outcomes for the non-treated firms â which would violate the stable unit treatment assumption. This is a potential limitation to consider when applying the identification methodologies discussed below. Return to text 18. Differentiated application of regulations is often mandated by statute. This article focuses on the ex-post evaluation of regulations issued by the executive branch agencies, but similar approaches can be followed by Congress to evaluate the effectiveness of statutes ex-post. Return to text 19. In the banking regulation context, regulations with thresholds of application abound (see Congressional Research Service (2017) for a listing of all the thresholds that were in place at that time). Several regulations include enhanced requirements for large firms, complex firms, or both, including capital, liquidity, and resolution requirements. Return to text 20. Large banking organizations tend to pose proportionally more systemic risk to the financial system than smaller banking organizations (see, for instance, Lorenc and Zhang (2020)). Return to text 21. Given the same regulatory requirements, a firm with $1 billion in activity may be able to use the same systemâand incur a similar absolute costâas a firm that performs $2 billion of the activity. Return to text 22. France imposes numerous regulations on firms once they employ 50 or more workers, resulting in an unusually high number of firms with exactly 49 employees. Such "bunching" has been estimated to reduce French aggregate productivity by 3.4 percent of gross domestic product (Garicano et al., 2016). Return to text 23. The Durbin amendment to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires the Federal Reserve to limit fees charged to retailers for credit card processing. Return to text 24. See, for example, Leonardi and Pica (2006) and Vaccro (2017). Return to text 25. For example, consider that the average domestic banking organization subject to Category III requirements had $550 billion in assets as of 2023:Q4. Given a typical return on assets of 1 percent, these banks would have to give up $3 billion in returns to be subject to Category IV requirements instead. Given observed growth in balance sheets, the current regulations have not caused banks to downsize in this way. Return to text 26. See Congressional Research Service (2017) and Labonte and Perkins (2017). The $50 billion threshold was generally increased to $250 billion in the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018. Return to text 27. See List (2024) for a discussion of how to optimally generate policy-relevant evidence before scaling an intervention. Return to text 28. See Federal Reserve System (2016) and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Reserve System, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (2023). Return to text 29. The idea of using staggered implementation for causal identification has long been a standard practice in policy analysis (Meyer, 1995). The earliest reference we know of calling for expanded use of staggering to promote policy evaluation is Leuz and Wysocki (2016). Return to text 30. Between August 2000 and January 2001, the New York Stock Exchange, in a series of incremental steps, began trading and quoting all its listed securities in increments of a penny. See SEC (2000) for additional details. Return to text 31. The primary component of the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 was a $100 billion program of economic stimulus using tax rebates. The IRS implementation of this stimulus was randomized based on the last two digits of the filer's Social Security number. See Parker et al. (2013) for details. Return to text 32. Chung et al. (2004) studied the staggered roll out of decimalization. The Nasdaq Stock Market and the New York Stock Exchange have also performed ex-post analyses of this policy. As predicted, these analyses found that decimal pricing reduced bid-ask spreads. There were concerns the rule would reduce market liquidity, but the analyses failed to find evidence that liquidity declined. Chung, Lee, and Rösch (2020) and Werner et al. (2022) look at a related policy experiment involving a stratified random sampling process that assigned different quote and trading price increments in 2016 called the tick size pilot program. Parker et al. (2013) studied the effect of the staggered IRS roll out of the economic stimulus payments of 2008. This paper helped establish the efficacy of fiscal stimulus spending, finding a marginal propensity to consume of 50 to 90 percent in the first three months after stimulus payments were received. These results imply that such payments are highly effective stimulus. Return to text 33. See Bessembinder et al. (2006) and Goldstein et al. (2007). Return to text 34. The 2024 CMS staffing rule for long-term care facilities phases in nurse staffing minimums across facilities at different times, based on geographic and facility-specific factors, allowing for future comparisons across rollout cohorts. Similarly, the Department of Labor's 2024 overtime rule raises salary thresholds in two steps, creating a time-based regression discontinuity that could support evaluation of labor market effects. To date, neither rule has been the subject of published ex-post evaluation exploiting this variation. Return to text 35. The CECL accounting standard was required for entities that meet the definition of an SEC filer as of January 2020, and all other entities were required to adopt CECL by January 2023 (see Financial Accounting Standards Board, 2016). Return to text 36. Stress tests were initially implemented for the largest 19 banks in 2009 (under the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program) and later extended to all banks with more than $50 billion in total assets in 2013, following on the statuary mandate from the Dodd-Frank Act; see Board of Governors (2009, 2013). Return to text 37. In an implementation that combines staggering and tiering, the LCR was initially introduced for the largest firms in 2015:Q1, and, later, a modified LCR was applied to a set of smaller yet large firms starting in 2016:Q1 (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Reserve System, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 2014). Return to text 38. This occasionally happens in medical trials where a treatment is so effective that the study is ended early over ethical concerns about denying potentially life-saving treatment to the control group. See Mueller, Montori, Bassler, Koenig, and Guyatt (2007) for a discussion of this issue. Return to text 39. See Harris et al. (2021) for a description of these and other pilot programs and for several references to studies that were based on these pilot programs. Return to text 40. See Abramowicz, Ayres, and Listokin (2011) for further discussion of the benefits of randomizing laws and regulations. Return to text 41. See Silverman and Chalmers (2001), Erikson and Stoker (2010), Gramlich (2017), and Weldon (2017) for a discussion of public perspectives on fairness in these contexts. Return to text 42. See Rawls (1971) for a discussion of the fairness of equality prior to resolution of uncertainty (i.e., being behind the veil of ignorance). Return to text 43. The Mexican anti-poverty program Progresa/Oportunidades was designed for evaluation using a randomized design. The ongoing program provides cash transfers to poor families based on school attendance and doctor visits (Parker and Todd, 2017). Due to lack of available funds to cover all eligible citizens, Oregon randomized who was covered by a Medicaid expansion in 2008, giving important insights actual benefits of government health insurance (Allen et al, 2010; DeVoe et al, 2015). Return to text 44. The Census Bureau frequently asks multiple versions of a question when introducing a potential question to the American Community Survey. In addition, extensive effort typically goes into the revision of existing questions to validate when and if the new and old series are comparable. See Census Bureau (2020). Return to text 45.

Title: BMO Capital’s AV Expert: Tesla Remains “Significantly Behind” Waymo

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. While Tesla has done its best to create a relentless hype cycle around its just-launched robotaxis, with a curated bunch of Tesla-supporting influencers receiving the first invites to test the service, and their ensuing flowery reports playing an important role in supporting Tesla's share price, the reality is much more nuanced, and lies somewhere in the middle of the sunny optimism emanating from the EV giant's quarters and the literal death knells that its opponents are sounding with an alarming frequency. Now, BMO Capital's Autonomous Vehicle (AV) expert has chimed in with a less-than-flattering view of the performance of Tesla's robotaxis over the past few days. BMO Capital's AV Expert: 'Waymo Is Miles Ahead’ We hosted an autonomous vehicle (AV) expert who previously worked at Waymo and now collaborates with policymakers to advance the AV industry. Our expert suggested that the industry is in the early innings of its commercialization… — Kaushik (@BigBullCap) June 26, 2025 To wit, BMO Capital has now disclosed in its latest note that it recently hosted an AV expert who had previously worked at Waymo and currently advises governments on advancing the AV industry. While conceding that the industry was still in the "early innings" of the ongoing commercialization race, this expert boldly pronounced that Waymo was "miles ahead of the AV competition," ranking Chinese players - Baidu and Pony.ai - as distant seconds, followed by Amazon's Zoox and May Mobility. Critically, according to the AV expert, Tesla remained "significantly behind" Waymo in the rapidly heating AV commercialization race. The expert then points out that a typical driver associated with a given ride-share service undertakes between 15 and 20 rides per day. This contrasts sharply with Waymo's current cadence of between 20 and 25 rides per day. To unlock the economies of scale, however, Waymo will have to scale to 50 rides per day per vehicle, according to this expert. As a refresher, Waymo currently operates an autonomous ride-hailing service in 5 US cities via a fleet of around 1,500 Jaguar I-Pace vehicles, with each such vehicle equipped with an expensive array of sensors, including LiDAR, 360-degree view cameras, and a radar, all feeding into onboard compute resources. On the other hand, Tesla's robotaxis leverage an interconnected neural network along with cameras that are supposedly capable of counting individual photons, although some experts doubt that these cameras are capable of such a feat. Coming back, BMO Capital's AV expert concedes that the expensive LiDAR sensors, which are critical for depth perception, currently remain "a key cost constraint to scaling AVs." The expert asserts that Tesla would be at a distinct advantage if its camera-based, vision-only AV solution were to ultimately prove as effective as Waymo's multiple sensors-based approach. After only 4 days, Tesla's robotaxi service in Austin has already logged one incident of "Safety Concern", giving it a rate of 0.25/day so far. Waymo has 22 Safety Concern incidents since testing began 359 days ago (0.06/day) & 14 since service began in March (0.12/day).$TSLA pic.twitter.com/LryAHvLToX — Motorhead (@BradMunchen) June 26, 2025 We noted in a previous post that the NHTSA has now reportedly contacted Tesla after various videos recently surfaced, showing robotaxis committing various traffic violations, which include failure to adhere to lane discipline as well as speed limit violations. For context, do note that Waymo has logged fewer critical errors over its 10 million completed miles than Tesla has over the past few days, and that too, with a fleet of just 11 robotaxis operating in a geofenced area of Austin, replete with an employee stationed in the front passenger seat and supported by a dedicated team of teleoperators, who are mandated to take over in case of an emergency! Of course, despite all the hype surrounding Tesla's FSD, it is still widely considered a Level 2 autonomous driving system, as opposed to Waymo's, which is classified as a Level 4 system. Not everything is doom and gloom around Tesla, however. For one, the brokerage firm Benchmark has just hiked its target for Tesla shares from $350 to $475, citing the EV giant's demonstration of a "controlled and safety-first approach" to its robotaxis, which can speed up the regulatory approval process. Benchmark goes on to note: "We are a believer in TSLA’s camera-focused approach that is not only cost effective but also scalable." Do note that Tesla has given up the entirety of this week's gains, and is currently trading flat on a 5-day basis. Over the past month, the stock is down around 10 percent.

Title: College graduates face toughest job market in more than a decade as hiring slows

By CHRISTOPHER RUGABER, AP Economics Writer WASHINGTON (AP) — While completing a master’s degree in data analysis, Palwasha Zahid moved from Dallas to a town near Silicon Valley. The location made it easy to visit the campuses of tech stalwarts such as Google, Apple, and Nvidia. Zahid, 25, completed her studies in December, but so far she hasn’t found a job in the industry that surrounds her. “It stings a little bit,” she said. “I never imagined it would be this difficult just to get a foot in the door.” Young people graduating from college this spring and summer are facing one of the toughest job markets in more than a decade. The unemployment rate for degree holders ages 22 to 27 has reached its highest level in a dozen years, excluding the coronavirus pandemic. Joblessness among that group is now higher than the overall unemployment rate, and the gap is larger than it has been in more than three decades. The rise in unemployment has worried many economists as well as officials at the Federal Reserve because it could be an early sign of trouble for the economy. It suggests businesses are holding off on hiring new workers because of rampant uncertainty stemming from the Trump administration’s tariff increases, which could slow growth. “Young people are bearing the brunt of a lot of economic uncertainty,” Brad Hersbein, senior economist at the Upjohn Institute, a labor-focused think tank, said. “The people that you often are most hesitant in hiring when economic conditions are uncertain are entry-level positions.” The growth of artifical intelligence may be playing an additional role by eating away at positions for beginners in white-collar professions such as information technology, finance, and law. Higher unemployment for younger graduates has also renewed concerns about the value of a college degree. More workers than ever have a four-year degree, which makes it less of a distinguishing factor in job applications. Murat Tasci, an economist at JPMorgan, calculates that 45% of workers have a four-year degree, up from 26% in 1992. While the difficulty of finding work has demoralized young people like Zahid, most economists argue that holding a college degree still offers clear lifetime benefits. Graduates earn higher pay and experience much less unemployment over their lifetimes. The overall U.S. unemployment rate is a still-low 4.2%, and the government’s monthly jobs reports show the economy is generating modest job gains. But the additional jobs are concentrated in health care, government, and restaurants and hotels. Job gains in professions with more college grads, such as information technology, legal services, and accounting have languished in the past 12 months. The unemployment rate has stayed low mostly because layoffs are still relatively rare. The actual hiring rate — new hires as a percentage of all jobs — has fallen to 2014 levels, when the unemployment rate was much higher, at 6.2%. Economists call it a no-hire, no-fire economy. For college graduates 22 to 27 years old, the unemployment rate was 5.8% in March — the highest, excluding the pandemic, since 2012, and far above the nationwide rate. Lexie Lindo, 23, saw how reluctant companies were to hire while applying for more than 100 jobs last summer and fall after graduating from Clark Atlanta University with a business degree and 3.8 GPA. She had several summer internships in fields such as logistics and real estate while getting her degree, but no offer came. “Nobody was taking interviews or responding back to any applications that I filled out,” Lindo, who is from Auburn, Georgia, said. “My resume is full, there’s no gaps or anything. Every summer I’m doing something. It’s just, ‘OK, so what else are you looking for?’” She has returned to Clark for a master’s program in supply chain studies and has an internship this summer at a Fortune 500 company in Austin, Texas. She’s hopeful it will lead to a job next year. Artificial intelligence could be a culprit, particularly in IT. Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, has calculated that employment for college graduates 28 and above in computer science and mathematical occupations has increased a slight 0.8% since 2022. For those ages 22 to 27, it has fallen 8%, according to Martin. Company announcements have further fueled concerns. Tobi Lutke, CEO of online commerce software company Shopify, said in an April memo that before requesting new hires, “teams must demonstrate why they cannot get what they want done using AI.” Last week, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said AI would likely reduce the company’s corporate work force over the next few years. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” Jassy said in a message to employees. “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” Zahid worries that AI is hurting her chances. She remembers seeing big billboard ads for AI at the San Francisco airport that asked, “Why hire a human when you could use AI?” Still, many economists argue that blaming AI is premature. Most companies are in the early stages of adopting the technology. Professional networking platform LinkedIn categorized occupations based on their exposure to AI and did not see big hiring differences between professions where AI was more prevalent and where it wasn’t, said Kory Kantenga, the firm’s head of economics for the Americas. “We don’t see any broad-based evidence that AI is having a disproportionate impact in the labor market or even a disproportionate impact on younger workers versus older workers,” Kantenga said. He added that the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes have also slowed hiring in tech. Many IT firms expanded when the Fed pinned its short-term rate at nearly zero after the pandemic. In 2022, the Fed began cranking up rates to combat inflation, which made it harder to borrow and grow. In fact, IT’s hiring spree when rates were low — fueled by millions of Americans ramping up their online shopping and video conferencing — left many firms with too many workers, economists say. Cory Stahle, an economist at the job-listings website Indeed, says postings for software development jobs, for example, have fallen 40% compared with four years ago. It’s a sharp shift for students who began studying computer science when hiring was near its peak. Zahid, who lives in Dublin, California, has experienced this whiplash firsthand. When she entered college in 2019, her father, who is a network engineer, encouraged her to study IT and said it would be easy for her to get a job in the field. She initially studied psychology but decided she wanted something more hands-on and gravitated to data analysis. Her husband, 33, has a software development job, and friends of hers in IT received immediate job offers upon graduation a few years ago. Such rapid hiring seems to have disappeared now, she said. She has her college diploma, but hasn’t hung it up yet. “I will put it up when I actually get a job, confirming that it was worth it all,” she said. AP Writer Matt Sedensky in New York contributed to this report.

Title: NATO’s 5 percent spending pledge is a threat to people and the planet

The alliance’s spending surge will prompt war, cut services and worsen the climate crisis. NATO’s leaders agreed this week to invest 5 percent of their countries’ gross domestic product (GDP) on “core defence requirements as well as defence and security-related spending by 2035”. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte called it a “quantum leap” in spending that would guarantee “freedom and security” for the military alliance’s one billion people. It certainly is historic in terms of military escalation, but will it deliver security – and if so, for whom? The headline demand for 5 percent GDP spending has been so loud, it’s easy to forget that for a long time, many NATO members considered the previous 2 percent goal either unachievable or unimportant. NATO first committed to its 2 percent GDP goal in 2002, but by 2021, only six of its members had achieved it. Yet three years later, 23 members had met the goal and all 32 are expected to comply by the end of 2025. This week, NATO has committed to more than doubling its spending to 5 percent of GDP. This will be partly met through creative accounting and reflects a desire to trumpet a big number to satisfy a petulant President Trump. The 5 percent headline includes 1.5 percent spent on military-related infrastructure, which could be broadly defined to include civilian expenditure. Even so, it reflects a huge escalation of military expenditure over the next decade from an already very high level. Last year, NATO spent $1.5 trillion on the military – more than half of global military spending. If members comply with the core 3.5 percent target by 2030, that would mean a total of $13.4 trillion in military expenditure. It’s an impossible figure to grasp, but if you stacked it in one-dollar bills, you could make almost four piles that reach the moon. It could also be distributed as a one-off cash bonus of $1,674 to every person on the planet. In reality, the money will be diverted – most of all from social and environmental spending – even though 30 percent of Europeans report difficulty in making ends meet and climate scientists warn that we have two years left to keep temperature increases below the international target of 1.5 degrees Celsius (34.7 degrees Fahrenheit). Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who fought for a partial exemption from the 5 percent goal, was the most honest about this costly trade-off: “If we had accepted 5 percent, Spain would have to spend by 2035 an extra 300 billion euros on defence. Where would it come from? From cuts in health and education.” Social and environmental spending is already on the chopping block. In February, the United Kingdom announced it would reduce its aid budget to 0.3 percent of GDP to pay for military spending increases – a year after it won an election committing to increase foreign aid. Belgium, the Netherlands and France followed suit, announcing aid cuts of 25 to 37 percent. The United States, under Trump, has decimated its overseas aid and climate programmes and reduced healthcare funding while proposing a record $1 trillion expenditure on the Pentagon. Europe is falling far behind on its own environmental and social goals, with its primary funding vehicle, the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF), expiring in 2026. The European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) concludes that most European NATO members will be unable to meet the 3.5 percent NATO target without cutting budgets, raising taxes or changing fiscal rules. NATO’s spending spree will not only divert money – it will worsen the climate crisis. As one of the world’s biggest carbon polluters, it is investing in more gas-guzzling jets, tanks and missiles. Military emissions are notoriously hard to track due to limited data, but one report estimates that 3.5 percent of GDP spending would lead to 2,330 million metric tonnes of greenhouse gases by 2030 – roughly the same as the combined annual emissions of Brazil and Japan. NATO’s justification is that increased investment is needed to confront the threats of “Russia” and “terrorism”. Yet there is no rationale behind the 5 percent target or details on why threats to NATO have so drastically increased. Nor is there self-examination on how NATO’s actions partly set the stage for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia has increased military spending, but it still spends 10 times less than NATO. Nor could it catch up militarily with NATO’s 32-strong alliance, given its economy: $2 trillion in 2024 (nominal GDP), compared with $26 trillion for non-US NATO countries and $29 trillion for the US alone. As for “terrorism”, the idea that NATO’s increased spending could deter it ignores the failures of the “War on Terror”, where NATO interventions in Afghanistan and Libya prompted instability and fighter recruitment. The security NATO seems most concerned with is that of its arms firms. Long before Trump’s pressure, arms firms have pushed for higher European military spending through lobbying groups like the AeroSpace and Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD). They have successfully made military security an overriding European Union objective, winning ever more public money for research and industry support. Now they are reaping the rewards with booming revenues and profits. Before the NATO summit, BlackRock released an investment report celebrating the arms industry as a “dynamic growth industry” and a “mega force” that will drive investment trends in the coming years. NATO’s idea of security diverts money from social needs, worsens the climate crisis, rewards arms firms profiting from global conflict, and chooses war over diplomacy. Its bellicose stance in The Hague this week makes it one of the greatest threats to global security – even to life on this planet. It is up to the peoples of NATO countries to reject this deadly path and reclaim security based on cooperation, justice and peace.

Title: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang begins sale of $925M worth of Nvidia stock — sale of 6 million shares barely dents his $123 billion in shares

How many leather jackets can this amount of money buy? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The leather jacket-toting CEO sold 100,000 Nvidia shares last Friday and Monday, marking the start of a planned sale of up to six million shares announced in March of this year. The company’s stock price around that time hovered at $144.56 per share, meaning Mr. Huang just made nearly $15 million over the weekend. Nvidia recently hit a record stock price of $154.31, so the total sale, if the company’s stock price holds, is potentially valued at almost a billion dollars — $925,429,000 to be exact. Despite that massive amount, it is but a drop in the bucket as his estimated net worth is $135 billion, says CNBC, putting him at number 10 on the Forbes list of the world’s richest people (at least at the time of writing). This sale was planned months earlier with the Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, which helps avoid corporate insiders from being accused of insider trading. Huang’s timing is impeccable, though, as his stock sale started execution just as Nvidia’s value hit record highs. This also isn’t the first time that Nvidia’s C-suite has executed an 10b5-1 plan and benefited from its sky-high stock prices. Just last year, its executives and directors sold over $1.8 billion in Nvidia stock, with Jensen raking in $713 million in cash after selling six million shares — the same amount planned for this year. Despite those sales figures, Jensen still owns a substantial amount of Nvidia. According to the SEC filing, he still has over 75 million shares in his direct ownership, plus another 783,375,400 shares owned indirectly through trusts and LLCs. Aside from that, he also received $49.9 million last year in total compensation, which was higher than the $44 million he received in 2023. Nvidia’s massive growth happened within the last couple of years, when the AI boom propelled its stock price to the stratosphere. Its stock price hovered around $5 in the late 2010s, before jumping to around $25 to $30 in 2021 due to the GPU shortages. It dropped back down to $15 in late 2022 before skyrocketing in the years after that due to AI advancements. By late 2024, Nvidia overtook Apple as the world’s most valuable company, making it worth more than Amazon and Meta combined.

Title: 4 Popular Dividends For The Geopolitical Conflicts Unfolding Now

ByBrett Owens ByBrett Owens, Contributor. Military Mission at twilight Let’s talk about oil and gold dividends. Whether or not the new peace in the Middle East holds, there are some high-quality dividends worth owning anytime. These generous payers (up to 8%) provide peace of mind just in case the geopolitical Jenga set gets knocked loose again. We’ll start with crude, which had rallied to one-year highs. I was originally going to advise not chasing the Strait of Hormuz oil rally. Futures indicated (and still do) that lower prices are likely ahead. January 2026 still trades cheaper—suggesting temporary disruption at worst. Back at home, you’ve probably heard (not least from me, often) that President Donald Trump wants a lower fed funds rate To achieve this, he and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent are targeting lower oil (“drill baby, drill”) so that inflation continues to cool and the Fed can ease. Given policymakers’ penchant for deregulation and drilling, it’s best to sidestep the producers here. We have done well owning Exxon Mobil (XOM) in the past but the time to buy the stock is when oil prices are likely to rise. Exxon has grinded sideways since we sold it from our Contrarian Income Report portfolio. Let’s consider Kinder Morgan (KMI) and its 4.2% yield instead. Kinder funds its dividend by “collecting tolls” on its 79,000 miles of pipelines. Crude oil and most notably natural gas flow through Kinder’s North America pipelines. As long as energy moves, the cash flows. A huge 40% of U.S. natural gas flows through Kinder’s systems to 139 company-owned terminals storing petroleum products, chemicals and renewables. With market share like this, Kinder can raise its pricing regularly and therefore boost dividends often too. When the company was founded back in 1997 (or “back in the 1900s” as my kids say) by Richard Kinder and William Morgan, they structured it as a master limited partnership. MLPs issue K-1 forms at tax time, which can be a bit of a headache. Instead of forcing shareholders into a lifetime of tax-time headaches, Kinder converted into a simpler corporation in 2014. Corporations issue a traditional 1099, which is easier for accountants and users of tax software. This move made Kinder more popular and awarded it a perennially higher valuation. For those of us who prefer lower valuations (and higher yields), Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP) is an elite 8% dividend play. Alerian buys MLPs and packages them into one fund, consolidating messy K-1s into a neat 1099 at tax time—a “cheat code” for easy 8% energy dividends. These are salad days for Alerian, too. The fund has raised its dividend for three straight quarters! AMLP Dividend Let’s move on to gold, the “barbarous relic” that investors buy when they feel nervous. We contrarians are bullish because: Creditors will be paid back, because the U.S. owns the global printing press. But they will ultimately receive depreciated dollars due to some “monetization” of this massive debt load. The U.S. dollar is already eroding, falling 28% versus gold year-to-date — 28%! A shiny sign of capital flowing into assets immune to central bank printing. VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX) is a one-click way to play higher gold and lower oil prices. Energy is the main cost input for gold miners. Profit margins will expand from here if gold stays high and oil slumps. A high-quality discounted alternative is GAMCO Global Gold, Natural Resources & Income Trust (GGN), a closed-end fund trading at a 2% discount to its net asset value. About half of the fund’s portfolio sits in mining stocks—both gold and non-gold plays like iron miner Rio Tinto (RIO). Thanks to the deal we can snag these stocks for 98 cents on the dollar. GGN pays a steady 3-cent monthly dividend (8% annualized), giving investors income stability with upside potential. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

June 26, 2025 08:36 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, June 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that it missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has soared back toward its all-time high of $112,000 per bitcoin, up around 50% from its April lows and helped by U.S. president Donald Trump surprising traders with a “massive” crypto prediction. Now, as the crypto market braces for a Congress game-changer predicted to “unleash” trillions, a legendary billionaire has said he expects global “de-dollarization" to catapult the bitcoin price to a $5 trillion market capitalization by 2030—putting it alongside technology giants Nvidia and Microsoft.

"I wake up every day at three in the morning and I’m like, ‘why am I such an idiot? What have I been waiting for, not being involved in [bitcoin]?' And it just goes up and up," Laffont told CNBC, adding that, “sometimes you have to change your mind and you have to say, well, 'I made a mistake.'” According to Laffont, who claims he hasn't bought bitcoin yet, its price could more than double to give bitcoin a market capitalization of over $5 trillion by 2030, with Microsoft forecast to soar to $5.7 trillion and Nvidia to $5.6 trillion.

Title: AMD's AI Moment May Be Coming. Will It Seize It?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. INDONESIA - 2025/06/16: In this photo illustration, the AMD (Advanced Micro Devices) logo is seen ... More displayed on a smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Algi Febri Sugita/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Advanced Micro Devices stock (NASDAQ:AMD) rose nearly 7% during Tuesday trading and approximately 15% year-to-date, as investor confidence grows regarding its role in the AI chip market, with several analysts raising their price targets for the stock. So what exactly has shifted for AMD in recent months? The AI semiconductor industry is vast and continues to grow rapidly. Nvidia has a stronghold in the market and has more than doubled its revenue over the last two years, with the data center GPU market exceeding $100 billion annually. However, AMD does not need to surpass Nvidia to further enhance its stock—it simply needs to increase GPU sales, and an opportunity may be emerging. In the past three years, the AI market has been characterized by significant investments from major tech companies and hyperscalers aiming to create the most advanced frontier AI models. These organizations have focused on performance and training speed, as training large language models necessitates substantial computational resources. This trend has favored Nvidia, which produces the leading chips available and possesses a well-established hardware and software ecosystem among major cloud service providers. Nonetheless, there is a genuine possibility that the rapid enhancements in frontier AI models will eventually reach a plateau. A broader array of AI workloads will transition to inference—essentially applying the developed models to real-world scenarios—where efficiency and cost are more critical than sheer computing power. This situation could represent a chance for AMD. Not all organizations require or can afford Nvidia’s premium GPUs. Many may choose older Nvidia models or more budget-friendly alternatives like AMD’s MI series, which provide adequate memory and solid performance for inference and fine-tuning of models. Additionally, open-source models like Llama from Meta may enable more companies to run their AI workloads on-site, decreasing dependence on costly cloud computing fees. This could also benefit AMD. Meanwhile, Intel is attempting to stage a comeback Can Intel’s 18A Break TSMC’s 2nm Stronghold? At its AI Day event, AMD introduced its MI350 series, set to launch in the second half of 2025, which it claims will deliver four times the AI compute capacity of its predecessor. The company also provided a preview of its MI400 and MI450 chips, furthering its evolving product strategy. Beyond hardware, AMD is developing its AI software and systems stack, positioning itself as a comprehensive AI provider—through its acquisitions of Brium, focused on compiler and AI software optimization, and Enosemi, specializing in silicon photonics. These strategies could also bolster AMD’s ROCm software stack, which follows an open-source, standards-based methodology, contrasting with Nvidia’s proprietary CUDA environment. This could attract enterprises seeking flexibility and lower costs for large-scale AI deployment. AMD recently announced a partnership with Oracle to make its MI355X GPUs available through Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, offering over two times the price-performance advantage compared to previous generations for large-scale AI tasks including inferencing. Nevertheless, risks persist. Cloud providers such as Google and Amazon are developing their own custom AI chips, which could restrict long-term demand for third-party hardware solutions. Nvidia may also intensify focus on more efficient mid-tier chips as the market shifts toward inferencing. Refer to our analysis on AMD Valuation: Is AMD Stock Expensive Or Cheap? for additional insights regarding AMD’s valuation and its comparison with competitors. The significant rise in AMD stock may restrict its potential in the near to medium term. Alternatively, the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices), has produced impressive returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provides a proactive way to capitalize on favorable market conditions while limiting losses when the market declines, as discussed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

(Photo Illustration by Algi Febri Sugita/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Advanced Micro Devices stock (NASDAQ:AMD) rose nearly 7% during Tuesday trading and approximately 15% year-to-date, as investor confidence grows regarding its role in the AI chip market, with several analysts raising their price targets for the stock. So what exactly has shifted for AMD in recent months? The AI semiconductor industry is vast and continues to grow rapidly. Nvidia has a stronghold in the market and has more than doubled its revenue over the last two years, with the data center GPU market exceeding $100 billion annually. However, AMD does not need to surpass Nvidia to further enhance its stock—it simply needs to increase GPU sales, and an opportunity may be emerging. In the past three years, the AI market has been characterized by significant investments from major tech companies and hyperscalers aiming to create the most advanced frontier AI models. These organizations have focused on performance and training speed, as training large language models necessitates substantial computational resources. This trend has favored Nvidia, which produces the leading chips available and possesses a well-established hardware and software ecosystem among major cloud service providers. Nonetheless, there is a genuine possibility that the rapid enhancements in frontier AI models will eventually reach a plateau. A broader array of AI workloads will transition to inference—essentially applying the developed models to real-world scenarios—where efficiency and cost are more critical than sheer computing power. This situation could represent a chance for AMD. Not all organizations require or can afford Nvidia’s premium GPUs. Many may choose older Nvidia models or more budget-friendly alternatives like AMD’s MI series, which provide adequate memory and solid performance for inference and fine-tuning of models. Additionally, open-source models like Llama from Meta may enable more companies to run their AI workloads on-site, decreasing dependence on costly cloud computing fees. This could also benefit AMD. Meanwhile, Intel is attempting to stage a comeback Can Intel’s 18A Break TSMC’s 2nm Stronghold? At its AI Day event, AMD introduced its MI350 series, set to launch in the second half of 2025, which it claims will deliver four times the AI compute capacity of its predecessor. The company also provided a preview of its MI400 and MI450 chips, furthering its evolving product strategy. Beyond hardware, AMD is developing its AI software and systems stack, positioning itself as a comprehensive AI provider—through its acquisitions of Brium, focused on compiler and AI software optimization, and Enosemi, specializing in silicon photonics. These strategies could also bolster AMD’s ROCm software stack, which follows an open-source, standards-based methodology, contrasting with Nvidia’s proprietary CUDA environment. This could attract enterprises seeking flexibility and lower costs for large-scale AI deployment. AMD recently announced a partnership with Oracle to make its MI355X GPUs available through Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, offering over two times the price-performance advantage compared to previous generations for large-scale AI tasks including inferencing. Nevertheless, risks persist. Cloud providers such as Google and Amazon are developing their own custom AI chips, which could restrict long-term demand for third-party hardware solutions. Nvidia may also intensify focus on more efficient mid-tier chips as the market shifts toward inferencing. Refer to our analysis on AMD Valuation: Is AMD Stock Expensive Or Cheap? for additional insights regarding AMD’s valuation and its comparison with competitors. The significant rise in AMD stock may restrict its potential in the near to medium term. Alternatively, the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices), has produced impressive returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provides a proactive way to capitalize on favorable market conditions while limiting losses when the market declines, as discussed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Business Sanjay Mehrotra, CEO of Micron Technology Inc., holds a chip on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., April 26, 2024. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo Micron Technology shares rose 2 per cent in premarket trading on Thursday, after a robust forecast from the chipmaker for fourth-quarter revenue on booming demand for its memory chips that power AI data centers. The company saw a nearly 50 per cent jump in sales of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips for the third quarter compared to the previous three months. Micron is one of the providers of HBM chips besides South Korea's SK Hynix and Samsung "AI servers are giving Micron an over-caffeinated growth spurt... (and) Micron is the only kid on the block shipping HBM3E at scale," said Michael Ashley Schulman, partner at Running Point Capital Advisors. Micron said it will continue to invest in HBM chips which reflects the growing demand from AI chip front runners - Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, who are customers of the company.

Title: 40 People Share The Most Disappointing, And Downright Rude Gifts They Ever Received At Work

Full Content:
by Mike June 26, 2025 Get ready to cringe and laugh as we unveil the tales of 40 people who received gifts at work that were more bewildering than wonderful. From thoughtlessly re-gifted items to presents that made them question their colleagues’ sanity, these stories of disappointing and downright rude gifts are a hilarious reminder that sometimes, it’s truly the thought that counts (or the lack thereof). Imagine unwrapping a box of expired chocolates, or finding a regifted pen with someone else’s name on it â these are just a sneak peek of the gift-giving blunders waiting inside. So, grab your popcorn and prepare for a journey through the wacky world of workplace gifting gone wrong. You’ll either be grateful for your considerate coworkers or find solace knowing you’re not alone in the office gift-giving Hall of Shame! My momâs boss gave everyone a pen (a really cr*ppy, normal pen) with their names printed on normal white printer paper that was scotch taped down the side of the pen. This sounds made up even to me as I type it, but itâs still in our junk drawer. A small, nickel-sized, heart-shaped rock sent in the mail. It was supposed to represent their appreciation for the extra work during Covid. All I could think of was Charlie Brown trick or treating, âI got a rock.â Not me, but one year the company my brother works for gave each employee a CD of the owner playing Christmas songs on the harmonica. A letter from the CEO telling us how he is going to celebrate Christmas with his family up north to go skiing. That was all. Two free tickets to a cinema. The issue was that the closest cinema in that particular chain was about 800 miles away from me. That year the company decided it wasnât going to provide basic office supplies for the break room. Coffee, tea, eating utensils, napkins, nothing. That year for Christmas we all got a brown paper bags fashioned like lunches. Inside was a metal straw, cloth napkin, a child sized set of plastic cutlery that fit in a travel case, a copy paste printed piece of paper with food puns in relation to our job, and a single fun sized hundred grand candy bar. This Fortune 500 company had over a billion in raw profit that year. Oh, and the cutlery ended up getting recalled due to some terrible forever chemicals in them. An email that only upper management would be getting the end of year bonus (sent to entire company by accident instead of just upper management). Then laid off 2 weeks into the new year. Found out from a friend in the company a little while later that the board of directors held a vote. They keep their car allowances at the expense of a wave of layoffs, or lose their car allowances and 10-15 people get to keep their jobs. Pretty sure it was unanimous. No matter how many times a company says youâre family, just remember that itâs the type of family that would gladly cut your throat to make sure the fat cats get to eat. – strike-when-ready Noise-cancelling Bluetooth headphones. I’m sure they were good and useful to some people, but I’m legally deaf. We were told we were receiving our Christmas bonuses soon, and then we were all given a poinsettia. The poinsettia in itself wasnât so bad, mine is actually still alive years later, but the fact that they had the audacity to call it a bonus was absurd. Jelly of the Month membership instead of my Christmas bonus. I wanted to put a pool in the backyard but nope. – inkyblinkypinkysue I was gifted a ham for the holidaysâ¦..Iâm Jewish. Not me but a friend – all staff at the hospital received a kitchen scrubby for Christmas. Not even themed. Just random browns, greens, pinks, and yellows… seems like the boss bought dollar store multi-packs and opened them to give everyone one piece. Nurses Week 2022 (height of Delta wave COVID). We were given rocks on a keychain. The rock was engraved with the word âHopeâ. We might have gotten some chapstick too. New owners this year. Old owner gave us 10% of our salary as a year end bonus. New guys gave us $100 amazon cards that were drained by the time we got them. Everyone was pissed but didn’t wanna say anything so I did. He asked everyone and they claimed to be delighted with their cards. Spineless bastards. Lmao. – dankasaurus710 Company coffee mug with the company name misspelled. It was a large company. Teacher here. One year, as our Christmas bonus, we got a defective plastic keychain that read “I love teching!” Spelled exactly like that. Normally, I’m not one to look a gift horse in the mouth.. but after the s**t we had been through, with zero support from admin, s**t pay, disrespect, etc. the keychain set us all off. It was adding insult to injury. Like, not only is our “bonus” a keychain that didn’t even work (the hasp had no spring), but the spelling error meant that a) someone didn’t even check them when they arrived, and b) someone put them in every teacher mailbox without looking at them. Admin sent out an email that basically said turn your keychains back in so they could send them back and get corrected ones. So, adding insult to injury. I appreciated the sentiment, but all of us could’ve done without that. An ultra-religious self-help book so we could become less miserable, incompetent and immoral. During the pandemic, my partnerâs company sent employees each an envelope through the mail with a sticker in it for some appreciation week I laughed so hard at that. It literally was a sticker that said âhappy appreciation weekâ. A coin commemorating a billion dollars in sales. I was re-gifted a gift basket given to my boss by a client and he forgot to remove the card that was addressed to him. Starbucks gift card that had no money on it and they had no receipt for it. Not me but a coworker at last year’s raffle got a Nintendo DS cleaning kit. For a normal Nintendo DS, not even a 3DS. They aren’t being made anymore. A pack of 10 tissues at the onset of COVID. Expired food. My last job the company broke all sorts of financial records and gave everyone a very expensive glass thing with a decal of the refinery. Not only did it suck but all employees ended having to pay 75 dollars in taxes on it. So the ‘job well done’ cost 75 bucks. – Logic_rocks I used to work in a record shop in the UK and usually got a bottle of wine as a Christmas bonus. Then the company was bought by Virgin and our Christmas bonus was a copy of Richard Branson’s (Virgin’s CEO) autobiography. 5 dollar Subway gift card. My boss made me come in on an off day to pick up because, âshe did not want me missing the company bonusâ. I really wonder if our managers need how much was on the cards? We talked about it for months. A long sleeve denim shirt with the company logo in the front above one of the front pockets.. In Florida. Plus we couldnât wear denim at work so the only time weâd be able to wear the company shirt is on our own time (not happening) or when weâd have dress down day (again not happening). When a coworker inquired where we could wear this since we canât wear it to work they listed places (like a BBQ joint, the movies, etc.) and said we should be grateful since most places donât give their employees gifts. It was a call center. Couldâve given a blanket (since it was cold in the center), travel mug, anything except a shirt we canât wear. – jennabellie A compulsory invitation to the holiday party. Technically, I wasn’t required to attend but it was a career-killer if you didn’t. I had to spend money on a dress just for the party since I didn’t have anything that was suitable, so not only did it cost *me* money, but I had to spend a precious evening pretending I liked my coworkers. – Particular-Natural12 A pink slip. And I don’t mean lingerie. TableAssault: A pink slip (in the US anyway) can be a notice of termination of employment or the title to a vehicle. Iâm guessing OP didnât get a new car as a gift, soâ¦ got fired. – ElvinBishop A cheap plastic key ring with the company logo on it after working 16-hour days for months to win a massive contract. No overtime paid either. An email from the boss saying he is donating “on behalf of the company” to a charity he is a chairman of. At a company Christmas party they would raffle off prizes; one prize for each person. They guy in front of me won a Budweiser mini fridge with LED lights. The guy after me won a LG flat-screen TV. My prize? A Pepsi baseball hat with broken snaps. – startinearly The first company I worked for out of college gave everyone a âfree turkeyâ around the holidays. It wasnât really a free turkey, it was a $25 gift certificate to a grocery store that was inconvenient for 75% of the people working there. And $25 didnât cover a turkey, of course. Turns out, the company owners had a stake in the store. – truthcopy A bottle of our restaurantâs âsignatureâ steak sauce that no one really liked and that we all had free access to all day, every day at work. This was instead of the standard $100 cash bonus we normally got yearly. – LadyLixerwyfe Welcome back in office postcard after the pandemic work from home period. Weâve got it minutes after receiving termination letters. Like I was fully expecting it but still it was in a poor taste. – jivow Nothing. And I work for a giant company. Not surprised though. The MD of the company bought himself a boat âfor the companyâ. We didnât get a bonus that year. – Thisoneissfwihope Worked for FritoLay. Went to the corporate headquarters and in my hotel room was a bag of FritoLay snack, all expired. – Zeus2068123 Mike Primavera is a Chicago-based comedy writer even though he doesn't HAVE to work.

This allows investors to access private markets with simplicity and efficiency similar to traditional public markets. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. Bryan Crawford, group head of investment & client solutions and member of the Authorized Management Committee at Quintet, said: “Diversification is a cornerstone of portfolio resilience, especially during periods of heightened volatility. “We are therefore delighted to partner with BlackRock to integrate exposure to private markets in client portfolios, supporting increased diversification and creating new opportunities to access long-term growth themes.” Quintet’s private markets offering includes BlackRock’s private markets platform, which manages over €600bn in assets pro forma across multi-alternatives and private equity strategies for investors in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia-Pacific. BlackRock EMEA Wealth Alternatives Specialists Team head Fabio Osta said: “By supporting the integration of private markets into wealth portfolios, we are making investing in alternatives easier and more accessible for a broader range of investors so they can benefit from the typically higher returns and diversification the asset class offers.” This announcement follows Quintet’s launch of multi-manager UCITS funds last year, also co-designed with BlackRock. These actively managed, single-asset-class funds, exclusive to Quintet clients, combine third-party managers to enhance diversification and portfolio performance. Earlier this year, Quintet introduced Future+, a sustainable investment mandate developed with BlackRock, adhering to its environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles.

Title: College graduates face toughest job market in more than a decade as hiring slows
URL: https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/college-graduates-face-toughest-job-market-decade-hiring-123221189
Time Published: 2025-06-26T09:46:25Z
Full Content:
Young people graduating from college this spring and summer are facing one of the toughest job markets in more than a decade WASHINGTON -- While completing a master’s degree in data analysis, Palwasha Zahid moved from Dallas to a town near Silicon Valley. The location made it easy to visit the campuses of tech stalwarts such as Google, Apple, and Nvidia. Zahid, 25, completed her studies in December, but so far she hasn't found a job in the industry that surrounds her. “It stings a little bit,” she said. “I never imagined it would be this difficult just to get a foot in the door.” Young people graduating from college this spring and summer are facing one of the toughest job markets in more than a decade. The unemployment rate for degree holders ages 22 to 27 has reached its highest level in a dozen years, excluding the coronavirus pandemic. Joblessness among that group is now higher than the overall unemployment rate, and the gap is larger than it has been in more than three decades. The rise in unemployment has worried many economists as well as officials at the Federal Reserve because it could be an early sign of trouble for the economy. It suggests businesses are holding off on hiring new workers because of rampant uncertainty stemming from the Trump administration's tariff increases, which could slow growth. “Young people are bearing the brunt of a lot of economic uncertainty,” Brad Hersbein, senior economist at the Upjohn Institute, a labor-focused think tank, said. “The people that you often are most hesitant in hiring when economic conditions are uncertain are entry-level positions.” The growth of artificial intelligence may be playing an additional role by eating away at positions for beginners in white-collar professions such as information technology, finance, and law. Higher unemployment for younger graduates has also renewed concerns about the value of a college degree. More workers than ever have a four-year degree, which makes it less of a distinguishing factor in job applications. Murat Tasci, an economist at JPMorgan, calculates that 45% of workers have a four-year degree, up from 26% in 1992. While the difficulty of finding work has demoralized young people like Zahid, most economists argue that holding a college degree still offers clear lifetime benefits. Graduates earn higher pay and experience much less unemployment over their lifetimes. The overall U.S. unemployment rate is a still-low 4.2%, and the government's monthly jobs reports show the economy is generating modest job gains. But the additional jobs are concentrated in health care, government, and restaurants and hotels. Job gains in professions with more college grads, such as information technology, legal services, and accounting have languished in the past 12 months. The unemployment rate has stayed low mostly because layoffs are still relatively rare. The actual hiring rate — new hires as a percentage of all jobs — has fallen to 2014 levels, when the unemployment rate was much higher, at 6.2%. Economists call it a no-hire, no-fire economy. For college graduates 22 to 27 years old, the unemployment rate was 5.8% in March — the highest, excluding the pandemic, since 2012, and far above the nationwide rate. Lexie Lindo, 23, saw how reluctant companies were to hire while applying for more than 100 jobs last summer and fall after graduating from Clark Atlanta University with a business degree and 3.8 GPA. She had several summer internships in fields such as logistics and real estate while getting her degree, but no offer came. “Nobody was taking interviews or responding back to any applications that I filled out,” Lindo, who is from Auburn, Georgia, said. "My resume is full, there’s no gaps or anything. Every summer I’m doing something. It’s just, ‘OK, so what else are you looking for?’” She has returned to Clark for a master's program in supply chain studies and has an internship this summer at a Fortune 500 company in Austin, Texas. She's hopeful it will lead to a job next year. Artificial intelligence could be a culprit, particularly in IT. Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, has calculated that employment for college graduates 28 and above in computer science and mathematical occupations has increased a slight 0.8% since 2022. For those ages 22 to 27, it has fallen 8%, according to Martin. Company announcements have further fueled concerns. Tobi Lutke, CEO of online commerce software company Shopify, said in an April memo that before requesting new hires, “teams must demonstrate why they cannot get what they want done using AI.” Last week, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said AI would likely reduce the company's corporate workforce over the next few years. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” Jassy said in a message to employees. “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” Zahid worries that AI is hurting her chances. She remembers seeing big billboard ads for AI at the San Francisco airport that asked, “Why hire a human when you could use AI?” Still, many economists argue that blaming AI is premature. Most companies are in the early stages of adopting the technology. Professional networking platform LinkedIn categorized occupations based on their exposure to AI and did not see big hiring differences between professions where AI was more prevalent and where it wasn't, said Kory Kantenga, the firm's head of economics for the Americas. “We don’t see any broad-based evidence that AI is having a disproportionate impact in the labor market or even a disproportionate impact on younger workers versus older workers,” Kantenga said. He added that the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes have also slowed hiring in tech. Many IT firms expanded when the Fed pinned its short-term rate at nearly zero after the pandemic. In 2022, the Fed began cranking up rates to combat inflation, which made it harder to borrow and grow. In fact, IT's hiring spree when rates were low — fueled by millions of Americans ramping up their online shopping and video conferencing — left many firms with too many workers, economists say. Cory Stahle, an economist at the job-listings website Indeed, says postings for software development jobs, for example, have fallen 40% compared with four years ago. It's a sharp shift for students who began studying computer science when hiring was near its peak. Zahid, who lives in Dublin, California, has experienced this whiplash firsthand. When she entered college in 2019, her father, who is a network engineer, encouraged her to study IT and said it would be easy for her to get a job in the field. She initially studied psychology but decided she wanted something more hands-on and gravitated to data analysis. Her husband, 33, has a software development job, and friends of hers in IT received immediate job offers upon graduation a few years ago. Such rapid hiring seems to have disappeared now, she said. She has her college diploma, but hasn't hung it up yet. “I will put it up when I actually get a job, confirming that it was worth it all,” she said. ___ AP Writer Matt Sedensky in New York contributed to this report. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

June 26, 2025 05:45 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, June 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Cryogenic Insulation Market Opportunities and Strategies to 2034" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The cryogenic insulation market is projected for significant expansion from 2019 to 2034, with comprehensive insights into regional dynamics and economic impacts. This growing sector reached a value of approximately $7.05 billion in 2024, recording a CAGR of 4.16% since 2019. The market is expected to rise further, reaching $9.52 billion by 2029 at a CAGR of 6.18% and projecting continued growth to $12.42 billion by 2034 with a CAGR of 5.46%. Historically, growth drivers included aerospace expansion, increased demand for cold chain logistics, and governmental policy support. However, the market faced challenges from stringent insulation material regulations. Looking forward, the market is poised to benefit from rising LNG demand, expanding industrial gas applications, and clean energy initiatives, although high initial investment costs and supply chain disruptions could pose challenges. In 2024, Asia-Pacific dominated the cryogenic insulation market, contributing $2.87 billion (40.67%) of the total. Continued growth is anticipated in Asia-Pacific and Western Europe, with CAGRs of 7.47% and 6.09% respectively. Other promising markets include the Middle East and South America, expected to grow at CAGRs of 5.78% and 5.45% respectively. The market landscape remains fragmented, with the top ten competitors holding a combined 24.15% share in 2023. BASF SE led the sector with a 3.57% market share, closely followed by players like Armacell International Holding GmbH and Lydall Inc. Product segmentation includes cellular, fibrous, flake, granular, reflective, and other types, with cellular being the largest segment (50.73% in 2024) and reflective expected to show the fastest growth (CAGR of 7.90% from 2024 to 2029). In terms of application, storage tanks represented the largest segment (36.75% in 2024), while the terminals segment promises rapid growth (CAGR 6.96%). The energy and power industry remains the primary end-use sector, with the anticipated accelerated growth at a CAGR of 7.25% by 2029. Significant opportunities exist across segments, particularly in the cellular market (projected $1.3 billion gain by 2029) and storage tanks ($1.0 billion). The energy segment alone could see a $1.14 billion increase by 2029. Notably, China is poised to gain $606.38 million within the sector. Strategic approaches for market players include developing partnerships to enhance innovation, advancing hydrogen storage solutions, and launching high-performance insulation panels. Companies are advised to implement pricing strategies, expand digitally, and leverage partnerships for added value.

Title: How Amazon, Duolingo, Spotify, and Others Say AI Will Reshape Staffing
URL: https://www.adweek.com/media/amazon-duolingo-spotify-ai-reshape-staffing/
Time Published: 2025-06-26T07:02:23Z
Full Content:
Tech companies once blamed layoffs on overhiring and market shifts—now it’s AI. Recent statements from firms like Amazon, Shopify, British Telecom, Duolingo, and Klarna suggest that automation is reducing demand for human workers. As these companies pour heavily into AI, they’re simultaneously streamlining costs mostly through layoffs. In 2024, 549 tech firms laid off approximately 152,000 employees, according to Layoffs.fyi. At the same time, many CEOs are championing “AI-first” strategies and touting productivity gains. But the workforce may not be ready, with only 62% of employees having received any AI-related training, even as companies push to scale AI across their operations, according to Gartner. “We’re at this moment where making big statements is about getting attention and drawing focus to the fact that AI is being used for real business impact,” Gartner vp analyst Nicole Greene told ADWEEK. “Rather than the tangible, long-term conversation around what does it really look like to re-skill and up-skill talent for a modern workforce.” Former Publicis chief strategist and growth officer Rishad Tobaccowala said the shift is also about rebalancing power. Companies may need 20% to 25% fewer people for the same output, he said, but that future will rely on a new kind of worker, one who can collaborate with AI. “People are talking about AI strategy… that’s the stupidest thing in the world,” he said. “You need to figure out how your entire strategy is changed because of AI.” Here’s what company leaders have said publicly about how they believe AI will impact their workforce, in alphabetical order. Amazon Action: Since 2022, Amazon has laid off more than 27,000 employees across multiple divisions. While the company initially cited macroeconomic uncertainty, recent statements from leadership suggest AI is becoming a key factor in how it envisions future staffing. What it said: In a June blog post, CEO Andy Jassy pointed to the company’s deep investment in generative AI—highlighting over 1,000 services and applications in progress—and signaled a shift in how work gets done. “As we roll out more generative AI and agents,” he wrote, “it should change the way our work is done… [and] we’ll need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today.” While Jassy didn’t specify which roles would be affected, he noted that the company expects to see workforce reductions in the coming years as it leans into AI-driven efficiency. Jassy also pointed to advertising as a clear example of AI integration, citing Amazon’s suite of tools that help brands plan, onboard, create, and optimize campaigns, used by over 50,000 advertisers in Q1. British Telecom Action: British Telecom plans to cut 55,000 jobs by 2030, roughly 40% of its 130,000-person workforce. Of those, at least 10,000 roles could be replaced by AI, according to The Financial Times. What it said: CEO Allison Kirkby told FT the company is exploring the full impact of AI and suggested that, “depending on what we learn from AI … there may be an opportunity for BT to be even smaller by the end of the decade.” The company has already begun integrating generative AI into customer-facing roles, including sales and support operations. Duolingo Action: Cut around 10% of its contractor workforce in 2023, as it turns to AI models like OpenAI’s GPT-4 to streamline content production and translations. What it said: CEO Luis von Ahn has positioned the company as “AI-first,” saying that achieving that vision means rethinking “much of how we work,” and “making minor tweaks to systems designed for humans won’t get us there.” As part of the shift, Duolingo is placing “constructive constraints” on hiring: headcount will only be approved if a team “cannot automate more of their work.” The company is also experimenting with AI in hiring and performance reviews. Klarna Action: Klarna has reduced its workforce by about 40%, with CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski telling CNBC in May that the cuts are largely due to AI. The Swedish fintech company previously said it planned to shrink its headcount from 3,800 to 2,000 employees over the next few years. The company posted a $99 million loss in Q1, attributing it to one-off costs related to depreciation, share-based payments, and restructuring. What it said: In marketing specifically, CMO David Sandström told ADWEEK that team size reductions were driven in part by the growing capabilities of generative AI, and that further cuts could follow as the technology evolves. Shopify Action: Shopify has trimmed its workforce in the last two years, first by 14% in 2022, followed by another 20% in 2023. The company ended 2024 with 8,100 employees, down from 8,300 the previous year, per the company’s filing. What it said: In a memo to employees, which CEO Tobi Lütke posted on X, Shopify laid out a new baseline: “Reflexive AI usage,” in other words, all staffers tinkering with AI, is now expected across the company. Teams requesting headcount must first explain why the work can’t be done with AI. “What would this area look like if autonomous AI agents were already part of the team?” Lütke wrote. The company also said it plans to add AI-related questions to its performance and peer review processes. Trishla is an Adweek staff reporter covering tech policy.

Title: Will AI really shrink workforces as Amazon boss says?
URL: https://www.dw.com/en/will-ai-really-shrink-workforces-as-amazon-boss-says/a-73029384

Andy Jassy is not the first executive to warn about the broader adoption of artificial intelligence and how it will fundamentally reshape the workforce. Are the doomsayers right? Amazon CEO Andy Jassy recently announced that his company would reduce its workforce as artificial intelligence (AI) replaces human employees. He also warned that AI will affect a wide range of jobs and sectors. Jassy is not alone, as many other tech firms have issued similar warnings about how AI breakthroughs could reshape their workforce. In May, the CEO of the AI startup Anthropic told the Arlington, Virginia-based American news website Axios that AI could eliminate half of all entry-level white-collar jobs in the next one to five years. US public companies have reduced the number of their white-collar staff by a collective 3.5% over the past three years, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing employment data provider Live Data Technologies. Over the past decade, one in five companies in the S&P 500 have shrunk, it said. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Several tech companies, including Microsoft, Hewlett Packard and Procter & Gamble, have announced layoffs of thousands of workers over the past several months. Recently, retail service provider Shopify said teams requesting additional staff would first need to prove that AI could not perform the tasks. Duolingo, a language-learning app, also plans to gradually replace its external workers with AI. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has estimated that a quarter of jobs worldwide are at a high risk of being replaced by AI automation. But AI is also expected to create new opportunities and boost productivity. A report by the World Economic Forum earlier this year forecast that technological transformation would displace about 92 million existing jobs by 2030, while creating 170 million new ones. Jobs in developed economies will likely be more affected by AI than those in developing ones. A study published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) last year found that the technology could affect 60% of jobs in developed economies — around half of them negatively, while the other half will see a positive impact. The report concluded that about 40% of jobs in emerging markets and 26% of jobs in low-income countries would be hit. But while these labor markets may see a smaller initial impact from AI, they are also less likely to benefit from the increased productivity that AI promises. During past technological breakthroughs, lower-skilled and blue-collar workers bore the brunt, such as workers on factory floors being replaced by robots. However, broad AI adoption is expected to hit higher-educated, white-collar workers hard, particularly those with tasks that AI could perform at a similar or better quality than a human worker. A study conducted by the Pew Research Center in the US found that occupations involving information gathering and data analysis, such as web developers, technical writers, accountants and data entry workers, among others, would be at high risk of being replaced by AI. Labor-intensive jobs that can't be easily automated, like construction workers, child care workers and firefighters, are expected to remain the most resilient. The possibility of massive job losses has triggered concerns over the disruptive effects of AI on employment and society, drawing the attention of politicians and even religious leaders. Pope Leo XIV, who became the head of the Catholic Church in May, has warned of the threat posed by AI to jobs and human dignity. Labor market expert Enzo Weber from the Institute of Employment Research in Nuremberg, Germany, believes the concerns over job losses are misplaced. Speaking with DW, he said AI advancements open up a wide range of economic possibilities and are more likely to help workers than cause mass unemployment. "AI primarily changes work, but it does not fundamentally eliminate it," said Weber, adding that the technology in most cases helps human workers "develop new tasks and perform their tasks better rather than just replacing them." A paper published in January by Harvard economists David Deming, Christopher Ong and Lawrence H. Summers shared a similar view. The economists argued that the automation of individual job tasks "does not necessarily reduce employment" and may even lead to "job gains in some sectors" of the economy. "In principle, being able to automate a previously onerous task could make workers so much more productive that the increased output offsets the fact that some of their work is now being done by a machine," they stated in the paper. Stressing that the impact of AI is likely to be "widespread and long-lasting," they also wrote that "history teaches us that even if AI disrupts the labor market, its impact will unfold over many decades." Given that artificial intelligence technology is still in its early stages, its precise longer-term impact on global labor markets remains uncertain. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video The efficacy of many AI tools will also depend on how well they are integrated into workplaces, and the willingness and ability of workers to use them. If workers refrain from making full use of AI out of concern for their jobs, it could compromise the productivity boost the new technology promises. Labor market expert Weber urged companies and workers to adapt to the changing technology landscape and seize the opportunities because for him AI technology is a "game changer." "This [technology] presents opportunities, but they need to be seized. Further development and active training of workers are essential. Not just to keep pace, but to get as far ahead as possible."

Title: Bitcoin's Bull Case Strengthens as Dollar Index Slides, Nvidia Hits Record High Amid Recession Cues

Bitcoin's BTC$107,394.48 price has rebounded nearly 10% from weekend lows, with key developments in traditional markets supporting the case for continued gains ahead. The dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against major fiat currencies, dropped to 97.27 early Thursday, the lowest level since February 2022, according to data source TradingView. The decline follows growing calls for a July Fed rate cut and disappointing data on housing and consumer confidence. The weakening of the dollar, a global reserve currency, tends to ease financial conditions, galvanizing increased risk-taking in financial markets. "DXY [is] now at the lowest level since March 2022. Very bullish implications for global money supply growth and bitcoin," Andre Dragosch, director, head of research - Europe at Bitwise, said on X. Meanwhile, shares in Nvidia (NVDA), a bellwether for all things AI and emerging technologies, rose 4%.33% Wednesday, hitting a record high of $154.30. Both NVDA and BTC bottomed out in late 2022 and have been in an uptrend ever since. As of the time of writing, the 90-day correlation coefficient between NVDA and BTC was 0.80, indicating a strong positive relationship between the two assets. NVDA's record high came a day after the Nasdaq futures formed a bullish golden cross, signaling a continued risk-on rally. The yield on the U.S. two-year note, which is more sensitive to interest rate expectations, dropped to 3.76% early today, the lowest since May 2. The yield has declined by 24 basis points this month. Meanwhile, the 10-year yield has declined by 16 basis points to 4.27%. As such, the spread between the 10- and two-year yields has widened in a move known as the steepening of the yield curve. Historically, recessions have begun with the two-year yield falling alongside a steepening of the yield curve, as noted by wealth advisor Kurt S. Altrichter on X. "We’re not there yet, but we’re dancing on the edge. The 10Y-2Y spread is bull-steepening. If the 2Y breaks lower, it signals the Fed has lost control. That’s your cue. Watch it closely," Altrichter said. Consumer confidence dropped last month to a reading of 93, registering a 5.4-point decline from May, with Republican party respondents leading the decline, according to data released by the Conference Board on Tuesday. More importantly, the expectations index, which represents the short-term outlook, slipped to 69, well below the 80 threshold that typically signals an impending recession. These developments, coupled with the oil price slide and the talk of a July rate cut by some Fed officials, have likely prompted traders to price in an early rate cut by the Fed. According to the CME's FedWatch tool. According to Bloomberg, interest rate swaps are now pricing around four basis points of easing into the July Fed meeting, up from near zero a week ago. Furthermore, traders anticipate a combined 60 basis points of easing over the remaining four meetings this year, up from 45 basis points a week ago.

Title: How To Care About Your Job When It Doesn't Care About You

We all want to do awesome things and make an impact at work. However, what we call “work” is a relationship between employer and employee that’s inherently and persistently designed to benefit the former over the latter. How do we meaningfully contribute, earn a living, and maybe even enjoy ourselves when the organization simply does not care about us? It’s harsh, but that’s captialism, baby! Any organization (“org”) exists for a purpose that’s greater than the individuals within it (e.g., profit, public service). We are a means to that end. Same goes for anything we personally get out of the arrangement be it salary, experience, foosball tables, or free lunches. This precarious and lopsided power dynamic manifests itself in our day-to-day in a variety of weird ways we often take for granted. Even if it never gets to something as extreme as layoffs or restructuring we still have to navigate this as best we can. We need to do our best work possible all while one tiny fact looms in the back of our minds. At the end of the day we’re just line items on somebody’s spreadsheet. One prevailing assumption that crumbles under the slightest scrutiny is that an org is a cohesive entity. We all know deep down it’s merely a collective made up of people, and yet we overlook this all the time. Heaven help us all if the company refers to itself as family. Ugh! If an employer ever says “We’re like a family here” what they mean is they’re going to ruin you psychologically The head of the collective—executive leadership—isn’t a single brain. It could be 3, 5, or 7 brains all trying to act like a cohesive unit. But if you personally had 7 brains inside your head how do you think you’d come across to others? Companies are not rational actors. Anything an org does is just an emergent property of humans trying to work together. Organizations, especially large ones, are not optimizing for complete or perfect decisions. They’re optimizing for as much alignment and consensus as they can get to keep moving (sometimes by fiat). By necessity these decisions will always be suboptimal and that will infuriate workers who care about what they do. Most of these decisions will not make sense because we can’t interpret a collective action as if it came from an individual. Rich Gilbert nails it in his great video “Caring Less About Work can get us what we really want”: If you’re going to work and and you’re getting frustrated and you’re intelligent and you’re looking around at all the dummies around that are not making the right decision, that is by design. We can plead, “How could they DO this?” or complain, “This is a dumb decision,” but executive leadership really is at arm’s length to us and our work. Leadership lacks the detail we regularly see in the course of our work and they’re dealing in the abstract. Actions from leadership will therefore often feel extreme, sudden, swift, half-baked, reactive, fickle, or temperamental. The ultimate effect is that the org doesn’t care about us. One could even argue that it cannot care about us. An org is operating on another plane of reality entirely. Whatever it “does” says nothing about the individuals along for the ride. We’re better off not trying to interpret its actions too closely, lest we break our brains. Most of the time Hanlon’s razor explains the dysfunction we see, but the nature of orgs can also provide temptation or cover for some willful disregard and gaslighting. A good example of gaslighting might be a lack of true upward mobility. Does the company promote often? Or does it say it will and then take forever to actually do it? How about raises—do they even happen and how are they calculated? Does the company promote from within or does it recruit a higher position with a new joiner? That’s the carrot, but the stick is far worse! We’re always on the chopping block whether we know it or not. Not even management or the CTO are safe. Layoffs are ever-present and come in several forms. If we’re unlucky enough to work somewhere that does stack ranking (e.g., Microsoft, Meta, Shopify) we can kinda sorta at least see it coming. Yay? Despite all evidence to the contrary CEOs absolutely love this shit. They definitely do not care who’s let go and for those who remain—until the next quarter—they don’t care about the paranoia or distrust it causes. When I interviewed at Meta, they had me do interviews with four engineers, seemingly chosen at random from within the company. The last guy had been there by far the longest. I asked him “What’s it like to work there?” and he said “Oh, working here will rewire your brain.” Maybe stack ranking is too cumbersome… Probably best to just do layoffs arbitrarily. The company doesn’t even need to be in trouble! Entirely profitable companies can do layoffs, often more than once and with impunity. It’s a great flex for shareholders—so trendy that the stock price might go down if CEOs don’t do it. WTF? As Anil Dash notes this is more than just cutting costs: Big tech CEOs and VCs really love performing for each other. We know they hang out in group chats like high schoolers, preening and sending each other texts, each trying to make sure they’re all wearing the latest fashions, whether it’s a gold chain or a MAGA hat or just repeating a phrase that they heard from another founder. The “return to office” push is another such trend. There’s no positive intepretation for it that has any basis in our post-2020 reality. Even supposing it’s not a “quiet layoff” it’s still not good. Executives continue to poke this bear—up to a full 5 days a week in a physical office—and when we go along with it then the org knows it can do almost anything it wants to us. And perhaps the darkest trend in recent times is the holy grail for CEOs—not hiring people in the first place. when a leader says human workers are a source of “bottlenecks”, and that automation is the source of “solutions”, pay very, very, very close attention If people think “AI” can meaningfully replace human developers, we’re in for a reckoning very soon. For one, we need junior developers and senior developers cannot exist in a vacuum. A generational talent gap is coming. For another, worsening software quality will erode and ruin companies. We’re left to ride this wave until orgs finally comprehend that developers do more than just produce code. Ahem, that last section got a little negative! However, a sober acknowledgment of the circumstances around us is the first step in loving our jobs. Yes, really. We can throw up our hands and lament that we’re just cogs in the machine, but I prefer to turn that idiom on its head a bit. It’s an apt metaphor. I’m just one gear of many. I have limited capabilities as do my neighbouring gears—I can rotate clockwise or counterclockwise. When I do something my neighbours react in turn, and vice versa. We come in different sizes and shapes resulting in differences in torque transmission, rotational speed, and so on. My direct neighbours are very obviously cooperating with me as our teeth are interlocking. Conversely, the further away a gear is from me the less direct, and evident, our influence on each other becomes. The overall machine from my point of view begins to act strangely, resists me, or jams up completely. This actual machine would certainly be useless if it were real. The point is there’s little sense in struggling over the distant cogs but there’s plenty to focus on right around us. The concentric circles of concern, influence, and control, popularized by Stephen Covey, is a famous framework for personal effectiveness and decision-making that translates extremely well to the context of an org. The org overall is our circle of concern—it completely surrounds us but is so far removed that we can only observe and adapt to it in relatively minor ways. What this means is we can put the overall organization and its shenanigans in the back of our minds while we optimize our local relationships and maximize our job satisfaction with real people and meaningful tasks. This is within our circle of influence. Namely, this is our manager, our reports, and our peers or teammates. We should figure out what our manager needs in order to perform their job and then become their ally towards those causes. This feedback loop builds trust very quickly and we’ll feel more empowered. Our boss also acts as a “canary in the coal mine”—if they’re comfortable in the org maybe we can be, too. Quick note: the advice above only works if our boss is a true leader and has our backs. If they’re driven by ego or more interested in licking executives’ boots, fuck 'em. If we ourselves have direct reports, then we practice servant leadership and put as much energy into these relationships as we can. Listen to them every day, figure out what they need, and collaborate with them on those actions. I know I became the leader I am today thanks to my reports. Obviously we spend most of our time with our fellow developers, designers, architects, QAs, product managers, analysts, and so on. These are the people, on a daily basis, that we want to impress and be impressed by. Ideally, they’re just plain fun to hang out with, too! Never underestimate how much job satisfaction can be derived from the mutual respect and admiration among people who like each other and are operating at the top of their game. This is the real company that we work for, as it were. It’s a subset of the overall org that we can readily interpret because none of it is abstract. It also means we don’t have to withdraw or disengage under the crushing weight of organizational nonsense. There will always be a venue where we can practice core principles—empathy, support, excellence, collaboration, camaraderie—and that means we can still grow our careers and our networks. Once we’ve drawn our local boundaries we know where to best apply ourselves. However, we also need to understand our individual boundaries, or rather how much we apply ourselves. This is within our circle of control. We start by not volunteering at work. We already have a job that we get paid for, so anything beyond that is extra work and in case I haven’t been clear so far—the org won’t care. Despite our best intentions, such work will be thankless and the law of diminishing returns will slap us in the face so hard we’ll get whiplash. We can do ourselves some serious lasting damage if we don’t exercise a healthy level of self-discipline. If you push yourself to your limits and burn out for a company, you are trading years of your future productivity for minor gains in the present. This isn’t the same as coasting, holding back, or phoning it in. There are plenty of ways to do a lot of good work within our circle of control. Indeed, it’s the only thing we truly control—applying our skills and abilities and getting direct satisfaction from that. There will always be times where we feel an urge to do more than asked, show some initiative, or simply seek appreciation from those beyond our circle of influence. We can indulge these urges, if we want, but we must be mindful. Whenever we’re doing extra work it should be clear to us why we’re doing it. The simplest (and least likely) reason to “volunteer” ourselves is because the org compensates us for it. What? It could happen! Maybe. Telling my boss “yes,” when they asked if I speak Spanish fluently and following it up with, “but not for free,” has been the highlight of my day, so far. Alternatively, we can “compensate” ourselves. We can always do extra work as long as we’re getting something out of it. This runs the gamut from acquiring a new skill to optimizing an annoying workflow bottleneck to securing our team’s delivery of a long-awaited feature. Whatever the reason or result, any extra work is a courtesy we extend to ourselves or our circle of influence. We should always assume that only we (or our teammates) will appreciate it. If that’s not enough to justify the effort then we don’t do it. This threshold of what constitutes extra work (or if we should do it) will be personal. The calculation will vary per person. Some can tolerate a great deal if the pay is good, while others can’t. Others will risk burning themselves out doing small favors for everybody, and others won’t. To each their own, I say. We can’t feel guilty or less of ourselves when we see somebody else’s circle of control is different than our own. We can only define it for ourselves and work happily within those confines. We should be careful about counting any vague, top-down forms of recognition as fair exchange for extra work or validation that we’re doing a good job. If we’re doing great work everyone will know because our circle of influence (manager, reports, peers) will be singing our praises. Word will spread. We don’t need to actively seek out credit or accolades by trying to do more. Either way, the slippery slope here is that an understanding of your contributions loses valuable detail at the org level. By definition, the wider our reputation the less control we have over its interpretaton. The org doesn’t care about us, so when all is said and done even the brightest star at the company will still be a resource. If you always deliver, they’ll always lean on you. And the more efficient you are? The more you get exploited. This perverse form of “recognition” could backfire on us in several ways. We might become the subject matter expert for some arcane legacy system or a new feature that requires constant maintenance. We risk getting typecast as “The Only Person Who Knows How To Do X”. We’ll get saddled with an additional workload or a new role we don’t actually have the bandwidth for. Again, we might actually be OK with such recognition—some could be legitimate career opportunities—but let’s not fool ourselves into thinking it’s true gratitude on the part of the org. However much we ingratiate ourselves with the org nothing is guaranteed. Despite the many YouTubers who naively pontificate on how to become recession-proof or dodge layoffs whenever the org flinches, no single company is going to save us. We have to be ready to save ourselves, and at any moment. This means job seeking on a casual and continual basis. Treat it like a hobby. Yes, even if we have a job already. And yes, even if we love that job. Think of the activities we do almost exclusively when we’re between jobs and do them on a smaller scale more regularly. Keeping our resume up to date, for instance, is far easier if we document our accomplishments as they happen. We can also practice other activities like staying in touch with colleagues, researching companies and their cultures, attending meetups or networking events, and even doing interviews! A low key job search can help in a few ways. For one, should we suddenly find ourselves unemployed we’re better prepared. We’ve already done some of the legwork that’d feel much harder to do in the moment. Any practice we’ve done also comes across as confidence to potential recruiters and interviewers. Second, it’s a chance for introspection and self-awareness. We’ll come to know more clearly what we like or dislike about our current job. It will also help to identify what we’re capable of and what we expect of ourselves or others. Useful for future jobs, yes, but this understanding makes us better at our current job, too. If nothing else, it might just cheer us up from time to time. I’ve had more than one Very Bad Day that found me cruising jobs on LinkedIn during my lunch break. And at one particularly toxic company I had a draft resignation letter open for a couple of months. Whenever the job wore me down I’d edit it a bit more. You know, as a treat! By the time I actually sent that letter it was bulletproof and very satisfying. Ultimately, proactive job seeking like this provides us with confidence, autonomy, and options. I’ve tried very hard to describe organizational behavior on its own terms and not as the deliberate intent of specific people. Just like us, executives have a role to play as part of the org, too. They may benefit from the system more than we do but they’re subjected to it all the same. Your CEO might actually be a nice human being. Most of them are! Elon Musk, on the other hand, is a demon wearing a meat suit. It’s the billionaires—and leaders who emulate them—that we need to worry about. So, I don’t have any useful advice for Musk, Bezos, Zuckerberg, or Altman. For anyone else in a leadership position I can only hope you looking into every nook and cranny of your org, seeing the people working for you, and doing right by them as best you can. I’ll admit I started writing this while in a somewhat bitter mood. However, it was a good exercise in helping me firm up some positive and actionable lessons. I find it reassuring that how I navigate an org doesn’t have to contradict my personal principles or how I work. In fact, they’re the very tools I need. I firmly believe that we can find a way to exist—flourish, even—without the org eroding our personal values. We don’t want to be naive, but that doesn’t mean we just give in to cynicism. I hate my job. The work sucks. The people suck. The pay sucks.looks up and sees motivational poster on wallWell this changes everything The steps seem simple enough. Make peace with the fact that any org is an irrational entity that always exists on the periphery. Focus our attention and effort on our circle of influence. Maintain rigorous and healthy personal boundaries. Always be ready to move on. It sucks that we have to do so even if we like where we work or feel like we’re doing well. It’s human nature to worry less about our well-being when the risks or costs are not evident or immediate. However, things are lovely until suddenly they’re not. Protect yourself. My promise to you is that there will be far more good days than bad days. Ultimately, the fact that your job doesn’t care about you is liberating! It’s not personal. You do you. My promise to myself is that I’m going to spend less time accommodating the company and more time empowering myself. Less time worried about what the CEO thinks and more time worried about how my coworkers feel. Less energy trying to save the world and more time simply being proud of myself and my work. We all want to do awesome things and make an impact at work. However, what we call “work” is a relationship between employer and employee that's inherently and persistently designed to benefit the former over the latter. How do we meaningfully contribute, earn a living, and maybe even enjoy ourselves when the organization simply does not care about us? Matt Hogg FYI Web developer. Technical leader. Husband. Father.

Archives Increased sea-level contribution from northwestern Greenland for models that reproduce observations, Badgeley et al., Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences The Greenland Ice Sheet has been thinning over the past several decades and is expected to contribute significantly to sea-level rise over the coming century. Ice flow models that make these projections, however, tend to underestimate the amount of mass lost from the ice sheet compared to observations, which complicates adaptation and mitigation planning in coastal regions. Here, we constrain a model of northwestern Greenland with a time series of satellite-derived surface velocity data and time-dependent physics to infer unknown ice properties. The model reproduces observed mass loss over the past 13 y within uncertainty. This model—constrained by more data—leads to about 8 to 17% greater sea-level rise contribution from this region by 2100. Evidence of Emerging Increasing Trends in Observed Subdaily Heavy Precipitation Frequency in the United States, Mascaro et al., Geophysical Research Letters The magnitude and frequency of heavy precipitation are expected to increase under warming temperatures caused by climate change. These trends have emerged in observational records but with much larger evidence on a daily rather than a subdaily scale. Here, we quantify long-term changes in heavy precipitation frequency in the United States using hourly observations in 1949–2020 from 332 gauges. We demonstrate that, when analyzed collectively, the frequencies of heavy precipitation at multiple durations from hourly to daily exhibit an increase that cannot be explained by natural climate variability. Upward trends are significant at ∼20%–40% of the gauges throughout the country except for the coastal western and southeastern regions, with higher percentages for longer durations. We also show that the frequency of hourly heavy precipitation has mainly grown after ∼2000, thus explaining the limited evidence of trends at the subdaily scale reported in past studies.

We use a time-dependent prospective life cycle assessment to enhance carbon footprints under four 1.5–3.0 °C decarbonisation pathways for electricity, fuel, and hydrogen from an energy-based integrated assessment model. Across 5000 comparative cases, battery electric vehicles consistently have the lowest carbon footprints compared to hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and fuel-cell vehicles. For example, battery electric vehicles show an average 32 to 47% lower footprint than hybrid combustion in 3.0 °C and 1.5 °C climate-compatible futures, respectively. This is driven by greater projected decarbonisation of electricity compared to fossil-dominated fuels and hydrogen. Battery electric vehicles meaningfully retain their advantage for mileages over 100,000 km, even in regions with carbon-intensive electricity since these are anticipated to decarbonise the most. Although our study supports battery electric vehicles as the most reliable climate-mitigation option for passenger cars, reducing their high manufacturing footprint remains important. Can dissent be meaningfully measured in an overwhelming consensus? A citation network case study in climate change research, Grunert, PLOS Clim ate In scientific discourse, the prevalence of overwhelming consensus obscures the presence of dissenting views as well as their characteristics. This paper explores the potential to meaningfully measure dissent within the context of such a consensus, using climate change research as a case study. Using citation analysis to explore the dynamics of scientific publications and the reception of dissenting opinions, this project questions whether there may be a methodological framework for quantifying dissent. This study employs analysis of citation networks to assess the visibility and impact of minority viewpoints, as well as the viability of such a study. The findings indicate that because dissent in climate change research is miniscule such measurements are limited. Despite that finding, researchers on the fringe of scientific consensus have an outsized impact on social viewpoints. This project has potential to disrupt the ways researchers critically consider the relevance of dissenting research in their own fields, and to think of ways to embrace the impact of research that expands their fields. In the face of anti-science politics, silence is not without cost, Editors, Nature We recognize that not all scientific leaders are in a position to be able to speak out, particularly those in countries where doing so could incur a penalty — or even punishment. That is why our call is to international scientific organizations. Academies in countries where the freedom to dissent is protected should also make their concerns known. All need to be aware that silence is also not without cost.

Title: Bernie Sanders Slams Job Cuts, Says AI Should Give Workers More Time Off: 'Instead Of Throwing You Out On The Street...'

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) is advocating for a 32-hour workweek, citing the potential for advancements in artificial intelligence and automation to provide workers with more personal time. What Happened: Sanders, in a recent appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, outlined his vision for a future where AI and automation drive increased productivity and efficiency, leading to reduced working hours for employees. “Instead of throwing you out on the street, I’m going to reduce your workweek to 32 hours,” Sanders stated. Trending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — this is your last chance to become an investor for $0.80 per share. The Vermont senator underscored the potential benefits of technology for workers, suggesting it could offer more time for family, friends and education. Sanders introduced the “Thirty-Two Hour Workweek Act” last year, which mandates overtime pay for any work beyond 32 hours in a week. The proposed change would be gradually implemented over a four-year period. See Also: Peter Thiel turned $1,700 into $5 billion—now accredited investors are eyeing this software company with similar breakout potential. Learn how you can invest with $1,000 at just $0.30/share. Why It Matters: The proposal comes at a time when the impact of AI and automation on the workforce is a hot topic. Just days before Sanders’ podcast appearance, Microsoft MSFT announced its third round of layoffs for 2025, primarily targeting the sales team and other customer-facing roles. This move was attributed to AI-driven workforce shifts. Similarly, Amazon AMZN CEO Andy Jassy recently warned that AI would reduce the company's corporate workforce due to efficiency gains, sparking backlash from employees. Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase JPM CEO Jamie Dimon admitted that U.S. companies are short on workers who can code software, secure networks and run complex projects.

Title: Xbox and Meta officially release limited edition black and green Meta Quest 3S bundle

Though if you want a quality VR headset, perhaps saving for a Quest 3 is a better plan. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. A few days ago we were treated to a sneak peak of the recent collaboration between Xbox and Meta Quest. The Xbox themed virtual reality headset was leaked by a BestBuy employee earlier this week, but now the official news blast is out. This limited edition black and green Meta Quest 3S is now available for purchase on Meta's website, or at Best Buy for folks in the USA, Argos and EE for UK readers. The headset looks almost exactly how we pictured it, harkening back to the original Xbox design. The matt black finish is highlighted with vibrant green trimmings, which I have to admit do look pretty cool. There's something to a VR setup that's giving Matrix aesthetics, just as long as I don't also have to be held in a weird gooey egg thing while machines harvest my life force. The headset would have to be a little bit cooler before I sign up for that. The special Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition bundle is going for $400 USD, but includes a bit of extra kit. Alongside the black and green 128 GB Meta Quest 3S, you also get Meta Touch Plus controllers, a limited-edition Xbox Wireless controller, and a Meta Quest Elite strap all themed to match. Alongside the bundled hardware are also a couple of subscriptions to help let you try out some VR games. You get 3 months of Meta Horizon+ and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate to try. This will let folks try games like Asgard's Wrath 2, which has been a highlight for VR gamers since its release. Judging by the included Xbox Wireless controller, this bundle isn't intended to limit folks to VR games on the headset. Instead it looks designed to be used as sort of theatre room replacement, where you can play all your Xbox games from the comfort of your headset. It's also worth noting if you already have GamePass these extra 3 months should stack and give you a bit of extra time on your subscription. The thing about this bundle I struggle with, however, is you'll never see it when using it. Half the joy of a limited edition fancy looking console or controller is looking down at it and smiling smugly to yourself during use. Thinking how it's cool that you have this nifty version of a thing you love that's just a little bit different to what's out there. This is really hard to do while wearing a VR headset. If you are keen on this collaboration, you might want to get in fast; stock is said to be super limited for this bundle. Personally, I'd forgo this and work on getting a full Quest 3 instead. Those heightened specs are well worth the price difference—which is why that's our pick as best VR headset right now—and that's certainly more beneficial than a black and green colourway.

Title: Devastating Layoffs Hit the Walt Disney Company

in Disney, Entertainment Credit: Disney In a recent report by TheWrap, it has been revealed that The Walt Disney Company is once again reducing its workforce, this time within its Entertainment and ESPN product and technology divisions. According to an unnamed source familiar with the matter, approximately 2% of the staff in these divisions has been let go as part of a broader rebalancing of resources. Despite the layoffs, Disney has emphasized that this move will not slow down its commitment to investing in product and technology growth. The company has been taking steps to streamline operations and adjust to the evolving media landscape, even as it continues to expand in other areas. This round of layoffs marks the fifth such occurrence in just a year at Disney. However, sources suggest that these cuts are distinct from previous ones, as they are not directly tied to any of the earlier rounds of job reductions. The decision is seen as part of Disney’s broader effort to optimize resources across its divisions, ensuring long-term success in the face of a rapidly changing entertainment environment. Led by Adam Smith, who joined Disney in 2024, the product and technology division has undergone significant changes under his leadership. Smith’s team has been actively working on enhancing Disney’s streaming platforms, particularly Disney+ and Hulu, with a focus on improving user experience and expanding subscriber perks. Notably, Disney has recently cracked down on password sharing for its streaming services, introduced new benefits for subscribers, and made strides in improving ad targeting through a new partnership with Amazon. Disney has also been exploring new ways to enhance the viewing experience. One of the latest initiatives includes the introduction of virtual “concessions stands” and “storefronts” within its streaming platforms, allowing viewers to purchase products directly related to the shows they are watching. Additionally, Disney is gearing up for the launch of a new ESPN streaming service later this fall, a move that marks the company’s continued push into the digital and sports streaming space. While these ongoing restructuring efforts are reshaping Disney’s internal operations, the company’s strategic goals remain focused on growth and innovation, particularly in the product and technology sectors. This wave of job cuts follows a larger trend of layoffs at Disney. Just earlier this month, the company laid off hundreds of employees from its entertainment and corporate financial divisions. Back in early 2025, under 200 employees from ABC News Group and its entertainment networks were also let go. This followed a series of cuts last fall that saw hundreds of corporate employees and ABC staff members losing their jobs. As Disney continues to adapt to the changing media landscape, the company’s commitment to innovation and product development remains a central focus, despite the ongoing workforce reductions. As the year progresses, Disney fans and industry observers alike will be keeping a close eye on how these changes will affect the company’s future growth and strategic direction. in Disney, Entertainment Eva was born and raised in the beautiful state of Oregon but has since relocated and lives in New York City.

Δ The rise took the company’s market cap to about $3.75 trillion, making it the world’s most valuable company, ahead of Microsoft, CNBC reportedWednesday. The increase in Nvidia shares was driven by the company’s latest earnings results, which showed robust growth and potential for future strength, according to the Bloomberg report. While Nvidia faces restrictions on selling advanced semiconductors in China, the company also has big customers like Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet and Amazon that are aggressively building artificial intelligence infrastructure, the report said. The company’s stock price has risen 14% this year after rising 170% last year and leaping 240% in 2023, per the report. Wall Street remains optimistic about the stock because it is showing both high growth and a reasonable multiple, the report said. In a presentation released in conjunction with a shareholder meeting held Wednesday, Nvidia reported that its fiscal year 2025 revenue was up 114% year over year. At the meeting, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that in addition to AI, the company sees opportunities for growth in robotics, beginning with self-driving cars, according to the CNBC report. “We have many growth opportunities across our company, with AI and robotics the two largest, representing a multitrillion-dollar growth opportunity,” Huang said, per the report. Huang added that the business unit that includes automotive and robotics was up 72% on an annual basis and accounted for 1% of the company’s total revenue in the latest quarter, the report said. Together with its AI chips, Nvidia has increasingly been offering related products like software, a cloud service and networking chips, according to the report. Huang said in the shareholder meeting that Nvidia no longer thinks of itself as a “chip company” but rather as a provider of “AI infrastructure” or “computing platform,” per the report. During a May 28 earnings call, Huang said Nvidia is pushing ahead with AI infrastructure projects worldwide to meet soaring demand for AI workloads. “The age of AI is here, from AI infrastructures, inference at scale, sovereign AI, enterprise AI and industrial AI,” Huang said. “Nvidia is ready.” Nvidia Shares Hit All-Time High as Companies Add AI Infrastructure Commerce Giants Expand Into Stores With New Debit and Credit Cards Fed Votes to Advance Proposal to Ease Banks’ Capital Requirements Apple Reportedly Set to Propose Easier Access to Offers Outside App Store We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Drivers across the US frustrated over their car’s paint jobs flaking off ‘in sheets,’ costing them thousands

Manage your account Thousands of drivers across the country are discovering their car paint jobs are literally peeling away — and fixing it could cost them thousands out of pocket. For Ed Rinkowitz, a Florida Hyundai owner, the flaky paint job is a familiar and frustrating sight. I'm 49 years old and have nothing saved for retirement — what should I do? Don't panic. Here are 6 of the easiest ways you can catch up (and fast) Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how Want an extra $1,300,000 when you retire? Dave Ramsey says this 7-step plan ‘works every single time’ to kill debt, get rich in America — and that ‘anyone’ can do it “My daughter's hood basically just flaked completely off, probably maybe 10% of the paint was left on it,” Rinkowitz told 10 Tampa Bay. “Then my wife’s car started and that was probably 30 to 40% that was coming off.” Rinkowitz says it’s the third Hyundai in his family with paint issues — and he’s far from alone. A Facebook group called “Hyundai Paint Peel / Peeling” has grown to over 6,000 members, all sharing stories of paint jobs seemingly disintegrating. So what’s causing the problem, and what can drivers do to protect their cars and wallets? While the issue spans several Hyundai models and paint colors, Rinkowitz says two of his affected vehicles were white — a trend echoed by dozens of other drivers. News station 10 Investigates also spoke with owners of Kia, Toyota and Chevrolet vehicles reporting similar issues. Rinkowitz brought his concerns to the dealership, but hit a wall. “I’ve got two white 2015 Elantras, very similar models, and they said, ‘Well, it’s not under warranty,’” he told 10 Investigates. Instead, he was told to go to a body shop — a fix he didn’t feel should fall on him. And it isn’t cheap. According to Bankrate, repainting a car can cost anywhere from $300 to more than $20,000, depending on the vehicle size, paint type and finish. A typical paint job costs around $3,000. A class-action lawsuit has been filed on behalf of Hyundai customers who say their paint peeled off prematurely. In response, some automakers have extended warranties and issued recalls. Hyundai announced a paint warranty extension for eight models, including 2017 and 2018 Elantras, Sonatas and Santa Fes. The coverage applies to peeling or bubbling white paint, especially around the hood, fenders and roof. Other drivers haven’t been as lucky. One Toyota Corolla owner told 10 Investigates that her dealership said the paint recall expired last year — even though her paint is now peeling off her car with just a spray from a garden hose.

In fact, you can get started with as little as $10 — here’s how Whether the issue is a manufacturer defect or not, there are steps car owners can take to help prevent paint damage before it gets worse. Parking in a garage or shaded area helps. Prolonged exposure to sunlight, bird droppings, tree sap and hail can speed up peeling and cracking. UV rays, in particular, cause paint to fade and break down over time. If your car’s paint starts to peel, don’t assume you're out of options. Attorney Charles Gallagher says a denied warranty claim isn’t necessarily the end of the road. He recommends asking the manufacturer for a warranty extension, especially if the issue stems from a known defect in the paint or its application. Automakers have their own processes for addressing paint complaints. Hyundai advises drivers to check their vehicle identification number (VIN) on the company’s website to see if they qualify for a paint warranty extension. Kia recommends starting with your local dealership, but if that doesn’t work, the company encourages contacting its customer care team directly. For now, many drivers are still trying to figure out what to do. “I’m 70 years old.

Title: College graduates face toughest job market in more than a decade as hiring slows

BREAKING NEWS Christopher Rugaber Associated Press Published: June 25, 2025 at 5:23 PM Updated: June 26, 2025 at 3:02 PM Christopher Rugaber Associated Press WASHINGTON – While completing a master’s degree in data analysis, Palwasha Zahid moved from Dallas to a town near Silicon Valley. The location made it easy to visit the campuses of tech stalwarts such as Google, Apple, and Nvidia. Zahid, 25, completed her studies in December, but so far she hasn't found a job in the industry that surrounds her. Recommended Videos “It stings a little bit,” she said. “I never imagined it would be this difficult just to get a foot in the door.” Young people graduating from college this spring and summer are facing one of the toughest job markets in more than a decade. The unemployment rate for degree holders ages 22 to 27 has reached its highest level in a dozen years, excluding the coronavirus pandemic. Joblessness among that group is now higher than the overall unemployment rate, and the gap is larger than it has been in more than three decades. The rise in unemployment has worried many economists as well as officials at the Federal Reserve because it could be an early sign of trouble for the economy. It suggests businesses are holding off on hiring new workers because of rampant uncertainty stemming from the Trump administration's tariff increases, which could slow growth. “Young people are bearing the brunt of a lot of economic uncertainty,” Brad Hersbein, senior economist at the Upjohn Institute, a labor-focused think tank, said. “The people that you often are most hesitant in hiring when economic conditions are uncertain are entry-level positions.” The growth of artificial intelligence may be playing an additional role by eating away at positions for beginners in white-collar professions such as information technology, finance, and law. Higher unemployment for younger graduates has also renewed concerns about the value of a college degree. More workers than ever have a four-year degree, which makes it less of a distinguishing factor in job applications. Murat Tasci, an economist at JPMorgan, calculates that 45% of workers have a four-year degree, up from 26% in 1992. While the difficulty of finding work has demoralized young people like Zahid, most economists argue that holding a college degree still offers clear lifetime benefits. Graduates earn higher pay and experience much less unemployment over their lifetimes. The overall U.S. unemployment rate is a still-low 4.2%, and the government's monthly jobs reports show the economy is generating modest job gains. But the additional jobs are concentrated in health care, government, and restaurants and hotels. Job gains in professions with more college grads, such as information technology, legal services, and accounting have languished in the past 12 months. The unemployment rate has stayed low mostly because layoffs are still relatively rare. The actual hiring rate — new hires as a percentage of all jobs — has fallen to 2014 levels, when the unemployment rate was much higher, at 6.2%. Economists call it a no-hire, no-fire economy. For college graduates 22 to 27 years old, the unemployment rate was 5.8% in March — the highest, excluding the pandemic, since 2012, and far above the nationwide rate. Lexie Lindo, 23, saw how reluctant companies were to hire while applying for more than 100 jobs last summer and fall after graduating from Clark Atlanta University with a business degree and 3.8 GPA. She had several summer internships in fields such as logistics and real estate while getting her degree, but no offer came. “Nobody was taking interviews or responding back to any applications that I filled out,” Lindo, who is from Auburn, Georgia, said. "My resume is full, there’s no gaps or anything. Every summer I’m doing something. It’s just, ‘OK, so what else are you looking for?’” She has returned to Clark for a master's program in supply chain studies and has an internship this summer at a Fortune 500 company in Austin, Texas. She's hopeful it will lead to a job next year. Artificial intelligence could be a culprit, particularly in IT. Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, has calculated that employment for college graduates 28 and above in computer science and mathematical occupations has increased a slight 0.8% since 2022. For those ages 22 to 27, it has fallen 8%, according to Martin. Company announcements have further fueled concerns. Tobi Lutke, CEO of online commerce software company Shopify, said in an April memo that before requesting new hires, “teams must demonstrate why they cannot get what they want done using AI.” Last week, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said AI would likely reduce the company's corporate workforce over the next few years. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” Jassy said in a message to employees. “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” Zahid worries that AI is hurting her chances. She remembers seeing big billboard ads for AI at the San Francisco airport that asked, “Why hire a human when you could use AI?” Still, many economists argue that blaming AI is premature. Most companies are in the early stages of adopting the technology. Professional networking platform LinkedIn categorized occupations based on their exposure to AI and did not see big hiring differences between professions where AI was more prevalent and where it wasn't, said Kory Kantenga, the firm's head of economics for the Americas. “We don’t see any broad-based evidence that AI is having a disproportionate impact in the labor market or even a disproportionate impact on younger workers versus older workers,” Kantenga said. He added that the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes have also slowed hiring in tech. Many IT firms expanded when the Fed pinned its short-term rate at nearly zero after the pandemic. In 2022, the Fed began cranking up rates to combat inflation, which made it harder to borrow and grow. In fact, IT's hiring spree when rates were low — fueled by millions of Americans ramping up their online shopping and video conferencing — left many firms with too many workers, economists say. Cory Stahle, an economist at the job-listings website Indeed, says postings for software development jobs, for example, have fallen 40% compared with four years ago. It's a sharp shift for students who began studying computer science when hiring was near its peak. Zahid, who lives in Dublin, California, has experienced this whiplash firsthand. When she entered college in 2019, her father, who is a network engineer, encouraged her to study IT and said it would be easy for her to get a job in the field. She initially studied psychology but decided she wanted something more hands-on and gravitated to data analysis. Her husband, 33, has a software development job, and friends of hers in IT received immediate job offers upon graduation a few years ago. Such rapid hiring seems to have disappeared now, she said. She has her college diploma, but hasn't hung it up yet. “I will put it up when I actually get a job, confirming that it was worth it all,” she said. ___ AP Writer Matt Sedensky in New York contributed to this report.

Title: Uber made a big change to how it prices trips. It might be the real secret to the company's turnaround.

Time Published: 2025-06-25T20:31:09Z

A new study suggests that Uber pulled off quite a feat — raising fares, lowering driver pay, and increasing profits — with a subtle change in pricing. The analysis, which is based on a trove of data from a single driver, offers some insight into a strategy that the researchers say explains the company's financial turnaround. In 2022, Uber moved away from a formula based largely on the length of a trip and started rolling out what it calls "upfront pricing," which gives a price to riders and potential earnings to drivers before they accept a trip. Behind the scenes, Uber's algorithms use a variety of factors, not just the length of the trip and demand, to determine rider prices and driver earnings. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has touted upfront pricing's ability to offer specific prices based on the company's data and AI analysis. "Anyone can price based on time and distance," he said during a quarterly earnings call in late 2023. "We'll be able to price out that trip and match it to a particular driver based on a bigger dataset than anyone else in the world." These days, upfront pricing is standard in most parts of the US and many of Uber's international markets. The strategy may be the secret ingredient behind Uber's 300% stock rally over the past three years, a new study indicates. Upfront pricing has been "enabling the company to raise rider fares and cut driver pay on billions of rideshare trips, systematically, selectively, and opaquely," Len Sherman, an executive in residence and adjunct professor at Columbia Business School, wrote in the report released Monday. The study, which is based on about seven years of trip data from one driver, found that changes to fares and driver pay could vary by trip. Sherman's report said that Uber had come close to being a master of what economists call "price discrimination," or determining the exact maximum that riders are willing to pay — or the exact minimum that a driver is willing to accept — for a trip. The term doesn't refer to discrimination based on race, sex, or other personal characteristics, but rather discrimination based on a person's needs and desires in a particular situation. It's a concept that economists have talked about in introductory economics courses for decades, but it was largely theoretical, Sherman told Business Insider in an interview. "They cracked the nut," Sherman said. "They have the data and the algorithms and the machine learning to come closer to being able to do that than anyone else." Since implementing upfront pricing, Uber's stock price has risen nearly fourfold from a low of about 40% below its initial public offering price. In 2023, for the first time in its history, Uber reported an annual profit. The performance rally helped Khosrowshahi secure the option to buy about $130 million in additional Uber stock early last year, as part of an incentive plan. In a statement at the end of Sherman's report, Uber said its upfront pricing strategy was "designed it be transparent and fair for both riders and drivers." The company also said its pricing algorithms "do not use information about an individual rider or driver's personal characteristics." In a statement to BI, an Uber spokesperson called Sherman's findings "a tired, misleading story." When Uber first launched, the compensation model used a rate card, with pay based on the length of trips. Under upfront pricing, drivers' earnings have plummeted, even as the costs of working as a ride-hailing driver, such as gas and car maintenance, have increased, the study found. Many of Sherman's findings come from an analysis of one driver's trip data — information that Uber allows drivers to download. The information includes details about how much the driver got paid, how much Uber charged the rider, and how long each trip was. The worker whose data Sherman used was described as a "power driver." The study examined just under 25,000 trips that this driver completed while working close to full time for Uber between 2018 and February 2025. The driver saw pay cuts starting in September 2022, around the time Uber rolled out upfront pricing, the study found. Over the preceding two years, many drivers had seen their pay increase while driving during the pandemic, the report said. "We've seen this kind of narrative before — one driver's data and a lot of speculation spun into a sweeping indictment," an Uber spokesperson said. "The facts are simpler: upfront pricing is designed to increase clarity for both riders and drivers, not to manipulate them." If Uber can apply these methods to one driver, Sherman said, it has an incentive to do the same across a wide swath of its contractors. "The question, therefore, isn't whether our profiled driver is truly representative of all US drivers," Sherman wrote, "but rather, given Uber's massive profit improvement revealed by our analysis, why wouldn't Uber seek to exploit the same levers across its entire pool of over one million drivers in the US?" One Uber driver in New York state told BI he used to get more than 50% of fares when he drove for Uber. Since Uber introduced upfront pricing in his area, though, he has seen his cut — and, usually, his total pay from trips — fall, usually to less than 30% of the total fare. The driver shared screenshots and notes of payouts from his recent trips. The gap between what riders pay and what he makes becomes apparent when he strikes up conversations in his car. "They'll tell you that they paid Uber $60, and you're lucky if you get $20," the driver told BI. One of the clearest pieces of evidence for Uber's use of price discrimination came when Sherman compared his driver's rides from 2019 with those from 2024. In 2019, almost all of the driver's trips — 98% — had predictable pay based on distance, travel time, and any surge pricing that was in effect at the time. By 2024, though, that number had dropped to 77%, a sign that Uber had given itself "considerable wiggle room to maximize profits by adjusting prices and pay on every trip," Sherman wrote. The analysis focused on the driver's actual earnings and wasn't affected by fees, such as airport pickup fees, that drivers sometimes incur but Uber reimburses, Sherman said. Perhaps the biggest financial impact of Uber's upfront pricing, the study suggests, is on the percentage of each fare that the company claims — a metric known as "take rate." Uber doesn't regularly report its take rate in earnings. Sherman estimated it by comparing the rider price per mile in the data with the driver's pay. When upfront pricing began in 2022, the rides that Sherman's driver took had a take rate of about 32%. By the end of 2024, the take rate stood at about 42%. On some trips that Sherman examined, Uber took more than 50% of the fare. Sherman determined that the lack of transparency around pricing with the new model could have allowed Uber to increase take rates. How much Uber takes from each fare is a frequent topic of discussion for ride-hailing drivers and their passengers. "Drivers are obsessed with it," Sherman said. Determining how they're splitting a fare with Uber is an important factor for ride-hailing drivers who are deciding whether the job is worth it, said Sergio Avedian, an Uber driver who's a senior contributor to The Rideshare Guy, a gig driver advocacy blog and YouTube channel. "There is no other math," he said. Uber's upfront pricing also raised fares for short trips that the driver took, Sherman found. Longer trips, meanwhile, became a comparatively good deal for riders, which could have spurred riders to use Uber for longer trips instead of only quick hops around town, he said. "Uber's upfront pricing policy thus unlocked a trifecta of profit improvement: higher margins applied to higher-priced trips plus a shift to longer, more profitable trips," the report said.

Business FILE PHOTO: Nvidia logo is seen in this illustration taken, January 27, 2025. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo Nvidia's stock hit a record high on Wednesday, and the chipmaker reclaimed the crown as the world's most valuable company after an analyst said the chipmaker was set to ride a "Golden Wave" of artificial intelligence. Shares of the Santa Clara, California-based company rose over 4 per cent to a record high of US$154.10. The rise sent Nvidia's stock market value to US$3.76 trillion, overtaking Microsoft, which was last valued at US$3.65 trillion following a 0.2 per cent increase in its stock. Fueling Nvidia's latest rally, Loop Capital lifted its price target for the designer of high-end AI processors to US$250 from US$175, while maintaining its "buy" rating. "Our work suggests we are entering the next ‘Golden Wave’ of Gen AI adoption and NVDA is at the front-end of another material leg of stronger than anticipated demand," Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah wrote in a client note.

(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. shares rose to an all-time high on Wednesday, with the leader in artificial intelligence chips extending an advance that has cemented its position as one of the most valuable companies in the world. The stock rose 3.8% to $153.46, taking out an all-time intraday high that has stood since January. The record is only the latest milestone for the company, which has risen 63% off an April low, a rally that has added more than $1.4 trillion to its market capitalization. Recent earnings results from Nvidia were the latest catalyst for bulls, as the report showed robust growth and pointed to more strength ahead despite the impact of restrictions on the sales of advanced semiconductors in China. Prints from Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc., and Amazon.com Inc. — which together make up more than 40% of Nvidia’s revenue, per supply chain data compiled by Bloomberg — further underlined how the company’s biggest customers continue to spend aggressively building out their AI infrastructure. “My confidence in Nvidia’s growth is higher than it was a couple months ago, and it seems the AI arms race will continue through 2025 and probably 2026,” said Michael Smith, co-portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments. “The momentum has clearly been re-established, and Nvidia’s moat has only widened and deepened, meaning its position has only strengthened.” At Nvidia’s shareholder meeting Wednesday, Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang reassured investors that demand remains strong. He reiterated his view that the computer industry is only at the beginning of a massive AI infrastructure upgrade. Little known just a few years ago, Nvidia has emerged as a household name and perhaps the most important stock on Wall Street by becoming the poster child for all things AI. The shares’ gain of more than 14% this year follow a rally of more than 170% in 2024, which itself came in the wake of 2023’s surge of nearly 240%. Even with this strength, it continues to screen as attractive next to its history by some valuation metrics. Nvidia trades at 31 times expected 12-month earnings, below its 10-year average and not far from the Nasdaq 100 Index’s multiple of 27 — despite Wall Street estimates calling for faster growth at Nvidia than the broader tech market. The stock’s PEG ratio — a measure of valuation relative to growth — is at about 0.9, by far the lowest among the Magnificent Seven. The combination of high growth and a reasonable multiple is a key reason why Wall Street remains optimistic about its prospects. Nearly 90% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, while it trades 13% below the average analyst price target, suggesting many expect the momentum to continue.

Title: Nvidia Rises to Record as AI Spending Momentum Stays Strong

(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. shares rose to an all-time high on Wednesday, with the leader in artificial intelligence chips extending an advance that has cemented its position as one of the most valuable companies in the world. The stock rose 3.8% to $153.46, taking out an all-time intraday high that has stood since January. The record is only the latest milestone for the company, which has risen 63% off an April low, a rally that has added more than $1.4 trillion to its market capitalization. Recent earnings results from Nvidia were the latest catalyst for bulls, as the report showed robust growth and pointed to more strength ahead despite the impact of restrictions on the sales of advanced semiconductors in China. Prints from Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc., and Amazon.com Inc. — which together make up more than 40% of Nvidia’s revenue, per supply chain data compiled by Bloomberg — further underlined how the company’s biggest customers continue to spend aggressively building out their AI infrastructure. “My confidence in Nvidia’s growth is higher than it was a couple months ago, and it seems the AI arms race will continue through 2025 and probably 2026,” said Michael Smith, co-portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments. “The momentum has clearly been re-established, and Nvidia’s moat has only widened and deepened, meaning its position has only strengthened.” At Nvidia’s shareholder meeting Wednesday, Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang reassured investors that demand remains strong. He reiterated his view that the computer industry is only at the beginning of a massive AI infrastructure upgrade. Little known just a few years ago, Nvidia has emerged as a household name and perhaps the most important stock on Wall Street by becoming the poster child for all things AI. The shares’ gain of more than 14% this year follow a rally of more than 170% in 2024, which itself came in the wake of 2023’s surge of nearly 240%. Even with this strength, it continues to screen as attractive next to its history by some valuation metrics. Nvidia trades at 31 times expected 12-month earnings, below its 10-year average and not far from the Nasdaq 100 Index’s multiple of 27 — despite Wall Street estimates calling for faster growth at Nvidia than the broader tech market. The stock’s PEG ratio — a measure of valuation relative to growth — is at about 0.9, by far the lowest among the Magnificent Seven. The combination of high growth and a reasonable multiple is a key reason why Wall Street remains optimistic about its prospects. Nearly 90% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, while it trades 13% below the average analyst price target, suggesting many expect the momentum to continue. Despite all that, Nvidia remains under-owned by market professionals relative to other Big Tech peers, an additional sign there is potential for more buying in the weeks to come. Nvidia is owned by 74% of long-only funds, according to data from Bank of America. This puts it behind Amazon, Apple and Microsoft, which is the most owned at 91%. “I’m bullish on this year and next, but like everyone else we don’t know what will happen after that,” said Smith. “The stock doesn’t look expensive, but there can be a limit to how much upside there is in one of the biggest companies in the world.

Title: Nvidia shares hit record high as Wall Street shakes off anxiety about AI chip export controls

Nvidia shares closed at an all-time high on Wednesday as Wall Street investors shook off fears that US limits on chip exports to China would hurt the company’s business. Led by CEO Jensen Huang, the AI chip giant’s stock rose 4.3% to nearly $154.31 per share in Wednesday trading. Nvidia’s previous all-time closing high was $149.43, which was achieved last Jan. 6 following President Trump’s election win. The stock is up about 15% since the start of the year. The surge pushed its market cap to $3.76 trillion, establishing Nasdaq-listed Nvidia as the world’s most valuable company. Microsoft, a key Nvidia customer, ranked second at $3.65 trillion, followed by Apple at approximately $3 trillion. The rally has occurred despite lingering investor anxiety about President Trump’s move earlier this year to slap fresh export controls on Nvidia’s shipments to China. The restrictions halted shipments of Nvidia’s H20 chips – which had been the only AI processors it could legally export to the country. In May, Nvidia told investors it would lose $8 billion in expected sales from China. Huang himself has grumbled that the “$50 billion China market is effectively closed to US industry.” However, overall demand for Nvidia’s chips remains strong. On Wednesday, Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah raised his price target on Nvidia stock to $250 – which, if achieved, would push its market cap to an unprecedented $6 trillion over time. “While it may seem fantastic that NVDA fundamentals can continue to amplify from current levels, we remind folks that NVDA remains essentially a monopoly for critical tech, and that it has pricing (and margin) power,” Baruah said in a note to clients. For the full year, Wall Street expects Nvidia’s revenue to surge 53% to nearly $200 billion, according to LSEG data. Nvidia shares popped despite mixed results for Wall Street’s main indexes. The Nasdaq was up about 60 points, or 0.3%, while the broad-based S&P 500 was flat and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 106 points, or 0.3%. The firm dominates the market for advanced computer chips needed to power energy-guzzling artificial intelligence models. Aside from Microsoft, Nvidia’s customers include the likes of Sam Altman’s OpenAI, Elon Musk’s xAI and Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta. The Santa Clara, California-based firm also held its shareholder meeting on Wednesday.

Wall Street is growing even more bullish on Microsoft (MSFT), whose shares set fresh all-time highs Wednesday. In a note to clients Tuesday, Wells Fargo raised its price target to $585 from $565, representing a 19% premium over Microsoft's closing level Tuesday of $490.11—which was itself a record. The climb continued today, as Microsoft shares hit a record intraday level of $494.56 and closed at $492.27. The finish marked the tech titan's 12th record close in 17 June trading sessions. "We acknowledge shares are trading near historical highs, but think this is justified given its early AI lead and strong incumbent position in a tight market," Wells Fargo said, adding, "We still see a bright future ahead for Microsoft." Wedbush was even more bullish Wednesday, raising its price target to $600 from $515. Microsoft has "a massive adoption wave of Copilot and Azure monetization now on the doorstep" as enterprise clients deploy AI tools, analysts wrote. Wells Fargo and Wedbush are more bullish than average, but they're far from alone. All 19 brokers tracked by Visible Alpha have a "buy" or equivalent rating for Microsoft stock, with a mean price target of about $532.

Title: Netflix Should Invest in High-Value, Short-Form Content and Exclusive Creator Deals, Analyst Says

Wells Fargo’s Steve Cahall says move would add subscribers, drive engagement, boost ads and better compete with YouTube and social media As Netflix aspires to reach a $1 trillion market cap by 2030, Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall believes that the company’s next big investment should be high-value, short-form content and exclusive, multi-year deals with creators. He sees short-form video content as a potential third pillar of growth, along with sports and ads, that will broaden the streamer’s engagement, deepen its library of content, help the company navigate generational changes as engagement grows on TikTok, social media and user generated feeds on YouTube, and make a $1 trillion market cap aspiration feel possible. “Some of the bigger creators on YouTube have high production value content with huge, built-in audiences. Their annual viewing hours rival big Netflix originals,” Cahall, who raised the bank’s price target on Netflix stock from $1,222 to $1,500 per share, wrote in a research note. “Moving creators exclusively to NFLX could be an opportunity to add subscribers, engagement and ads, all at an attractive ROI.” Wells Fargo estimates that Netflix paid an average of $81 per 1,000 hours viewed on content in 2024, with top originals making an average of $132 per 1,000 hours viewed. In comparison, Cahall believes the company could pay top creators an average of $60 per 1,000 hours viewed. While Netflix has recently moved into live programming, Cahall argued that type of appointment viewing will “always be limited for a mostly on-demand service.” He pointed out that Netflix’s ramp up of live and sports content has been “very piecemeal and will likely remain so” due to most major sports rights being locked up between now and the end of the decade. Cahall’s call for Netflix to push into short-form video content comes as YouTube lead TV viewing for the fourth consecutive month in May with a 12.5% share, while Netflix trailed behind in second with a share of 7.5%. “We think short-form premium content that has helped YouTube track ahead of NFLX in US TV time (and potentially time per user) presents a unique opportunity for nearer term growth,” he said. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos has previously knocked YouTube, arguing that it’s in the “killing time” business as opposed to the “spending time” business. He added that YouTube is a good platform for creators to “cut your teeth on” or develop an idea that can then be brought to Netflix where they would assume the financial risk. While Netflix has been focused on capturing the share of TV watching that’s not on its platform nor YouTube, Sarandos has said the company is competing with the Alphabet-owned video platform for the chunk of viewing geared towards “professional content.” In order to reach its $1 trillion market cap goal, Netflix is looking to double its revenue to $78 billion and triple its operating income to around $30 billion by 2030. It’s also eyeing about 410 million subscribers and roughly $9 billion in global ad sales by 2030, according to figures leaked to the Wall Street Journal. Outside of its content, Netflix has expressed an interest in adding video podcasts to the platform. The company is also targeting a late 2025 opening for its Netflix Houses in Pennsylvania and Dallas, with a third location opening on the Las Vegas Strip in 2027, which will offer live immersive experiences based on its popular programming, a theater to watch movies and shows on the big screen, shopping and dining. Shares of Netflix have climbed 90% in the past year and 44% year to date.

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. We noted in a recent post that NVIDIA appears to have vanquished nearly all of its near-term bearish catalysts, prompting some hedge fund managers based in Boston to ask the rhetorical question: what is keeping the stock from breaking out? Now, Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah has joined this bullish chorus by pegging a street-high price target of $250 on NVIDIA shares, which implies a market capitalization of $6 trillion! Baruah then cites the math that "just works" to justify his unbridled enthusiasm vis-à-vis NVIDIA. According to Loop Capital's supply chain analyst John Donovan, the spending on GPUs could climb to $2 trillion by 2028, which would be equivalent to between 50 and 60 percent of total installed compute capacity. For context, GPUs account for just 15 percent of the global compute capacity today. This aligns with NVIDIA's own statement during its Q1'26 earnings call, where it declared that it had visibility into "tens of gigawatts" of AI infrastructure projects. Bear in mind that NVIDIA has already disclosed that it earns between $40 billion and $50 billion in revenue from each GW of new AI infrastructure. According to UBS, assuming a conservative order pipeline of 20GW, this scenario would result in $1 trillion in revenue for NVIDIA. Coming back, Baruah believes that the upcoming next phase of NVIDIA's growth will be driven by hyperscalers, sovereign AI data centers, generative AI, and AI-based accelerated computing. Bear in mind that BofA's Vivek Arya is much more circumspect in his outlook for the overall AI market, expecting a global data center TAM of just around $1 trillion by 2030. As such, Loop Capital now expects NVIDIA to ship 6.5 million GPUs in the ongoing calendar year 2025, and 7.5 million in 2026, replete with an ASP of over $40,000. On the flip side, Baruah concedes the possibility that NVIDIA might realize these numbers and still not reach the stratospheric $6 trillion valuation, owing to a compression in its 30x P/E, which has been the norm for NVIDIA for the last 36 months or so. NVIDIA shares are up 3 percent at the time of writing and trading at the $152 price handle. So far this year, however, the stock is up just around 10 percent.

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CHONGQING, CHINA - APRIL 26: In this photo illustration, the logo of Amazon.com, Inc. is displayed ... More on a smartphone screen, with the company's iconic smile branding visible in the background, on April 26, 2025, in Chongqing, China. (Photo illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images) Amazon’s stock has already delivered impressive gains, rising over 150% from $85 levels in early 2023 to around $210 now. But what could propel the stock to double from current levels over the next few years? The answer lies in AWS and AI – the primary growth engine for Amazon. AWS remains Amazon’s most lucrative segment and the key catalyst for future stock appreciation. AWS revenue growth of 19% year-over-year in 2024 and 17% in Q1’25 was strong, and it is expected to remain in high teens in the near term. The artificial intelligence boom is driving accelerated demand for cloud computing services, with enterprises turning to AWS to leverage AI capabilities quickly. Separately, if you are looking for an upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Also, see – Should You Buy RKLB Stock At $33? Amazon is making a significant investment in its AI infrastructure. In 2024, the company spent approximately $75 billion on capital expenditures, and CEO Andy Jassy expects this to exceed $100 billion in 2025. This substantial investment is largely driven by the increasing demands of generative AI. Recently, Amazon further underscored its commitment by announcing plans to invest $54 billion in the UK over the next three years. This investment aims to expand both its warehouse network and artificial intelligence infrastructure, bolstering its e-commerce and cloud operations. AWS revenue reached $108 billion in 2024, representing 17% of Amazon’s total revenues. However, the segment’s high margins establish it as Amazon’s primary profit driver. Continued double-digit growth in AWS could significantly increase the company’s overall valuation. For perspective, AWS alone accounted for an estimated 40% of Amazon’s total EBITDA in 2024. Wondering about Amazon’s profitability, check out – Amazon Operating Income Comparison and Amazon Operating Cash Flow Comparison Amazon’s AI investments create a multiplier effect across all business segments. In e-commerce, AI will help enhance recommendation engines, optimize logistics networks, and improve inventory management, driving higher conversion rates and operational efficiency. For advertising, AI will likely enable more precise targeting and dynamic pricing, increasing ad effectiveness and commanding premium rates. These cross-segment AI benefits compound revenue growth while reducing operational costs, creating a virtuous cycle of scaling revenues and expanding margins. Amazon's advertising business has become a significant revenue generator, hitting $56.2 billion in 2024, marking its first time exceeding $50 billion annually. This was a 20% increase year-over-year. The strong momentum continued into Q1 2025, with advertising revenue reaching $13.9 billion, a 19% increase compared to the previous year. Amazon's unique position as both a marketplace and a media platform gives its advertising business a significant advantage. The recent introduction of ads on Prime Video has expanded ad inventory, while the company's extensive e-commerce data offers powerful targeting capabilities for advertisers. While attention often focuses on AWS and advertising, Amazon's foundational e-commerce business remains a substantial revenue source. Last year, the online stores segment brought in $247 billion in annual revenue, accounting for 39% of Amazon's total business. This strong base provides consistent cash flow, enabling Amazon to fund growth investments in its higher-margin segments like AWS and advertising. For Amazon's stock to double, the company needs to show consistent growth across its key businesses. This growth will likely be fueled by AWS's AI-driven expansion, the rapid increase in advertising revenue, and the stability of its e-commerce operations. Key factors that could drive stock appreciation include AWS consistently growing above 20%, advertising revenue reaching $80-90 billion annually (expected within 2-3 years), and improved operating margins as AI investments start paying off. Amazon's substantial AI infrastructure investments strategically position it to capture a significant share of the emerging AI market. Looking at the numbers, we project Amazon’s revenues to exceed $900 billion in the next three years, with earnings nearly doubling from 2024 to over $10 per share. Currently, with AMZN stock trading around $210, it’s valued at approximately 39 times trailing earnings. If it maintains a similar valuation, the stock could surpass $400 within the next three years. Should investors assign an even higher multiple, it would imply more than a two-fold growth. Also see – Amazon’s Valuation Ratios Comparison Amazon’s diverse revenue streams and leadership in cloud computing, e-commerce, and digital advertising offer multiple avenues for sustained growth. This revaluation, coupled with fundamental business growth, provides the basis for the stock to double, reflecting sustained revenue increases and a reassessment of Amazon's long-term earnings potential in the AI economy. Amazon's diversified revenue streams and leadership in cloud computing, e-commerce, and digital advertising provide multiple pathways for sustained growth. If these segments continue their current trajectories, the stock could potentially double from here, driven by both revenue growth and margin expansion as AI investments mature. The convergence of scaling revenues across all segments and improving profitability from AI-driven efficiencies could fuel significant investor optimism. As Amazon demonstrates its ability to monetize massive AI investments while maintaining market leadership, investors may assign premium valuation multiples typically reserved for high-growth technology companies. This multiple expansion, combined with fundamental business growth, provides the mathematical foundation for the stock to double—requiring both sustained revenue increases and a revaluation of Amazon's long-term earnings potential in the AI economy. While Amazon’s pathway looks promising, several factors could hinder the stock from doubling. Intensifying competition in cloud computing from Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, for example, could put pressure on AWS's margins and growth rates. Furthermore, regulatory scrutiny over Amazon’s market dominance, especially in e-commerce and advertising, might lead to antitrust actions. These could limit expansion or even force business restructuring. Google and Meta are already facing the heat. The company's massive AI capital expenditures also carry execution risk; if these investments don't deliver expected returns or take too long to materialize, investor sentiment could turn negative. Additionally, economic downturns could reduce enterprise cloud spending and consumer e-commerce activity. Elevated interest rates could also make high-growth stocks like Amazon less appealing compared to fixed-income alternatives. Overall, investors willing to bet on Amazon should take into account these risks as well. Now, we apply risk assessment framework while constructing the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

As alleged in an underlying securities fraud class action complaint, DoubleVerify, via certain of its officers, failed to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company’s high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the above, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. Grabar Law Office is investigating whether officers and directors of DoubleVerify breached their fiduciary duties owed to the company.

These statements included, among other things, confidence in the Company’s ability to forecast guidance despite macroeconomic fluctuations, the growth potential of their professional services offerings, and the ability for their cloud revenue to drive revenue for its professional services.The underlying complaint alleges that Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Manhattan Associates’ forecasting ability for its professional services; notably, the Company was either not truly equipped to deliver “responsible targets” for growth or, otherwise, Manhattan Associates’ services were not equipped to achieve such targets.

On April 11, 2025, the federal court determined that key allegations would survive Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint. In so holding, the court determined “Plaintiffs have adequately stated Exchange Act claims by pleading scienter [knowledge of wrongdoing] through defendants’ unusual stock sales and by plausibly alleging loss causation between the corrective announcement and stock price drop. Plaintiffs have also stated Securities Act claims against Napco and the underwriter defendants.” . . . “Taking the well-pleaded facts as true, there is no question that plaintiffs have adequately pled scienter. First, the stock sales were highly unusual in timing and amount. As to amount, the total proceeds of over $108 million from stock sales by the officer defendants weigh in favor of a motive. . . .

Title: Remedy is in control

Time Published: 2025-06-25T12:38:15Z
Full Content:
Amid a bleak landscape, the studio behind Alan Wake has found a way to survive and grow, all while staying weird. In the quiet city of Espoo, a short drive west from Helsinki in Finland, is an unassuming building that’s home to one of the most confounding studios in games. Remedy Entertainment is known for getting weird. It started with the meta horror of Alan Wake, and has since expanded with Control, a game that turns a bureaucratic government office into a sinister and unsettling battleground. Their worlds merge the surreal and the mundane — which is not a bad description of Remedy itself. On the day I visited, the studio’s energy was relaxed and subdued — in true Finnish style, there are even multiple onsite saunas — and frankly a little boring, especially for a creative team known for the likes of the mind-bending Ashtray Maze or “Old Gods of Asgard” musical. But that contrast is also one of the keys to Remedy’s recent success. In the wake of the covid-19 pandemic, the video game industry has experienced studio closures, persistent layoffs, corporate meddling, and ill-fated games that were canceled soon after launch. Exceptions like Remedy have been rare. Over the past decade, the studio has been implementing a plan to help it compete with bigger, better-funded developers and publishers, steadily inching its way from a work-for-hire studio to one in charge of its own destiny. As the industry has shifted toward live-service hits like Fortnite and blockbusters like Grand Theft Auto, Remedy has taken big swings with ambitious and delightfully strange narrative titles. Now it’s trying to expand even further with its first multiplayer — and self-published — game in FBC: Firebreak. The stakes are high: it’s the perfect example of Remedy’s new way of working and a proof of concept for its larger, more expansive future. It’s also a strange experience, marrying the surreal tone of Control with co-op play that bucks the latest online gaming trends. But to hear it from the Finnish developer, it only gets to take swings like Firebreak because it nailed all of the boring stuff first. “We are this building,” explains creative director Mikael Kasurinen. “This is it; this is us. We aren’t owned by anybody else, and I think that realization brings that culture of taking more responsibility. There is nothing above us that will save the day if things go wrong. It’s all on us.” This wasn’t the case for much of the studio’s existence. Founded in 1995, Remedy’s first release was a combat racing game called Death Rally. A few years later, the studio garnered widespread acclaim with 2001’s Max Payne, a hard-boiled noir with action ripped out of a John Woo movie. After a sequel, Remedy expanded in new directions with the survival horror game Alan Wake and sci-fi game / TV show hybrid Quantum Break. Despite its modest success, though, the studio found itself stuck in a cycle of working from game to game. It didn’t own any of its creations — instead, they were the property of publishers like Rockstar and Microsoft — and, with the exception of the rapid 18-month development of Max Payne 2, Remedy was only putting out new games every five years or so. That half-decade cycle meant that if any game failed, so did the company. This put Remedy in a precarious position, and it’s something Tero Virtala realized right away when he took over as CEO in 2016. “At that point Remedy had been around for 20 years, and succeeded in relation to many criteria,” Virtala says. That included releasing several hit games and steadily growing in headcount. But Virtala says that “it didn’t feel like enough” to have such a talented team and only release one game every four or five years. While it’s typical for games to take years to build, only having one project at a time left the studio vulnerable in case any of them flopped. Virtala helped spearhead a new path for Remedy’s future built on two pillars: One was becoming a multi-project studio, so that it was less dependent on any single game. Second, Remedy also wanted ownership of its original creations and to eventually become its own publisher. “It’s important to understand enough of the business, even though I don’t love it.” A major part of making this work was ensuring that everyone in the studio bought in and understood the plan, not just management. It sounds like a controversial idea and runs counter to the way the industry typically works: whereas most studios operate with clear lines dividing creative and business, Virtala believed that empowering developers to understand the business side meant they’d be better able to make the right decisions on the creative end. “People are smart,” Virtala says of his employees, “and they are mature enough to understand that if you want to make creative, ambitious games, it’s not possible unless you have the financial basis, unless you are aligned with the technology, unless you have the people and the production plans are in order. We try to provide the teams with as much information as possible. And then the teams are in the best place to try to figure out what is the best creative path within these constraints.” And it seems that the creative side has bought in. Sam Lake has been with Remedy for nearly its entire 30-year existence, starting out as a writer on Death Rally. (He’s also the face of the original Max Payne — literally.) He now serves as creative director and is the lead writer behind all of Remedy’s major franchises. “It’s important to understand enough of the business, even though I don’t love it,” Lake says. “When you’re creating a game concept, there are a lot of decisions being made, and the more you understand about what these decisions affect, the better you are prepared to choose wisely.” The real turning point came with the launch of Control in 2019, the first game released under Virtala’s leadership. While the idea for the story and world had been kicking around in Lake’s head for some time, the actual development happened as Virtala was implementing broader studio changes. He pushed for more efficient processes and timelines, hoping to make games faster without sacrificing the quality level Remedy had become known for. “Those three years were transformative for Remedy,” Kasurinen says. He notes that this new development style meant planning much more in advance on Control, and viewing limitations around budgets and timelines as creative challenges “that forced us to reinvent many things in a good way.” When it came out, Control exemplified exactly what the studio wanted to be: it was developed in a comparatively brisk three years, was a brand-new property that the studio would (eventually) own outright, and was in development alongside another project in collaboration with Korean publisher Smilegate. Creatively, it also allowed the team to attempt a new kind of open-ended action game and it opened up new directions for the future. Control’s success allowed this plan to continue. Since then, Remedy has steadily expanded. Control was followed by a long-awaited sequel to Alan Wake, and the studio has grown to 380 people. It currently has four projects in development: a sequel to Control, remakes of the Max Payne games, an unannounced title, and its first multiplayer game, the recently launched Control spinoff FBC: Firebreak. With the exception of Max Payne, which is being published by Rockstar, all of its in-development games are self-published. Remedy now also holds the publishing rights for Alan Wake (the sequel was originally published by Epic Games), and has created its own connected universe, which unites the worlds of Alan Wake and Control. In 2024 it partnered with Annapurna Pictures to potentially expand this even further through film and TV adaptations. Branching out into new genres and mediums is a further attempt to grow Remedy’s capabilities — and to better insulate itself from the volatile whims of the games industry. Getting to this moment required some structural changes. Remedy now has multiple development teams, with staff shifting between them as needed, and it also has a unique setup with two creative directors in Lake and Kasurinen. Lake says that both of them want to be hands-on when they’re leading a new game, and so having two people in the role allows the creative side to always be involved in larger studio decisions, even in the midst of an intense development process. “When I was deep into Alan Wake 2, I wasn’t a part of attending weekly management meetings,” Lake says. “I just needed to focus on [the game]. But it’s really important that we have the creative side represented on the company level. So this arrangement gives us flexibility. We can represent each other.” Even still, the transition wasn’t always smooth. As Remedy attempted to grow into a multi-project studio, not all of its expansion attempts worked out. First, the studio partnered with Smilegate on a new iteration of the popular military shooter Crossfire. The idea was that Smilegate would make the multiplayer portion of the game, while Remedy would craft a single-player story mode, giving the studio a chance to make its first first-person shooter. But CrossfireX was poorly received upon release in 2022 — campaign mode included — and shut down a year later. Remedy also attempted to get into the world of free-to-play games through a partnership with Tencent, but the title — known as Project Vanguard — eventually shifted to a premium release, before finally being canceled before it was ever shown to the public. Virtala says that these setbacks were largely a result of pushing too far too fast. And in the case of Vanguard, the failure helped the studio realize that four games at a time was the sweet spot for what the company could manage. “We started to feel that we had a bit too many projects for our size of organization,” he explains. “We saw that if we had a bit more focus, it would help our other projects to succeed.” But those failures don’t mean Remedy is done trying new things. In fact, the studio’s first fully self-published game, FBC: Firebreak, is also one of its most surprising releases. It’s a multiplayer shooter, which might sound like an odd release from a studio known for single-player narratives. But as the studio looked to expand, multiplayer was one of the key areas the team wanted to explore. “We want to explore ways of building new types of experiences.” Firebreak is a relative baby step in that direction. It’s connected to a popular game the studio owns, and it was built by a small internal team. While regular updates are planned — including “major” releases in the fall and winter — Firebreak isn’t a live-service game on par with Fortnite or Call of Duty, designed to keep players coming back with ongoing events and daily activities. It’s a paid game meant explicitly to “respect the player’s time.” It’s also a way for the studio to expand its capabilities without stretching the team too far. “We want to explore ways of building new types of experiences,” says Mike Kayatta, game director on Firebreak. “I like to think that we know what we’re doing when it comes to these large, single-player story-driven games. This is how the studio built its reputation and what it’s good at. When you’re faced with saying, ‘Hey, we need to diversify the types of experiences we’re making,’ do you really just want to just make five more of these linear, story-driven games?” So far, Firebreak’s release hasn’t gone exactly to plan. It was greeted with mixed reviews from critics and players, many of whom complained that, while it maintains some of the weird and unsettling tone as Control, it’s held back by repetitive gameplay and a lack of Remedy-style narrative flourishes. But the studio seems intent on fixing things, recently posting an extensive list of patch notes and other upcoming changes that cover everything from the onboarding experience to the UI. “Several things have gone well,” the studio wrote. “Clearly, not everything has.” The success of a game like Firebreak is still critical for Remedy even under its multi-project structure. It’s a complex plan that has kept Virtala very busy over the last 10 years. In fact, when I spoke to him in an empty conference room at Remedy’s office, he was delayed because he had to prepare for the studio’s most recent financial report the next day. “Every single game is highly important for us,” Virtala says. “There is no question that we are not fully insulated. But we are less dependent on any single game than we used to be.” This feeling is only strengthened by the current realities of the gaming industry. It’s a space where even a well-funded EA studio can’t get a Black Panther game made, a Sony-backed multiplayer shooter in development for eight years, Concord, is quickly shuttered, and the likes of Netflix and Amazon are struggling to make headway despite huge investments. Remedy is currently in a good place, with a growing back catalog and multiple games in development, and while it has grown, it’s still a fraction of the size of most other studios making big-budget games, which often have headcounts in the thousands. While the last decade has been a big shift at Remedy, Lake describes his time at the studio as being filled with constant change, as the company steadily grew in terms of both staff and the scale of its projects. Even still, he believes that the current incarnation of the studio might be ideal for this multi-project structure, and says that he “would be surprised” if Remedy continued to grow significantly over the next few years. While many large studios are seemingly focused on perpetual growth, the team at Remedy is happy to be sustainable. “There were a couple of false starts trying to get there, but now it feels very much like we’re settled,” says Lake. “This is what Remedy is now.” A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. © 2025 Vox Media, LLC.

Title: Tesla's long-awaited robotaxi rollout faced bumps in the road
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-robotaxi-austin-waymo-google-video-elon-musk-uber-stock-2025-6
Time Published: 2025-06-25T11:33:01Z
Full Content:
Good morning. An American moved to France expecting the workplace dynamics to resemble those back home — they were wrong. For one, they had grown used to friendly yet professional office interactions with clear boundaries. Paris was different, they said. Workplace relationships felt far more personal. In today's big story, Tesla's long-awaited robotaxis were rolled out in Austin. What's on deck Markets: From interviewing past midnight to scrambling to sign an offer, a PE professional shared his stressful on-cycle recruitment experience. Tech: Apple pulled another ad. What's going on? Business: Homebuyers can't afford to ignore the fight between Zillow and Compass anymore. But first, there's a driver who won't judge your playlist. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. There were some bumps in the road. After a decade of waiting, Tesla launched a limited self-driving car service in Austin. The first Tesla robotaxi rides were available on Sunday to a small group of invited users for a flat fee of $4.20 (surely not a coincidence). For now, the service is geofenced to avoid Austin's more challenging intersections. The cars came with a passenger already buckled in — a Tesla employee as a safety precaution. In footage seen by BI, there appeared to be no significant intervention from the supervisor. The vehicles did several things right, but the rollout wasn't without its hiccups. One video showed a passenger being driven across double yellow lines into the wrong lane, prompting a car behind to honk at it. During the same ride, the robotaxi also exceeded the 35-mph speed limit on multiple occasions. While the rollout used the current Tesla Model Y, sources told BI the company is building a modified version of the car for its robotaxi fleet. The project, internally referred to as "Halo," involves cars with self-cleaning cameras and extra protection for the cameras to prevent damage and debris, one insider said. The rollout came at a turbulent time for Musk. At the end of March, Tesla capped its worst quarter since 2022 amid protests at its showrooms. Then, earlier this month, Tesla stock plummeted more than 14% following a very embittered, very public falling out between Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump. Competition is also fierce. Waymo has such cabs in several cities, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Austin. They don't require human supervisors to be present, and their service range in Austin is about twice the size of Tesla's current operating limits. Their technology differs, too. Tesla relies on a set of cameras mounted on its vehicles, rather than expensive radar and lidar sensors used by Waymo. This is in part why Musk expects Tesla's purpose-built Cybercab to sell for less than $30,000. Waymo, meanwhile, retrofits existing vehicles with its technology, which can result in a list price as high as $70,000. Although the robotaxi arrived years later than promised, Tesla's rollout was a critical step for Musk's ambitions to make an Uber-like network of autonomous vehicles. The company's stock price leapt 8% when the markets opened on Monday, causing Musk's net worth to jump by $19 billion. 1. Inside private equity's recruiting nightmare. The industry's process for hiring junior talent is notoriously competitive and chaotic. One PE professional shared his recruiting experience with BI, detailing how he interviewed until 2:30 a.m. with one firm and hid in the bathroom to call headhunters during interviews with another. 2. More Fed officials are calling for rate cuts. Three top officials appear to be on the same page as President Donald Trump after the Fed decided to hold interest rates steady last week. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell defended the central bank's patient approach in his testimony to Congress on Tuesday. Here's what the Fed officials are saying. 3. Tariff worries could soon make a comeback. July 9 is the end of the 90-day pause on Trump's tariffs. Markets are in relief mode now over Israel and Iran's ceasefire, but Morgan Stanley laid out three reasons why tariff anxiety could take center stage again. 1. How AI data centers are deepening the water crisis. Large AI data centers each guzzle up millions of gallons of fresh water a day — enough for tens of thousands of Americans. Despite drought deepening, a BI investigation found that Big Tech companies have put nearly half of these centers in the most water-stressed areas of the US. 2. Why does Apple keep pulling its ads? The iPhone maker used to be infamous for its ad campaigns, but now Apple is becoming more known for yanking them. Its latest ad vanished from YouTube and Apple's site a few days ago, and BI's Peter Kafka doesn't get why. 3. What we know about the mystery device from OpenAI and Jony Ive. Or rather, what it won't be. Tang Tan, cofounder of Ive's io, revealed in legal filings that the highly anticipated AI device doesn't go in your ear and isn't a wearable. 1. Homebuyers are caught in the middle of an ugly real-estate fistfight. Compass and Zillow have been trading blows over who gets to see the houses for sale in America and where buyers will have to go to find them. Everyday consumers can't afford to ignore it anymore, writes BI's James Rodriguez. 2. The vibes are rank in HR right now. Nonstop layoffs, RTO mandates, AI training demands, not to mention concerns over immigration raids in the workplace — it's all piling up on HR workers. They told BI about the parts of the job that are getting downright ugly. 3. Disney's tough June. The company laid off workers for the second time this month, this time in product and technology. The layoffs affected under 2% of the group, according to a person with direct knowledge. Fed Chair Jerome Powell presents semiannual monetary policy report to the Senate Banking Committee.

Title: Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan on how he shrugged off Trump’s accusations
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/06/25/bank-of-america-ceo-brian-moynihan-on-how-he-shrugged-off-trumps-accusations/
Time Published: 2025-06-25T08:54:20Z
Full Content:
Diane Brady is executive editorial director of the Fortune CEO Initiative and Fortune Live Media. She also writes the CEO Daily newsletter. Good morning. Every time I’ve seen Brian Moynihan over the years, whether it was at a press briefing after being called America’s worst big bank CEO early in his tenure or watching him get trashed by Donald Trump on stage at Davos, one word has come to mind: unflappable. Now in his 16th year as CEO of Bank of America, Moynihan plays the long game. In this week’s Leadership Next podcast, the man now considered to be one of America’s best big bank CEOs says he would have told his younger self to move faster at making change and to “stay strong, keep calm and carry on.” “I testified in Congress before I was CEO,” he says, “and was told by the head of a House investigation committee ‘there’s no way you should be CEO of this company.’ He didn’t think our company was any good or I was any good.” Flash forward a few years and that person was “a good colleague” on other issues. “I don’t hold grudges” quips Moynihan, “except as an Irish person for 100 years.” Growing up with seven siblings in Marietta, Ohio, Moynihan wanted to be a criminal lawyer like Perry Mason. Instead, he became a corporate lawyer for FleetBoston Financial, which merged with BofA in 2004. Tapped as CEO in 2010, Moynihan recently said he would like to stay until the stock price more than doubles to $100—which he seems confident about achieving in these volatile times. “You need to be willing to step in and lead in good times and bad times,” he says. “Some people wear that responsibility like a comfortable sweater and some people could never get into it.” As for that moment in Davos when Trump publicly accused him of refusing to do business with conservatives? “What you try to be is an energy giver, not an energy taker. So when you’re in a situation of pressure, how do you give people energy? By being calm and showing them a way to do something as a team and as a group that enables you to make progress.” That’s a quality he hires for, too: “You’re looking for people who can be calm at a point of attack,” he says. “When 210,000 team members look at you, they don’t want to see a person who’s going to panic. You may have nervous energy behind you or wonder in the middle of night, what the heck is going on? But if you show that and you let it eat at you, you can’t give energy.” You can listen to our full conversation on Apple, Spotify or YouTube. More news below.Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com NATO on edge for Trump visit The president is in The Hague today for a top-level NATO meeting at which the military alliance is expected to confirm big increases in defense spending. On the way to the Netherlands, Trump cast doubt on the U.S.’s commitment to Article 5, the part of the NATO treaty that says if one member is attacked, all members must respond. “Depends on your definition. There are numerous definitions of Article 5. You know that, right? But I’m committed to being their friends,” he told reporters on Air Force One. Trump shares DM from NATO chief The president also posted on social media an obsequious personal message from NATO chief Mark Rutte welcoming him to the meeting. It calls Trump “truly extraordinary” and says “You will achieve something NO American president in decades could get done.” Read it here. Leaked Pentagon report downplays Iran bombing The U.S. air strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities did less damage than the president claimed and probably only set back their development by months, according to a leaked report from the Defense Intelligence Agency. The report suggests that although the entrances to the underground bunkers were caved in the facilities inside remain intact. Trump used social media to insist that the sites were “obliterated.” Meanwhile, the ceasefire between Iran and Israel, briefly broken yesterday, seems to be holding. Judge rules against Jony Ive and Sam Altman A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order against Ive and Altman’s io AI device venture, according to the FT. OpenAI was forced to take down a blog post announcing their deal because it may infringe upon a trademark established by iyO, a startup founded by Jason Rugolo, who is also pursuing a wearable AI device. Landmark AI copyright decision A U.S. District Judge has ruled that it was “fair use” for AI company Anthropic to train its models on copyrighted books. That is, as long as Anthropic purchased those books and didn’t pirate them. Powell talks to Congress Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell told Congress on Tuesday that interest rates haven’t been lowered yet because the Fed predicts a “meaningful increase in inflation over the course of this year.” Powell notably declined to comment on President Trump’s policies during the Congressional hearing.

Major U.S. equities indexes gained ground on Tuesday after President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire agreement between Iran and Israel, raising hopes for a more sustained drawdown in hostilities. Investors also kept an eye on Congressional testimony by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Powell indicated that the central bank intends to maintain interest rates at their current levels until there is more clarity on tariff policy and its potential economic impact, despite the White House's calls for immediate rate cuts. The S&P 500 gained 1.1%, closing just beneath its record-high level set in February. The Dow was up 1.2%, while the Nasdaq jumped 1.4%. Shares of Coinbase Global (COIN), operator of the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S., skyrocketed 12.1% on Tuesday to secure the S&P 500's top performance. Analysts at the research firm Benchmark lifted their price target on Coinbase stock, pointing to favorable legislative and regulatory developments and the company's initiatives to capitalize on them. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that the department would launch a massive advertising campaign to encourage the use of wearable health devices. Kennedy specifically mentioned the benefits of glucose monitors for patients managing diabetes. Shares of glucose monitor manufacturer Dexcom (DXCM) surged 9.7%. Uber Technologies (UBER) shares jumped 7.5% as the ridesharing company debuted its robotaxi service in Atlanta. Uber's partnership with Waymo, the autonomous vehicle company owned by Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), initially offers service in 65 square miles of Atlanta, around half the city's footprint. Carnival Corporation (CCL) posted better-than-expected sales and profits for its fiscal first quarter, and the cruise operator's shares sailed 6.9% higher. The company also boosted its full-year profit outlook, pointing to increases in passengers carried and passenger cruise days as well as declining costs. Shares of competitors Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) and Royal Caribbean Group (RCL) also advanced. AutoZone (AZO) shares dropped 3.6%, losing the most of any S&P 500 stock on Tuesday, following reports that a senior vice president at the auto parts retailer had sold a stake in the company worth more than $2.5 million. Investors often view large sales by company insiders as a negative signal for a stock. Crude oil futures tumbled as optimism around de-escalation in the Middle East helped alleviate potential supply concerns. Shares of energy company Occidental Petroleum (OXY) fell 3.3%, while Exxon Mobil shares (XOM) were down 3%. The potential for calming geopolitical tensions also pressured defense stocks. Northrop Grumman (NOC) shares dropped 3.2%, while shares of aerospace and defense peers RTX Corp. (RTX) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) also traded lower.

Title: Stocks Near All-Time High as Oil Prices Tumble

US stocks climbed near their all-time high on Tuesday after oil prices eased further on hopes that Israel's war with Iran will not damage the global flow of crude. The S&P 500 rallied 1.1% Tuesday and got back within 0.8% of its record. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.2%. The Nasdaq composite jumped 1.4%. Oil prices fell roughly 6% and are below where they were before the Israel-Iran conflict began, the AP reports. Oil prices began falling sharply on Monday after Iran launched what appeared to be a limited retaliatory strike to the United States' entry into the war, one that did not target the production or movement of oil. They kept falling even after attacks continued past a deadline to stop hostilities early Tuesday. President Trump later said that the ceasefire was "in effect." With the global oil market well supplied and the OPEC+ alliance of producing countries steadily increasing production, oil prices could be headed even lower as long as the ceasefire holds and a lasting peace solution can be found, says Carsten Fritsch, commodities analyst at Commerzbank. Falling oil prices should take some pressure off inflation, and that in turn could give the Federal Reserve leeway to resume cutting interest rates. Fed Chair Jerome Powell remains cautious. He said again in testimony delivered to Congress Tuesday that the Fed is "well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance." But he did indicate the next move is likely to be a cut. Asked whether a reduction could arrive as soon as July, Powell said, "We will get to a place where we cut rates, sooner rather than later—but I wouldn't want to point to a particular meeting."

They kept falling even after attacks continued past a deadline to stop hostilities early Tuesday. President Trump later said that the ceasefire was "in effect." On Wall Street, cruise operator Carnival steamed 6.9% higher after delivering a much stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Josh Weinstein said it's seeing strong demand from people booking cruises close to the departure date, and customers are spending strongly once on board. Carnival also raised its forecast for an underlying measure of profit for the full year. Uber Technologies rose 7.5% after it said customers in Atlanta can use its app to ride in Waymo autonomous vehicles. Coinbase Global rallied 12.1% as the cryptocurrency exchange rose with the price of bitcoin, which jumped back above $105,000.

Title: This is how over 40% of NYC bookstores became unionized.
URL: https://lithub.com/this-is-how-over-40-of-nyc-bookstores-became-unionized/
Time Published: 2025-06-24T17:53:53Z

The books world has been full of labor action in the last few years, most recently with Quirk Books voting to form a union with the NewsGuild and Abrams Books winning their vote to form a union with the UAW. Bookstores have especially been at the forefront of this push to organize. On May Day, I went to an event at Verso’s offices featuring unionized booksellers talking about their work and their organizing. One fact jumped out at me: over 40% of all bookstores in New York City are unionized, which is four times the nation average. That 40% is likely about to be even higher with the news that The Center for Fiction just won voluntary union recognition. How did bookstores in New York get to such a high union density? I spoke to five bookstore workers in NYC about their experiences organizing, how COVID changed the perceptions of their work, and how they find inspiration in each others’ struggles. Thanks to Aaron, Pilar, Henri, Joe, and Maritza for taking the time to talk to me. Their responses, which were so in depth and thoughtful, have been edited for length and clarity. Aaron Lascano, shop steward, writer, game designer, and Senior Bookseller at Barnes & Noble Union Square, RWDSU Maria Pilar Beddall, bookseller at Book Culture, with RWDSU Henri Seguin, bookseller at The Center for Fiction, RWDSU Joe Gross, poet and Lead Visual Merchandiser at The Strand, UAW Local 2179 Maritza Montañez, improviser and buyer at Greenlight Bookstore in Brooklyn, RWDSU AARON: I wanted to organize a union at Barnes & Noble because every single one of my coworkers deserved to be treated and paid better … workers at other companies like Amazon and Starbucks had begun their own union campaigns to win better pay and working conditions. They showed us the path forward—the only way to regain power in the workplace and to bring your employer to the bargaining table is to unionize. HENRI: I had been asking around about a union because I came from Elliot Bay Books in Seattle. (Editor’s note: They started their own union!) Elliot Bay had this really wonderful structure they had started during COVID and fought for during that crazy time. So they were just total seasoned veterans of union work and the benefits that it brought to the space … So I came in [to The Center for Fiction] very eager and with some backgrounds in that work. And then getting into the Center, it was lot different than I expected. It’s not just a bookstore, it’s also a cafe, and it’s also a nonprofit. And so although it’s a small organization, I saw a lot of the same issues as at Elliott Bay … And then there was a big renegotiating of contracts at the end of the year. A lot of shuffling around that—you know, I can’t totally speak to everyone’s experience—but my own, I was told one thing and then didn’t get that in terms of pay … It was a big upset and we started discussing how to fix this, and how the Center can work in the long term, because it just didn’t feel, without the union, like it had longevity in the system. So we saw [the union] as a tonic to fix these structural issues. PILAR: We need unions, we have always needed unions, without them we have no real chance of a better, more just future. MARITZA: Most of my extended family has spent decades in physically demanding jobs, and many of their hardest jobs as migrant or seasonal farm workers offered the fewest protections. I took their stories to heart and cared about worker rights sort of implicitly. I didn’t anticipate organizing myself, but working in retail changed me a lot and made me more comfortable talking to people, including my coworkers. Eventually it became clear that we wanted similar things from our jobs, and that it would be safest to advocate for ourselves with formal union protections. JOE: In short, non-union life is no kind of life. AARON: I think I talked a lot about a union as stability. A union contract sets pay and certain policies clearly, meaning you’re no longer at the whims of management. You can bargain out policies to protect people in case of layoffs or store closure (which we did), you can bargain for more safety training and a clear banning policy (which we did). Without a union, we felt like bookselling wasn’t a job you could depend on for more than a year. JOE: We talked about precarity. We talked about being the lowest paid unionized booksellers in the city, which had become common knowledge inside and outside the shop as people who worked or applied to work at other shops filtered through. …We talked about how many of us worked two jobs or picked up freelance assignments to make ends meet. A bargaining committee member who wanted to continue working at The Strand but couldn’t afford to left the store early in negotiations and returned home—we talked about that. MARITZA: Our earliest conversations were casual in tone, validating, and a huge relief. One of my coworkers got a handful of BIPOC booksellers she trusted from both stores to join a Zoom after her last day at the store, and we essentially had a three-hour venting session as our first meeting. After that, our meetings got much more structured but it felt very much like we were looking out for one another and trying to make meetings as easy as possible to attend. PILAR: Because we need to! The threat of Bezos, and the more existential threats posed by capitalism and the government mean that the interests of booksellers and the literal work of book selling is more important than ever. And probably in the face of Trump and everything else, owners and bosses seem much less formidable. JOE: My longtime friend since elementary school, Aaron Lascano, was working at Barnes & Noble Union Square and helping to negotiate his bargaining unit’s first contract while I was assisting with Strand workers’ contract renegotiations, and of course we spoke to each other about our various victories and defeats until eventually we got members of our bargaining committees into a room together and began trading information. We showed up for each other’s rallies and pickets where we could, and RWDSU research…confirmed our suspicions that Strand workers were earning less than any other unionized booksellers in the city. The big takeaway from their reporting, though, was that upwards of 40% of all book shops in NYC were unionized, which is extremely high for any industry and opens a world of possibility in terms of contract alignment, the creation of industry-wide standards, and a base from which to organize related industries. AARON: I think that part of it has to do with the types of workers that bookstores draw. There are plenty of students working at my shop, but there are also a lot of working artists (writers, actors, etc.), as well as people who have previously held unionized jobs as mail carriers, truck drivers, and teachers … We also are kind of in a bookstore resurgence–in NYC, B&N is really coming back, but the smaller stores are seeing it too. So we’re working harder days, moving more product and talking to more people, and we’re not seeing our pay rise with the rise in sales and work unless we unionize. HENRI: Bookstores and the larger literary world is an industry of passion and personal interest. It’s very easy to gloss over a lot of issues because you’re sharing your love of literature, and of books, and you have a community of like-minded people around you. But the thing about COVID is that it really stripped us down to “oh, no, it’s a service industry job.” It’s minimum wage, you’re under the heel of a lot of pressures, and you don’t have a lot of agency when it came down to it… you’re doing something you love, but you’re not treated in a loving manner. MARITZA: It almost feels cliche to say, but I really do think the pandemic pushed a lot of people to act on their values. The economy and our industry shut down and stripped away some of the biggest perks that come with bookselling and left a lot of booksellers with just the toughest parts of our jobs. I think a lot of us had similar experiences: we lost the higher paying jobs and gigs that subsidized our low bookseller wages, and we either risked our health for low wages or got laid off by employers who received PPP loans. Many of my newer coworkers came from other industries that also got shaken up by the pandemic and were surprised by conditions so many booksellers accepted as industry standards, and that really reframed our expectations as well. JOE: And we read. Anyone who reads history knows the only reason any workers anywhere have any sort of rights is because past workers formed unions, and radical, militant ones at that. AARON: I was most surprised by how quickly people were willing to step up. Bargaining took about a year and half, and in that time, we had a lot of different people volunteer their time to help run the union. Even as new people got hired at B&N, they’d immediately get involved by coming to bargaining and making time to meet with the committee. Keeping any shop organized is difficult and time consuming, and it can only be done if workers step up to make it happen. JOE: Organizing tests whether you’ll show up for something that’s possible but not yet probable, and every one of my comrades did. MARITZA: I was anxious about talking to people who might think bookselling is too easy a job to organize, and I’ve been pleasantly surprised by how many workers in other industries immediately understand that bookselling is worth unionizing. More and more people agree that workers benefit from unions regardless of what industry they work in. HENRI: It’s been really encouraging to see the different workers and my colleagues step up in really encouraging ways. You know someone through their function at work, but the union work has really broadened that perspective. I’ve seen my colleagues and now my friends stay up late,wake up super early, plan all sorts of sort of contingencies and write drafts letters. And to see that work was a reflection of our commitment to The Center and its mission, it just makes the workspace feel a lot more purpose driven and inviting. AARON: I’ve been inspired by the progress we’ve made as a unionized industry. In NYC, the RWDSU now covers B&N, McNally Jackson, Book Culture, and Greenlight. I’ve started organizing meetings with shop stewards from those stores and also Strand (covered by the UAW), so we can begin having conversations about building a new standard. I firmly believe that, if unions are to really make headway and regain power in this country, they need to provide a robust vision for working people. It can’t just be about raises, it has to be about reclaiming power, reclaiming dignity, reclaiming time from our jobs. And to get there, to really get contracts that can change people’s lives, unions have to link arms and act in concert with one another. We have to bargain together, picket together, and strike together. We have to re-learn what solidarity means and how to effectively perform solidarity. JOE: So many people showed up for us when our negotiations stalled and we went on strike: the patrons who boycotted the store, comrades from Alamo Drafthouse, Cinema Village, and Nitehawk Cinemas who are currently negotiating their own contracts, comrades from UAW Region 9A and UAWD, comrades from the RWDSU, and socialist elected officials from across the city including Zohran Mamdani and Brad Lander. I’m grateful, and I think people are realizing the existential importance of organizing outside traditional political structures, and unions are key to providing alternative avenues of engagement. Unions should not be siloed in singular shops. They are political vehicles, and the most obvious ones at that. MARITZA: It’s been inspiring to recognize that we’re part of a larger labor movement. The organizer who worked most closely with us at Greenlight also worked with Amazon workers in Bessemer, and that was humbling for me. I am sappy so the things that most inspire me are hearing my coworkers advocate for each other or praise each others’ work. I also love little and tangible things, like so many of my coworkers got new and long-overdue glasses after our first contract because the company agreed to a vision plan for part-timers, and that felt like a small but important and immediately actionable win. MARITZA: My advice is to do it! And more specifically: make space for your coworkers to talk. Not everyone is comfortable complaining about work, especially at work– give your coworkers a safe place to talk, maybe on Zoom or some bar where their complaints won’t be overheard by the wrong people at the wrong time. Then give people some grace while you find common ground. Very practically, I’d recommend researching similar workplaces that have unions and find a contact there to start walking you through what you need to do (and stress that you want to be discreet). If you’re in an industry that hasn’t historically had many unions, think about what the day-to-day of your work looks like, and see if there are parallels in another industry. AARON: Before I started my own journey, all I could think about was how much better my coworkers deserved. I knew that we could and would win this campaign, that we could and would improve our lives. But I didn’t anticipate how our campaign would ripple outwards. The militancy of the B&N campaign, which involved actions including delegations, practice pickets, and a couple of walkouts, made conditions more favorable for other union campaigns to push back against their bosses. We rallied and picketed with Strand, took note of the concessions their bosses made to them, and then the concessions our bosses made to us were noted by other bookstores that were re-negotiating their contracts. The work that we did at B&N Union Square, B&N Park Slope, B&N Upper West Side, Strand, etc., didn’t just improve our individual stores. It helped improve the lives of hundreds of workers around NYC. JOE: Talk about the shit that sucks. Don’t get any lofty ideas to start with; just complain to and commiserate with each other about every little and big way your job drains you and disrespects you and you’ll find that Baldwin quote about Dostoevsky proven true: your pain and heartache aren’t unprecedented in the history of the world and you share the path toward their alleviation. And never, under any circumstances, accept a tiered contract. PILAR: Do it, talk to each other, ask questions, reach out to members, and remember that no one has ever relinquished power willingly, even for things as small as better hours, or more holiday time. AARON: I am reading Roberto Bolaño’s Savage Detectives. I’m Latino, and I’ve been spending more time reading and thinking about Latino history, politics, and culture. I think Bolaño does an incredible job at capturing the fallout of American-backed coups and American imperialism in Latin America. PILAR: Jesus and John Wayne by Kristin Kobes Du Mez. JOE: Andrei Platonov’s Chevengur, which is a novel of ardent ennui that follows the forays of the October Revolution into the expanse of the Russian steppe and the people navigating that horizon, the space between the joining of a fight that was always going on whether they acknowledged it or not and the future they hope to win from it. MARITZA: I’m currently reading Miriam Toews’ A Truce That Is Not Peace and Oyinkan Braithwaite’s Cursed Daughters. HENRI: One that I adored is this very strange book called One or Two by H.D. Everett. It’s [published] by Mandylion Press who highlight lost feminist and female writers, and this book is about a woman who, in order to lose weight, exorcises her body, and then that exorcised clump of weight that she loses gains sentience and haunts her. And it’s also probably the most beautiful book binding I’ve seen in a long time. It’s an absolutely gorgeous little book. AARON: Solidarity is altruism, faith, strength … You engage this fight not knowing where it will go, not knowing that you’ll succeed, but knowing that you have a moral obligation to stand with fellow workers… it begins with the basic understanding that our fight is one fight, and that an injury to any worker is an injury to every worker. HENRI: For me, solidarity is just very simply showing up when things get hard. Especially just across the nation, there’s been a lot of examples of moments where showing up is the hardest thing to do, but it is the most important thing. And I’ve seen it at The Center, which is really wonderful. I’ve seen workers who are at their limits reach out for help and people lift them up… it’s kind of banal, but I think at its core it’s just showing up when it’s hard. JOE: Solidarity is a full and complete commitment to causes that nominally are not your own because you realize that every human cause is of mortal importance when you live in the same time and space and can only affect a real reduction in suffering by collectively exerting the power of all peoples. Either everyone has unalienable rights or no one does. MARITZA: For me, solidarity means mutual support, a willingness to take risks for one another and protect one another, and a feeling of investment in each other’s well-being. PILAR: Solidarity means remembering that we are not alone in the struggle, that victories have been won before and will be won again, as long as we fight together.

June 24, 2025 13:00 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, June 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming July 11, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Elevance Health, Inc. (“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV) common stock between April 18, 2024, and October 16, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR ELEVANCE INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On July 17, 2024, Elevance disclosed that it was “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population, including in outpatient home health, radiology, durable medical equipment, as well as some elective procedures.” On this news, Elevance’s stock price fell $32.21, or 5.8%, to close at $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024, thereby injuring investors. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance released its third quarter 2024 financial results, missing EPS consensus estimates by 13.7% “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” Additionally, the Company lowered its EPS guidance for 2024 by 11.3%. On this news, Elevance’s stock price fell $52.61, or 10.6%, to close at $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024, thereby injuring investors further. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) sicker patients with higher acuity tended to remain on Medicaid after redetermination, leading to higher per-patient costs; (2) this increase in cost was occurring at a rate that was not adequately reflected in Elevance's rate negotiations with the states or in its financial guidance for 2024; and (3) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Elevance common stock during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than July 11, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Title: Oricom and E Ink Deliver Full Color Electronic Paper Signage to Create a Sustainable Advertising Medium

June 24, 2025 12:35 ET | Source: E Ink E Ink BILLERICA, Mass., June 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- E Ink (8069.TW) the originator, pioneer, and global commercial leader in electronic paper (ePaper) technology, today announced, in collaboration with Oricom Co., Ltd., a vanguard in the Japan ad agency scene, the next-generation advertising medium via the Sustainable Board. Featuring E Ink’s most vivid color ePaper, Spectra TM 6, Oricom will produce the Sustainable Board as a new channel for advertisers, offering an unprecedented, environmentally conscious advertising method. The product is an innovative, sustainability-dedicated medium for companies using Oricom’s brand, Mirapale. While being conscious of energy consumption, it actively communicates sustainable priorities and initiatives. Sustainable Board is ultra-low-power digital signage that uses E Ink’s ePaper technology. E Ink’s Spectra 6 offers a wide viewing angle similar to paper and enables vivid color expression like a print-quality poster. Because it’s a reflective display that doesn’t use a backlight, it achieves especially high sunlight readability. Additionally, it only requires power when content is updated, and image content remains visible once displayed without consuming any energy. This allows for substantial energy savings compared to conventional displays. Moreover, signage products equipped with E Ink’s ePaper, which boasts these features, can operate on batteries or renewable energy sources like solar. This makes it possible to choose their installation locations with more flexibility and mobility in mind. “We are very grateful to collaborate with Oricom, a leader in the advertising industry, in the electronic paper signage area,” said JM Hung, Vice President of Business Center at E Ink. “As we enter an era of global environmental preservation and environmentally conscious solutions are increasingly sought, our ePaper is a display technology that aligns with a more environmentally-friendly future. Through our collaboration with Oricom, we are confident we can contribute to advancing SDG activities in society.” Expected installation sites range from company receptions, lobbies, and showrooms to commercial facilities and tourist destinations. This product is recognized as a novel method that aligns corporate branding with environmental responsiveness by making sustainability tangible. Providing sustainable advertising mediums will generate a new market in the advertising industry. Oricom intends to promote broader Sustainable Development Goals by enabling companies and local governments to leverage this environmentally conscious advertising platform. “Amidst the expansion of corporate activities with a long-term vision, prioritizing environmental protection and social responsibility, advertising is similarly called upon to contribute from this perspective,” said Akemi Nakajima, President of Oricom. “We developed the Sustainable Board alongside E Ink as a specific method for this. Moving forward, we will continue to strengthen the relationship between both companies, supporting corporate growth while contributing to realizing a sustainable society.” E Ink’s ePaper draws power only when the screen updates, and no energy-hungry backlight is required. This ultra-efficient, non-emissive design reduces both electricity use and carbon footprint versus paper or LCDs. Guided by its PESG (Product, Environment, Social, and Governance) framework, E Ink delivers low-carbon solutions that speed the world’s sustainable transition. FTSE Russell classifies 99.9 % of the company’s revenue as green, and Moody’s has confirmed E Ink’s loans align with global Green Loan Principles—clear proof of its industry-leading environmental performance. Installation trials at major stations in Japan are underway for Sustainable Board. The future goal is to expand into places with high advertising needs, such as commercial facilities. About E InkE Ink Holdings Inc. (8069.TWO), based on technology from MIT's Media Lab, provides an ideal display medium for applications spanning eReaders and eNotes, retail, home, hospital, transportation, logistics, and more, enabling customers to put displays in locations previously impossible.

Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), and other semiconductor companies surged Tuesday, amid broader market gains as investors welcomed news of a cease-fire agreement between Israel and Iran. AMD stock was up 5% in recent trading, making it one of the best-performing stocks on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, while Broadcom added 4%. Intel (INTC), Nvidia (NVDA), and TSMC (TSM) were also among the other chip stocks on the rise, boosting the PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) over 3%. Micron Technology (MU) climbed 4% higher a day ahead of its quarterly results. On Monday, Melius analysts reportedly said AMD stock “has a lot more to go” as the company’s position in the artificial intelligence industry grows. The broker raised its price target to $175 from $110, above the Wall Street consensus of roughly $124 compiled by Visible Alpha. Broadcom stock meanwhile got an upgrade to “buy” from “hold” by analysts at HSBC Tuesday. The bank raised its price target to $400 from $240, placing it well above the Street consensus of $294. The chipmaker's application-specific integrated circuit business has the "potential to knock our socks off," HSBC said.

Title: High tariffs give Trump less room for error in Iran | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: The US economy needs the fragile ceasefire President Donald Trump brokered in the Middle East to hold. If the pause in fighting between Israel and Iran fails and major hostilities resume, oil prices would likely spike again. And surging gasoline prices are the last thing the US economy needs right now. Inflation is already expected to heat up this summer because of Trump’s massive tariffs on imports. An oil shock would make matters worse — perhaps much worse. “It would be a bit of a double-whammy. First there’s the stagflationary shock from tariffs. And then a potential oil shock,” Alan Blinder, economics professor at Princeton University and a former top Federal Reserve official, told CNN in a phone interview. In many ways, Trump’s trade war gives him less margin for error in the Middle East. He can’t afford another world event that causes inflation to rear its ugly head again and further delays rate cuts from the Fed. “The economy is vulnerable to anything that could go wrong, and this certainly qualifies,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. That’s why investors are breathing a huge sigh of relief in recent days. Stocks have popped and oil prices have plunged in one of the biggest sell-offs in years. Iran’s response to US strikes on nuclear sites was far more limited, and symbolic, than feared. Not only that, but the ceasefire between Israel and Iran eases fears that vital energy infrastructure in the region will get caught in the crossfire. The nightmare scenario had been that Iran would try to close the Strait of Hormuz, the most critical oil chokepoint on the planet. Analysts have warned that if this waterway shut down, oil prices could easily spike beyond $100 or $120 a barrel, causing a return of $4 to $4.50 gas in the US. As of Sunday, the odds of Iran closing the Strait of Hormuz spiked to about 60% on prediction platform Polymarket. But by Tuesday, the odds plunged to just 17% as investors bet the worst in the Israel-Iran crisis may be over. Observers have noted that closing the Strait of Hormuz would be counterproductive for Iran, which relies on the waterway to get its own oil to customers, mostly in China. “They would be shooting themselves in the foot,” Blinder said, “but countries have been known to do that.” Critics of Trump’s aggressive use of tariffs warn that they will backfire, too. However, inflation has cooled in recent months even as Trump has lobbed tariffs on autos, steel, aluminum and imports from most countries. Yet many economists say this is the calm before the storm, with tariff-fueled price hikes on the way. Some items exposed to tariffs like appliances, toys and electronics have already become more expensive. “In many ways, the past few months may be transitory low inflation before the price effect of tariffs hit,” Bob Elliott, CEO of alternative investment firm Unlimited, told CNN in a phone interview. “No serious economist would look at inflationary trends and forecast they will exist into the future.” Unless tariffs get dramatically scaled back, Elliott said inflation is likely to heat up by 1% to 1.5% from current levels. “That’s not going to be acceptable for the Fed,” said Elliott. In testimony before Congress Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated the central bank’s wait-and-see stance, telling lawmakers: “I wouldn’t want to point to a particular meeting. I don’t think we need to be in any rush because the economy is still strong.” If the situation in the Middle East does turn south again, it would create a potential boost to energy prices. “It would be a tricky combination,” said Elliott, a former executive at hedge fund giant Bridgewater Associates. Oil shocks can be very inflationary because energy prices feed in to many parts of the US economy. Not only that, but there can be a psychological effect given how closely Americans follow gas prices. And it’s only been three years since gas prices spiked above $5 a gallon for the first time ever after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Inflation skyrocketed to four-decade highs and the Fed was forced to put the fire out by dramatically lifting borrowing costs. “People look at prices at the pump as a litmus test for inflation broadly,” said Zandi, the Moody’s economist. For now, gas prices appear to have stabilized. The national average price of regular gas was flat at $3.22 a gallon on Tuesday, according to AAA. That’s up from $3.13 a gallon when Israel attacked Iran earlier this month. However, it’s still lower than $3.45 a gallon a year ago. In a speech on Tuesday, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack noted oil prices “bear watching” given the recent price swings from geopolitical events. “The pain of large increases in energy prices still weighs on consumer spending,” Hammack said, while noting that the US is less exposed to oil shocks than in the past. “Recent increases in oil prices pose an upside risk to the stability of inflation expectations.” The scars of $5 gasoline in 2022 loom large. For now, investors are hoping the ceasefire in the Middle East means there won’t be a repeat today. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, June 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Elevance Health, Inc. (“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV) and reminds investors of the July 11, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the risk and cost profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid programs. While Defendants acknowledged that Medicaid expenses were rising, they repeatedly assured investors that this was adequately reflected in the Company’s guidance for the year. The truth began to emerge on July 17, 2024, when the Company revealed that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.” In response to this disclosure, the price of Elevance common stock declined by $32.21 per share, or 5.8%. However, Defendants continued to make false, reassuring statements to investors concerning the extent of the cost increase and how that was accounted for in the Company’s full year guidance. The truth was further revealed on October 17, 2024, when Elevance announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2024, revealing that the Company had missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations for the quarter by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” Elevance further revealed that it was lowering EPS guidance for 2024 from $37.20 to $33.00, or 11.3%, as it expected these Medicaid issues to continue. T These disclosures caused the price of Elevance common stock to decline by another $52.61 per share, or 10.6%. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Elevance’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Title: Oil prices tumble, and Wall Street nears its record in a worldwide rally for stocks

WFTV Now NEW YORK — (AP) — U.S. stocks rose toward their all-time high on Tuesday after oil prices eased further on hopes that Israel’s war with Iran will not damage the global flow of crude. The S&P 500 climbed 1.1%, following up on big gains for stocks across Europe and Asia, after President Donald Trump said late Monday that Israel and Iran had agreed to a "complete and total ceasefire." The main measure of Wall Street's health is back within 0.8% of its record set in February after falling roughly 20% below during the spring. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 507 points, or 1.2%, and the Nasdaq composite rallied 1.4%. The strongest action was again in the oil market, where a barrel of benchmark U.S. crude fell 6% to settle at $64.37. Brent crude, the international standard, had a similar drop. The fear throughout the Israel-Iran conflict has been that it could squeeze the world's supply of oil, which would pump up prices for gasoline and hurt the global economy. Iran is a major producer of crude, and it could also try to block the Strait of Hormuz off its coast, through which 20% of the world's daily oil needs passes on ships. Oil prices began falling sharply on Monday after Iran launched what appeared to be a limited retaliatory strike to the United States' entry into the war, one that did not target the production or movement of oil. They kept falling even after attacks continued past a deadline to stop hostilities early Tuesday. Trump later said that the ceasefire was "in effect." Oil prices have dropped so much in the last two days that they’re below where they were before the fighting began nearly two weeks ago. With the global oil market well supplied and the OPEC+ alliance of producing countries steadily increasing production, oil prices could be headed even lower as long as the ceasefire holds and a lasting peace solution can be found, said Carsten Fritsch, commodities analyst at Commerzbank. Falling oil prices should take some pressure off inflation, and that in turn could give the Federal Reserve leeway to resume cutting interest rates. Wall Street loves lower rates because they boost the economy by making it cheaper for U.S. households and businesses to borrow money to buy a car or build a factory. But they could also give inflation more fuel. That threat is why the Fed has been hesitant to cut rates this year after lowering them through the end of last year. The Fed has said repeatedly that it wants to wait and see how much Trump's tariffs will hurt the economy and raise inflation before committing to its next move. So far, the economy seems to be holding up OK, though a report on confidence among U.S. consumers came in weaker than economists expected on Tuesday, and inflation has remained only a bit above the Fed's 2% target. Trump has been pushing loudly for more cuts to rates. And two of his appointees to the Fed have said recently they may consider cutting rates as soon as the Fed's next meeting next month. Fed Chair Jerome Powell remains more cautious, though he he did indicate Tuesday that the Fed's next move is likely to be a cut. Asked during testimony before a Congressional committee whether a reduction could arrive as soon as July, Powell said, “We will get to a place where we cut rates, sooner rather than later – but I wouldn’t want to point to a particular meeting. I don’t think we need to be in any rush because the economy is still strong.” That helped Treasury yields ease in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.29% from 4.34% late Monday. The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed action, fell to 3.81% from 3.84%. On Wall Street, cruise operator Carnival steamed 6.9% higher after the cruise operator delivered a much bigger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Josh Weinstein said it’s seeing strong demand from people booking cruises close to the departure date, and customers are spending strongly once on board. Carnival also raised its forecast for an underlying measure of profit for the full year. Uber Technologies rose 7.5% after it said customers in Atlanta can use its app to ride in Waymo autonomous vehicles. Coinbase Global rallied 12.1% as the cryptocurrency exchange rose with the price of bitcoin, which jumped back above $105,000. All told, the S&P 500 rose 67.01 points to 6,092.18. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 507.24 to 43,089.02, and the Nasdaq composite rallied 281.56 to 19,912.53. In stock markets abroad, indexes rallied at least 1% everywhere from France to Germany to Japan following the announcement of the Israel-Iran ceasefire. Hong Kong’s jump of 2.1% and South Korea’s leap of 3% were two of the strongest moves. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Title: Higher Market Volatility Shines a Light on Buffer ETFs

Advisor usage of the products had been on the rise even before the recent tumult, and the new wave of uncertainty has only fueled that growth. June 24, 2025 Markets are facing a fresh round of uncertainty with the United States striking Iranian targets over the weekend and Iran retaliating by firing missiles at a U.S. base in Qatar. Questions loom about the potential for spiking oil prices as observers wait to see if tensions escalate or simmer down. It’s just the latest shock to markets this year. President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs and subsequent announcements have sent stocks and bonds whipsawing amid on-again, off-again developments. The Chicago Board Options Exchange's CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) currently sits at about 20 and at one point in April reached 50—the highest level since the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Easily and efficiently maximizing returns while mitigating risk is the promise driving one of the biggest recent success stories in exchange-traded funds: Defined outcome ETFs. By buying and selling options on the underlying portfolio, like a structured product, these ETFs promise to let investors realize market gains while still getting protection when they fall. The tradeoff: Sacrificing some portion of those gains should the market climb higher than the pre-determined limit. The funds have grown from $5 billion in assets at the end of 2020 to $50 billion by 2025, according to Morningstar. In a recent report, BlackRock projected the space will reach $650 billion by 2030. Even institutional investors are buffing up their portfolios. In December, Bloomberg reported that the University of Connecticut’s endowment sold almost all of its hedge fund exposure in favor of the funds. Related:$6.5B RFG Advisory Launches Suite of Active ETFs “What’s really resonating is the certainty in the downside protection,” said Graham Day, executive vice president and CIO, with Innovator, the firm that launched the first buffer ETF in 2018. “The ability of bonds to protect is now a huge question mark. And so that’s starting to stir the pot more in terms of what advisors are using to manage risk.” Overall, more than 300 buffer ETFs are on the market. Two managers—Innovator and First Trust—still dominate the space, though others are competing by launching variations on the theme (i.e., Calamos has debuted Buffer crypto ETFs) or with lower fees (BlackRock’s funds cost slightly less than the average). Other managers jumping on the buffer ETF train include Goldman Sachs Asset Management, PGIM, Alliance Bernstein and Allianz. “For something that started as a niche product, now the largest asset managers are hopping into the game, which we would expect to drive down costs,” said Patrick Nerney, vice president, investments, with St. Petersburg, Fla.-based Dynasty Financial Partners. “But at the end of day, this is a complex product that requires a nuanced understanding.” Related:Retail Investors Power US ETF Flows Past $500B in 2025 Despite Macro Risks Providers offer a range of buffers, so advisors can choose what percentage of losses they are willing to tolerate and how much upside they are willing to forego. Downside protection can be as low as single-digit percentages or go all the way to 100%. The upside caps vary accordingly. More downside protection, less upside gains and vice versa. As ETFs, they easily fit into most advisor trading platforms and performance reporting tools. They require more handholding than plain-vanilla ETFs. They have fixed time spans—typically a year. Buffer ETFs tied to major stock indices tend to come in monthly flavors, while some newer ETFs offering protection on Bitcoin and other assets are issued quarterly. Investors can roll over into a new version at the end of the defined outcome period. Some try their hand at tactical plays—trading in or out may reduce the protections or, conversely, lock in early gains, but only if timed correctly. In addition, some providers now offer laddered products with blended exposures to provide time-based diversification and automatically roll over into new issuances annually. Related:Seven Must Reads for This Week (June 24, 2025) “The beauty of those is that you can hold them for the long term,” said Rob Kane, director of alternative investments with $285 billion AUM Commonwealth Financial Network. “We continue to see the evolution of trying to make these more of a strategic allocation in a portfolio … something that will be in a portfolio for the next 20 years.” More adventurous advisors use the funds as tactical investments, opportunistically moving in and out of the funds regardless of the time frame in the prospectus. For example, if an investor buys a defined outcome ETF with a 15% upside cap in one month for $100 and the market goes up 5%, they can opt to sell, enter a new buffer ETF, lock in their gains and reset their protection levels. “We do see tactical use where an investor sells if the cap is running out or they want to reset the protection level,” said Lan Anh Tran, a manager research analyst for Morningstar who tracks the sector. “There are people buying in after the buffer periods have started. So, there is some opportunistic investment. But the more common use case is to use these as a hedge. And they make more sense as laddered products.” Because of the options strategies, investors in these ETFs do not receive dividends. “The conversation we often have is, ‘Are you willing to forego dividends and returns in excess of a certain percentage in exchange for downside protection?’” said Curtis Congdon, president of XML Financial Group in Bethesda, Md. “And for many clients who are approaching retirement or wanting to be more conservative, buffer ETFs give them a way to retain equity exposure while having less tail risk.” In addition, buffer ETFs carry higher fees than passive ETFs. Average expense ratios are in the 70 to 80 basis point range. “This category of buffers has not seen the fee compression that other categories of ETFs have,” said Mike Venuto, chief investment officer at Tidal, which advises asset managers on launching ETFs. “Our internal research says that it has an average expense ratio of 72 basis points. If you weigh by assets, it’s 65 basis points. That’s light years away from traditional ETFs. I can see why new issuers are drawn to them.” While recent volatility may have triggered some advisors to give the funds a fresh look, interest has been steadily building over time. In fact, in the year-to-date through the end of April, $5.6 billion flowed into the category, according to data from Morningstar Direct. During the first quarter, “we got about $368 million in inflows,” said Matt Kaufman, senior vice president and head of ETFs at Calamos Investments, which has a variety of defined outcome products, some offering 100% downside protection on the major stock indices as well as Bitcoin. “We see people who are buying new. We also see people selling out of old series, capturing gains and moving into other series to reset their starting points. People are using these exactly as we anticipated and expect them to.” Not everyone is a fan. In March, asset manager AQR Capital Management analyzed 99 ETFs using Morningstar data and found that the ETFs performed worse than passive funds tracking market indices coupled with investments in three-month Treasuries. The researchers argued that there are better ways for investors to hedge risk. That triggered a pair of responses from Vest, the subadvisor that builds First Trust’s buffer products. Vest President Jeff Chang questioned the dataset that AQR chose, which included both buffer and non-buffer ETFs. Chang also pointed out that evaluating buffer ETFs on returns misses the point since the products are not intended to beat the market, but to provide protection. Morningstar’s Jeffrey Ptak joined the debate on his Substack, posted shortly after another article he wrote on Morningstar’s site. Ptak said buffer ETFs, by and large, had delivered on their promises and found “the average dollar invested in buffer ETFs has exceeded the ETFs’ total returns, meaning investors have been able to achieve the potential outcomes advertised.” The buffer funds have weathered the initial COVID-19 market disruptions in 2020 and the wave of supply chain disruption and inflation that hammered 60/40 portfolios in 2022. “They did what they were supposed to do,” Innovator’s Day said. “Sometimes we are asked if these have been tested. In 2020, the VIX was at 70, and they did what they were supposed to do.” However, Jack Zhang, chief investment strategist, alternative investments, with Sequoia Financial, cautioned about how surrendering the upside, at the wrong time, is also a risk of the ETFs. “In the case of the COVID recovery, we essentially got many years of returns crammed into a short time period,” Zhang said. With a capped upside, investors can miss out on those kinds of substantial gains. “In times of crisis, they can provide benefits, but perhaps not as much as other asset classes. Over cycles, being diversified in stocks, bonds and alternatives gives you more of an all-weather approach. I think over the long-term horizon, that just works better than buffer ETFs.” “Our team moved a considerable portion of our client’s domestic and international equity exposure—almost 40%—into these products in February and late March,” said Phillip Knight, a managing director and partner with Americana Partners, a Houston-based wealth management firm with over $8.5 billion in assets under management. “We’re beyond glad that we made this move, but we’ve also found that using these types of tools in a portfolio model adds an element of optionality, and to maximize benefits for our clients, you need to closely monitor the P&Ls of each position.” “We tend to recommend them as a complement to a traditional stock and bond portfolio,” said Gary Quinzel, vice president, portfolio consulting with Minneapolis-based Wealth Enhancement, an RIA with about $100 billion in client assets. “Our dynamically-hedged equity building block portfolio aims to provide exposure to U.S. equities with less beta risk relative to the overall market. Investors can expect a smoother experience.” Wealth Enhancement uses a variety of buffer ETFs diversified by buffer ranges and time periods. Depending on the client, it recommends allocating 10% to 25% of portfolios to the products. “We like to combine the different strategies so we’re hedged against time periods as well as potential downfalls. The end result, if done optimally, is that it can lower beta in a portfolio by 30% to 50%.” Brent Coggins, chief investment officer with Triad Wealth Partners, a Lawrence, Kan.-based RIA with $460 million in AUM, outlined a similar philosophy. “If you look at our investment platform, you will see a bit of everything,” Coggins said. “We have strategies that use the full principal protection outcomes, all the way up to more aggressive, high-single digit protection levels that may have a levered upside. It’s very much case-by-case and all anchored back to identifying the strategy that’s going to maximize the success for the client’s financial plan.” They can be particularly good fits for clients who are more concerned about principal protection than about increasing their wealth—such as investors in or near retirement. “There’s a massive chunk of wealth transitioning from the accumulation phase to the decumulation phase. For them, it’s no longer about, ‘Did I beat the S&P or did I miss it by a couple hundred basis points.’ It’s about, ‘Am I harnessing growth potential,” said Mike Loukas, principal and CEO of TrueMark Investments, which operates a suite of active ETFs, including buffers, under the TrueShares banner. “Investors, to a large degree, are far more comfortable with that tradeoff and the world of hedging than they used to be.” Loukas still sees the benefit of uncapped funds. “There are moments where I’m OK in a normal market, trailing the S&P by a little bit, but in these massive up markets, you can’t afford to trail by 2000 basis points,” Loukas said. “Something that is uncapped has the ability to track the S&P up the ladder without being capped out. It comes down to what individual investors or modelers are looking for, and matching expectations and intents with the right defined outcome for the needs of the portfolio.” While it is always important to see what makes any fund perform the way it does, that’s particularly true with buffers. “The largest education hurdle we’ve had with advisors is that some of these products own underlying large cap stocks. And while those held up awesome at the end of the year, in the recent slide the Mag 7 got hit hard,” said Dynasty’s Nerney. “The index wasn’t down as much as those names, so how were these products lower than the S&P? It was because you’re long large cap tech.” Still, Nerney said the ETFs do have a role to play. “I hope our teams that were using them continue their allocations even though the payoff prolife wasn’t as exciting as it typically is,” Nerney said. “You need to remain systematic in your allocation in any product set you use. [When] portfolios are shedding 5% to 6% a day, there’s nothing like actual protection.” Generally, advisors using buffer ETFs are allocating anywhere from 10% to 25% of a client’s assets to the funds. Buffer ETFs are more common in the RIA space, as broker/dealers more often restrict the investments allowed on the platform, and some have limited the use of buffer ETFs because of the underlying options. “One of the things that still surprises me is that some home offices … say that sounds risky. So, they limit how much an advisor can use them,” Day said. “It’s backwards. If you are an aggressive investor, you can allocate more to these buffers, but if you’re conservative, you can allocate less, which is counterintuitive.” One of the biggest benefits advisors see for the products is mitigating investor behavior, such as panic selling, when markets fall. “Most folks, just by human nature, don’t want to lose money,” Kane said. “So, when you come out and say, ‘We have an option to protect you,’ that’s absolutely great. It’s an easier sell than ‘I would like to put option overlay strategy over your portfolio’, which requires much more nuance to describe. Buffer ETFs are a great way to package it together.” Vest’s Chang also points to behavioral factors as a key selling point. “One of the biggest risks is not volatility. It’s staying invested,” he said. Studies show that investors experience losses 2.5 times more than they experience gains, which often leads them to sell and then miss out when markets turn. “The average equity investor underperforms by 3.5% every year. They would have doubled their returns if they had something that kept them invested.” That makes sense to clients concerned about the heightened volatility roiling markets. “This is when pricing can be extremely attractive,” Chang said. “We are always one tweet away from a 10% move up or down. That’s going to persist for a bit. ... When Henry Ford created the seat belt, less than 10% of consumers paid for that option. But if you’re going to be out there in a Lamborghini, you want to put a seat belt on.” David Bodamer Editorial Director, WealthManagement.com David Bodamer covers investments for WealthManagement.com, including hosting the Wealth Management Invest podcast.

Title: Should You Buy RKLB Stock At $33?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CHONGQING, CHINA - MAY 06: In this photo illustration, the logo of Rocket Lab USA, Inc. is displayed ... More on a smartphone screen, with the company's latest stock market chart in the background, reflecting investor sentiment and recent trading activity, on May 06, 2025, in Chongqing, China. (Photo illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images) Rocket Lab USA (NASDAQ:RKLB) has experienced a remarkable surge in its stock price, climbing approximately 600% over the past twelve months. This impressive growth is largely due to the success of its recent rocket launches and the securing of new contracts, including those for its new Neutron rocket. While the existing Electron rocket is designed to deploy small payloads, with a capacity of up to 300 kilograms, into space, Rocket Lab's second and more powerful vehicle, the Neutron, will significantly increase this capacity, capable of carrying up to 13,000 kilograms to low-Earth orbit. While these advancements are promising, Rocket Lab's stock appears expensive and unattractive at its current valuation, especially given its recent significant rally. We’ve reached this conclusion by analyzing RKLB stock's current valuation against its recent operating performance and its historical and present financial health. Our comprehensive analysis of Rocket Lab USA, assessing Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience, indicates that the company has only a moderate operating performance and financial condition. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, RKLB stock looks very expensive compared to the broader market. Rocket Lab USA's Revenues have grown considerably over recent years. Rocket Lab USA’s profit margins are considerably worse than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Rocket Lab USA's balance sheet looks very strong. RKLB stock has fared much worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. In summary, Rocket Lab USA's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: Rocket Lab shows impressive sales growth and a strong financial position. It's understandable for a company at this early stage to have negative margins and a high cash burn rate. Despite these positives, the stock appears to have priced in all the good news, currently trading at 35 times its trailing revenues. While the upcoming Neutron rocket launch and potential new orders could certainly drive the stock higher, the current valuation presents a high risk. Additionally, there’s the broader concern of a market downturn given the uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical climate. We’ve seen how sensitive the stock can be to such conditions, as evidenced by its over 80% drop during the 2022 inflation shock market correction. Now, we apply risk assessment framework while constructing Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Google has reportedly cut the budget of its smart TV team by 10%, according to a report from The Information, citing people familiar with the situation (via Android Police). The budget cuts are said to be linked with recent layoffs at the Google TV division, despite Google planning to revamp the smart TV platform with its Gemini AI later this year. Google TV is what powers the Google Chromecast with Google TV, the new Google TV streamer, and various smart TVs and media players made by third-party manufacturers. Back in September, Google announced that there are now over 270 million monthly active Google TV and Android TV devices on the market. However, it’s hard to see Google taking its smart TV platform as a priority despite aggressive competition from Amazon, Roku, and built-in software experiences from Samsung (Tizen) and LG (webOS).

"*" indicates required fields Δ Still, a Google representative shared the following statement with The Information. “We continue to invest in Google TV with new user experiences including the upcoming integration of Gemini. There are more than 270 million Android TV devices, and we remain committed to growing this ecosystem with an exciting road map ahead.” According to the report, the budget cuts affecting Google’s smart TV team come at a time when the company is focusing more on YouTube as its main entertainment platform. Earlier this year, YouTube CEO Neil Mohan boldly claimed that “YouTube is the new television,” with TV now being the primary device for YouTube viewing in the U.S. YouTube also brings Google a lot of revenue through advertising and premium subscriptions like YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, which has 8 million subscribers in the US. The Information reports that Google would like to take the platform into new directions to better compete with streaming platforms like Netflix. YouTube recently hired long-time Disney executive Justin Connolly as its global head of sports and media. The move quickly led Disney to file a breach-of-contract lawsuit against YouTube and Connolly. Laurent is a Senior News Editor at Thurrott.com.

June 24, 2025 08:18 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, June 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that it missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CHONGQING, CHINA - MAY 25: In this photo illustration, the logo of Costco Wholesale Corporation is ... More displayed on a smartphone screen, with the latest stock market chart of the company in the background, reflecting investor sentiment and recent trading activity, on May 25, 2025, in Chongqing, China. (Photo Illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images) Note: Costco FY’24 concluded on September 1, 2024. Costco’s (NASDAQ: COST) shares have experienced significant growth, increasing by 40% in 2024 (calendar year) and tacking on another 7% so far in 2025, easily surpassing the S&P 500’s 2% increase. What’s fueling this momentum? Robust performance supported by its membership model. In fiscal Q3 2025 (which ended on May 11), Costco generated $63.2 billion in revenue and $2.5 billion in operating profit. Of that amount, $1.2 billion was derived from membership fees alone—accounting for nearly half of the operating profit, and primarily recurring. With inflation putting pressure on household budgets, Costco’s value-oriented model is resonating well with consumers. In May 2025, sales experienced a year-over-year increase of 7%—more than twice the 3% growth across the broader U.S. retail industry. At first glance, it seems like a retail paradise. However, here’s the drawback: Costco is trading at 55 times earnings and 59 times free cash flow, resulting in a meager 1.7% cash flow yield. For perspective, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), which enjoys faster top-line growth and exposure to high-margin sectors like cloud and advertising, trades at a lower multiple. While Costco may claim scale, strategic position, and market affection, it comes at a hefty cost. Refer to Buy or Sell Costco Stock? Costco’s valuation assumes perfection, and even a minor deceleration could lead to turbulence. To put it in perspective, this stock is not immune to volatility. Shares plummeted nearly 49% during the 2008 financial crisis, 20% during the Covid-19 crisis in early 2020, and 32% during the inflation-driven pullback of 2022. Investors should remain aware of that history, even as the current fundamentals appear strong. Costco’s high valuation is based on its consistently strong performance. In fiscal Q3 2025, the company achieved earnings per share of $4.28, reflecting a 13% year-over-year increase, on $63.21 billion in revenue, an 8% rise. Comparable-store sales increased by 8% year-over-year, while e-commerce grew by nearly 15%, excluding fuel and currency impacts. Membership renewal rates remained exceptional, at 92.7% in the U.S. and Canada, and 90.2% globally, with total household memberships rising by 6.6%. In the latest quarter, Costco’s U.S. same-store sales surpassed Walmart’s (NYSE: WMT) 4.5% and significantly outperformed Target’s (NYSE: TGT) 3.8% decline, highlighting the warehouse model’s attractiveness to value-oriented shoppers. The company’s high-margin, recurring membership revenue has shown remarkable resilience during economic hardships, contributing to the stock’s recent surge. Operating 905 warehouses worldwide, including 624 in the U.S., Costco leverages its pricing advantage through extremely thin margins and the efficacy of its private-label brand, Kirkland Signature. In Q3, shopping frequency increased by 5.2%, while the average transaction size only rose by 0.4%, showing that foot traffic—not price inflation—is driving the growth. Costco’s adaptable supply chain has allowed it to manage increasing tariffs by redirecting shipments and altering sourcing strategies. With two-thirds of its merchandise sourced domestically and merely 8% of U.S. sales connected to China, its exposure to trade risks is limited. The company is also localizing Kirkland production and experiencing steady demand for essentials such as groceries and fuel. Its scale enhances pricing power, which is vital for maintaining its premium valuation. Costco continues to be a premier operator, but its high valuation seems detached from its fundamentals. Revenue growth is solid, yet not explosive, lingering in the low teens. Store expansion has slowed—less than 3% for this fiscal year—and some new locations may eat into existing sales, indicating a maturing presence. The current premium assumes that elevated growth will persist. If comparable sales trend towards mid-single digits, investor confidence—and Costco’s valuation multiple—could come under pressure. Investing in a single stock carries inherent risks. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which consists of 30 stocks, has a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last four-year period. Why is that? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index, resulting in less volatile performance as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Comparable-store sales increased by 8% year-over-year, while e-commerce grew by nearly 15%, excluding fuel and currency impacts. Membership renewal rates remained exceptional, at 92.7% in the U.S. and Canada, and 90.2% globally, with total household memberships rising by 6.6%. In the latest quarter, Costco’s U.S. same-store sales surpassed Walmart’s (NYSE: WMT) 4.5% and significantly outperformed Target’s (NYSE: TGT) 3.8% decline, highlighting the warehouse model’s attractiveness to value-oriented shoppers. The company’s high-margin, recurring membership revenue has shown remarkable resilience during economic hardships, contributing to the stock’s recent surge. Operating 905 warehouses worldwide, including 624 in the U.S., Costco leverages its pricing advantage through extremely thin margins and the efficacy of its private-label brand, Kirkland Signature. In Q3, shopping frequency increased by 5.2%, while the average transaction size only rose by 0.4%, showing that foot traffic—not price inflation—is driving the growth. Costco’s adaptable supply chain has allowed it to manage increasing tariffs by redirecting shipments and altering sourcing strategies. With two-thirds of its merchandise sourced domestically and merely 8% of U.S. sales connected to China, its exposure to trade risks is limited. The company is also localizing Kirkland production and experiencing steady demand for essentials such as groceries and fuel. Its scale enhances pricing power, which is vital for maintaining its premium valuation. Costco continues to be a premier operator, but its high valuation seems detached from its fundamentals. Revenue growth is solid, yet not explosive, lingering in the low teens. Store expansion has slowed—less than 3% for this fiscal year—and some new locations may eat into existing sales, indicating a maturing presence. The current premium assumes that elevated growth will persist. If comparable sales trend towards mid-single digits, investor confidence—and Costco’s valuation multiple—could come under pressure. Investing in a single stock carries inherent risks. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which consists of 30 stocks, has a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last four-year period. Why is that? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index, resulting in less volatile performance as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: HIMS Stock To $25?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CANADA - 2025/03/31: In this photo illustration, the Hims & Hers Health logo is seen displayed on a ... More smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Hims & Hers Health (NASDAQ: HIMS) experienced a devastating 35% stock crash on June 23, 2025, after Novo Nordisk abruptly terminated their brief partnership. The dramatic sell-off reflects not just the immediate loss of a key business relationship, but fundamental questions about the company’s long-term viability in the weight-loss drug market. If you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and clocked >91% returns since inception. On a separate note, see – Is Iran Bluffing While Readying An Attack? The collaboration between HIMS and Novo Nordisk, which began in April 2025, was supposed to be a game-changer for the telehealth company. The partnership promised direct access to Wegovy, Novo Nordisk’s blockbuster weight-loss drug, through HIMS's platform. This arrangement had fueled much of HIMS's remarkable 150% stock surge earlier this year, as investors bet on a clear pathway to sustained revenue growth. However, the partnership lasted barely two months. Novo Nordisk cited concerns over what it called "illegal mass compounding and deceptive marketing" by HIMS, specifically pointing to the company’s continued sales of personalized, compounded versions of semaglutide (Wegovy’s active ingredient) rather than focusing solely on the branded medication. The dispute highlights a fundamental tension in the weight-loss drug market. Following the FDA’s declaration that the semaglutide shortage had ended, compounding pharmacies technically lost their legal justification to produce copycat versions of the drug. Yet HIMS continued marketing personalized versions of the treatment, which Novo Nordisk viewed as undermining their branded product and potentially violating regulatory requirements. This strategic misstep by HIMS reveals a deeper problem: the company appeared to prioritize its existing compounded drug business over nurturing the partnership that investors had priced as its future growth engine. The decision to continue selling personalized versions while simultaneously partnering with Novo Nordisk created an untenable conflict of interest. The stock crash, while severe, may still not fully reflect HIMS’s diminished prospects. Even after the 35% decline, HIMS trades at approximately seven times trailing revenues— more than double its five-year historical average of three times revenues. This elevated multiple made sense when investors expected the Novo Nordisk partnership to drive explosive growth, but that rationale has now evaporated. If HIMS were to revert to its historical valuation multiple of three times revenues, the stock would fall to around $25 — representing another 40% decline from current levels. This suggests the selling may not be finished, particularly as investors reassess the company’s growth trajectory without its key partnership. HIMS can theoretically continue selling personalized obesity treatments, but this approach faces multiple headwinds. The regulatory environment remains uncertain, with the FDA potentially intervening if it determines that companies are abusing compounding loopholes rather than providing genuinely personalized medicine. The loss of Wegovy’s direct sales potential also eliminates what could have been a massive revenue stream from the company's existing member base. The question now becomes whether HIMS’s remaining business model can generate sufficient growth to justify any premium valuation. The company's personalized approach may serve a niche market, but it's unlikely to match the scale that direct Wegovy sales could have provided. The HIMS situation represents a classic case where investors should resist the urge to "buy the dip." While the stock’s 35% decline appears dramatic, the fundamental investment thesis has now been altered. The company has lost its clearest path to significant revenue growth and faces an elevated risk profile regarding regulatory compliance. For now, the prudent approach is to wait and observe how the situation develops. HIMS may find alternative pathways to growth, but without the Novo Nordisk partnership, those routes are far less certain and likely less lucrative. The market's brutal reaction to the partnership termination sends a clear message: when a company's primary growth catalyst disappears overnight, even a 35% decline may not be enough to restore attractive risk-adjusted returns. Now, regulatory risk is just a small part of the risk assessment framework we apply while constructing the 30-stock Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. 1.

Title: If you think your job is hard right now, try working in HR
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/why-hr-workers-miserable-2025-6
Time Published: 2025-06-24T08:35:03Z

Over the past 18 months, Evan Loveless has led seven rounds of layoffs, personally informing hundreds of his ad-agency colleagues that they were being let go. "It's a chronic feeling of sadness because it's so frequent for me," said Loveless, a senior human-resources partner in St. Louis. "It's like being stuck under a raincloud." Loveless recalled a particularly soul-crushing layoff conversation with a worker who thought he was reaching out with news about a promotion. "Sometimes the person's husband or wife also just lost their job," he said. "You see their faces and then their faces haunt you a little bit." Working in HR has never been glamorous, as the occupation often requires enforcing unpopular company rules and decisions. Now, HR professionals say the job is getting downright ugly. Unceasing layoffs, stricter return-to-office mandates, immigration raids in the workplace, and a sudden need to help everyone master AI are among the latest challenges upending their workloads. "It's a confluence of events that are occurring simultaneously, the likes of which and magnitude of which I never have observed in my more than 30 years of being a human-capital leader," Jim Link, chief human resources officer for the Society of Human Resource Management, told Business Insider. The new rigors come after another tumultuous period for HR workers. During the pandemic years, they suddenly had to develop and manage remote-work set-ups, grapple with anti-vaccine pushback, and deal with employee tensions and calls to action following the murder of George Floyd. Today, HR teams are juggling even more, said Tracy Brower, a Ph.d sociologist in Michigan who researches organizational behavior. "The demands on HR today are significant, increasing, and intense," said Brower. One of the new tasks HR is having to deal with is the impact of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in the workplace. Several times a week foreign workers now come to Alexandra Valverde, an HR director for a midsize food manufacturer in the Southeast, with concerns about getting swept up in raids by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. Some have tears in their eyes. "This is the hardest year I've had in HR," said Valverde, who's been working in the industry since 2019. "The fear I'm seeing from employees, even if their status is completely fine — that is something I hadn't experienced before." The steady drumbeat of layoffs is also particularly unsettling for HR workers at companies with staffers on H1-B visas, which allow foreigners to temporarily live and work in the U.S. if they meet certain criteria. "It's never easy to lay anybody off, but it's even harder when you're telling someone they're probably going to leave the country," said Mike Smart, an HR executive at a California tech company. Upon losing a job, H1-B workers typically have just 60 days to find another employer or face deportation. "Even in the best of job markets, 60 days isn't ample by any stretch," said Smart. As of May, employers have announced 696,309 job cuts this year, an 80% increase compared with the same period last year, according to a new report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Making matters worse, the cuts are coming at a time when company chiefs are warning of even more layoffs coming down the line due to the rise of generative AI and AI agents. Last week Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the company's extensive use of the technology is expected to reduce its total corporate workforce, which totaled approximately 1.5 million last year. CEOs of other companies, including chatbot maker Anthropic, freelance-job site Fiverr, and payments provider Klarna, have recently issued similar declarations. HR workers are used to taking heat for implementing policies that don't sit well with workers. But lately they say it's gotten a lot harder to keep their cool. In the second quarter, employees at organizations that experienced layoffs in the past year committed 67% more acts of so-called workplace incivility on average than those at firms without such cuts, according to new SHRM data. Those acts, which the trade group says includes silencing and excessively monitoring colleagues, were also 63% higher among workers at organizations with return-to-office mandates than at those without. David Gaspin, the head of HR for a commercial real-estate company in New York, said that at his previous employer he was hit with "some serious vitriol" from a colleague he thought he had a good relationship with after having to lay this person off last year. The tongue-lashing included comments such as "you're just a corporate tool" and "you're a horrible human being." "That's never easy to hear," said Gaspin. Given the more taxing landscape, it's perhaps no wonder that fewer people are looking for work in HR. Searches for HR jobs on Indeed.com in the first half of this year were down nearly 5% from the first half of 2024, and they've been declining annually since 2021, Indeed data show. Separately, a 2022 study from LinkedIn found HR had the highest turnover rate of any job function. (The job site hasn't updated the report since then.) Rebecca Taylor, a former HR professional in New Jersey who co-hosts a podcast called HR Confessions, said one reason she left the field is that she was tired of always being the office grinch. The final straw came after a worker she was tasked with laying off looked up her parents' landline and called them repeatedly to chastise her. "It was scary," said Taylor, who uses a pseudonym partly because of that incident. If a disgruntled employee is angry enough, she added, what else will they try to find? Jump to

Title: Implementing CQRS and Event Sourcing with Axon Framework in Spring

Modern enterprise applications often require complex consistency, scalability, and traceability features. This is where CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) and Event Sourcing shine. Together, they allow systems to scale efficiently while preserving a full audit trail of all state changes. In this article, you’ll learn how to implement CQRS and Event Sourcing using the Axon Framework in Spring Boot. We’ll cover: CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) is a design pattern that separates the write model (commands) from the read model (queries). This decoupling allows each side to scale and evolve independently. Instead of storing the current state in a database, Event Sourcing stores all changes to the state as a sequence of events. For example, instead of storing: You would store: The current state is rebuilt by replaying these events. The Axon Framework simplifies the implementation of CQRS and Event Sourcing in Java. It provides: Let’s walk through a sample implementation of an Order Management System using Axon. Replaying hundreds or thousands of events to restore state can slow down system performance. Snapshotting solves this by saving the state of an aggregate after a certain number of events, so only a few need to be replayed. Axon Framework makes it surprisingly manageable to implement CQRS and Event Sourcing in Spring Boot. With proper use of aggregates, projections, and snapshotting, you get a scalable, event-driven architecture that’s built for the long haul. Whether you’re building systems that need audit logs, complex workflows, or massive scalability, Axon gives you the building blocks to make it happen cleanly and reliably. We will contact you soon.

Title: A Postcard from Cannes Lions: Power Struggles, Winners, and AI

This year’s Cannes Lions, the ad industry’s biggest festival, unfolded against a backdrop of upheaval and anxiety. The industry is at a critical moment—facing “an existential crisis,” as S4 Capital founder Martin Sorrell told ADWEEK’s editors—but little of that fear was present on stage. While celebrities like Reese Witherspoon and Patrick Schwarzenegger took center stage, and teams posed with gold trophies on the red carpet, executives on the ground spoke with ADWEEK about issues such as AI, agency consolidation, and layoffs. The event was also marked by an aggressive land grab, both for literal pieces of the Croisette and for marketing budgets. Certain power struggles were visible throughout the festival: Adobe versus up-and-comer Canva, both of which upped their budgets for activations this year. Amazon versus… everyone else. And Michael Kassan’s 3CV versus his former company, MediaLink. Even in the creative awards, rivalries–such as that between holding companies Publicis Groupe and WPP–were on display. Publicis Conseil, a jewel in the crown of the former holdco, won both Agency of the Year and the Titanium Grand Prix, while WPP was named Creative Company of the Year. In the latest episode of Adspeak, the ADWEEK editorial team reports from the sandy beaches and hot pavements of Cannes about who came out on top at the festival, what’s behind the parties and beachfront activations, and what Cannes says about where the industry is headed.

Title: An elegant and hefty cheeseburger bento awaits at the “Japanese Costco” Lopia

Bringing you yesterday's news from Japan and Asia, today. RocketNews24 Japanese It’s so classy, you’ll want to eat it with a knife and fork. There’s a supermarket in Japan nicknamed the “Japanese Costco” because much like its namesake, it sells very large quantities of food at bulk-discount prices. Its real name is Lopia, and our writer Ikuna Kamezawa often enjoys going there even though many of the things for sale are way too big for her to ever eat on her own. But this time, a certain cheeseburger bento caught her eye. It was large, but not too large, and only cost 1,078 yen (US$7.40), so she decided to take the meaty plunge. It was so big that she could barely fit it into her shopping bag and things only got worse as it started to rain while she walked home. She had to carry it very carefully too, for reasons we’ll see in a moment. After getting home, she unveiled her Manpuku Burger Double Cheese and confirmed its size at about 25 centimeters (10 inches) in length. Popping the lid off we can see that the very fancy arrangement was why Ikuna had to carry it so carefully, and the sheer volume of it all was the reason it was priced a little more than a Big Mac combo. She felt kind of bad disturbing the elegant layout of her bento, but she had to take stock of what was inside before eating it. There was a double cheeseburger with two patties and two slices of cheese, some seasoned fries, and two breaded chicken filets. That photo might not do the size justice so she took some shots alongside a pack of matches for scale. Sure, a matchbox might not be the most universally understood comparison, but she was just so excited to eat this thing. ▼ Fries ▼ Chicken Filets ▼ Double Cheese Burger Ikuna turned her attention back to the cheeseburger and tried to reassemble it in a normal way. That’s when she noticed something was off with the proportions of the bun and patties. She thought this must be some chic designer cheeseburger arrangement she’d never seen before. That might give the illusion Lopia is being chintzy with the meat, but rest assured they were good-sized beef patties. For a more understandable comparison, Ikuna placed a Yamazaki Bakery convenience store cheeseburger next to it. This store-bought burger selling for about 99 yen is slightly smaller than a McDonald’s cheeseburger and the Lopia burger blows it out of the water. ▼ Lopia’s burger ▼ Yamazaki’s burger There were definitely some structural integrity issues with it though, so our writer opted to eat the whole thing with a knife and fork. A fancy burger like this deserves fancy eating utensils anyway. The hamburger patty wasn’t juicy at all, but it was very dense and meaty. This texture might turn some burger aficionados off, but she felt kids would really go for it. There was also a sweet ketchup on it, but really the flavor of the beef stood out so much that she barely even remembers eating the cheese and bun. While it might not be for everyone, the taste of this burger bento was right up Ikuna’s alley. Her only complaint — if you could call it that — was that it was too much for her to eat in one sitting. But for the price she paid, that’s the kind of problem you’d want to have. In conclusion, she definitely recommends the Manpuku Burger Double Cheese for big eaters. Lopia can be a little random with their offerings, especially in the bento section, but Fridays are known as “Fry Days” there which is when they usually go all out in that department so your best chance is to find it then.

Title: Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. Reminds Investors That Class Action Lawsuits Have Been Filed Against Compass Diversified, Digimarc, Elevance, and West Pharmaceutical and Encourages Investors to Contact the Firm

June 23, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, June 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Compass Diversified (NYSE:CODI), Digimarc Corporation (NASDAQ:DMRC), Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV), and West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. (NYSE:WST). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Compass Diversified (NYSE:CODI) Class Period: May 1, 2024 - May 7, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 8, 2025 According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) the Company's subsidiary, Lugano Holdings, Inc., maintained unrecorded financing arrangements and irregularities in its sales, cost of sales, inventory, and accounts receivable; (2) the irregularities and undisclosed details in Lugano Holdings, Inc.'s financial statements rendered the financial statements of the Company as a whole unreliable, and would require restatement; (3) the Company failed to maintain adequate internal controls related to its financial statements; and (4) as a result, defendants' public statements were materially false and/or misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. For more information on the Compass Diversified class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/CODI Digimarc Corporation (NASDAQ:DMRC) Class Period: May 3, 2024 - February 26, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 7, 2025 According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. A large commercial partner of Digimarc would not renew its contract on the same terms. As a result, the Company would renegotiate the large commercial contract. Based on this renegotiation, the Company’s subscription revenue and annual recurring revenue would be adversely affected. Based on these facts, the Company’s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period. When the market learned the truth about Digimarc, investors suffered damages. For more information on the Digimarc class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/DMRC Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV) Class Period: April 18, 2024, and October 16, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 11, 2025 According to the lawsuit, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that, with the Medicaid redetermination process nearly complete, defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the risk and cost profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid programs. While defendants acknowledged that Medicaid expenses were rising, they repeatedly assured investors that this was adequately reflected in Elevance’s guidance for the year. These representations were materially false or misleading. In truth, the redeterminations were causing the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members to rise significantly, as the members being removed from Medicaid programs were, on average, healthier than those who remained eligible for the programs. This shift was occurring to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations with the states or in its financial guidance for 2024. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. For more information on the Elevance class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ELV West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. (NYSE:WST) Class Period: February 16, 2023, - February 12, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 7, 2025 The West Pharmaceutical class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) despite claiming strong visibility into customer demand and attributing headwinds to temporary COVID-related product destocking, West Pharmaceutical was in fact experiencing significant and ongoing destocking across its high-margin High-Value Products portfolio; (ii) West Pharmaceutical’s SmartDose device, which was purportedly positioned as a high-margin growth product, was highly dilutive to West Pharmaceutical’s profit margins due to operational inefficiencies; and (iii) these margin pressures created the risk of costly restructuring activities, including West Pharmaceutical’s exit from continuous glucose monitoring (“CGM”) contracts with long-standing customers. The West Pharmaceutical class action lawsuit further alleges that on February 13, 2025, West Pharmaceutical issued its 2025 revenue forecast in the range of $2.88 billion to $2.91 billion, significantly below expectations. According to the complaint, West Pharmaceutical attributed the disappointing guidance in part to Contract Manufacturing headwinds, including the loss of two major CGM customers that had begun transitioning to in-house manufacturing of next-generation devices because West Pharmaceutical “made the decision to not participate going forward as our financial thresholds cannot be achieved.” The West Pharmaceutical class action lawsuit further alleges that West Pharmaceutical also revealed that its SmartDose wearable injector will become margin dilutive in 2025 due to lower pricing. On this news, the price of West Pharmaceutical’s stock fell more than 38%.
