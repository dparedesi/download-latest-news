Spot Bitcoin ETFs have attracted mountains of cash, and have enabled investors to gain exposure to BTC without the hassle of managing private keys. They have also lent legitimacy to the asset on Wall Street. Meanwhile, spot Ethereum ETFs validated the asset’s regulatory status. And despite a subdued debut, they have gained momentum in recent weeks and potentially opened the door to similar products for Solana and XRP in the U.S. When Bitcoin ETFs began trading in January, the price of BTC clocked in at $46,000. Nearly a year later, the asset’s price has more than doubled. It even breached $108,000 in December, following momentum sparked by Donald Trump’s White House victory. As a group, eleven spot Bitcoin ETFs now hold $113 billion in assets under management, or AUM, according to CoinGlass. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas had told Decrypt in early December that the number of Bitcoin held by these products could overtake the estimated 1.1 million Bitcoin mined by Bitcoin’s enigmatic creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, by Christmas. Turns out, the symbolic milestone was shattered just two days later. “It’d be a fitting cap on a storybook launch,” Balchunas said at the time. “This stuff is an anomaly in physics. There has never been a launch like this, and there will never be another one.” When it comes to spot Bitcoin ETFs, the products brought “excitement, anticipation, opportunity, [and] legitimacy” to the asset, Balchunas added. Removing any friction associated with getting exposure to Bitcoin, he said the power of matching investors with brands they know and trust in brokerage accounts could not be overstated. It's a marked departure from the common refrain of “Not your keys, not your coins,” following the collapse of FTX in 2022—that is, the believe from many crypto die-hards that self-custody is the only reasonable way to own crypto. By 2024, the value proposition of Bitcoin exposure without key management was too good for some investors to pass up. Nathan Geraci, president of investment advisor The ETF Store, told Decrypt that he was always highly bullish on the prospects of Bitcoin ETFs. At the start of the year he predicted that the group would “obliterate every ETF launch record out there” before they began trending. However, he added, “net inflows into these products has exceeded even my extremely optimistic expectations.” With more than $53.5 billion in AUM, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) emerged as an industry leader this year. Towering over Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the second-largest spot Bitcoin ETF by AUM at $20 billion, IBIT’s profile was boosted by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who highlighted Bitcoin as an investment multiple times this year. Once a Bitcoin skeptic, the CEO of the world’s largest asset manager described Bitcoin in January as “potential long-term store of value” against governments devaluing their currency. Months later, Fink called himself a “major believer” in Bitcoin, framing the asset as an investment for those with an increasingly frightened view toward the world. As far as stores of value are concerned, Bitcoin advocates often compare Bitcoin to “digital gold.” Within BlackRock’s suite of products, that link crystallized in November, when IBIT’s AUM surpassed that of BlackRock’s iShares Gold ETF (IAU)—first offered in 2005. As of this writing, it ranked 32nd among all U.S. ETFs by AUM, according to the ETF Database. While analysts noted to Decrypt that BlackRock’s push into the crypto space eroded industry stigma in 2023, Geraci said the stellar performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs was anything but a given. “Back in January, I’m not sure anyone envisioned the spot Bitcoin ETF category eclipsing $100 billion in assets before year-end,” he said. “As a matter of fact, there were plenty of naysayers who thought the category would never hit that mark.” Spot Bitcoin ETFs garnered massive amounts of inflows this year, but they also improved Bitcoin’s market structure, according to research from analytics firm Kaiko. In June, Kaiko observed that the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs had increased trading volumes for Bitcoin on crypto exchanges, while strengthening the market’s ability to absorb large orders. At the same time, Kaiko analysts noted that Bitcoin’s trading activity became concentrated around weekdays, when Wall Street is open for business. After branding himself a “crypto president” on the campaign trail, Trump’s reelection sparked a record-setting rally in Bitcoin’s price. When it came to BlackRock’s Bitcoin product, IBIT served as a connective tissue that enabled investors to trade Bitcoin in an unprecedented way. As Bitcoin jumped past $75,000 on November 6—the day after Trump’s reelection—IBIT’s trading volume crossed $1 billion in 20 minutes. By the end of the day, IBIT’s trading volume had swelled to $4.1 billion. "For context, that's more volume than stocks like Berkshire, Netflix, or Visa saw today," Balchunas wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter). In an interview, Balchunas noted that spot Bitcoin ETFs smashed record after record this year, from trading volume stats to an initial pace of inflows. Of note, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF reached $10 billion in AUM faster than any ETF ever launched in history. It was also the first ETF to hit $50 billion in AUM—more than five times faster than any other ETF in history. When the SEC approved the listing and trading of options for spot Bitcoin ETFs in October, analysts told Decrypt the development would make it easier, cheaper, and safer for institutional players to gain Bitcoin exposure. “I mostly consider this another brick in the wall of normalization,” Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan told Decrypt. “We should be happy about it.” It would be impossible to capture the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs without mentioning Grayscale. It was once the largest asset manager in the crypto space, and its legal victory against the SEC last year paved the way for the products’ eventual approval. The SEC dragged its feet on approving applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs for a decade, citing concerns about market manipulation. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit found last August that the SEC’s repeated denial of Grayscale’s ETF gambit was unlawful. While billions of dollars flowed out of GBTC this year—$21 billion, as of this writing—Grayscale’s then-CEO Michael Sonnenshein said the outflows were anticipated. In April, he pointed to the bankruptcy estates of collapsed crypto firms, which were “forced” to liquidate GBTC holdings, among traders capitalizing on GBTC’s once-sizable discount due to its former structure. Analysts also attributed GTBC outflows to the product’s expense ratio as well, which stands at 1.5%. Making the product more costly to hold than GBTC’s competitors, with expense ratios as low as 0.19%, Grayscale responded with a GBTC spinoff ETF featuring a 0.15% expense ratio. A similar dynamic befell the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which saw over $1 billion in outflows during its first three trading days as a full-fledged ETF, according to CoinGlass. While the bleeding has largely stopped, and Grayscale has launched a spinoff ETF for ETHE too, the outflows dampened investor enthusiasm when spot Ethereum ETFs launched this summer. Because SEC Chair Gary Gensler had sidestepped questions about Ethereum’s regulatory status, many doubted that applications for spot Ethereum ETFs would be approved under his leadership. In a stunning development, however, the SEC flashed a green light for the products in May. A lawsuit filed by the Ethereum software company Consensys had also alleged that the SEC internally viewed ETH as a security. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in Decrypt.) The distinction would’ve forced ETF hopefuls to pursue a different avenue, but the SEC effectively validated Ethereum’s status as a commodity with its move. Still, spot Ethereum ETFs have seen far lower inflows than spot Bitcoin ETFs have. Weighed down by $3.6 billion in ETHE outflows, the group of products from eight issuers have attracted $2.3 billion worth of inflows since their July debut, as of this writing, according to CoinGlass. Meanwhile, the ETFs haven’t been a salve to Ethereum’s price the way similar products were for BTC. After peaking around $4,100 earlier in December, the cryptocurrency currently trades hands around $3,400. And unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum hasn't broken its all-time high mark in 2024, nor has it come close to doing so. It makes sense that investors haven’t flocked to spot Ethereum ETFs en masse, given that Ethereum’s story is relatively unknown compared to Bitcoin’s within the minds of mainstream investors, FlaconX Head of Research David Lawant told Decrypt. Bitcoin’s narrative as a store of value has been well established, Lawant said. But regardless of whether Ethereum is conveyed as a tech play, smart contract platform, or an app store for Web3 applications, the narrative surrounding Ethereum isn’t as established outside crypto circles. “Ethereum is a different beast” compared to Bitcoin, Lawant said. “There's different ways you can spin it, but regardless of how you tell the story, it is a different story.” At present, Bitcoin and Ethereum are the only digital assets with spot ETFs in the United States. Yet, alongside hopes of a crypto-friendly SEC during Trump’s administration, asset managers have filed for ETFs covering Solana, XRP, and Litecoin, among a growing list of other digital assets. Even Dogecoin ETFs don't seem so far-fetched in this climate, analysts told Decrypt. Whether or not applications for those cryptocurrencies are approved may be a question for Gensler’s slated successor, Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner and Trump's nominee for the role. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs will be trading, following up their first year with a high bar to shoot for.

Bloomberg data shows that these changes aim to keep the index in balance. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with META. Among those earning higher weight were Apple (AAPL, Financials), Nvidia (NVDA, Financials), Microsoft (MSFT, Financials), and Alphabet (GOOG, Financials; GOOGL, Financials). The rebalancing follows a rule limiting the total weight of the top five components to around 40%. Projected at 515,000 units with year-over-year rise, Tesla is likely to set a new quarterly record for vehicle deliveries in the fourth quarter. Third week of December saw 17,600 weekly insurance registrations for Tesla; its weekly insurance registrations in China showed a 12% rise over previous quarter and a 13% year-on-year increase. Although it declined consecutively from last week, Tesla's quarterly performance in the Chinese market is probably going to be outstanding. A tire pressure monitoring system issue that might lead to an accident by not sufficiently notifying drivers of low tire pressures has caused Tesla to issue a recall for over 700,000 automobiles.

Tesla will provide a free over-the-air software update to address the problem. Although some recent dips, Tesla's stock has seen noteworthy rise and now ranks among the $1 trillion market capital value. Shares for this month are up 35%; for this year they are 87%. Broadcom officially joined the $1 trillion club driven by a demand for its chips running artificial intelligence. Its AI-generated fiscal 2024 revenue doubled year-over-year to $12.2 billion, therefore fueling total sales of $51 billion more. Forecasts of a 40% rise in fiscal 2025 and rising market share inspire experts about Broadcom's potential AI income growth. Claiming violation of its patents on "virtual machines," Netflix has sued Broadcom's subsidiary VMware. This legal action feeds ongoing disputes between Netflix and Broadcom that include claims of Netflix breaching Broadcom's video streaming technology patents since 2018. Broadcom's stock has exploded over 100% as demand from artificial intelligence customers takes hold. AI revenue surged 280% to $3.1 billion only in the last quarter.

Title: Stock market today: Dow ekes out gains, bitcoin slumps as 'Santa Claus' rally takes a pause

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks struggled to meaningfully extend a "Santa Claus" rally the day after Christmas while Wall Street digested one of the only significant economic data points of the week. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell below the flatline while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) fell slightly. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) closed the session up 28 points after flipping between positive and negative territory throughout the light trading session. Small cap stocks inched higher, sending the Russell 2000 (^RUT) up 0.9%. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) fell to hover near the $96,000 level as volatile trading continued. Crypto-linked stocks like MicroStrategy (MSTR) tracked the declines. Markets kicked off the "Santa Claus" rally on Tuesday as the S&P 500 notched its best Christmas Eve performance since 1974, according to Bespoke. The broader index and Nasdaq Composite moved to within striking distance of their records after clawing back gains from a Fed-fueled dive last week. As Wall Street saunters back from its holiday break, the normally routine release of weekly jobless claims took more of a spotlight than usual as the only piece of the jobs puzzle on the docket this week. According to the latest Labor Department data, weekly jobless claims fell to 219,000 compared with expectations of 223,000. However continuing claims pointed to a cooling labor market, jumping by 46,000 in the week ending Dec. 14 to 1.91 million, the highest level since November 2021. Stocks closed mixed amid a light trading session on Thursday following the Christmas holiday break. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) closed just below the flat line. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose about 28 points, or nearly 0.1%. Stocks were little changed throughout the session, with the major averages flipping between positive and negative territory as the market struggled to meaningfully extend its Santa Claus rally. Small cap stocks however rose as the Russell 2000 (^RUT) gained more than 0.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up nearly 15% year-to-date, but Boeing (BA) and Nike (NKE) have been the big laggards of 2024. As Bespoke Investment Group pointed out, with the exception of Intel (which was booted off the blue-chip index in place of AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) in November), industrial giant Boeing is the biggest laggard, down 30% since the start of the year after a slew of production and safety challenges. Sports apparel com[any Nike is also down about 29% since the start of the year. Tesla (TSLA) extended declines to 2% on Thursday afternoon, making it difficult for the Nasdaq (^IXIC) and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to firmly trade in positive territory. Still, shares of the EV maker are up more than 80% year to-date. The majority of those stock gains were achieved following Donald Trump's presidential victory in November, which Tesla CEO Elon Musk was instrumental in supporting. Trading volume for Tesla stock on Thursday was about 30% less than average daily volume, according to Yahoo Finance chart data. Bitcoin was trading 3% lower on Thursday afternoon as prices hovered below the $96,000 level. The token is down about 10% from its all-time highs north of $108,000 reached over a week ago. Despite the recent dip, bitcoin is up nearly 120% year to date, far outperforming other asset classes like gold and the major stock market averages. As Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports, 2024 has been a year when everything changed for the cryptocurrency once viewed as a fringe sideshow, a concern for D.C. policymakers, and a subject of ridicule for top Wall Street figures. Crypto's widespread acceptance this year translated into major gains for investors who were along for the ride. Stocks wavered by 1 p.m. ET, with the major averages flipping between positive and negative territory. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) hugged the flat line while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was also little changed. Shares of EV giant Tesla (TSLA) and social media company Meta (META) both fell, weighing on the Communication Services and Consumer Discretionary sectors. Meanwhile, chip stock Broadcom (AVGO) rose for a fourth straight day. GameStop (GME) stock rose as much as 10% early Thursday before paring gains. Shares were up roughly 6% midday. The stock's gain comes after infamous meme stock trader "Roaring Kitty" — whose real name is Keith Gill — posted a mysterious photo of a wrapped present on Dec. 25. GME's climb Thursday puts the stock on track to notch a roughly 16% gain over the past five days. The stock is up over 88% in 2024, fueled by Roaring Kitty's return to social media after three years of silence. Still, GameStop shares remain well below all-time highs of over $80 during the stock's short squeeze in 2021. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) erased early session losses by 11:30 a.m. ET. Shares of Honeywell (HON) and Boeing (BA) rose more than 1%, helping lift the blue-chip index slightly above the flatline. Apple (AAPL) touched intraday highs after a price target raise to a Street high of $325 from Wedbush analysts Dan Ives. AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) pared early morning losses to trade just below the flatline. Apple (AAPL) stock hit an all-time intraday high Thursday after a nod of confidence in its continued upswing from Wall Street. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives raised his price target on Apple shares to a new Street high of $325, anticipating “a golden era of growth” for the Tim Cook-helmed tech giant in 2025. Apple stock touched $260 early Thursday before modestly paring gains. The stock was still on track to notch another record close after hitting a high of $258.20 on Christmas Eve.

US stocks struggled to meaningfully extend a "Santa Claus" rally the day after Christmas while Wall Street digested one of the only significant economic data points of the week. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell below the flatline while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) fell slightly. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) closed the session up 28 points after flipping between positive and negative territory throughout the light trading session. Small cap stocks inched higher, sending the Russell 2000 (^RUT) up 0.9%. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) fell to hover near the $96,000 level as volatile trading continued. Crypto-linked stocks like MicroStrategy (MSTR) tracked the declines. Markets kicked off the "Santa Claus" rally on Tuesday as the S&P 500 notched its best Christmas Eve performance since 1974, according to Bespoke. The broader index and Nasdaq Composite moved to within striking distance of their records after clawing back gains from a Fed-fueled dive last week. As Wall Street saunters back from its holiday break, the normally routine release of weekly jobless claims took more of a spotlight than usual as the only piece of the jobs puzzle on the docket this week.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on YETI Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:YETI) on Substack by Rene. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on YETI. YETI Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:YETI)'s share was trading at $39.31 as of Dec 24th. YETI’s trailing and forward P/E were 17.02 and 13.51 respectively according to Yahoo Finance. A family enjoying a camping trip, with the company's coolers, cargo bags, and other outdoor lifestyle products in the frame. Yeti, a premium lifestyle brand known for its high-quality outdoor and leisure products, has built a strong market presence through a combination of functionality, durability, and aspirational appeal. Founded in 2006 by Roy and Ryan Seiders, Yeti initially focused on high-performance coolers but has since diversified into a variety of products including drinkware, backpacks, and barware. Despite its premium prices, Yeti’s products resonate deeply with a loyal customer base, particularly those from middle- to upper-middle-class demographics who value quality and reliability. Yeti’s customers often view purchases as long-term investments, reinforcing brand loyalty and repeat business. The company’s direct-to-consumer (DTC) model has played a critical role in driving growth, accounting for over half of total revenue. By selling through its own website and retail stores, Yeti maintains control over its brand image while enjoying higher margins than traditional wholesale channels. In addition to its core products, Yeti has expanded into related categories, such as coffee gear and cast-iron cookware, effectively building an ecosystem that encourages repeat purchases. This approach has allowed the company to create a robust brand that blends functionality with status, distinguishing itself from competitors. Financially, Yeti has experienced significant growth, with revenue tripling from approximately $600 million in 2016 to over $1.8 billion today. The company has consistently maintained gross margins above 50%, driven by its pricing power and premium product offerings. Yeti's focus on high-margin categories and product innovation is key to its profitability, and management is targeting a gross margin surpassing 60% within the next five years. Additionally, Yeti’s return on invested capital (ROIC) has averaged 28.5% over the past decade, showcasing its efficient capital deployment and strong financial performance. Looking ahead, Yeti’s growth strategy revolves around three key pillars: international expansion, product innovation, and acquisitions. With only 18% of revenue coming from outside the U.S., international markets represent a significant opportunity for growth, particularly in regions like Europe and Asia. Yeti’s recent acquisitions, including premium backpack brand Mystery Ranch and cast-iron cookware maker Butter Pat Industries, are expected to help the company capture new customer segments and expand its product portfolio. However, risks remain, including competition from emerging brands and supply chain dependencies, particularly in China. Market saturation in the U.S. also poses a challenge, making international growth crucial for sustaining double-digit revenue growth. Despite these risks, Yeti’s strong brand, customer loyalty, and robust financials position it well for continued success. At its current valuation, Yeti offers an attractive investment opportunity with significant upside potential driven by international expansion and product innovation. YETI Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:YETI) is not on our list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 31 hedge fund portfolios held YETI at the end of the third quarter which was 31 in the previous quarter.

Decrypt conducted analysis using data from CoinGecko and Nasdaq to identify top-performing coins. To qualify, assets needed a starting market cap of at least $500 million, observed from January 1 to December 17. Other digital asset-related investments, including those of major companies, also did quite well. Here's a look at this year's top-performing assets. One of the newer meme tokens to sit near the top of the market, Pepe (PEPE), launched last year. The token is based on Pepe the Frog, an internet cartoon later labeled a hate symbol by the Anti-Defamation League after alt-right groups strangely adopted it. Pepe hit a new all-time high in December. The Ethereum-based token started the year with a market cap of $590.8 million, but landed at $9.4 billion by December 17—a 1,492% surge. Pepe grabbed headlines for—in typical meme style—its absurd rise in value and how rich it made a small number of traders. But unlike many assets in the bizarre space of meme tokens, Pepe kept going up, and it’s now the 28th biggest coin by market cap. It wasn’t long ago that the little-known Sui (SUI) came on the scene: Launched in May 2023, the blockchain was developed by ex-Meta (formerly Facebook) engineers and now has a buzzing DeFi community using its speedy network. Rapid blockchain Sui’s native SUI token has boomed this year. In January, its market cap stood at $925 million. A 1,193% rise means that by December, it had hit nearly $12 billion. SUI is now the 18th biggest cryptocurrency by market cap. Michael Saylor’s software company went all in on Bitcoin this year—and the firm’s stock shows that it was trading for less than $70 a share at the start of the year. By December, it had increased nearly fivefold—touching $386. That’s a 464% increase and better than everything else on the Nasdaq, including Nvidia. MicroStrategy was formerly a quiet software company. It then started buying Bitcoin in 2020 and rebranded itself as a “Bitcoin treasury company.” This year, the Tyson, Virginia-based entity accelerated its orange coin buys, promising speculators the best deal for Bitcoin exposure. Investors—including hedge funds looking to get volatile returns—piled in on the stock. The O.G. meme coin. Created as a joke to poke fun at the silly amount of altcoins being minted into existence, Dogecoin (DOGE) is now the seventh largest crypto by market cap. Its market cap jumped by 342% this year and now stands at $45.9 billion. Bitcoin’s rise certainly helped. It’s mainly got Tesla CEO Elon Musk to thank for that: The world’s richest man posted frequently about the asset in 2020-2021, and did so again this year amid speculation that the coin would be used on his platform X (formerly Twitter). XRP has had a strong year. The token facilitates transactions on the Ripple network, which provides institutions with a blockchain solution for cross-border payments. The token’s market cap has shot up so much that it’s now the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, increasing 286% from $34 billion to $131.2 billion. It was briefly the third largest this month, overtaking Tether; and on January 1 of this year, it was sixth. The coin has made headlines over its dealings with the authorities. The SEC hit Ripple with a $1.3 billion lawsuit in 2020, alleging that the company sold unregistered securities to investors to raise funds. But last year, the company scored a partial win against the regulator when a judge ruled that programmatic sales of XRP on crypto exchanges to retail investors did not qualify as securities. The ruling was interpreted as a win by Ripple—and the crypto industry as a whole—despite the judge ruling that $728 million worth of tokens for institutional sales constituted unregistered securities sales. Let's call this one an honorable mention, given the title of this article. It’s been an incredible year for Bitcoin, and the world’s biggest asset manager has played a part by making the biggest and oldest cryptocurrency available to all via an ETF. The iShares Bitcoin Trust is a traditional investment vehicle that allows investors to buy and sell shares that track Bitcoin’s price. The shares are traded on the Nasdaq. When it started trading in January, IBIT broke record after record with trading volume and inflows: By December, it had more than $50 billion in assets under management, achieving the milestone in just 228 days—quicker than any other ETF in history. Several other top asset managers also have Bitcoin ETFs trading, but BlackRock’s product has been the most successful.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best TaaS Stocks to Invest in According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Domino's Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ) stands against the other TaaS stocks. Market experts opine that the transportation world is surrounded by tech-infused transformation, which creates significant opportunities for investors to go long on TaaS (transportation-as-a-service) stocks. The digital transformation that is being experienced by the transportation sector continues to make delivery services more accessible and customized. As per Introspective Market Research, factors including the need for on-demand, affordable, and eco-friendly transport solutions are expected to drive the growth of the transportation-as-a-service market. Technological advancements including self-driving cars are some of the prominent factors, with healthy improvement in connectivity. Smart cities and the application of loT, primarily in the transportation sector, should also act as contributing factors. The TaaS market saw a transformative shift over the recent past, courtesy of the integration of Artificial Intelligence (Al) and Machine Learning (ML). Al-powered systems tend to optimize fleet operations by analyzing real-time and historical data, predicting vehicle demand, and suggesting efficient routes. ML algorithms focus on analyzing user behavior, preferences, and travel history to offer recommendations. Therefore, both the technologies, Al and ML, have transformed demand forecasting and predictive analytics. As per Successive Digital, deep learning models, mainly Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, are proficient enough to capture temporal dependencies in data, which helps in demand forecasting. Notably, ML models like ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) and Prophet are used to predict future demand by studying time-series data.

One of the most important trends likely to drive the growth of the TaaS market in 2025 is the rapid adoption of EVs. The global push towards sustainability continues to support the growth of the EV market. Introspective Market Research believes that stringent emission standards set by governments and incentives provided for EVs continue to support the adoption. Furthermore, the development of battery systems focused on enhancing the driving range and cutting down the cost of EVs should make them affordable to consumers. Next, Mobility as a Service (MaaS) integration should continue to fuel growth in the TaaS market. MaaS platforms focus on the convenience of users by offering a one-stop app where people can locate modes of transport such as buses, trains, bicycles, ride-hailing, etc. As per Introspective Market Research, the evolution of digital technologies like real-time data and analytics, mobile applications, and loT supported the growth of MaaS. These technologies focus on integrating and managing different forms of transport services. Our Methodology To list the 10 Best TaaS Stocks to Invest in According to Hedge Funds, we conducted extensive research and scanned through several online rankings. After getting an initial list of 25-30 stocks, we filtered out the ones having high hedge fund holdings. Finally, the shortlisted ones were ranked in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment, as of Q3 2024. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

The price of Bitcoin surpassed US$100,000 this year upon a favourable US election result for the asset. Photo / 123rf If there was any story that gripped financial markets in 2024, Bitcoin would likely be it. The cryptocurrency (although Bitcoiners don’t like it being called that), smashed records this year to surpass US$100,000 for the first time. It followed the launch of exchange-traded funds that made investing in the asset easier for retail investors, and a US election result that favours its future. Markets with Madison began covering Bitcoin in-depth earlier this year, speaking to its biggest bulls including Michael Saylor and Cathie Wood. Markets with Madison visited MicroStrategy’s executive chairman in Washington DC in October to discuss his company’s Bitcoin adoption playbook. MicroStrategy held about US$45 billion worth of Bitcoin by December, as it kept acquiring it despite the rising price. In the first part of this interview, Saylor discussed the multiple his stock is commanding above the value of its Bitcoin holdings, and how investors should assess his company’s finances. In the second part of the Saylor interview, he discusses the factors fuelling the asset’s attractiveness among investors. This episode also explains how Bitcoin is created and its properties. One of the more significant moves in Bitcoin this year was the halving event, where the reward earned from mining the cryptocurrency is reduced. Such an event occurs about every four years and has historically positively impacted its price. In this episode, Ark Invest chief investment officer Cathie Wood discusses her outlook for the asset upon the halving, and the success of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds that her firm launched alongside other financial players like BlackRock.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News You Can't Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stands against the other AI stocks you can't miss. According to a Department of Energy-backed study, U.S. data center power demand could nearly triple in the next three years. With the industry going through an artificial intelligence transformation, data centers could account for as much as 12% of total US electricity consumption. The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory report revealed that by 2028, data centers' annual energy use could reach between 74 and 132 gigawatts. The report was produced in an attempt to understand how Big Tech's data center demand will impact electrical grids, power bills, and the climate. READ NOW: Top 12 AI Stock News and Ratings Dominating Wall Street and 10 AI Stocks Taking Wall Street by Storm "This really signals to us where the frontier is in terms of growing energy demand in the U.S…"What this report is highlighting is what's actually growing the fastest, and the leading edge of demand growth in the U.S. is the very new growth in artificial-intelligence data centers”. A McKinsey analysis reveals how the United States is expected to be the fastest-growing market for data centers, fueled by the continued increase in data, compute, connectivity from digitalization, cloud migration, as well as the scaling of new technologies, particularly AI. A similar study by Bain & Company reveals that the global electricity demand has jumped an estimated 72% from 2019 to 2023 due to the surge in AI. The study further revealed that by 2027, demand could double 2023 levels and is expected to continue rising after 2027. The rate, however, is highly uncertain, depending on factors such as generative AI adoption, regulations, the data center supply chain’s ability to handle growth, and the commercialization of emerging energy technologies. With the need for energy growing rapidly, the power ecosystem is grappling with many challenges at the same time. From reliable power sources, sustainability of power, and upstream infrastructure for power access, to power equipment within data centers, many issues must be addressed before it can have its power needs satisfied. According to a McKinsey study, the time to get new power connections for data center sites in major data center hubs such as Northern Virginia; Santa Clara, California; and Phoenix has been increasing. So much so that locations outside of the United States have placed moratoriums on many new data center builds primarily because they lack the power infrastructure to support them. As such, meeting these needs is highly important to fully realize the potential of artificial intelligence. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). 25 Most In Demand Cars Heading into 2024 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99 Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an automotive and clean energy company that leverages advanced artificial intelligence in its autonomous driving technology and robotics initiatives. On December 23, Barclays kept an “Equal-Weight” rating on Tesla with a $270 price target. The firm expects Tesla to report Q4 deliveries of 515,000 units, up 6% year-over-year and slightly above the consensus estimate of 511,000. The analyst also told investors in a research note that a beat could keep the momentum strong, but the company’s fundamentals are a secondary focus. Moreover, a slight near-term volume miss “would likely do little to dampen” the company’s focus on autonomous vehicles and artificial intelligence, particularly with the anticipated 2025 launch of "Unsupervised FSD”. Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) is expected to reach unsupervised status as early as 2025, allowing vehicles to operate without human oversight. Similarly, the firm noted that a slight beat in Q4 is also insignificant to Tesla's bull case. Overall TSLA ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks you can't miss. While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSLA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Elon Musk's xAI raises $6 billion from Nvidia, AMD, and others

Time Published: 2024-12-26T15:10:00Z

What just happened? Elon Musk-led AI startup xAI has raised $6 billion in Series C funding, valuing the company at around $40 billion, up from $24 billion earlier this year. Some of the notable investors who participated in this round include semiconductor giants Nvidia and AMD, as well as major VCs and asset management firms, such as BlackRock, Fidelity, Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, and more. In total, 97 investors were involved in this round of funding, with the minimum investment per participant pegged at $77,593. Investors were only allowed to participate if they had helped Musk raise funds for his Twitter acquisition in 2022. xAI is reportedly planning to raise additional funds next year as it strives to compete with Google and OpenAI, which have opened up a substantial lead in the high-stakes generative AI game. Since closing its Series B funding round in May 2024, xAI has built a high-power supercomputer called 'Colossus' and released its Grok-2 frontier language model with state-of-the-art reasoning capabilities. Colossus is expected to make it easier for xAI to build and test its AI models, including the aforementioned Grok LLMs that power a chatbot for X Premium users and the Flux image generator. Believed to be the world's largest supercomputer, Colossus is powered by 100,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs, each costing upwards of $30,000. xAI plans to use some of the new funds to double the size of Colossus to 200,000 Nvidia Hopper GPUs. Musk is an important player in the AI sector, having helped found OpenAI in 2015. However, he left the project in 2018 following disagreements with other co-founders, including Sam Altman, who is currently the company's CEO. Musk has also often sounded the alarm against AI, claiming it could destroy humanity without sufficient guardrails. As part of his continuing battle against OpenAI and its founders, Musk sued the company earlier this year, alleging "deceit of Shakespearean proportions." According to his lawsuit, Altman and another co-founder, Greg Brockman, violated the founding contract that envisioned OpenAI as a non-profit organization dedicated to public good. Altman, however, rejected all charges, saying Musk was the one who originally wanted to establish OpenAI as a for-profit company. According to him, the founding members agreed in 2017 to convert OpenAI into a for-profit venture, but rejected Musk's demand for majority equity and the post of the company's CEO. He also alleged that the SpaceX and Tesla CEO is now trying to thwart OpenAI's progress to help his own fledgling AI startup.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks held steady Thursday as trading resumed after the Christmas holiday and Wall Street digested one of the only significant economic data points of the week. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was little changed, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) held steady after erasing early morning losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.1%. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) fell to the $96,000 level as volatile trading continued. Crypto-linked stocks like MicroStrategy (MSTR) tracked the declines. Markets looked to be struggling in a bid to extend the start of the "Santa Claus rally," which kicked off with a bang on Tuesday. All three major indexes rose around 1%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite moved to within striking distance of their records after clawing back gains from a Fed-fueled dive last week. As Wall Street saunters back from its holiday break, the normally routine release on weekly jobless claims took more of a spotlight than usual as the only piece of the jobs puzzle on the docket this week. According to the latest Labor Department data, weekly jobless claims fell to 219,000 compared with expectations of 223,000. However continuing claims pointed to a cooling labor market, jumping by 46,000 in the week ending Dec. 14 to 1.91 million, the highest level since November 2021. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) erased early session losses by 11:30 a.m. ET. Shares of Honeywell (HON) and Boeing (BA) rose more than 1%, helping lift the blue-chip index slightly above the flatline. Apple (AAPL) touched intraday highs after a price target raise to a Street high of $325 from Wedbush analysts Dan Ives. AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) pared early morning losses to trade just below the flatline. Apple (AAPL) stock hit an all-time intraday high Thursday after a nod of confidence in its continued upswing from Wall Street. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives raised his price target on Apple shares to a new Street high of $325, anticipating “a golden era of growth” for the Tim Cook-helmed tech giant in 2025. Apple stock touched $260 early Thursday before modestly paring gains. The stock was still on track to notch another record close after hitting a high of $258.20 on Christmas Eve. Shares have rallied more than 11% over the past month, and the iPhone maker is nearing a $4 trillion market cap. Read the full story here. Shares of AI chip heavyweight (NVDA) fell more than 1% while the rest of the 'Magnificent 7' stocks wavered on Thursday. Technology stocks led the modest market declines as the 'Santa Claus rally' from Wednesday took a pause after the Christmas holiday break. Shares of iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) and Google parent company Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) flipped between positive and negative territory during morning trading. Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley reports: If 2024 was the year of AI chatbots becoming more useful, 2025 will be the year AI agents begin to take over. Autonomous and semi-autonomous AI systems, you can think of agents as super powered AI bots that can take actions on your behalf, such as pulling data from incoming emails and importing it into different apps.

Title: From Microsoft to Nvidia, the AI agents are coming in 2025

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. If 2024 was the year of artificial intelligence chatbots becoming more useful, 2025 will be the year AI agents begin to take over. You can think of agents as super-powered AI bots that can take actions on your behalf, such as pulling data from incoming emails and importing it into different apps. You’ve probably heard rumblings of agents already. Companies ranging from Nvidia (NVDA) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to Microsoft (MSFT) and Salesforce (CRM) are increasingly talking up agentic AI, a fancy way of referring to AI agents, claiming that it will change the way both enterprises and consumers think of AI technologies. The goal is to cut down on often bothersome, time-consuming tasks like filing expense reports — the bane of my professional existence. Not only will we see more AI agents, we’ll see more major tech companies developing them. Companies using them say they’re seeing changes based on their own internal metrics. According to Charles Lamanna, corporate vice president of business and industry Copilot at Microsoft, the Windows maker has already seen improvements in both responsiveness to IT issues and sales outcomes. According to Lamanna, Microsoft employee IT self-help success increased by 36%, while revenue per seller has increased by 9.4%. The company has also experienced improved HR case resolution times. As with any new technology, using AI agents will take some getting used to. But if they live up to the lofty expectations tech companies are laying out, they could win over plenty of users as an impressive new use case for generative AI. “If … you immediately get very rapid and very accurate and very meaningful and helpful responses, then that can start to change people's habits,” TECHnalysis Research president and chief analyst Bob O’Donnell told Yahoo Finance. “But changing people's habits takes a while.” The AI chatbot/AI copilot/AI agent discussion can be a bit confusing. After all, generative AI chatbots still feel like a new technology, and now we’re already being shuffled on to the next big thing. But those three capabilities are all part of the same overall system. Ray Smith, Microsoft’s vice president of AI agents, says you can think of an AI copilot as your main interface for interacting with your chatbot or assistant. Kind of like a home screen for your different AI needs. When you ask your chatbot or assistant to complete various tasks for you, it will reach out to the AI agents with the appropriate capabilities. If that sounds complex, here’s an easy example: Say you want to book a flight. You could tell your chatbot to see what flights are available for you, and it will use different AI agents to check your flight preferences, your calendar and availability, and potentially even your financial apps to make sure you’re getting a flight in your budget range and then come back with a handful of suggested flights. Earlier this month, Google debuted its experimental prototype, Project Mariner, which is capable of navigating the web and performing tasks via Google’s Chrome browser. In a video demo, Google shows an example of a user who needs to look up the contact information for a number of companies listed in a Google Sheets document. The user tells Mariner to memorize the list of companies, go to their websites, and find their contact emails. The agent then actively navigates to each website, grabs the email information, and provides it for each company. Google significantly sped up the process in the demo video, explaining that Mariner is still in its early stages and that it takes time for it to complete requests. But the company says accuracy and speed will improve quickly, though it doesn’t have a set release date. Apple’s (AAPL) Apple Intelligence will eventually offer AI agent-style functionality as well. In upcoming updates, the company says you’ll be able to do things like ask Siri when you should pick up your husband or wife from the airport. The assistant will then check your email to see when the flight is expected to land, check traffic via Apple Maps, and provide you with a suggested time to hit the road. According to Futurum Group CEO Daniel Newman, agents will also be able to do things like help workers find potential business opportunities then help them set up and book meetings with prospective clients. Don’t expect high-powered, multistep AI agents to go mainstream as soon as the clock strikes midnight on New Year's Day. We’ll start to see a few next year, but it’ll likely take a bit of work to iron out all of the kinks. Instead, expect companies to lean into more basic enterprise use cases. “There's going to be also what I’ll call more boring agents that do productive things, things that automate IT processes, things that automate other tedious tasks,” O’Donnell said. “Those, I think, are going to become really important next year.” Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

Title: The biggest gaming controversies of 2024

Time Published: 2024-12-26T14:00:53Z

Layoffs, politics, and the culture wars dominated 2024, but there were plenty of regular, everyday goofs, too. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. 2024 was a big year for gaming, and so naturally it was also a big year for gaming-related controversies. While hand-wringing over fears that "videogames cause violence" seems to have subsided, at least for now, political and culture wars nonsense is more pronounced than ever. The videogame industry itself, meanwhile, continued to suffer decimation as funding dried up and executives who overplayed their hands during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic slashed headcounts in the name of "sustainability." There's no other way to put it: It got ugly out there. Of course, there were plenty of conventional fumbles too: Dissembling, dishonesty, and some straight-up bad calls provided plenty of "things that actually happened" for gamers to be unhappy about. From Facebook rejecting ads for board games to a weird cat game accused of being built with AI, here's our roundup of the year's biggest lowlights. Our face: 😕 What happened: When board game publisher Fort Circle attempted to purchase Facebook ads for a new edition of Votes for Women, a board game about the women's suffrage movement in the US, it received an unexpected surprise: Facebook said no. The problem, according to an automated response provided by Facebook to the publisher, is that the ad "mentions politicians or is about sensitive social issues that could influence public opinion, how people vote and may impact the outcome of an election or pending legislation." The outcome: You might think that such patent stupidity is the result of a bad algorithm making bad decisions, as they do, and you'd be correct. But when Fort Circle requested a review of the ruling, that too was rejected. Not being able to run ads had a material impact on the Votes for Women crowdfunding campaign—"Most Kickstarter creators will tell you that Facebook advertising is a crucial piece of the crowdfunding puzzle," Fort Circle founder Kevin Bertram said at the time—but more broadly it points to a pretty serious failure in Facebook's review process. Our face: 😡 What happened: In March, a little-known company called Sweet Baby Inc was suddenly thrust into the spotlight by "anti-woke" gamers outraged by, as one put it, the narrative consultants' promulgation of "ideological worldviews that I believe have taken hold of the Western world, media, and gaming as a whole." Which is of course nonsense: The company is contracted by developers who want to improve pre-existing elements of their games, and it has absolutely no power to force anyone to do anything—least of all make wholesale changes to their projects to enforce some sort of imagined "race and identity group quota." Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The outcome: As ridiculous as it sounds (and is), the furor was (and is) real. A Steam curator group dedicated to "detecting" the presence of Sweet Baby Inc in games has now swollen to more than 460,000 followers, and the company was forced to lock its social media accounts following a torrent of abuse. Our face: 🤨 What happened: The Fallout TV show on Amazon was a hit, but it made some Fallout die-hards angry because of a perceived lack of faith to the lore. PC Gamer's Chris Livingston broke the whole thing down in detail, but the short version is that aggrieved fans believed Bethesda was using the Amazon show to erase Fallout: New Vegas—a fan-favorite in the series that was notably not developed by Bethesda, but by Obsidian—from the timeline. The outcome: Reactions to the conspiracy theory varied: Showrunner Graham Wagner said the wasteland isn't static and sometimes things happen, New Vegas lead designer Josh Sawyer understands the annoyance but really doesn't give a shit, and Todd Howard, the man currently atop the Fallout creative mountain, expressed mild exasperation about the whole thing, promising that "New Vegas is a very, very important game" to Bethesda. Bottom line? Everyone needs to simmer down. Our face: 🤔 What happened: Battlestate Games shot itself in the foot real good in April with the release of a $250 Unheard Edition of the game that included, among other things, access to co-op PvE—a mode that owners of other editions would have to pay to play. What really stuck in the community's craw, though, was a previously-released $150 Edge of Darkness edition that promised "free access to all subsequent DLCs," but that did not offer access to the new mode. Battlestate argued that the PvE mode was not DLC but a "unique feature of the new game," and thus didn't count. That went over about as well as you'd expect—extremely not well, to be clear—and Battlestate made the situation worse by dicking around with half-baked sops. It eventually offered six months of co-op play for free, but not until some future date because the servers don't have the capacity to handle everyone; on top of that, people who bought the $250 edition were promised priority matchmaking, meaning everyone else would be stuck in longer queues. They were also given access to in-game items protecting them from scavs and enabling more and better gear to be carried, conferring a distinct advantage over others, including those who bought the previously-prized $150 version. The outcome: As PC Gamer's Jake Tucker said, Battlestate "wiped out years of goodwill in one catastrophic week," but somehow it wasn't quite finished stepping on the Lego it'd dumped on the floor. After initially offering owners of the Edge of Darkness edition of Escape from Tarkov an option to upgrade to the newer release for $100 (what a deal), Battlestate reduced the upgrade price to $50; players who had already forked over $100 for the upgrade were offered $50 in "compensation," in the form of a single-use Escape from Tarkov voucher. Our face: 😣 What happened: Not content to sit quietly on the sidelines and watch Battlestate blow years of goodwill to smithereens with unforced errors, Bethesda said "hold my beer" and rolled out a "next-gen" patch for Fallout 4 that PC Gamer's Ted Litchfield described as nothing short of "calamitous." It wasn't just that the update changed so little, it actually made things worse: The added ultrawide support borked the UI, modded saves wouldn't load, and frame rate was still capped at 60. Adding insult to injury, the update rolled out on the heels of the hit Fallout TV show on Amazon, which had sparked a whole new wave of interest in and excitement for the game series, and the mod team behind Fallout London had to delay the total conversion's release to be sure it'd be compatible with the new version. The outcome: An update to the update rolled out a few weeks later, correcting a few issues but leaving the biggest problems for modders to fix. Many of them recommended the simplest fix of all: Use the Fallout 4 Downgrader tool to revert the game to a pre-"next gen" state and be happy with a game that works like it's supposed to. For the record, Fallout 4's next-gen patch hasn't been updated since. Our face: 😵 What happened: The Kerbal Space Program 2 controversy actually kicked off in early 2023 with a catastrophic early access launch, but it took a weird, drawn-out twist in 2024. In May, it was reported that KSP2 developer Intercept Games, along with Rollerdrome studio Roll7, were being closed as part of sweeping layoffs at parent company Take-Two Interactive. But shortly after that report, the Kerbal Space Program X account piped up, saying, "We're still hard at work on KSP2. We'll talk more when we can." Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick threw more confusion on the fire a couple weeks later, saying the closure report wasn't true: "We didn't shutter those studios, to be clear." Zelnick insisted he wasn't trying to be "cute or difficult" about the situation, but yeah, he was being kind of cute and difficult. Not too long after that, Intercept employees confirmed that large numbers of people at the studio, and possibly the entire team, was being laid off. The outcome: In November, Take-Two sold its Private Division publishing label to an unnamed buyer, and at the same time finally confirmed that Intercept and Roll7 had in fact been closed at some point prior to the sale. Take-Two still hasn't explained what happened between 'we haven't closed the studio' and 'the studio is closed.' As for Kerbal Space Program 2, it appears to be cooked: The KSP X account hasn't posted since the "still hard at work" promise in May, and the most recent game update—a relatively small bug-fix patch—went live in June. The game currently has a "mostly negative" overall user rating on Steam, and a concurrent player count that hovers around 100. Our face: 😐 What happened: Arrowhead's fascism-is-fun shooter Helldivers 2 was on a monster roll following its launch in February, but ran face-first into a concrete wall in May when Sony, the game's publisher, announced that players on Steam would be required to have a PlayStation Network account if they wanted to keep playing. That was the plan from the start, but the requirement was initially put on hold because of server issues when the game first went live. That didn't mollify players, who came hard with the time-honored tradition of a review-bombing: More than 220,000 negative reviews flooded into Steam, dragging Helldivers 2's "overwhelmingly positive" rating to "mixed." Sony stood its ground briefly but eventually backed down, leaving Arrowhead to clean up the mess. The outcome: An influx of positive reviews followed in the wake of Operation Cleanup, but like grassy fields in France that remain pockmarked with shell craters, evidence of the battle remains in the game's "mostly positive" rating on Steam: Good, but nowhere near what it used to be. And despite the debacle, Sony isn't giving up on the PSN account requirement on PC: President Hiroki Totoki said in November that linked accounts are necessary so people can "safely" play its games. Our face: 😬 What happened: Things went sideways in a hurry for Tekken pro Kim "JDCR" Hyun-jin, who was about to claim victory against opponent Alexandra "AK" Laverez at Dreamhack Dallas when his controller crapped out, eventually determined to be the result of someone who was previously connected to the setup turning their controller on. That forced a redo of the match, and that didn't go over well: As PC Gamer's resident fighting game pro Mollie Taylor recounted, "Twitch chat can be seen saying things like 'JDCR won that fair and square,' 'JDCR ALREADY WON,' 'JDCR got screwed,' and 'Jdcr won. This is rigged'." When the do-over match eventually went ahead, AK—who was undoubtedly going to lose prior to the technical trouble—came out on top, and the reaction was predictable. AK received "a heaping of rather undue hate," Taylor wrote: Some said he should have forfeited the match, others went so far as to claim that he'd intentionally sabotaged JDCR's controller connection in order to avoid a loss. The outcome: JDCR ultimately finished ninth in the tournament, just missing out on a top-eight finish that would have earned him a qualifying position at the Esports World Cup. DreamHack founder Alex Jebailey said on Twitter that he felt "incredibly sorry for what happened" and that he'd help JDCR attend future qualifiers for another World Cup shot. But, he added, "the amount of death threats and crazy things being said to me are pretty horrendous." Our face: 🤠 What happened: Starfield was a perfectly fine Bethesda RPG, but didn't quite live up to the pre-release hype. The mood among players soured further as months went by with minimal support, and the launch of the Starfield Creation Kit in June did not improve things. The big problem was the release of a single Trackers Alliance mission called The Vulture that cost $7, which thanks to the magic of Starfield Creation Credits bundle pricing was in reality $10. Unhappy players likened the DLC to Oblivion's infamous Horse Armor, the 2006 add-on that heralded the era of cosmetic microtransactions. The outcome: Horse Armor won in 2006, and despite the widespread early upset it looks like The Vulture did too: In response to the backlash, Todd Howard said "we hear the feedback" (ie., a small review bombing campaign on Steam) but Bethesda hasn't budget on the price, and it remains among the most popular of more than 2,700 Starfield creations. Our face: 🤬 What happened: Assassin's Creed Shadows has been a nexus of anti-woke gamer upset since revealing Yasuke, one of its two protagonists. Yasuke is a real-life historical figure who lived in Japan in the 16th century and eventually became an attendant of Oda Nobunaga. He's an ideal fit for an Assassin's Creed character, but he's also Black, and that caused great distress among certain corners of the gaming world, who very suddenly discovered a new commitment to historical authenticity (it's widely believed Yasuke served as a samurai, but not known for certain) and felt that featuring him instead of a "real" Japanese samurai was disrespectful to Japan. X owner Elon Musk amplified that sentiment in May, replying to a complaint about the game posted on his platform that "DEI kills art." Ubisoft's ham-fisted efforts to address what it apparently imagined were good-faith concerns about the game, meanwhile, only made the whole situation worse. It got to the point where even Reddit was sick of dealing with it. Other, more self-inflicted problems cropped up over the second half of the year. In July, Ubisoft apologized for using a real-life reenactment group's flag in Assassin's Creed Shadows concept art without permission, and in October the maker of a collectible said it would be redesigned following complaints that it bore a striking resemblance to the one-legged torii standing outside the Sannō Shrine, a remnant of the 1945 nuclear attack on the city of Nagasaki. Frankly, though, I don't think either issue would have attracted nearly as much attention had the anger pump not already been primed by the inclusion of Yasuke. The outcome: Assassin's Creed Shadows was delayed in September to February 14, 2025, so we're still waiting to see how that works out, but it's been interesting watching Ubisoft grapple with the blowback. There seems to be confusion, or perhaps conflict, on how best to approach it: Executive producer Marc-Alexis Côté said in June that Musk was "feeding hatred," but in September, after announcing the delay, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot took pains to reassure everyone that "our goal is not to push any specific agenda" with games. But Coté is having none of that, saying more forcefully in November that some of Assassin's Creed Shadows' loudest critics post "lies, half truths and personal attacks online," and that "when we self-censor in the face of threats, we hand over our power, piece by piece, until freedom and creativity both wither away." Our face: 🤢 What happened: Guy Beahm, better known online as the streamer Dr Disrespect, was banned from Twitch for life in 2020. But the reason for his ouster remained a secret until June 2024, when a former Twitch employee alleged that Beahm was shown the door because he was caught "sexting a minor" through Twitch's Whispers messaging system. A few days later, Beahm acknowledged exchanging messages with a minor in 2017 "that sometimes leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate," but insisted that "nothing illegal happened" and that he never faced criminal charges as a result of his actions. The outcome: The fallout was immediate and severe. Beahm was fired by Midnight Society, the game studio he co-founded in 2021, when the allegations first came to light; shortly after his public admission, 2K Games, Turtle Beach, the NFL, and YouTube also cut ties with the streamer. Our face: 😧 What happened: Destiny 2 studio Bungie laid off 220 employees in July, less than a year after an October 2023 layoff that saw a number of long-time and high-profile staffers put out of work. What really pissed people off, though, were claims that Bungie CEO Pete Parsons had spent more than $2.4 million on vintage cars over the two years leading up to the layoffs. Parson's money to spend, yes, and not a huge amount of it compared to the cash Destiny 2 has hoovered in over the years, but as PC Gamer's Harvey Randall put it, "Isn't it weird that he has so much of it while his now-former employees face anxiety over their basic living expenses?" Some former Bungie employees sure thought so. The reaction to Parsons' vehicular habits was no doubt amplified to some extent by his public performance in the wake of those October 2023 layoffs, in which he did his best to present himself as an innocent bystander rather than a well-paid, still-employed studio chief. As one person said in response to Parsons' post about those layoffs on X, "Your senior social lead probably would have recommended against this post, which you would have known had you not let them go." The outcome: Destiny 2 is still grinding along, but the road ahead hasn't gotten any smoother. In October, Sony carved off more of Bungie, making its Creative Studios arm a part of PlayStation Studios, and in December former Destiny 2 and Marathon director Christopher Barrett, who was fired in April over allegations of inappropriate behavior with female employees, sued the company for $200 million, saying Bungie "deliberately destroyed [his] reputation by falsely, and publicly, insinuating they had 'investigated' Barrett and 'found' he had engaged in sexual misconduct." Our face: 😮 What happened: Amina Abakarova, a 40 year-old chess player from the Russian Republic of Dagestan, was scheduled to play Umayganat Osmanova, a 30 year-old longtime rival who had beaten Abakarova into second place in a tournament the week prior. Not wanting to risk a second consecutive L, Abakarova decided to up her game by smearing liquid mercury all over the chess board and pieces they were meant to use. Mercury is of course very poisonous, and Osmanova began complaining that she was unwell, nauseous and dizzy around half an hour after the game began. Doctors were called in, and were fortunately able to prevent her from succumbing to the poison. The outcome: Abakarova might be a really good chess player, but she's not much of a criminal mastermind. She applied the poison in full view of security cameras, and was thus quickly busted by police. She reportedly copped to the whole thing, not because she wanted to win the match but just because she really doesn't like Osmanova, and now she's facing up to three years in prison and a lifetime ban from competitive chess play. It may not seem like a world-shattering controversy from our videogame-centric perspective, but it was a very big deal in the world of chess: Malcolm Pein of the English Chess Federation said he'd "never seen anything like this before," adding that it was "the first recorded case of somebody using a toxic substance, to my knowledge, in the history of the game of chess." Our face: 😒 What happened: Black Myth: Wukong is a good game and a major success, but it's also become a pivot point in the culture wars thanks to a 2023 IGN report on the long history of sexism at developer Game Science. The issue was put back under the spotlight in August 2024 when the studio sent out streaming guidelines just ahead of Black Myth: Wukong's release forbidding, among other things, "feminist propaganda" during streams. Naturally, the usual parts of the Twittersphere were thrilled to see a developer being so "based," especially since Black Myth: Wukong was a hit, proof positive that 'real gamers' don't want politics in their videogames, or somesuch. Others viewed the whole thing more as just strange and a little creepy. The outcome: Game Science has steadfastly refused to even acknowledge the issue: On multiple occasions, both before and after the streamer guidelines came to light, the studio has kept its head down and refused to comment on the controversy. Which may be a comment in itself: As PC Gamer's Wes Fenlon wrote, "It's hard not to read the silence as a sign that Game Science feels it has nothing to apologize for." Our face: 😶 What happened: Mega-YouTuber Jimmy "MrBeast" Donaldson had a good first-half in 2024, with his main account becoming the most-subscribed channel on the platform in June, but a very bad second half, as his media empire became embroiled in multiple scandals. Longtime collaborator Ava Kris Tyson was accused of grooming a 14-year-old fan after an exchange of inappropriate messages came to light, and while Donaldson quickly cut ties with Tyson, more trouble followed. Contestants in his Beast Games competition, a real-life Squid Games knockoff, complained of poor treatment, and former employees came forward to say some elements of his videos were either faked or rigged—and that they'd been mistreated themselves. The outcome: Rather than issuing the standard mea culpa that so often comes in the wake of this sort of thing, Donaldson is trying to power through it, keeping his head down, his mouth shut, and the videos rolling. So far it seems to be working: His subscriber numbers continue to climb, and his videos are still attracting hundreds of millions of viewers. Our face: 🙄 What happened: Legendary game designer and bullshitter extraordinaire Peter Molyneux said in August that he's "coming home" to PC, which would've been exciting news in, say, 2006. But in 2024, the bloom is off the rose thanks to a long series of catastrophes including Curiosity, Godus and the follow-up Godus Wars, and Legacy, a blockchain-based business sim that raised a huge pile of money in pre-release land sales (although apparently not quite the $54 million claimed by some reports) and then immediately tanked. Which isn't to say Molyneux's new thing, the god game Masters of Albion, will necessarily be bad. If anything, it actually shows some real promise: Superficially, it looks a bit like Populous mashed up with Fable, and if Molyneux's 22cans studio can pull it off, that definitely might not suck. The outcome: Impossible to say at this point because nothing else has happened, but memories of the last decade-plus will not be forgotten, and that puts the whole thing in a deep hole right from the start. I hope he's able to climb out of it and clock us all in the head with one final, great triumph, but the days of granting Molyneux the benefit of the doubt are long over. Our face: 😢 What happened: The online shooter Concord was one of the biggest, most spectacular flameouts in videogame history: After sinking vast amounts of money into the project, including the outright purchase of developer Firewalk Studios in 2023, mixed user reviews and abysmally low player counts sealed its doom immediately. Some hoped Concord might get a second shot at life as a free-to-play game, but Sony shot down that proposition in October: Concord, like the proverbial parrot, is dead. The outcome: It was an ugly mess by any measure, but what was particularly notable in the wake of Concord's failure was the glee it prompted from some corners of the gaming world: Gloating, memes, and shared screenshots of the game's concurrent player count on Steam dominated the post-closure discourse. PC Gamer's Tyler Wilde said "the eagerness to grave dance on unpopular games has become a bad habit," and he's absolutely right. Concord was at best a perfectly fine shooter trying to break into a crowded genre where "perfectly fine" isn't nearly good enough, and there's plenty of space for analysis and discussion of how it all went so completely wrong. But cheering its loss—and the subsequent closure of Firewalk—does no one any good. Our face: 🤢🤢🤢 What happened: The Dr Disrespect comeback tour began in September with a 20-minute rant on his YouTube channel, in which he said his Twitch suspension was primarily the result of a conspiracy against him. But it didn't really kick into gear until October, when YouTube declined to remonetize his channel. In response, the streamer teased "something much, much bigger" in the works, which in November turned out to be a move to Rumble, the right-wing streaming platform that hosts the likes of Dan Bongino, Steven Crowder, Viva Frei, Russell Brand, The Quartering, and the Tate Brothers. The outcome: Well, Dr Disrespect is on Rumble now. The numbers aren't nearly the same at this point—he's currently at a little over 76,000 followers on Rumble, a small fraction of the 4.55 million he'd amassed on YouTube—but he's not just streaming there: His deal with the platform includes equity in the company, and he will also lead Rumble Gaming, its videogame-focused livestream category. Lest there be any doubt about his commitment to the cause, the move came a month after he announced a line of "Make Gaming Great Again" merchandise modeled after the campaign slogan of US president-elect Donald Trump. Our face: 😠 What happened: Under pressure from the Anti-Defamation League, a major American non-profit that campaigns against antisemitism and promotes Zionism as a movement for "self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland," Twitch banned several Arab streamers in October over a TwitchCon panel that had occurred a month earlier. Panelists had put together a tier list ranking various streamers from "Arab" to "loves Sabra", an American and Israeli-owned hummus brand; Twitch partner and panel host Frogan said the panel was about "who has a habibi pass" (habibi is Arabic for "my love") but the ADL characterized it as "antisemitic vitriol." The ban came a week after Twitch suspended Asmongold for his racist tirade against Palestinians, and the discovery that Twitch had stopped signups with email verification from both Israel and Palestine for more than a year, which it said was done "to prevent uploads of graphic material" following the Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023—a "temporary" measure it apparently forgot to reverse. The outcome: Following weeks of back-and-forth complaints of Islamophobia and antisemitism on the platform, Twitch rolled out a policy requiring a warning label for streams about vaguely-defined "politics and sensitive social issues," which included discussions about topics including "reproductive rights, LGBTQ+ rights, or immigration." Twitch modified the guidelines a few days later to remove LGBTQ+ references but the rules remained too vague to be useful in any meaningful way; days after that, again under pressure from the ADL, Twitch forbid the use of the word "Zionist" to "attack or demean" other people or groups, but said it could still be used in its political context. Our face: 🤡 What happened: X owner and soon-to-be co-president of the United States Elon Musk made the bizarre statement on his platform that "too many game studios that are owned by massive corporations," before promising that "xAI is going to start an AI game studio to make games great again!" The outcome: Setting aside the fact that making games is really hard and nobody knows what an "AI game studio" is beyond some imagined Star Trek-style fantasy that doesn't actually exist, the statement was especially strange coming from a man with whose net worth is counted in the hundreds of billions—he's literally the wealthiest man on the planet—and who heads up a number of pretty famous "massive corporations" of his own. The real motivation for Musk's promised move into the industry was revealed by a later tweet to be less about concerns over corporate ownership, and more about wanting games that "skip the woke lecture." The segment of the gaming community up in arms about "wokeness" in videogames was thrilled to see Musk wading into the fray, but there's been no more said about it since. Our face: 😔 What happened: Hardware maker NZXT came under fire in December for its Flex PC rental service, which a Gamers Nexus exposé called a "predatory, evil rental computer scam." Specific complaints included allegations that NZXT would sometimes swap out components in rented PCs with less powerful hardware, use seemingly false or misleading benchmarks, and lock rental customers into unfair contracts. The outcome: NZXT defended its practices in response, but acknowledged that it "messed up" on some points. It committed to greater clarity on various points of the program and an end to "influencer-led" advertising, and also spent a good chunk of text laying out the "use case" for the Flex rental program, which NZXT said "allows for flexibility and lower commitment than owning or financing a PC." The response did not calm the waters: A video of NZXT CEO Johnny Hou discussing the matter has received 331 likes on YouTube, and more than 6,400 dislikes. Our face: 🐱 What happened: Catly, a weird game about cats, dropped a reveal trailer at the 2024 Game Awards. Rather than being greeting with the presumably-expected "awww, they're so cute," though, the trailer sparked immediate speculation (and some straight-up accusations) that it was made with generative AI. The game itself, from the very little that could be seen of it, struck many as little more than an NFT showcase. Those concerns were heightened by reports that Kevin Yeung, the co-founder of developer SuperAuthenti, is also co-founder of TenthPlanet, a studio that definitely is (or at least was) working on blockchain projects. The outcome: SuperAuthenti has been oddly quiet about the whole thing, although it did eventually state that Catly does not use AI and has "zero blockchain technology." Beyond that, we'll have to wait and see: A post-announcement update to the Steam page provided a closer look at what the game is all about, but more details won't be revealed until sometime in 2025. Andy has been gaming on PCs from the very beginning, starting as a youngster with text adventures and primitive action games on a cassette-based TRS80. From there he graduated to the glory days of Sierra Online adventures and Microprose sims, ran a local BBS, learned how to build PCs, and developed a longstanding love of RPGs, immersive sims, and shooters. He began writing videogame news in 2007 for The Escapist and somehow managed to avoid getting fired until 2014, when he joined the storied ranks of PC Gamer. He covers all aspects of the industry, from new game announcements and patch notes to legal disputes, Twitch beefs, esports, and Henry Cavill. Lots of Henry Cavill. We learned just how small Valve really is this year, but also how good it is at raking in the cash: It's making more money per employee than Apple The best heavyweight boxer in the world dressed like Hitman's Agent 47 to clown on his opponent in a pre-fight press conference Google being pushed to sell off Chrome is likely a good thing, but don't cheer on the decision just yet PC Gamer is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Title: More Reasons For Cautious Optimism About The Demise Of The Green Energy Fantasy

Skip to comments. Posted on 12/26/2024 5:13:04 AM PST by MtnClimber My post on Saturday noted one big reason for optimism that the green energy fantasy is coming to the end of its run: the first country, Germany, has apparently begun to hit the green energy “wall.” Although Germany has never consistently reached even 50% of its electricity production from wind and solar, its ability to continue its green energy dreams has stalled: its electricity prices have soared, its manufacturing sector has been seriously undermined, its economy is in recession, and recently its green-promoting government has fallen. Its failed example now stands for others to see and avoid. And as I look around at developments since the election, I see a number of other reasons to reinforce my cautious optimism. Maybe it’s that the political environment has changed, and maybe it’s that some people are starting to recognize that you can’t beat the laws of physics; and maybe it’s some of both. Here are examples: Banks and investment firms quitting net zero “alliances”On Saturday’s post, commenter William Bell asked “Who, exactly, is preventing third-world inhabitants from using wood, charcoal, coal, petroleum derivatives, and/or natural gas for fuel and by what means?” Apparently Mr. Bell, and maybe many others, is unaware of the many “alliances” of banks and investors seeking to starve fossil fuels of investment capital, and thus prevent third-world countries (and everybody else) from continuing to use them. Most of these groups are somehow directed and overseen by the UN. Examples of these groups include the Net Zero Banking Alliance (“Bank-led, UN-convened”), the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, and Climate Action 100+. I’m sure that I have not got them all. The members are, or have been, a who’s who of all the biggest banks and investment firms in the world. The Center Square reports here on December 20 that two rather significant banks, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo, have just quit the NZBA: Not soon after the general election, and within two weeks of each other, two major financial institutions have left a United Nations Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA). This is after they joined three years ago, pledging to require environmental social governance standards (ESG) across their platforms, products and systems. House Judiciary Committee issues report accusing large money managers of running a “climate cartel”On December 13, the House Judiciary Committee issued a Report titled “Sustainability Shakedown: How a Climate Cartel of Money Managers Colluded to Take Over the Board of America’s Largest Energy Company.” The Report documents the process by which the Climate Action 100+ alliance, “emboldened” by encouragement from the Biden/Harris administration, orchestrated replacement of three board members of Exxon in May 2021. The collusive actions of the largest investment firms and proxy advisors are described as a “cartel” clearly violative of the antitrust laws. Red state AGs sue investment firms for antitrust violations for colluding on “climate” issues Maybe it’s coincidence, but shortly before the issuance of the Judiciary Committee Report, an antitrust suit was brought on November 27 by eleven red state AGs, led by Ken Paxton of Texas, accusing participants in the investment industry of collusive conduct in enforcing “climate” and other “ESG” goals. The defendants in the case include the three largest money managers, Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street. From Bloomberg Law, November 27: BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. were sued by a group of states led by Texas for allegedly breaking antitrust law by boosting electricity prices through their investments, in the highest-profile lawsuit yet against the beleaguered ESG industry. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and 10 other states claim the money managers, as part of their green agenda, combined their market clout and membership in climate groups to pressure coal producers to cut output. TotalEnergies pauses major wind farm in the waters off New York and New JerseyAlso on November 27, French energy giant TotalEnergies announced that it was “pausing” its major Attentive Energy off-shore wind project in the Atlantic Ocean off New York and New Jersey. In his announcement of the “pause,” Total’s Chairman specifically attributed the action to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. From Offshore, November 27: TotalEnergies has reportedly paused development of the Attentive Energy wind farm it planned to build off the coast of New York and New Jersey, CEO Patrick Pouyanne said Tuesday at an energy industry conference in London. “I have decided to put the project on pause,” TotalEnergies’ CEO Patrick Pouyanne said at the Energy Intelligence Forum, according to reports from Bloomberg and Reuters. The decision is one of the first tangible signs of a halt in investment in renewable power sources due to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. Trump has vowed to stop offshore wind energy development “on day one” of his next term starting in January 2025. The new Trump administration is still almost a month away from taking office, but already the anticipation of its arrival is having the positive effect of driving some of the parasites into hiding. There are many more such positive developments out there. I’ll see if I can assemble a few more before year’s end. Meanwhile, I’m as hopeful as I’ve ever been that the green energy mania is fading.

There is no way out. Germany can’t build new nuclear power plants - the Gaia worshipers would never tolerate it. They can’t burn coal for the same reason. They have to buy their natural gas at spot market prices which are considerably higher than they were paying and they can’t compete at those prices. You will see more and more manufacturers closing down plants in Germany and opening plants overseas. 6 posted on 12/26/2024 5:57:45 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: V_TWIN Eric Hoffer, the “longshoreman philosopher,” nailed it many years ago: “Every cause begins with a movement, which develops into a business, and ends up being a racket.” Good word choice. 7 posted on 12/26/2024 5:58:29 AM PST by hinckley buzzard ( Resist the narrative.)

Maybe it’s that the political environment has changed, and maybe it’s that some people are starting to recognize that you can’t beat the laws of physics; and maybe it’s some of both. Here are examples: Banks and investment firms quitting net zero “alliances”On Saturday’s post, commenter William Bell asked “Who, exactly, is preventing third-world inhabitants from using wood, charcoal, coal, petroleum derivatives, and/or natural gas for fuel and by what means?” Apparently Mr. Bell, and maybe many others, is unaware of the many “alliances” of banks and investors seeking to starve fossil fuels of investment capital, and thus prevent third-world countries (and everybody else) from continuing to use them. Most of these groups are somehow directed and overseen by the UN. Examples of these groups include the Net Zero Banking Alliance (“Bank-led, UN-convened”), the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, and Climate Action 100+. I’m sure that I have not got them all. The members are, or have been, a who’s who of all the biggest banks and investment firms in the world. The Center Square reports here on December 20 that two rather significant banks, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo, have just quit the NZBA: Not soon after the general election, and within two weeks of each other, two major financial institutions have left a United Nations Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA). This is after they joined three years ago, pledging to require environmental social governance standards (ESG) across their platforms, products and systems. House Judiciary Committee issues report accusing large money managers of running a “climate cartel”On December 13, the House Judiciary Committee issued a Report titled “Sustainability Shakedown: How a Climate Cartel of Money Managers Colluded to Take Over the Board of America’s Largest Energy Company.” The Report documents the process by which the Climate Action 100+ alliance, “emboldened” by encouragement from the Biden/Harris administration, orchestrated replacement of three board members of Exxon in May 2021. The collusive actions of the largest investment firms and proxy advisors are described as a “cartel” clearly violative of the antitrust laws. Red state AGs sue investment firms for antitrust violations for colluding on “climate” issues Maybe it’s coincidence, but shortly before the issuance of the Judiciary Committee Report, an antitrust suit was brought on November 27 by eleven red state AGs, led by Ken Paxton of Texas, accusing participants in the investment industry of collusive conduct in enforcing “climate” and other “ESG” goals. The defendants in the case include the three largest money managers, Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street. From Bloomberg Law, November 27: BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. were sued by a group of states led by Texas for allegedly breaking antitrust law by boosting electricity prices through their investments, in the highest-profile lawsuit yet against the beleaguered ESG industry. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and 10 other states claim the money managers, as part of their green agenda, combined their market clout and membership in climate groups to pressure coal producers to cut output. TotalEnergies pauses major wind farm in the waters off New York and New JerseyAlso on November 27, French energy giant TotalEnergies announced that it was “pausing” its major Attentive Energy off-shore wind project in the Atlantic Ocean off New York and New Jersey. In his announcement of the “pause,” Total’s Chairman specifically attributed the action to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. From Offshore, November 27: TotalEnergies has reportedly paused development of the Attentive Energy wind farm it planned to build off the coast of New York and New Jersey, CEO Patrick Pouyanne said Tuesday at an energy industry conference in London. “I have decided to put the project on pause,” TotalEnergies’ CEO Patrick Pouyanne said at the Energy Intelligence Forum, according to reports from Bloomberg and Reuters. The decision is one of the first tangible signs of a halt in investment in renewable power sources due to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. Trump has vowed to stop offshore wind energy development “on day one” of his next term starting in January 2025. The new Trump administration is still almost a month away from taking office, but already the anticipation of its arrival is having the positive effect of driving some of the parasites into hiding. There are many more such positive developments out there. I’ll see if I can assemble a few more before year’s end. Meanwhile, I’m as hopeful as I’ve ever been that the green energy mania is fading.

The decision is one of the first tangible signs of a halt in investment in renewable power sources due to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. Trump has vowed to stop offshore wind energy development “on day one” of his next term starting in January 2025. The new Trump administration is still almost a month away from taking office, but already the anticipation of its arrival is having the positive effect of driving some of the parasites into hiding. There are many more such positive developments out there. I’ll see if I can assemble a few more before year’s end. Meanwhile, I’m as hopeful as I’ve ever been that the green energy mania is fading.

This is after they joined three years ago, pledging to require environmental social governance standards (ESG) across their platforms, products and systems. House Judiciary Committee issues report accusing large money managers of running a “climate cartel”On December 13, the House Judiciary Committee issued a Report titled “Sustainability Shakedown: How a Climate Cartel of Money Managers Colluded to Take Over the Board of America’s Largest Energy Company.” The Report documents the process by which the Climate Action 100+ alliance, “emboldened” by encouragement from the Biden/Harris administration, orchestrated replacement of three board members of Exxon in May 2021. The collusive actions of the largest investment firms and proxy advisors are described as a “cartel” clearly violative of the antitrust laws. Red state AGs sue investment firms for antitrust violations for colluding on “climate” issues Maybe it’s coincidence, but shortly before the issuance of the Judiciary Committee Report, an antitrust suit was brought on November 27 by eleven red state AGs, led by Ken Paxton of Texas, accusing participants in the investment industry of collusive conduct in enforcing “climate” and other “ESG” goals. The defendants in the case include the three largest money managers, Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street. From Bloomberg Law, November 27: BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. were sued by a group of states led by Texas for allegedly breaking antitrust law by boosting electricity prices through their investments, in the highest-profile lawsuit yet against the beleaguered ESG industry. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and 10 other states claim the money managers, as part of their green agenda, combined their market clout and membership in climate groups to pressure coal producers to cut output. TotalEnergies pauses major wind farm in the waters off New York and New JerseyAlso on November 27, French energy giant TotalEnergies announced that it was “pausing” its major Attentive Energy off-shore wind project in the Atlantic Ocean off New York and New Jersey.

The collusive actions of the largest investment firms and proxy advisors are described as a “cartel” clearly violative of the antitrust laws. Red state AGs sue investment firms for antitrust violations for colluding on “climate” issues Maybe it’s coincidence, but shortly before the issuance of the Judiciary Committee Report, an antitrust suit was brought on November 27 by eleven red state AGs, led by Ken Paxton of Texas, accusing participants in the investment industry of collusive conduct in enforcing “climate” and other “ESG” goals. The defendants in the case include the three largest money managers, Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street. From Bloomberg Law, November 27: BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. were sued by a group of states led by Texas for allegedly breaking antitrust law by boosting electricity prices through their investments, in the highest-profile lawsuit yet against the beleaguered ESG industry. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and 10 other states claim the money managers, as part of their green agenda, combined their market clout and membership in climate groups to pressure coal producers to cut output. TotalEnergies pauses major wind farm in the waters off New York and New JerseyAlso on November 27, French energy giant TotalEnergies announced that it was “pausing” its major Attentive Energy off-shore wind project in the Atlantic Ocean off New York and New Jersey. In his announcement of the “pause,” Total’s Chairman specifically attributed the action to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. From Offshore, November 27: TotalEnergies has reportedly paused development of the Attentive Energy wind farm it planned to build off the coast of New York and New Jersey, CEO Patrick Pouyanne said Tuesday at an energy industry conference in London. “I have decided to put the project on pause,” TotalEnergies’ CEO Patrick Pouyanne said at the Energy Intelligence Forum, according to reports from Bloomberg and Reuters. The decision is one of the first tangible signs of a halt in investment in renewable power sources due to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. Trump has vowed to stop offshore wind energy development “on day one” of his next term starting in January 2025. The new Trump administration is still almost a month away from taking office, but already the anticipation of its arrival is having the positive effect of driving some of the parasites into hiding. There are many more such positive developments out there. I’ll see if I can assemble a few more before year’s end. Meanwhile, I’m as hopeful as I’ve ever been that the green energy mania is fading.

The defendants in the case include the three largest money managers, Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street. From Bloomberg Law, November 27: BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. were sued by a group of states led by Texas for allegedly breaking antitrust law by boosting electricity prices through their investments, in the highest-profile lawsuit yet against the beleaguered ESG industry. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and 10 other states claim the money managers, as part of their green agenda, combined their market clout and membership in climate groups to pressure coal producers to cut output. TotalEnergies pauses major wind farm in the waters off New York and New JerseyAlso on November 27, French energy giant TotalEnergies announced that it was “pausing” its major Attentive Energy off-shore wind project in the Atlantic Ocean off New York and New Jersey. In his announcement of the “pause,” Total’s Chairman specifically attributed the action to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. From Offshore, November 27: TotalEnergies has reportedly paused development of the Attentive Energy wind farm it planned to build off the coast of New York and New Jersey, CEO Patrick Pouyanne said Tuesday at an energy industry conference in London. “I have decided to put the project on pause,” TotalEnergies’ CEO Patrick Pouyanne said at the Energy Intelligence Forum, according to reports from Bloomberg and Reuters. The decision is one of the first tangible signs of a halt in investment in renewable power sources due to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. Trump has vowed to stop offshore wind energy development “on day one” of his next term starting in January 2025. The new Trump administration is still almost a month away from taking office, but already the anticipation of its arrival is having the positive effect of driving some of the parasites into hiding. There are many more such positive developments out there. I’ll see if I can assemble a few more before year’s end. Meanwhile, I’m as hopeful as I’ve ever been that the green energy mania is fading.

In his announcement of the “pause,” Total’s Chairman specifically attributed the action to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. From Offshore, November 27: TotalEnergies has reportedly paused development of the Attentive Energy wind farm it planned to build off the coast of New York and New Jersey, CEO Patrick Pouyanne said Tuesday at an energy industry conference in London. “I have decided to put the project on pause,” TotalEnergies’ CEO Patrick Pouyanne said at the Energy Intelligence Forum, according to reports from Bloomberg and Reuters. The decision is one of the first tangible signs of a halt in investment in renewable power sources due to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. Trump has vowed to stop offshore wind energy development “on day one” of his next term starting in January 2025. The new Trump administration is still almost a month away from taking office, but already the anticipation of its arrival is having the positive effect of driving some of the parasites into hiding. There are many more such positive developments out there. I’ll see if I can assemble a few more before year’s end. Meanwhile, I’m as hopeful as I’ve ever been that the green energy mania is fading.

Title: More Reasons For Cautious Optimism About The Demise Of The Green Energy Fantasy

Skip to comments. Posted on 12/26/2024 5:13:04 AM PST by MtnClimber My post on Saturday noted one big reason for optimism that the green energy fantasy is coming to the end of its run: the first country, Germany, has apparently begun to hit the green energy “wall.” Although Germany has never consistently reached even 50% of its electricity production from wind and solar, its ability to continue its green energy dreams has stalled: its electricity prices have soared, its manufacturing sector has been seriously undermined, its economy is in recession, and recently its green-promoting government has fallen. Its failed example now stands for others to see and avoid. And as I look around at developments since the election, I see a number of other reasons to reinforce my cautious optimism. Maybe it’s that the political environment has changed, and maybe it’s that some people are starting to recognize that you can’t beat the laws of physics; and maybe it’s some of both. Here are examples: Banks and investment firms quitting net zero “alliances”On Saturday’s post, commenter William Bell asked “Who, exactly, is preventing third-world inhabitants from using wood, charcoal, coal, petroleum derivatives, and/or natural gas for fuel and by what means?” Apparently Mr. Bell, and maybe many others, is unaware of the many “alliances” of banks and investors seeking to starve fossil fuels of investment capital, and thus prevent third-world countries (and everybody else) from continuing to use them. Most of these groups are somehow directed and overseen by the UN. Examples of these groups include the Net Zero Banking Alliance (“Bank-led, UN-convened”), the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, and Climate Action 100+. I’m sure that I have not got them all. The members are, or have been, a who’s who of all the biggest banks and investment firms in the world. The Center Square reports here on December 20 that two rather significant banks, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo, have just quit the NZBA: Not soon after the general election, and within two weeks of each other, two major financial institutions have left a United Nations Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA). This is after they joined three years ago, pledging to require environmental social governance standards (ESG) across their platforms, products and systems. House Judiciary Committee issues report accusing large money managers of running a “climate cartel”On December 13, the House Judiciary Committee issued a Report titled “Sustainability Shakedown: How a Climate Cartel of Money Managers Colluded to Take Over the Board of America’s Largest Energy Company.” The Report documents the process by which the Climate Action 100+ alliance, “emboldened” by encouragement from the Biden/Harris administration, orchestrated replacement of three board members of Exxon in May 2021. The collusive actions of the largest investment firms and proxy advisors are described as a “cartel” clearly violative of the antitrust laws. Red state AGs sue investment firms for antitrust violations for colluding on “climate” issues Maybe it’s coincidence, but shortly before the issuance of the Judiciary Committee Report, an antitrust suit was brought on November 27 by eleven red state AGs, led by Ken Paxton of Texas, accusing participants in the investment industry of collusive conduct in enforcing “climate” and other “ESG” goals. The defendants in the case include the three largest money managers, Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street. From Bloomberg Law, November 27: BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. were sued by a group of states led by Texas for allegedly breaking antitrust law by boosting electricity prices through their investments, in the highest-profile lawsuit yet against the beleaguered ESG industry. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and 10 other states claim the money managers, as part of their green agenda, combined their market clout and membership in climate groups to pressure coal producers to cut output. TotalEnergies pauses major wind farm in the waters off New York and New JerseyAlso on November 27, French energy giant TotalEnergies announced that it was “pausing” its major Attentive Energy off-shore wind project in the Atlantic Ocean off New York and New Jersey. In his announcement of the “pause,” Total’s Chairman specifically attributed the action to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. From Offshore, November 27: TotalEnergies has reportedly paused development of the Attentive Energy wind farm it planned to build off the coast of New York and New Jersey, CEO Patrick Pouyanne said Tuesday at an energy industry conference in London. “I have decided to put the project on pause,” TotalEnergies’ CEO Patrick Pouyanne said at the Energy Intelligence Forum, according to reports from Bloomberg and Reuters. The decision is one of the first tangible signs of a halt in investment in renewable power sources due to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. Trump has vowed to stop offshore wind energy development “on day one” of his next term starting in January 2025. The new Trump administration is still almost a month away from taking office, but already the anticipation of its arrival is having the positive effect of driving some of the parasites into hiding. There are many more such positive developments out there. I’ll see if I can assemble a few more before year’s end. Meanwhile, I’m as hopeful as I’ve ever been that the green energy mania is fading.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Banks and investment firms quitting net zero “alliances”On Saturday’s post, commenter William Bell asked “Who, exactly, is preventing third-world inhabitants from using wood, charcoal, coal, petroleum derivatives, and/or natural gas for fuel and by what means?” Apparently Mr. Bell, and maybe many others, is unaware of the many “alliances” of banks and investors seeking to starve fossil fuels of investment capital, and thus prevent third-world countries (and everybody else) from continuing to use them. Most of these groups are somehow directed and overseen by the UN. Examples of these groups include the Net Zero Banking Alliance (“Bank-led, UN-convened”), the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, and Climate Action 100+. I’m sure that I have not got them all. The members are, or have been, a who’s who of all the biggest banks and investment firms in the world. The Center Square reports here on December 20 that two rather significant banks, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo, have just quit the NZBA: Not soon after the general election, and within two weeks of each other, two major financial institutions have left a United Nations Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA). This is after they joined three years ago, pledging to require environmental social governance standards (ESG) across their platforms, products and systems. House Judiciary Committee issues report accusing large money managers of running a “climate cartel”On December 13, the House Judiciary Committee issued a Report titled “Sustainability Shakedown: How a Climate Cartel of Money Managers Colluded to Take Over the Board of America’s Largest Energy Company.” The Report documents the process by which the Climate Action 100+ alliance, “emboldened” by encouragement from the Biden/Harris administration, orchestrated replacement of three board members of Exxon in May 2021. The collusive actions of the largest investment firms and proxy advisors are described as a “cartel” clearly violative of the antitrust laws. Red state AGs sue investment firms for antitrust violations for colluding on “climate” issues Maybe it’s coincidence, but shortly before the issuance of the Judiciary Committee Report, an antitrust suit was brought on November 27 by eleven red state AGs, led by Ken Paxton of Texas, accusing participants in the investment industry of collusive conduct in enforcing “climate” and other “ESG” goals. The defendants in the case include the three largest money managers, Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street. From Bloomberg Law, November 27: BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. were sued by a group of states led by Texas for allegedly breaking antitrust law by boosting electricity prices through their investments, in the highest-profile lawsuit yet against the beleaguered ESG industry. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and 10 other states claim the money managers, as part of their green agenda, combined their market clout and membership in climate groups to pressure coal producers to cut output. TotalEnergies pauses major wind farm in the waters off New York and New JerseyAlso on November 27, French energy giant TotalEnergies announced that it was “pausing” its major Attentive Energy off-shore wind project in the Atlantic Ocean off New York and New Jersey. In his announcement of the “pause,” Total’s Chairman specifically attributed the action to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. From Offshore, November 27: TotalEnergies has reportedly paused development of the Attentive Energy wind farm it planned to build off the coast of New York and New Jersey, CEO Patrick Pouyanne said Tuesday at an energy industry conference in London. “I have decided to put the project on pause,” TotalEnergies’ CEO Patrick Pouyanne said at the Energy Intelligence Forum, according to reports from Bloomberg and Reuters. The decision is one of the first tangible signs of a halt in investment in renewable power sources due to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. Trump has vowed to stop offshore wind energy development “on day one” of his next term starting in January 2025. The new Trump administration is still almost a month away from taking office, but already the anticipation of its arrival is having the positive effect of driving some of the parasites into hiding. There are many more such positive developments out there. I’ll see if I can assemble a few more before year’s end. Meanwhile, I’m as hopeful as I’ve ever been that the green energy mania is fading.

This is after they joined three years ago, pledging to require environmental social governance standards (ESG) across their platforms, products and systems. House Judiciary Committee issues report accusing large money managers of running a “climate cartel”On December 13, the House Judiciary Committee issued a Report titled “Sustainability Shakedown: How a Climate Cartel of Money Managers Colluded to Take Over the Board of America’s Largest Energy Company.” The Report documents the process by which the Climate Action 100+ alliance, “emboldened” by encouragement from the Biden/Harris administration, orchestrated replacement of three board members of Exxon in May 2021. The collusive actions of the largest investment firms and proxy advisors are described as a “cartel” clearly violative of the antitrust laws. Red state AGs sue investment firms for antitrust violations for colluding on “climate” issues Maybe it’s coincidence, but shortly before the issuance of the Judiciary Committee Report, an antitrust suit was brought on November 27 by eleven red state AGs, led by Ken Paxton of Texas, accusing participants in the investment industry of collusive conduct in enforcing “climate” and other “ESG” goals. The defendants in the case include the three largest money managers, Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street. From Bloomberg Law, November 27: BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. were sued by a group of states led by Texas for allegedly breaking antitrust law by boosting electricity prices through their investments, in the highest-profile lawsuit yet against the beleaguered ESG industry. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and 10 other states claim the money managers, as part of their green agenda, combined their market clout and membership in climate groups to pressure coal producers to cut output. TotalEnergies pauses major wind farm in the waters off New York and New JerseyAlso on November 27, French energy giant TotalEnergies announced that it was “pausing” its major Attentive Energy off-shore wind project in the Atlantic Ocean off New York and New Jersey. In his announcement of the “pause,” Total’s Chairman specifically attributed the action to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. From Offshore, November 27: TotalEnergies has reportedly paused development of the Attentive Energy wind farm it planned to build off the coast of New York and New Jersey, CEO Patrick Pouyanne said Tuesday at an energy industry conference in London. “I have decided to put the project on pause,” TotalEnergies’ CEO Patrick Pouyanne said at the Energy Intelligence Forum, according to reports from Bloomberg and Reuters. The decision is one of the first tangible signs of a halt in investment in renewable power sources due to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. Trump has vowed to stop offshore wind energy development “on day one” of his next term starting in January 2025. The new Trump administration is still almost a month away from taking office, but already the anticipation of its arrival is having the positive effect of driving some of the parasites into hiding. There are many more such positive developments out there. I’ll see if I can assemble a few more before year’s end. Meanwhile, I’m as hopeful as I’ve ever been that the green energy mania is fading.

The collusive actions of the largest investment firms and proxy advisors are described as a “cartel” clearly violative of the antitrust laws. Red state AGs sue investment firms for antitrust violations for colluding on “climate” issues Maybe it’s coincidence, but shortly before the issuance of the Judiciary Committee Report, an antitrust suit was brought on November 27 by eleven red state AGs, led by Ken Paxton of Texas, accusing participants in the investment industry of collusive conduct in enforcing “climate” and other “ESG” goals. The defendants in the case include the three largest money managers, Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street. From Bloomberg Law, November 27: BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. were sued by a group of states led by Texas for allegedly breaking antitrust law by boosting electricity prices through their investments, in the highest-profile lawsuit yet against the beleaguered ESG industry. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and 10 other states claim the money managers, as part of their green agenda, combined their market clout and membership in climate groups to pressure coal producers to cut output. TotalEnergies pauses major wind farm in the waters off New York and New JerseyAlso on November 27, French energy giant TotalEnergies announced that it was “pausing” its major Attentive Energy off-shore wind project in the Atlantic Ocean off New York and New Jersey. In his announcement of the “pause,” Total’s Chairman specifically attributed the action to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. From Offshore, November 27: TotalEnergies has reportedly paused development of the Attentive Energy wind farm it planned to build off the coast of New York and New Jersey, CEO Patrick Pouyanne said Tuesday at an energy industry conference in London. “I have decided to put the project on pause,” TotalEnergies’ CEO Patrick Pouyanne said at the Energy Intelligence Forum, according to reports from Bloomberg and Reuters. The decision is one of the first tangible signs of a halt in investment in renewable power sources due to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. Trump has vowed to stop offshore wind energy development “on day one” of his next term starting in January 2025. The new Trump administration is still almost a month away from taking office, but already the anticipation of its arrival is having the positive effect of driving some of the parasites into hiding. There are many more such positive developments out there. I’ll see if I can assemble a few more before year’s end. Meanwhile, I’m as hopeful as I’ve ever been that the green energy mania is fading.

TotalEnergies pauses major wind farm in the waters off New York and New JerseyAlso on November 27, French energy giant TotalEnergies announced that it was “pausing” its major Attentive Energy off-shore wind project in the Atlantic Ocean off New York and New Jersey. In his announcement of the “pause,” Total’s Chairman specifically attributed the action to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. From Offshore, November 27: TotalEnergies has reportedly paused development of the Attentive Energy wind farm it planned to build off the coast of New York and New Jersey, CEO Patrick Pouyanne said Tuesday at an energy industry conference in London. “I have decided to put the project on pause,” TotalEnergies’ CEO Patrick Pouyanne said at the Energy Intelligence Forum, according to reports from Bloomberg and Reuters. The decision is one of the first tangible signs of a halt in investment in renewable power sources due to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. Trump has vowed to stop offshore wind energy development “on day one” of his next term starting in January 2025. The new Trump administration is still almost a month away from taking office, but already the anticipation of its arrival is having the positive effect of driving some of the parasites into hiding. There are many more such positive developments out there. I’ll see if I can assemble a few more before year’s end. Meanwhile, I’m as hopeful as I’ve ever been that the green energy mania is fading.

Simple answer - state’s rights. The Constitution does not state nor imply that FedGov has such a power so it becomes a choice for each individual state. The much abused Interstate Commerce clause/act might be used to apply pressure to CA into stopping this insanity but the court battles will take a long time. Interestingly the hard left will find themselves in a quandary which will once again put their hipocrisy on display. They lust for unlimited FedGov power but since CA is doing something they want (ban ICE usage) they must support CA’s authority to invoke the ban. States dating back to English kings like New York have power that is only limited by their constitution and the federal Constitution. I believe federally created states like California should have no more than necessary and proper power, but I don’t sit on the Supreme Court. California owns most of its roads, so only what it approves can run on them. “Germany can’t build new nuclear power plants” Nuclear powerplants can be built on ships. The US Navy provides proof. Green energy cannot exist without massive government subsidies and green energy hucksters have become very adept at getting federal dollars selling their snake oil solutions to the “climate crisis”. The corn ethanol boondoggle is probably the most successful of these scams and has many corn state members of Congress in their pocket. Ironically the corn ethanol boondoggle is now shown to be a major producer of the dreaded CO2, but fear not another climate scam is proposing a pipeline across Iowa and the Dakotas to transport the dreaded CO2 so it can safely be disposed by injecting it deep underground in North Dakota. There is a sucker born every minute and most suckers reside in Washington, DC.

Title: How Stocks Perform After Nasdaq-100 Rebalancing

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. It’s that time of year again — the annual rebalancing of the Nasdaq-100 Index (NDX). The NDX represents the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. On Monday, three new companies were added to the index, and three others were removed. When a stock is included in a widely followed index, it often generates demand from exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and index funds, while removal typically leads to selling pressure. These changes were announced about a couple weeks ago, meaning much of the buying and selling has already occurred. This week, I’m examining what happens once these stocks begin trading in the index. One theory is that the announcement of additions and removals can shift sentiment, and if the initial buying or selling overshoots, it can create opportunities going forward. Before diving into the historical data, the tables below show the stocks that were added as well as those removed. Goin back to 2010, I tracked 80 stocks added to the NDX and 73 removed. We don’t have data on some of the stocks that aren’t trading anymore. I am also only considering stocks added and removed in December during the rebalancing. I will not be considering stocks eliminated and added mid-year due to bankruptcy, mergers, etc. The tables below summarize the returns of the stocks added and removed since 2010. The stocks that were removed performed better than those added. Stocks added to the index in December averaged a return of 3.81% over the next three months, compared to a 7.27% gain for those removed. Over the next three months, less than half the stocks added beat NDX, but 56% of those removed beat the NDX. One year later, the stocks added to the index averaged a gain of about 12%, with 40% of the stocks beating the overall index. Those figures underperform compared to stocks removed from the index, which averaged a pop of 18% over the next year, with 52% of those stocks beating the NDX. Based on these numbers, there could be merit to the theory that sentiment tends to get too bullish for those added, and too bearish for those removed. Next, I incorporated analyst ratings to identify stocks with extreme sentiment. Stocks added to the index are prone to excessive bullish sentiment. Using my historical data, I focused on stocks added that had at least 80% of analysts recommending a "buy" on the day they were added. This may be an indicator of sentiment being too bullish. Conversely, stocks removed from the index can attract excessive bearish sentiment. I analyzed stocks removed with 20% or fewer firms sporting a "buy" rating. If this theory holds, stocks added with bullish sentiment may underperform, while those removed with bearish sentiment may outperform. The numbers in the table below suggest there’s merit to the theory. For those one-year returns, stocks removed where 20% or fewer firms had a "buy" rating averaged a gain of 34% in the next year, with 58% of stocks beating the index. This means it may be worth considering Moderna (MRNA) and Super Micro Computer (SMCI) as potential stocks to buy. The data below also suggests avoiding stocks that were added that have at least 80% of analysts calling it a "buy." In the next year, these stocks gained less than 5% on average, with just 22% of them beating the NDX. Axon Enterprise (AXON) stock was added to the index this year, and all 15 firms call it a "buy." Our data suggests it has an increased chance of underperforming moving forward. MicroStrategy (MSTR) doesn’t meet the criteria of the study, because I only considered stocks with at least 10 brokerages in coverage. However, all eight analysts suggest buying SMCI, so I wouldn’t be surprised if it underperforms going forward. Sign in to access your portfolio

Oracle's co-founder has gained roughly $75 billion in paper wealth as the software company he started in 1979 enjoyed its biggest stock rally since 1999 and the dot-com boom. While the S&P 500 index has gained 27% in 2024, Oracle shares have shot up 63%, lifting Ellison's net worth to more than $217 billion, according to Forbes, behind only Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos among the world's richest people. At 80, Ellison is a senior citizen in the tech industry, where his fellow billionaire founders are generally decades younger. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, whose net worth has also ballooned past $200 billion, is half his age. But Ellison has found the fountain of youth both personally and professionally. After being divorced several times, Ellison was reported this month to be involved with a 33-year-old woman. And at a meeting with analysts in Las Vegas in September, Ellison was as engaged as ever, mentioning offhand that the night before, he and his son were having dinner with his good friend Musk, who's advising President-elect Donald Trump (then the Republican nominee) while running Tesla and his other ventures. His big financial boon has come from Oracle, which has maneuvered its way into the artificial intelligence craze with its cloud infrastructure technology and has made its databases more accessible. ChatGPT creator OpenAI said in June that it will use Oracle's cloud infrastructure. Earlier this month, Oracle said it had also picked up business from Meta. Startups, which often opt for market leader Amazon Web Services when picking a cloud, have been engaging Oracle as well. Last year, video generation startup Genmo set up a system to train an AI model with Nvidia graphics processing units, or GPUs, in Oracle's cloud, CEO Paras Jain said. Genmo now relies on the Oracle cloud to produce videos based on the prompts that users type in on its website. "Oracle produced a different product than what you can get elsewhere with GPU computing," Jain said. The company offers "bare metal" computers that can sometimes yield better performance than architectures that employ server virtualization, he said. In its latest earnings report earlier this month, Oracle came up short of analysts' estimates and issued a forecast that was also weaker than Wall Street was expecting. The next day, the stock fell 7% in the worst performance of the year, eating into the gains for 2024. Still, Ellison was bullish for the future. "Oracle Cloud Infrastructure trains several of the world's most important generative AI models because we are faster and less expensive than other clouds," Ellison said in the earnings release. For the current fiscal year, which ends in May, Oracle is expected to record revenue growth of about 10%, which would mark its second-strongest year of expansion since 2011. Jain said that when Genmo has challenges, he communicates with Oracle sales executives and engineers through a Slack channel. The collaboration has resulted in better reliability and performance, he said. Jain said Oracle worked with Genmo to ensure that developers could launch the startup's Mochi open-source video generator on Oracle's cloud hardware with a single click. "Oracle was also more price-competitive than these large hyperscalers," Jain said. Three months before its December earnings report, at the analyst event in Las Vegas, Oracle had given a rosy outlook for the next three years. Executive Vice President Doug Kehring declared that the company would produce more than $66 billion in revenue in the 2026 fiscal year, and over $104 billion in fiscal 2029. The numbers suggested acceleration, with a compound annual growth rate of over 16%, compared with 9% in the latest quarter. After Kehring and CEO Safra Catz spoke, it was Ellison's turn. The company's chairman, technology chief and top shareholder strutted onto the stage in a black sweater and jeans, waved to the analysts, licked his lips and sat down. For the next 74 minutes, he answered questions from seven analysts. "Did — did he say $104 billion?" Ellison said, referring to Kehring's projection. Some in the crowd giggled. "That's going to be so easy. It is kind of crazy." Oracle's revenue in fiscal 2023 was just shy of $50 billion. The new target impressed Eric Lynch, managing director of Scharf Investments, which held $167 million in Oracle shares at the end of September. "For a company doing single digits for a decade or so, that's unbelievable," Lynch told CNBC in an interview. Oracle is still far behind in cloud infrastructure. In 2023, Amazon controlled 39% of the market, followed by Microsoft at 23% and Google at 8.2%, according to industry researcher Gartner. That left Oracle with 1.4%. But in database software, Oracle remains a stalwart. Gartner estimated that the company had 17% market share in database management systems in 2023. Ellison's challenge is to find opportunities for expansion. Last year, he visited Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington, for the first time to announce a partnership that would enable organizations to use Oracle's database through Microsoft's Azure cloud. Microsoft even installed Oracle hardware in its data centers. In June, Oracle rolled out a similar announcement with Google. Then, in September, Oracle finally partnered with Amazon, introducing its database on AWS. Oracle and Amazon had exchanged barbs for years. AWS introduced a database called Aurora in 2014, and Amazon worked hard to move itself off Oracle. Following a CNBC report on the effort, Ellison expressed doubt about Amazon's ability to reach its goal. But the project succeeded. In 2019, Amazon published a blog post titled, "Migration Complete – Amazon's Consumer Business Just Turned off its Final Oracle Database." Ellison looked back on the history between the two companies at the analyst meeting in September. "I got kind of got cute commenting about Amazon uses Oracle, doesn't use AWS, blah, blah," he said. "And that hurt some people's feelings. I probably shouldn't have said it." He said a friend at a major New York bank had asked him to make sure the Oracle database works on AWS. "I said, 'Great. It makes sense to me,'" Ellison said. The multi-cloud strategy should deliver gains in database market share, said analyst Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho, which has the equivalent of a buy rating on Oracle shares. Cloud deals related to AI will also help Oracle deliver on its promise for faster revenue growth, he said. "Oracle right now has an end-to-end stack for enterprises to build their AI strategy," said Panigrahi, who worked on applications at Oracle in the 2000s. So far, Oracle has been mainly cutting high-value AI deals with the likes of OpenAI and Musk's X.ai. Of Oracle's $97 billion in remaining performance obligations, or revenue that hasn't yet been recognized, 40% or 50% of it is tied to renting out GPUs, Panigrahi said. Oracle didn't respond to a request for comment. Panigrahi predicts that a wider swath of enterprises will begin adopting AI, which will be a boon to Oracle given its hundreds of thousands of big customers. There's also promise in Oracle Health, the segment that came out of the company's $28.2 billion acquisition of electronic health record software vendor Cerner in 2022. Unlike rival Epic, Oracle Health lost U.S. market share in 2023, according to estimates from KLAS Research. But Ellison's connection to Musk, who is set to co-lead Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, might benefit Oracle Health "if there is a bigger push towards modernizing existing healthcare systems," analysts at Evercore said in a note last week. They recommend buying the stock. For now, Oracle is busy using AI to rewrite Cerner's entire code base, Ellison said at the analyst event. "This is another pillar for growth," he said. "I think you haven't quite seen it yet." Hours earlier, Ellison had put in a call to Marc Benioff, co-founder and CEO of Salesforce. Benioff knows Ellison as well as anyone, having worked for him for 13 years before starting the cloud software company that's now a big competitor. "It was awesome," Benioff said in a wide-ranging interview the next day, regarding his chat with Ellison. Benioff spoke about his former boss's latest run of fortune. "Larry really deeply wants this," Benioff said. "This is very important to him, that he is building a great company, what he believes is one of the most important companies in the world, and also, wealth is very important to him."

Title: Integrating Tokenization With Traditional Fund Management Practices
URL: https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesfinancecouncil/2024/12/26/integrating-tokenization-with-traditional-fund-management-practices/
Time Published: 2024-12-26T12:00:00Z
Full Content:
Matt Ong is CEO of B2B Alternative Asset Solutions provider Ctrl Alt. How important is tokenization? Let’s start with a back-to-basics on what tokenization is. At its core, tokenization is the process of converting the rights of an asset into a digital token on a blockchain. In simpler terms, it’s about transferring assets into a digital representation (i.e., “digital assets”) that can be easily and securely traded, shared or owned in fractional portions on a digital platform. From real estate to hedge funds, tokenization can, in theory, transform the ownership rights of an asset (physical or virtual) into a digital token. It’s a process that’s gaining a lot of traction in the investment space. Reuters reports that in 2018, the global market cap of tokenized assets was $1.5 billion. Today, this figure has grown to $120 billion, with an estimated $16 trillion market cap by 2030. A survey from Nickel Digital Asset Management showed that 75% of wealth managers and institutional investors predict increased adoption of tokenization for investment funds over the next five years, with 14% forecasting dramatic growth. BNY Mellon’s research indicates that 97% of institutional investors believe tokenization will revolutionize asset management. It’s a sentiment echoed by major investment firms like BlackRock, which has already launched a tokenized asset fund on the Ethereum network. Research from EY suggests that asset managers see tokenization as a way to access new market segments and clients, increase market share and mitigate risks through product diversification. There is no doubt that there is traction. Today, we’re going to look specifically at the role of tokenization regarding the future of fund management. We’ll be exploring the key benefits that tokenization can bring to the industry and look to the U.K., where the government is engaging to support advancement. The U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) noted that although there is no formal definition of “fund tokenization,” it fundamentally means the process of converting an investor’s share or unit in a collective investment scheme into a digital token, recorded on a blockchain that supports smart contracts. It’s this process of tokenization that streamlines fund management processes by using blockchain technology. Blockchain technology facilitates automated transactions, reduces paperwork and ensures transparent recordkeeping. By creating tokenized versions of existing funds or launching new, natively tokenized funds, asset managers can seriously reduce administrative burdens. Automated smart contracts handle subscriptions, redemptions and distributions, massively reducing or even eliminating the need for manual intervention. Taken together, it means fund managers can save time and costs. Having worked at large financial institutions including Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, I’ve seen firsthand the need for innovation and engagement to open up traditional financial practices. Fast forward to now running my own business, where we’re seeing an increase in institutions looking to utilize the benefits of tokenization across various sectors of their business. The finance sector must adapt to our increasingly digitized world. Between blockchain technology integration and the growth of digital transactions and currencies, the landscape is ripe for tokenized assets—and fund management is a prime example of an industry benefiting from this. Another potential advantage of tokenization regarding benefiting funds is its ability to improve liquidity. Tokenized assets can potentially be traded 24/7 on global platforms, giving you continuous access and liquidity. This not only benefits investors but also provides fund managers with more dynamic and flexible fund structures, a core competency for attracting diverse investors and optimizing portfolio performance. With tokenization, there can be regulatory ambiguity across regions, which calls for more clarity from the government and other official bodies. Tokenization is one of the most prominent use cases of blockchain, but the speed of adoption here has been limited in part due to legal and regulatory uncertainty. Integrations with traditional financial infrastructure are not straightforward, as they must adhere to existing legal frameworks and corresponding regulations. Over the last few years, governments, regulators and industry organizations have sought to address this uncertainty to foster innovation, which is evident in the U.K.’s engagement as per below. The streamlining benefits are recognized across the board, including by the U.K. government’s Technology Working Group, which earlier this year issued its second report encouraging collaboration on innovation regarding tokenization capabilities. This advancement builds on the first report issued by the group in November 2023, which called for regulatory clarity. It’s a significant move toward what’s termed “Investment Fund 3.0,” aiming to transform the sector’s efficiency, transparency and competitive edge. The second report focuses on two industry use cases to test: fully on-chain investment markets, with tokenized funds investing in tokenized securities such as in the fixed income or other asset classes; and the use of tokenized money market fund units as collateral, where eligible, under the U.K. regime for non-centrally cleared derivative contracts. The report is a positive step forward in the integration of new technologies in the U.K. financial services sector. There is no doubt that tokenization will play a key role in the future of financial services, especially in fund management. Engagement from government to large institutions shows just how fast this sector is moving. At my company, we’re pleased to be playing a role in this rise, especially via our expertise in the tokenization of both new and existing funds.

Full Content:
December 26, 2024 06:55 ET | Source: YieldMax YieldMax CHICAGO and MILWAUKEE and NEW YORK, Dec. 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- YieldMax™ today announced distributions for the YieldMax™ ETFs listed in the table below. Note: DIPS, FIAT, CRSH and YQQQ are hereinafter referred to as the “Short ETFs”. You are not guaranteed a distribution under the ETFs. Distributions for the ETFs (if any) are variable and may vary significantly from period to period and may be zero. Investors in the Funds will not have rights to receive dividends or other distributions with respect to the underlying reference asset(s). * The inception date for FEAT and FIVY is December 16, 2024. Each Fund has a limited operating history and while each Fund's objective is to provide current income, there is no guarantee the Fund will make a distribution. Distributions are likely to vary greatly in amount. Important Information Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. For a prospectus or summary prospectus with this and other information about each Fund, visit our website at www.YieldMaxETFs.com. Read the prospectus or summary prospectus carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any Fund’s investment strategy will be properly implemented, and an investor may lose some or all of its investment in any such Fund. Tidal Financial Group is the adviser for all YieldMax™ ETFs. ZEGA Financial is the sub-adviser for all YieldMax™ ETFs other than FEAT and FIVY. THE FUND, TRUST, AND SUB-ADVISER ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY UNDERLYING REFERENCE ASSET. Risk Disclosures (applicable to all YieldMax ETFs referenced above, except the Short ETFs) YMAX, YMAG, FEAT and FIVY generally invest in other YieldMax™ ETFs. As such, these two Funds are subject to the risks listed in this section, which apply to all the YieldMax™ ETFs they may hold from time to time. Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Call Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s call writing strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in the positive price returns of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold call options and over longer periods. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared derivatives”). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund’s counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. A high portfolio turnover rate increases transaction costs, which may increase the Fund’s expenses. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of call option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in increases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Call Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security (ARKK, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, NFLX, COIN, MSFT, DIS, XOM, JPM, AMD, PYPL, SQ, MRNA, AI, MSTR, Bitcoin ETP, GDX®, SNOW, ABNB, BABA, TSM, SMCI, PLTR, MARA), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosure (applicable only to MARO) Digital Assets Risk: The Fund does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than the Fund. Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to BABO and TSMY) Currency Risk: Indirect exposure to foreign currencies subjects the Fund to the risk that currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar. Currency rates in foreign countries may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for a number of reasons, including changes in interest rates and the imposition of currency controls or other political developments in the U.S. or abroad. Depositary Receipts Risk: The securities underlying BABO and TSMY are American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”). Investment in ADRs may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market. Foreign Market and Trading Risk: The trading markets for many foreign securities are not as active as U.S. markets and may have less governmental regulation and oversight. Foreign Securities Risk: Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks that may not be present with investments in securities of U.S. issuers, such as risk of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations or to political or economic instability, as well as varying regulatory requirements applicable to investments in non-U.S. issuers. There may be less information publicly available about a non-U.S. issuer than a U.S. issuer. Non-U.S. issuers may also be subject to different regulatory, accounting, auditing, financial reporting and investor protection standards than U.S. issuers. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to GDXY) Risk of Investing in Foreign Securities. The Fund is exposed indirectly to the securities of foreign issuers selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. Investments in the securities of foreign issuers involve risks beyond those associated with investments in U.S. securities. Risk of Investing in Gold and Silver Mining Companies. The Fund is exposed indirectly to gold and silver mining companies selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. The Fund invests in options contracts based on the value of the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX®), which subjects the Fund to some of the same risks as if it owned GDX®, as well as the risks associated with Canadian, Australian and Emerging Market Issuers, and Small-and Medium-Capitalization companies. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YBIT) YBIT does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than YBIT. Bitcoin Investment Risk: The Fund’s indirect investment in Bitcoin, through holdings in one or more Underlying ETPs, exposes it to the unique risks of this emerging innovation. Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile, and its market is influenced by the changing Bitcoin network, fluctuating acceptance levels, and unpredictable usage trends. Digital Assets Risk: Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Potentially No 1940 Act Protections. As of the date of this Prospectus, there is only a single eligible Underlying ETP, and it is an investment company subject to the 1940 Act. Bitcoin ETP Risk: The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Bitcoin ETP. This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of the Bitcoin ETP, even though it does not. Bitcoin ETPs are subject, but not limited, to significant risk and heightened volatility. An investor in a Bitcoin ETP may lose their entire investment. Bitcoin ETPs are not suitable for all investors. In addition, not all Bitcoin ETPs are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Those Bitcoin ETPs that are not registered under such statute are therefore not subject to the same regulations as exchange traded products that are so registered. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to the Short ETFs) Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Price Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the value of the underlying reference asset. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the underlying reference asset, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, the Fund is subject to the risk that the value of the underlying reference asset increases. If the value of the underlying reference asset increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. Put Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s put writing (selling) strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in decreases in the value of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold put options and over longer periods. Purchased OTM Call Options Risk. The Fund’s strategy is subject to potential losses if the underlying reference asset increases in value, which may not be offset by the purchase of out-of-the-money (OTM) call options. The Fund purchases OTM calls to seek to manage (cap) the Fund’s potential losses from the Fund’s short exposure to the underlying reference asset if it appreciates significantly in value. However, the OTM call options will cap the Fund’s losses only to the extent that the value of the underlying reference asset increases to a level that is at or above the strike level of the purchased OTM call options. Any increase in the value of the underlying reference asset to a level that is below the strike level of the purchased OTM call options will result in a corresponding loss for the Fund. For example, if the OTM call options have a strike level that is approximately 100% above the then-current value of the underlying reference asset at the time of the call option purchase, and the value of the underlying reference asset increases by at least 100% during the term of the purchased OTM call options, the Fund will lose all its value. Since the Fund bears the costs of purchasing the OTM calls, such costs will decrease the Fund’s value and/or any income otherwise generated by the Fund’s investment strategy. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared ("cleared derivatives"). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund's counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house ("clearing members") can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in decreases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Put Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, for any Fund that focuses on an individual security (e.g., TSLA, COIN, NVDA), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YQQQ) Index Overview. The Nasdaq 100 Index is a benchmark index that includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, based on market capitalization. Index Level Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the Index level. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the Index, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the Index level, the Fund is subject to the risk that the Index level increases. If the Index level increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. The Fund may also be subject to the following risks: innovation and technological advancement; strong market presence of Index constituent companies; adaptability to global market trends; and resilience and recovery potential. Index Level Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will benefit from decreases in the Index level experienced over the Put Period. This means that if the Index level experiences a decrease in value below the strike level of the sold put options during a Put Period, the Fund will likely not experience that increase to the same extent and any Fund gains may significantly differ from the level of the Index losses over the Put Period. Additionally, because the Fund is limited in the degree to which it will participate in decreases in value experienced by the Index level over each Put Period, but has significant negative exposure to any increases in value experienced by the Index level over the Put Period, the NAV of the Fund may decrease over any given period. The Fund’s NAV is dependent on the value of each options portfolio, which is based principally upon the inverse of the performance of the Index level. The Fund’s ability to benefit from the Index level decreases will depend on prevailing market conditions, especially market volatility, at the time the Fund enters into the sold put option contracts and will vary from Put Period to Put Period. The value of the options contracts is affected by changes in the value and dividend rates of component companies that comprise the Index, changes in interest rates, changes in the actual or perceived volatility of the Index and the remaining time to the options’ expiration, as well as trading conditions in the options market. As the Index level changes and time moves towards the expiration of each Put Period, the value of the options contracts, and therefore the Fund’s NAV, will change. However, it is not expected for the Fund’s NAV to directly inversely correlate on a day-to-day basis with the returns of the Index level. The amount of time remaining until the options contract’s expiration date affects the impact that the value of the options contracts has on the Fund’s NAV, which may not be in full effect until the expiration date of the Fund’s options contracts. Therefore, while changes in the Index level will result in changes to the Fund’s NAV, the Fund generally anticipates that the rate of change in the Fund’s NAV will be different than the inverse of the changes experienced by the Index level.

Title: How Consumers Can Prepare For Trump's New Tariffs
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/dearbeawalker/2024/12/26/how-consumers-can-prepare-for-trumps-new-tariffs/
Time Published: 2024-12-26T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
Donald Trump is threatening tariffs on all imports from Mexico, Canada and China. This will impact the price of everything from washing machines to garlic. Here’s how you can prepare. Weekly grocery bills are likely to get more expensive if President-elect Donald Trump follows through in imposing tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada and China. Everything from avocados to garlic will go up. That new car you’re eyeing—or even your next grocery run—could cost more after President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20. Trump plans to sign an Executive Order on day one that would impose 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, and threatens additional tariffs on products from China and elsewhere. Trump said that tariffs will “make our country rich,” because the U.S. “right now loses to everybody.” Specifically, Trump has said he'll boost tariffs to 60% or more on goods from China. “The prospect of a trade war looms large, not just between the U.S. and China but beyond,” Forbes markets contributor Courtney Fingar writes. Here’s what these proposed tariffs are designed to do and what they could mean for American consumers, who should be prepared for potential price hikes. A tariff is a tax on imported goods that companies pay to the government when they import products to the U.S., and that tax is usually passed on to the consumer in the form of higher prices. “That extra cost has to get covered one way or another, either by coming out of the importing company’s margins or by being passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices,” Forbes contributor Joe Moglia says. “If the tariffs are too high, there may be no choice other than raising prices.” The purpose of tariffs is to raise the price of foreign-produced goods, prompting consumers to purchase less-expensive domestic goods and services. Tariffs are not new for Americans. The U.S. has long used them as a tool to regulate trade with import duties that vary by product and trading partner. Ultimately, tariffs aim to protect U.S. industries from foreign competitors and raise revenue for the government. A 20% universal tariff could raise $3.3 trillion for the government from 2025 to 2034, according to the Tax Foundation. This is before factoring in the effects on the economy and any retaliatory actions by trade partners, including other countries and trade blocs like the EU. Experts believe Trump's tariffs threat is a negotiating tool to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. Trump's rationale for his proposed tariffs includes restoring manufacturing jobs in the U.S. and, some experts say, using tariffs as a trade negotiating tool. In addition to the economic motivations, Trump cites security: He has insisted that Mexico and Canada stem the flow of illegal drugs and migrants over the border. “Financial markets have not reacted thus far, because many investors view the threats as a bargaining ploy on Trump’s part,” Forbes contributor Nick Sargen writes. Here’s what Trump has proposed: Tariffs on raw materials like steel or aluminum could send the prices of cellphones and laptops through the roof, according to True Tamplin, a Forbes personal finance contributor. “For example, a 10% ad valorem tariff on a $1,000 laptop would add $100 to its price,” Tamplin writes. Your occasional Modelo or Corona beer, brewed in Mexico, could also go up, Kate Benot, the lead analyst at Sightlines told Forbes spirits contributor Don Tse. “Indirectly, they’re also likely to raise the price of beer in aggregate, even beer that’s made in the U.S. or countries not subject to tariffs,” Bernot told Tse. “If the most popular beers in the country are suddenly more expensive, it gives other producers license to increase prices as well.” Bernot said. Other goods that could become more expensive: “Industries with lots of exposure to imported goods—retail, electronics and even agriculture—could face significant headwinds,” Forbes markets contributor, Frank Holmes writes. The roots of a potential trade war go back to Trump’s first term. A report at the time showed that the U.S. was experiencing job cuts in manufacturing starting in 2001 while China was engaged in unfair trade practices, running large trade surpluses with the U.S. The U.S. also accused China of intellectual property theft —a growing risk to national security. “Over the next year and a half, the U.S. phased in tariffs on imports from China that eventually accounted for about one-half of the goods it shipped to the U.S.,” Sargen, a financial markets contributor, says. Prices rose 12% on products like washing machines and dryers, a 2019 study by the Federal Reserve Board and the University of Chicago found. And U.S. companies lost at least $1.7 trillion in market cap, according to a 2020 study by Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Columbia University. “The tariffs had an impact on U.S. company stock values because, it turns out, tariff increases are a form of industrial policy that lose money for U.S. companies and investors,” Forbes leadership contributor, Stuart Anderson wrote at the time. China and India notably retaliated against Trump’s tariffs on aluminum and steel imports in 2018, but experts believe Trump’s new tariffs could have an even more significant impact, Sargen says. China has passed laws since 2018 to better respond to U.S. tariffs and President Biden has not only kept Trump’s tariffs in place, but he has imposed additional tariffs on China. Many investors believe Trump’s tariff threat is just that Sargen says: a negotiating tactic. While tariffs can be effective in negotiations, they do risk counter-measures from the exporting country, potentially leading to job losses, price hikes and higher cost of living at home, Sargen writes. However, it’s likely that the price increases will but will not be ongoing. “Price changes that result from tariffs typically occur all at once,” Bill Conerly, Forbes leadership contributor writes. There’s also the risk of the spillover effect. Retailers importing the goods will increase the price to absorb the cost of the tariff, however, domestic producers, who aren’t impacted by the tariffs, will feel emboldened and may raise their prices too. We saw this during Trump’s first term when the price of both washers and dryers rose 12%. Washers were subjected to the tariffs, dryers were not. It’s likely that prices will go up for everyone — consumers and retailers — but it’s not guaranteed. Global retailers like Macy’s or Kroger will have to diversify sourcing options and strengthen supplier relationships through long-term contracts if they want to stay competitive in the tariff-entrenched market, Forbes retail contributor Shelley E. Kohan writes. On the other hand, vendors on sites like Amazon, Etsy and Temu have more options. As Forbes retail contributor Kiri Masters writes, the de minimis law allows direct-to-consumer platforms like Temu to potentially avoid tariffs on individual shipments up to $800 per day, while traditional retailers and sellers importing in bulk would face the full impact. The Wall Street Journal reported that retailers have already begun buying in bulk, which Kohan warns can be a huge gamble. “While some retailers have made commitments to advance the purchasing of goods from overseas sources, this can be a large outlay of capital that may not turn into planned margins but instead may lead to overstocks or excessive markdowns,” Kohan says. However, there are retailers that are looking to take advantage of other retailers' panic buying. Retailers with a secondary-brand purchase business model like TJX, the parent company of TJ Maxx and Marshalls, are looking at the tariffs as an opportunity. The company's CEO, Ernie Herrman, said during a recent earnings call that the company is hoping manufacturers will stock up ahead of the tariffs, creating a surplus of goods and lower prices. TJX purchases goods after they’ve reached the U.S., allowing it to mark down prices 20 to 60%. As you prepare for a potentially higher grocery bill and an overall higher cost of living, Forbes contributor Taylor Bauldwin suggests that you look to discount or bulk retailers, like Costco and Sam’s Club. They could be great options for groceries, appliances and electronics. Local farmer markets in some areas could also be an option for groceries. There's a caveat: As demand increases for local and seasonal shops, it could drive up those prices, too. “The rising cost of produce due to tariffs underscores how global policies can directly impact everyday expenses for consumers,” Bauldwin writes.

Title: Inside the rise of Wall Street's distinguished engineers and technical fellows
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-rise-wall-street-tech-fellows-distinguished-engineers-2024-12
Time Published: 2024-12-26T10:00:02Z
Full Content:
Every two years, a selective group of Morgan Stanley's elite technologists open their ranks to welcome a new crop of distinguished engineers. This month the distinguished engineers selected their 19 newest members after a rigorous half-a-year vetting process. The group, now made up of 78 employees from across the firm, represents the top 0.3% of technologists at Morgan Stanley. "Anywhere we're making those core decisions at the center of tech, you can almost guarantee that all or some portion of the DEs are involved in those decision processes," Michael Pizzi, Morgan Stanley's head of US banks and head of technology, told Business Insider. Goldman Sachs, meanwhile, last month announced its class of 111 technical fellows, representing the top 3% of engineers at the bank. They specialize in specific domains and are often tapped to work on some of the firm's trickiest technical issues. John Madsen, Goldman's chief technology officer, remembers assembling an A-team of about 10 technical fellows a few years ago to upgrade an important system that was about to max out on its capacity, he said, declining to specify which business the system supported. "These kinds of moments often go unnoticed by the bulk of the firm, but they highlight the exact value this community brings to Goldman Sachs," Madsen told BI. At JPMorgan, distinguished engineers represent the highest level of engineer and include Marco Pistoia, who leads applied research on cutting-edge technologies like quantum computing, and William Patrick Opet, the bank's global chief information security officer. The technical distinction is picking up traction outside of banking. Ken Griffin's market maker, Citadel Securities, hired its first technical fellow this year, and BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, introduced its inaugural class in 2021. While it's usually the rainmakers, investors, and traders who take the spotlight on Wall Street, a growing group of technologists' influence is taking center stage as tech is increasingly viewed as a competitive advantage. Call them distinguished engineers or technical fellows (depending on the firm), they're the people bank leaders go to with their thorniest and most challenging technical problems. They also help effect and execute the longer-term firmwide tech strategy set out by C-suites. For many engineers the role is a dream — and one of the highest technical designations in the business. BI spoke with some of the newly minted distinguished engineers, a longtime tech fellow, and the executives running these programs to find out what they do and how they influence the wider tech strategy and to get an inside look at the vetting process. Some of the first tech fellows on Wall Street were at Goldman Sachs, whose program dates back to 2004. Miruna Stratan remembers the call when she was told she had made it. "I remember I wanted it more than anything," Stratan told BI. Now she's a top tech exec within Goldman's lucrative investment-banking division and one of just four partner-level tech fellows at the firm. The distinction is highly sought after by Goldman's technical population, she said, and the bank even hosts presentations to demystify what it means to be a tech fellow. Part of the allure is being able to show off your technical chops. But being a tech fellow also means you can shape the firm through your engineering solutions, Stratan said. "The tech fellows at Goldman Sachs have been at the center of all the major business transformations through technology since the program began, from grid compute and virtual desktops to cloud and data lakes and now, of course, with AI," she said. It's a similar story at Morgan Stanley, where, Pizzi said, distinguished engineers are expected to spend 15% to 20% of their time on enterprise-level problems, not unit-specific problems. That additional responsibility, which doesn't necessarily come with a raise or promotion, is actually a plus for many engineers in the program. Ken Zhang, a new Morgan Stanley DE who's one of the brains behind the bank's generative-AI tool, AskResearch, said the DEs "can help to make some firmwide decisions in technology and make sure we are moving in the right direction." Fang Song, another newly minted Morgan Stanley DE who's an executive director in the enterprise computing group, described her peers as "technical influencers" who make wide-reaching decisions on reusable technology blueprints used across departments. At Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, distinguished engineers and technical fellows can't apply for the designation; they must be nominated by senior management or existing TFs and DEs. While engineering excellence is at the heart of being a DE and TF, it's not the only thing candidates are judged on. At Morgan Stanley, Pizzi said, contributing to the firm's technical reputation externally is important, whether it involves writing technical books and white papers or holding patents. He added that the bank's DEs held one-third of the patents it has generated. Goldman Sachs judges candidates on how they nurture the broader technology population. Stratan said she kept in touch with her mentors, who taught her "how to be a senior engineer and how to think through complex problems." "A very important piece is mentoring and coaching," Stratan said. "Basically the tech fellows are coaching the next generation of tech talent at the firm." Jump to

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 11 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where CyberArk Software Ltd. (NASDAQ:CYBR) stands against the other trending AI stocks. The rise of Chinese open-source AI models highlights their growing influence in the global AI landscape, challenging traditional proprietary systems. Their accessibility and competitive capabilities signal a shift in the balance of AI innovation. On December 17, CNBC's Arjun Kharpal reported that Chinese AI models are advancing rapidly, with several matching or exceeding the performance of U.S. models despite chip restrictions imposed by Washington. Open-source models, referred to as "open weight," are key to this growth. These models, such as Deepseek and Alibaba's QN, are highly popular on platforms like Hugging Face, allowing developers worldwide to freely access and build applications without strict licensing. The strategy enables Chinese companies to distribute their technology widely and challenge proprietary systems from firms like OpenAI, which rely on closed ecosystems to monetize their models. The growing adoption and strong capabilities of Chinese large language models present a significant challenge to U.S. dominance in the AI sector.

While China is making significant moves in AI, US-based companies are also making strides. OpenAI concluded its 12-day "shipmas" event by unveiling o3, a new reasoning model and successor to o1, along with o3-mini, a smaller version tailored for specific tasks. CEO Sam Altman highlighted the advanced capabilities, including exceptional performance in coding, mathematics, and scientific problem-solving. The o3 model achieved a groundbreaking 87.5% on the ARC-AGI benchmark, prompting plans to develop a more challenging evaluation. The score shows the model's ability to perform well on tasks that require learning and adapting to new challenges. ARC-AGI is a benchmark used to evaluate how well an AI can acquire new skills beyond its training data. This high score suggests that o3 is advancing toward more general intelligence capabilities. With a strong focus on safety testing and future enhancements, o3 represents a major step forward for U.S.-based AI development. OpenAI's decision to skip naming the model o2 is linked to trademark concerns with a UK telecom company. While o3 is not yet broadly available, safety researchers can preview o3-mini now, with general availability expected in early 2025. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A data center with a repetetive design of computer servers, showing the companies' efficient and secure IT infrastructure. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51 CyberArk Software Ltd. (NASDAQ:CYBR) develops AI-driven identity security solutions that protect access, manage credentials, and provide secure authentication across various industries and environments. J.P. Morgan has identified CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR) as one of its "top picks" in security software for 2025, citing strong demand, favorable expectations, and potential for better-than-expected performance. J.P. Morgan emphasized focusing on companies with strong enterprise budget exposure and those expanding into adjacent markets. Additionally, as digital identity management becomes a top priority for businesses, securing AI is also highlighted as a key theme for 2025, with growing competition expected in this area. The firm said: "We think that solutions to securing AI currently exist in a highly fragmented and nascent market, and that sustained investment from bigger players in the security space will likely increase competition and available solutions.” Overall, CYBR ranks 5th on our list of trending AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of CYBR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CYBR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Trump is surrounding himself with a tight-knit group of right-wing tech barons
URL: https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/mapping-trumps-connections-techs-right-wing-brotherhood-rcna180693
Time Published: 2024-12-26T07:29:43Z

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time President-elect Donald Trump has surrounded himself with an interconnected group of tech barons. President-elect Donald Trump has surrounded himself with a tight-knit group of wealthy tech barons whose ideas will help define his second term in the White House. Three key allies — members of a group known as “the PayPal Mafia” for their involvement in the money-transfer company two decades ago — seem to be shaping policy and staffing decisions in Trump’s incoming administration, and they are part of an expansive right-wing tech network that will accompany Trump back into power. The network is highly interconnected, sharing not only a political alliance but also social ties, investment opportunities, anti-regulatory ideas and geographic proximity in Austin, Texas, or Northern California. Some of their friendships and professional connections go back decades, and almost all the members of the network are men. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has been called the “shadow president” or “first buddy,” and he wants to take a hatchet to the federal budget at Trump’s request as co-lead of the newly formed “Department of Government Efficiency” with biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. David Sacks, a tech investor and podcaster, will have the role of Trump’s tech “czar,” advising him on artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. Peter Thiel, a longtime Trump supporter, has given the incoming Trump administration a staffing pipeline filled with at least 10 of his former co-workers, employees or investing partners — including Vice President-elect JD Vance. And dozens of other tech figures are now orbiting in Trump’s gravity, as either informal advisers, government officials-in-waiting or supporters pushing Trump’s agenda from outside Washington. While some converted to his side only recently, many of the tech figures know one another very well. “They’ve turned profits into power,” said Rob Lalka, author of the book “The Venture Alchemists,” which came out this year and profiled many of the figures who are headed into the administration. Lalka, a professor at Tulane University’s Freeman School of Business, said several characteristics define the technologists surrounding Trump, including their wealth and skepticism of institutions and the heavily online personas they’ve created. And he said they have a shared history, with many of them overlapping at Stanford University during and after Thiel’s time there. “That contrarianism, it doesn’t come out of nowhere. It comes from real-life experiences they had as college students,” he said. In other words: A right-wing faction has coalesced within the usually progressive tech industry, and much of it is preparing to make Washington a second home for the next four years. The Trump transition team describes it as a natural fit. “President Trump’s agenda includes economic, energy and regulatory policies that will allow the US to reclaim its global dominance of innovation and technology,” Brian Hughes, a spokesperson for the transition, said in a statement. “President Trump is surrounding himself with industry leaders like Elon Musk as he works to restore innovation, reduce regulation, and celebrate free speech in his second term,” he said. Musk, Sacks and Thiel didn’t respond to requests for comment on the transition. Neil Malhotra, a professor of political economy at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, said it’s notable that many in the tech industry crowd that’s close to Trump don’t come from the biggest-name tech companies, such as Meta, Google, Apple and Microsoft. “This specific group is unique because it’s coming a lot from venture,” he said, referring to venture capitalists who invest in startups. “Venture is very different from Big Seven incumbent tech. The Big Seven incumbent tech, those people are trying to be very neutral.” The Magnificent 7 collection of tech companies includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, NVIDIA and Tesla. Venture capitalists often are less interested in corporate initiatives such as diversity programs, he said. Instead, they have a reputation for ruthless competition, focusing in their most extreme moments on growth at all costs and upending the existing order. “The contrarian culture of Silicon Valley and venture has pushed back against big corporate ideas coming out of the professional managerial class,” he said. Trump’s second term won’t be the first administration to have strong influence from the modern tech industry. The Obama administration was closely tied to tech, especially to Google and its executives, such as former CEO Eric Schmidt. But there’s little overlap between the tech figures who advised President Barack Obama and those working now for Trump. And there’s a different dynamic this time around, said Nathan Leamer, a Republican consultant in Washington and CEO of Fixed Gear Strategies. “Obama was following Big Tech’s lead in 2008, and there was an excitement that the Obama administration’s approach to tech mirrored the blogosphere and early Twitter and how these companies saw themselves as fitting into the world,” he said. “The difference now is that, with Trump, it’s following the Republican Party’s lead,” he said. “Tech is watching Republican leaders and realizing that they have to get in the game. Otherwise, they’re going to be left out.” Previously Trump-skeptical tech companies such as Meta, Amazon and OpenAI are each giving at least $1 million to Trump’s inaugural fund, donations that Trump can use for whatever purpose he wants. Setting a tone near the top of the new administration will be Vance, who worked for one of Thiel’s venture capital funds, Mithril Capital, after law school and has benefited ever since from the association. Thiel was one of the main backers of Vance’s run for the Senate in Ohio in 2022. “From the top, you see that connection with Silicon Valley,” Leamer said. (He noted that Trump himself now qualifies as a tech investor, with a majority stake in the parent company of Truth Social, Trump Media & Technology Group Corp.) Leamer said that while some industries rely on Washington-based trade and lobbying organizations to be the faces of their businesses, figures such as Musk, Sacks and Thiel pursue a different model: cutting out the trade groups as middlemen and speaking directly to large audiences through social media and podcasts. “These are the people behind the microphone,” he said. “It’s fitting that these very famous people are now disintermediating the marketplace.” Trump’s choices for Cabinet-level nominations are generally people from political backgrounds, including members of Congress, Republican governors and campaign loyalists. But just below that level, tech figures are populating some of the most important positions. Jacob Helberg, an adviser to the government contractor Palantir Technologies and the husband of another ex-PayPal executive, Keith Rabois, is Trump’s pick for undersecretary of state for economic growth, energy and the environment. A tech investor, Trae Stephens, a co-founder of the defense contractor Anduril and a partner at Thiel’s Founders Fund, has been under consideration for Defense Department jobs, according to Politico and The Wall Street Journal. Jim O’Neill, former CEO of the Thiel Foundation, is Trump’s choice for the No. 2 job at the Department of Health and Human Services. Trump has named Emil Michael, a former Uber executive, for the Pentagon’s top research job. Vance’s economic adviser Gail Slater, who has worked for Fox Corp., Roku and a now-defunct trade group called the Internet Association, is Trump’s choice to lead antitrust enforcement at the Justice Department. Announcing his choice of Slater on Truth Social, Trump highlighted the conflicts between large incumbent tech firms and the tech startups that have venture capitalists’ backing: “Big Tech has run wild for years, stifling competition in our most innovative sector and, as we all know, using its market power to crack down on the rights of so many Americans, as well as those of Little Tech!” Trump has also designated appointees friendly to the same tech faction to lead the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission. But there are hundreds or thousands of potential appointments still to come in the middle levels of the bureaucracy where other tech figures could end up. Vance said in a 2021 podcast interview that if Trump were to win another term, he should replace all federal civil servants with “our people,” meaning conservatives. Lalka, of Tulane University, said that for all the rhetoric about meritocracy coming from right-leaning tech entrepreneurs and investors, Vance’s vision for the federal workforce is more like the opposite. “That is literally ‘to the victor go the spoils’ from the 19th century,” he said. “It’s not how you attract top talent.” Malhotra, of Stanford, said one outstanding question is how many tech figures will take full-time jobs in government rather than part-time ones. Sacks’ White House role, for example, is expected to be part-time only, and Musk’s task of co-leading an efficiency commission also won’t be his day job. “That’s going to really limit their power,” he said of the part-time roles. “This is a really good way for Trump to marginalize these people and give them the facade that they’re powerful.” Despite his part-time role, though, Musk has lately left his imprint on the transition by helping block a government funding bill and globe-trotting with Trump to meet foreign leaders. There’s a long list of actions that Trump’s tech appointees are expected to tackle, including deregulation of the cryptocurrency industry, fewer constraints on artificial intelligence development, easier environmental approval for projects such as Musk’s SpaceX rocket launches, a shakeup in antitrust enforcement, an overhaul of military procurement and, with congressional approval, low tax rates for corporations and wealthy individuals. Adam Kovacevich, the CEO of Chamber of Progress, a Democratic tech industry organization, said that despite Vice President Kamala Harris’ loss to Trump in November, he’s trying to see potential upside for tech overall in part because of who’s advising Trump. “You have to go into the new administration with optimism,” he said. “A lot of these people who have supported Trump, they’ve supported Democrats in the past, so we’re not necessarily talking about people who are always in the Republican corner,” he said. Tech figures in that category include Musk, Sacks and investor Marc Andreessen, who recently said he’s spending half his time at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida advising on the transition. Kovacevich said he believes their alliance with Trump is best thought of as a narrow reaction against President Joe Biden, a longtime skeptic of the tech industry, rather than a complete rejection of Democratic politics. Kovacevich said he thinks Trump won’t be able to follow through on some of his most radical ideas about technology, including forcing social media platforms to further bend their content moderation in favor of conservative users. “Any efforts there will probably run into a First Amendment buzzsaw,” he said. One closely watched question: How much money will Trump’s tech allies make during his administration? Musk’s wealth has soared 70% since last month’s election, to about $450 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index — fueling progressive theories that he and others in tech are motivated by a desire to increase their net worth. The stock price of Palantir Technologies, a government contractor, has roughly doubled since the election, and defense tech startup firms such as Anduril have also expressed optimism about increased sales during the new administration. Leamer, the Republican consultant, said he thinks Trump’s tech allies have a different motivation: to prove that they’re right. “I think they see it as a chance to put their ideas into practice,” he said. “These individuals have been thinking about these ideas, and they really have an interest in entrepreneurship and the future of the country.” CORRECTION (Dec. 26, 2024, 1:00 p.m. ET): A diagram in a previous version of this article included a wrong photo.

We recently compiled a list of the 13 AI News Investors Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tevogen Bio Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:TVGN) stands against the other AI news investors should not miss. As we look toward 2025, the AI investment landscape is evolving from a focus on general-purpose computing to custom-built solutions tailored to specific needs. This shift opens up opportunities for suppliers of specialized technology and software companies to incorporate AI into their offerings. Meanwhile, higher interest rates may push investors toward established players with strong growth potential in the AI space. READ ALSO: 12 AI News and Ratings Investors Are Watching Right Now and Jim Cramer's Latest Lightning Round: 8 Stocks in Focus. At CNBC’s ‘Closing Bell,’ Doug Clinton of Intelligent Alpha and Deepwater Asset Management discussed the shifting dynamics of AI investments heading into 2025. He explained that while Nvidia has been a key beneficiary of AI-driven spending over the past two years, with companies investing heavily in general-purpose AI compute, the focus is now transitioning to custom silicon. Companies like Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon have developed their own custom chips designed to handle their specific AI needs. Clinton believes that as these companies begin to deploy their custom chips more aggressively, suppliers like Broadcom, which works with most of these tech giants, and Marvell, another stock in Intelligent Alpha's portfolio, could see growth. He compared the current AI trend to the dot-com era, where Cisco was a dominant player. He stressed that the AI market is not solely about one company, and as the sector evolves, more companies will emerge as key players, broadening the scope of AI investments. Regarding the impact of interest rates, Clinton noted that higher rates might push investors back to mega-cap stocks, but also highlighted that companies with strong AI growth potential, like Snowflake, could still thrive. The company has been expanding its AI offerings and could attract attention as more customers deploy its services for AI applications. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Title: AI is expected to fuel Wall Street's tech hiring in 2025. Headhunters break down what you need to know to get a leg up.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-get-tech-job-on-wall-street-recruiter-advice-2024-12

It's been a tough year for software engineers on the job market, but one bright spot is starting to emerge on Wall Street for technologists looking for a new gig. Banks, hedge funds, and investment firms bullish on AI are expected to hire more tech talent in the new year, according to two headhunters who recruit engineers and data scientists for finance firms. That's good news for jobseekers in these sectors, which were long considered to be recession-proof careers but were hit this year with waves of layoffs, job freezes, and hiring cutbacks. Ben Hodzic, a managing director at recruitment firm Selby Jennings who finds talent for hedge funds and investment banks, told Business Insider there's "a lot of optimism" around AI in financial services. "Financial services institutions are slowly adopting their workflows and they've come to a reality where you need the right talent to actually build and implement and manage those products," he said. In some cases, the hiring spree is already happening. Jamie Dimon, the boss of America's biggest bank JPMorgan Chase, said earlier this year that he's anticipating adding thousands of jobs related to AI in the next few years. Hedge fund and proprietary-trading firms are shelling out as much as $350,000 in annual salaries for top-tier AI researchers and engineers. Meanwhile, private-equity firms have been "clamoring" to hire AI operating executives to improve their portfolio companies. Hodzic said the rosier outlook stems from a desire to build AI tools in-house and boost worker productivity in areas like wealth advisory, investment banking, and trading. More clarity on the direction of macroeconomic factors, like inflation and the impacts of the US election, is also providing tailwinds for banks looking to invest in human capital in 2025, he said. While AI is expected to drive an uptick in tech hiring, the technology is also changing what it takes to get a tech job on Wall Street. BI spoke with recruiters to find out how candidates should adapt and what they need to do to stand out. They outlined some of the industry's most in-demand skills, explained why having Big Tech experience might not get you that far anymore, and shared the companies that hiring managers want to see on resumes. They declined to disclose specific client activity due to privacy agreements. A few years ago, Matt Stabile, a tech recruiter who works with buy-side firms including Two Sigma and Susquehanna International Group, could almost guarantee an interview with a hiring manager if a candidate was coming out of a FAANG company. "Now, due to overhiring and layoffs, those resumes seem to be a dime a dozen," Stabile told BI. It's true that Big Tech companies have shed thousands of workers this year, flooding the job market with resumes touting the same companies, like Meta and Amazon. And only certain divisions of Big Tech companies on a resume will catch hiring managers' eyes, like Google's DeepMind, for instance, Stabile said. Finance firms witnessing the AI transformation from the sidelines want to get in on the action and build their own homegrown solutions. That's created demand among hedge-fund clients to ask for technologists specifically from Nvidia, Hodzic told BI. "There's definitely an inherent need for people to understand the infrastructure side as well, how to actually construct the computer in the right way to be able to process some of this information and what quality of chips are needed in order to actually produce the output they're looking for," Hodzic said. Stabile is seeing the same, with hiring managers getting excited to see talent coming from the $3.6 trillion chipmaker, AI startup Anthropic, and ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. He said these are the resumes that are getting through and being considered over all the others. Even if you haven't worked at any of these companies, Stabile said experience and exposure to their software tools is still a highly sought after skill. He specifically highlighted the Nvidia Triton Inference Server, an open-source software that's key to deploying and executing AI workloads, Nvidia TensorRT-LLM, used to optimize the performance of large language models, and Nvidia Fleet Command, which is important for scaling AI deployments. If you haven't worked at a large AI company, or haven't worked with their latest products, not all hope is lost. Wall Street banks especially rely heavily on legacy technologies. Some are built on codebases that have likely been around longer than the developer working on it has been alive. To be clear, that hasn't stopped financial firms from building entire businesses and offerings on modern technology. What that has introduced, however, is the need to ensure that systems old and new can work together and exist in the same environment without introducing bugs or dependency issues. And in the case of firms moving on-premise systems to the public cloud, sometimes entire back-end systems have to be rebuilt. As a result, hiring managers often light up when candidates can talk about their experience with software migrations, Selby Jennings' Hodzic said. If you've shifted data or software from one system to another, or translated code from one language to another, be sure to bring it up during the interview process. "People who can demonstrate that engineering skillset of recreating and reconstructing things are really sought after," Hodzic said. "I think what a lot of clients want are people who can come in and show them what's not working well, how to iterate and how to improve, and then actually do it." Jump to

Title: From Wall Street to Crypto: How Top Finance Talent Braved Risks for Blockchain Rewards
URL: https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2024/12/from-wall-street-to-crypto-how-top-finance-talent-braved-risks-for-blockchain-rewards/

The transition from Wall Street to cryptocurrency has been both risky and transformative for finance professionals who made the leap. Many who left lucrative roles at top institutions during the last bull market are now reportedly seeing their decisions validated. Bitcoin’s historic surge past $100,000 marks a dramatic recovery from the 2022 crypto winter, when the market was plagued by skepticism and losses. A key driver of Bitcoin’s resurgence has been the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January 2024. Major firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Invesco introduced ETFs that simplify access to Bitcoin for institutional and retail investors. According to data from Farside Investors, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust saw strong inflows, highlighting the growing institutional interest in digital assets. In December 2024 alone, Bitcoin ETFs collectively attracted billions of dollars, demonstrating heightened confidence in the crypto market. The ETFs have played a pivotal role in mainstreaming cryptocurrency, offering regulatory safeguards that address long-standing concerns about volatility and security. This institutional backing has not only increased investor confidence but also reduced barriers for entry, bringing cryptocurrency closer to the mainstream. Retail adoption of cryptocurrency has also grown significantly. Recent surveys offer varying estimates: Security.org reports that 40% of American adults now own crypto, up from 30% in 2023, while Pew Research estimates 17% of Americans have invested in or used cryptocurrency. Ownership trends reveal that younger generations, particularly Millennials and Gen Z, are driving this growth. Men under 50 are significantly more likely to own cryptocurrency than other demographic groups, reflecting a generational shift in financial priorities. While these statistics vary, they collectively underscore the increasing acceptance of cryptocurrency across diverse demographics. However, Federal Reserve data suggests that only 7% of Americans used or held cryptocurrency in 2023, reflecting a more conservative view on adoption rates. These discrepancies highlight the evolving nature of the market and the different methodologies used to assess its growth. The future of the crypto market could hinge on regulatory developments in early 2025. Gary Gensler, the current SEC Chair known for his stringent approach to cryptocurrency, will step down on January 20, 2025. On January 20, 2025 I will be stepping down as @SECGov Chair.A thread 🧵⬇️ This coincides with Donald Trump’s inauguration for a second presidential term, raising expectations for a potential shift toward more crypto-friendly policies. Industry participants are optimistic that clearer regulatory frameworks could unlock further growth and innovation. For finance professionals who transitioned from Wall Street to crypto, the current market environment represents both validation and caution. According to a recent article by Francesca Maglione and Charlie Wells for Bloomberg News, Vivek Raman—a former Morgan Stanley trader who shifted to blockchain to explore trading bonds on Ethereum—and Patrick Liou, a former BlackRock trader who joined Gemini, are among those who stayed committed despite the challenges of the 2022 downturn. Liou described moments of doubt but emphasized the importance of resilience and belief in blockchain’s transformative potential. Other examples include Michael Harvey, who joined Galaxy in 2023 after nearly two decades in traditional finance. As Bitcoin surged to new highs, Harvey finally considered opening a bottle of Johnnie Walker Blue Label gifted to him on his first day—a symbol of perseverance and celebration. These stories illustrate the cautious optimism shared by many crypto professionals who recognize the market’s cyclical nature. The journey from Wall Street to crypto has been marked by risk, resilience, and reward. Bitcoin’s rally past $100,000, driven by institutional adoption and increasing retail interest, underscores the maturity and legitimacy of the cryptocurrency industry. As 2025 approaches, the combination of regulatory shifts, institutional backing, and demographic changes signals a promising future for the intersection of traditional finance and blockchain technology.

Title: RICH BODY

Time Published: 2024-12-25T18:36:39Z

. For example ,,, ￼ you would not want to be the world’s most muscular and glorious demigod body if you only got two hours of sleep a night, and felt like you were physiologically dying, and had very low testosterone. ￼ Similarly speaking, it wouldn’t matter if you were like the worlds strongest man, you could lift like 100,000 pounds or whatever, but, once again, you had naturally low mood, low testosterone, and once again only slept two hours a night? So one random thought I have in regards to fitness is the criticality of sleep and recovery. For example, I think I have a simple antidote, to reset your circadian rhythm, or sleep patterns, for dinner, the night prior, eat a shit load of beef ribs. Why beef ribs? First, ancient Greek literature, the Iliad confirms this. ￼￼ For example, when Achilles had his friends joined him in his hut, he carved out the backbone of the ox, often prized, the most choice meat. Also, it is easily accessible, you could find it at any Costco, even Food 4 Less. Even with the price of inflation, it is still affordable, around 499 a pound, or 449 a pound. I found a very very simple recipe, just take a baking tray and cover it with aluminum foil, and you don’t even have to season the ribs or prepare them, just put them directly on the aluminum foil, heat the oven at 325°, let it cook for an hour and a half, and boom you’re done! And then later you could just coat it with some salt pepper and garlic powder, and smoked paprika is actually good too. Anyways, after consuming about two trays of beef ribs, I’ve been sleeping way better, like on average another two or three hours a night, which I feel at least 500% better in the morning? The weird idea is in a lot of self improvement circles is that waking up super early every day, at like 3:30 AM or for whatever is considered virtuous. No. I would actually say that the ultimate virtue and active mainlines is to try to secure at least 8 to 12 hours of sleep a night. Why? Simple biology; assuming that during the day you are doing some sort of physical exercise and weightlifting, then what that then means is that the corresponding rest and recovery time will also be in similar accordance. Also, a simple thoughts; the stronger you become the heavier way to lift, you must also correspondingly spend equal amounts of time stretching, warming up etc. For example on the road to hitting my legendary thousand pound Atlas lift, all of these low testosterone guys would always tell me ￼“be careful”, which was their strange way of trying to feel superior to me that they thought I was doing something foolish in which I actually might injure myself? The simple idea that I have is once again, obviously! The higher weight you go, the more careful you become. And my personal way of mitigating safety was simple; spending at least two or three times more effort stretching warming up, doing dynamic exercise exercises like a bunch of yoga stuff on steroids. And this is where a lot of fools also don’t understand; when that would be warming up for my really really heavy weight lifts, I would also do a lot of calisthenics that looks like I would just do a single muscle up to warm up, planches etc. ￼ So currently my practical thought is the best car or vehicle to own in LA, maybe anywhere in Southern California, maybe even America is probably a white Toyota plug-in Prius prime. Why? First, once again you want to have the best of all worlds! For example, when you become dumb rich, it ain’t about showing off, rather, it is about adding more convenience to your life. For example, you want maximum optionality. What that means is you want to have access to gasoline pumps when necessary, and also you want to have access to electric charging ports when also available. But you don’t want to be dependent on either. ￼ Once again, do you want to have the optional not the dependence. So I just finished reading principles of economics by Saifedean, and one really really fascinating idea I encountered is this idea that perhaps, what if a lot of these doomsday Colts were simply predicated on false science math and philosophical principles? For example, just ChatGPT; what percentage of the earths crust has been mined for oil, and it will spit out an absurdly tiny number. Also all this hysteria when it comes to carbon dioxide and carbon footprint whatever; also once again, just ChatGPT the percentage of carbon in the earths atmosphere, compared to nitrogen which is about 70%, oxygen which is about 20%, and carbon which I think is like .01%? Anyways, I think the biggest issue here is that almost 99.9999% of all these doomsday cults is that once again, the world is going to shit, and it is precisely because we are boiling the earth, carbon footprint, running out of oil etc. But what if I could tell you, that with 100% certainty that human beings will be fine for the next hundred million years on planet earth, and even at the rate we are going, we have only tapped .001% of the earths natural gas and oil supply, in that, we would never run out of natural minerals even for the next hundred billion years? Certainly I cannot make this prediction but this is a thought experiment. If this were the case, then what? ￼￼ anyways, the reason why I think this is important is that even though I am 100% fan of Tesla Elon Musk, the truth is, getting an electric vehicle or a Tesla is more about fashion rather than saving the planet or whatever. Even an ancient Taoist philosophy says this; How dare you have the audacity to think that somehow the planet needs your help? I think there are virtues to arrogance, but also, the arrogant line of thinking that somehow the Earth needs our help, is also an arrogant thought? Sandbox thinking So currently I really really like this idea of a sandbox. The general idea is that what if we lived in the world in which we had unlimited time unlimited resources, essentially god mode, then how would we proceeded and live life? ￼￼ first, I think 99.9999% of the current modern-day misery that most humans face is body poverty. It don’t matter if you make seven figures or eight figures at Google, at Apple, Meta or Facebook whatever; it seems that almost all these people that I know who work in tech, all of them have extreme bodily poverty? Once again, not enough time weightlifting, too much time jerking off to VR porn, or going on Reddit late at night, with incognito browser on, or their VPN on with pirate bay, whatever it may be. Also, not enough meat consumption. All of these bizarre virtues signaling folks with plant-based diets whatever. Also once again, this anti-sleep mentality, the strange idea that sleeping is a vice? I find everybody on all sides of the political spectrum bad. Republicans and Democrats are bad, Libertarians are bad, moderates are bad etc. The left the right the alt left the alt right whatever. ￼ I don’t know any independent thinkers. All thinkers are dependent on others, nobody stands on their own two feet. I think currently the only independent thinkers that I appreciate and love include Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, Kanye West, Jeff Bezos, Michael Saylor, NASSIM Taleb etc. But once again, these individuals are good role models but not the end in itself. For example you could spend 100,000 years studying Elon Musk but the truth of the matter is you do not want to become Elon Musk. Why? The critical issue here is he has extreme body poverty until you see him topless on a yacht, with a golden bronze tan, and a six pack, don’t follow him. In some ways Jeff Bezos might be a better guide, look at him, he’s so fucking jacked. But then again I’m pretty sure that Bezos is on the juice, I’m sure he trains good, but he also does steroids good. Michael Saylor is a good example, he knows the virtues of intermittent fasting, and at the age of 59 he looks great! But I also think that maybe he could get into weightlifting; I want to see a sleeveless Michael Saylor with huge guns. MSTR FOLKS email me at Eric@erickim.com for tips So some simple training ideas: First, killing 10 birds with one stone. What that means is just go on a morning walk around town, with your 60 pound weight vest on! Titan.fitness is good ￼ Also, a very simple thing you could do is just get those wooden gymnast rings, you get on Amazon or Titan fitness, and just hook it up in your garage or backyard your front lawn, on a tree, your parking spot whatever ,,, and with your 60 pound weighted vest on, just do a few ups dips, “skin the cat”, Essentially an exercise in which you’re holding the rings you do kind of a backflip and un backflip it again, planches etc. ￼ Currently I think actually one of the most underrated exercises is the rack pull. Essentially, you rack your barbell at around waist level, and then you load it up with weights, and then you kind of do like a mini hip thrust, and you just get it off the rack for like half an inch and you’re done. Imagine like doing like a super mini deadlift, but it is far superior because you don’t have to deal with racking and unracking the weights annoyingly off the floor, and also, the transfer injury is almost nailed because there is not much load on your lower back. A rack pull is more like a hip thrust, meets thigh exercise, meets upper back and trap exercise? ￼ Another very simple one is the Atlas lift, once again, you don’t have to squat all the way down. You just rack up the weight, like you’re doing a squad, and the only goal is to just lift it up half an inch. For the fools who say this don’t do nothing, I have like the most insanely jacked legs thighs calves quads of all time and once again I’m not on steroids. It don’t matter if they are vegan plant-based, professional or whatever, everyone is on steroids! Even your favorite vegan power lifter and weightlifter is on steroids! Even your favorite yoga instructor or calisthenics or CrossFit instructor is also on steroids. Note, steroids are vegan! Ha ha. My massage therapist Aaron at massage envy in Beverly Hills, 100% recommended, told me something interesting that all body mechanics are pretty much the same, but the only difference is our levels of fitness. Also he encouraged me that because I am so physically active, to once again, the more physically active you become, the more time you must also dedicate to stretching mobility work etc. As an investor, you need to have big balls and high testosterone, good mood, good sleep, good physiological and mental health. The primary issue is that a lot of these degenerate traders, have very very poor physical and physiological health. If you’re checking prices like 100 times a day, this is bad. I would actually make the argument if you’re like a single person, and assuming that you’re trading bitcoin and investing a micro strategy stock whatever, the intelligence strategy is if you want to get your mind off things, invest in your physical fitness and health 10x. What that then means is like spend maximum time outside, outdoors, walking outside in the elements, go on nice hikes, be a nature, spend some time with the gym or weightlifting at home, essentially embrace a natural lifestyle. Also, quit marijuana, alcohol. These are all bad toxins. Just be sober. Just be focused on one thing at a time? When is future forecasting good and when is it bad?

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. It was a stellar year for investors here and abroad, with some stand-out stocks on our market as interest rate cuts start to relieve some economic pressure. In January, the Herald asked professional stock pickers which companies they were backing on the New Zealand, Australia and US stock markets. This article reveals how their picks performed in the year to December, and the stocks they’re picking for 2025. Scroll to the end to see a graphic of all the results and picks. It was a year of two halves for our share market with almost all of the gains coming after interest rates were cut, although economic challenges saw many companies dim their lights this year, including some notable names. Spark suffered under the weight of reduced corporate and Government spending, but its loss was Infratil’s gain as the owner of One NZ saw its early data centre bets pay off. Surprisingly, stock brokers remain committed to some of the poorest performers, such as retirement village operator Ryman Healthcare, with optimism that interest rate cuts may finally result in improved finances, especially in an industry tied to the housing market. Energy was a consistent pick for the new year, with Contact and Mercury specifically in sight, after a crisis period that made electricity generation’s importance clear. Firms were increasingly investing in companies offshore, with some firms' picks for 2025 allocated entirely internationally where they could get more exposure to technology. “The global economy is expected to grow at around 3% in 2025, with inflation continuing to normalise after the highs of recent years,” Hamilton Hindin Green investment adviser Jeremy Sullivan said. “However, growth may be uneven across regions due to varying impacts of tariff and immigration policies, particularly in the US and China. “Despite these challenges, the ongoing recovery and advancements in technology offer significant opportunities for growth and development. Retirement village operator Summerset was a favourite for the new year, following its outperformance in 2024. The company made a total shareholder return of 26.6% in the year to December 9, according to figures collated for the Herald by Forsyth Barr. “Summerset has been a standout performer in 2024 and remains our top pick in the retirement sector,“ Craigs Investment Partner’s head of private wealth research Hamish Don said. “We have a favourable view of Summerset’s development strategy and think it can deliver strong cash flows and significant value for shareholders in the future.” Infratil was another crowd favourite for a repeated year with firms expecting it could keep building on top of this year’s 23.3% total return and its addition to the MSCI World Index. “The demand for and valuation of data centres is central to Infratil’s positive outlook,” Nikko Asset Management’s head of New Zealand equities Michael Shrerrock said. “Furthermore, should Contact’s takeover of Manawa Energy be approved by [the] Commerce Commission, then Infratil will receive Contact shares and cash for its Manawa holding.” Nikko and Forsyth Barr both had Contact on their lists for the new year, after it added more geothermal generation to its portfolio. “Contact Energy trades at a significant discount to Mercury and Meridian Energy and offers similar or better earnings growth.” Forsyth Barr senior equities analyst Aaron Ibbotson said. Although, Salt Funds was picking Mercury as its power play, purely because it was priced cheap. “Occasionally, the forced idiocy of passive funds gives active investors a free hit in large cap stocks,” Salt’s managing director Matt Goodson said. Stock broking firm Hamilton Hindin Greene picked only international stocks for 2025, with United States household names Walmart and BlackRock among its picks. “Walmart had a strong fiscal year 2024, with a 6% increase in revenue to US$648.1 billion,” Investment adviser Jeremy Sulllivan said. “The company also saw significant growth in its eCommerce sales, which surpassed $100 billion for the year.” Hamilton Hindin Greene’s Australian-listed picks included Xero and WiseTech Global. “Xero’s focus on expanding its subscriber base and enhancing its product offerings, particularly in the US market, is expected to drive growth,” Sullivan said. Some of the firms also had an international technology play in their investment line-up, including Amazon and Uber. The well-known ride-share app “getting good traction with its loyalty scheme and with selling advertising, which is very profitable,” Forsyth Barr’s Ibbotson explained. Getting the bad news out of the way first, Spark and Ryman Healthcare turned out to be poor performers, despite some firms backing them at the outset of 2024. The telecommunications company Spark was deemed somewhat defensive in an economic downturn, however, it had suffered more than stock pickers expected, with its share price hitting its lowest level since 2015 this year. Spark’s total shareholder return for the year to December 9 was -40.2%, including its share price fall buffered by any dividends paid, according to figures collated for the Herald by Forsyth Barr. “It’s fair to say that Spark surprised and disappointed the market with its poor earnings result,” Nikko Asset Management’s Michael Sherrock said of its early 2024 pick. “Its removal from the MSCI World Index, which forced a significant sell down of stock, further weakened its share price.” The company recently sold the rest of its cell tower infrastructure business and announced an earnings and dividend downgrade. “The board and management acknowledge that our current financial performance falls short of what is acceptable, and we understand the disappointment our shareholders will be feeling,” Spark chairwoman Justine Smyth said in October. However, two analysts have since upgraded their rating on Spark’s stock, suggesting it could be oversold. On a similar note, retirement village developer and operator Ryman’s total return for the year to December was -28.8%, making it among one of the worst performing on the New Zealand Stock Exchange (NZX) this year. Chairman Dean Hamilton recently announced a near halving in its half-year net profit and rising vacancies across its properties. Its struggles speak to the housing-tied difficulties more broadly, where higher interest rates may still be having an impact, but much of Ryman’s problems were its own doing, as Hamilton explained to the Herald in June. “The financial performance has slowly deteriorated,” the chairman said. “A bit like being in a boiling pot and then when you look at it five years later you go, ‘how did the business get to this position?’” It surprised stock pickers at Forsyth Barr who were backing the company to be one of the best performing this year as interest rates were expected to come down. “We believe Ryman to be the most attractive mid to large-cap opportunity in New Zealand over the coming 12 months,” Forsyth Barr senior equity analyst Aaron Ibbotson said in January. One month after making that statement, the company raised $902 million from investors to help repay debt, followed by its chief executive resigning. In Ibbotson’s defence, he was sticking with the stock for 2025. Another of Forsyth Barr’s picks did not play out as hoped, with AFT Pharmaceuticals making a -18.2% total return in the year. The Maxigesic pain-relief producer announced a significant operating profit downgrade in November. Hamilton Hindin Greene’s own property pick played out poorly - Vital Healthcare, which owns medical properties such as private hospitals, made a -12.1% total return. “Despite a solid dividend yield of 6.42%, the stock’s capital value declined,” Hamilton Hindin Greene investment adviser Jeremy Sullivan said. “The company focused on divesting non-core assets and reinvesting in new developments, which, while strategically sound, impacted short-term performance.” Sky Television was among the favourites for both Craigs and Nikko Asset, who liked it because of its dividend payout potential. While the media company did pay a solid dividend, it failed to help the share price, finishing the year to December with a total return of just 0.2%. “Sky has not been immune to a weak economy, and has bounced around over the year a bit like a rugby ball,” Nikko’s Sherrock said. “Sky Network Television has been a disappointing pick,” Craigs’ Hamish Don said. “In August, the company reported slightly lower-than-expected profit and tempered investor expectations by reducing its revenue guidance.” Both raised investor concerns about renewing expensive New Zealand rugby rights going forward, although they both believed its decent dividend of 30 cents per share next year was attractive. “We continue to see value in Sky Network Television,” Don said. Nikko was sticking with Sky as a top pick for 2025. Despite Ryman’s woes, a competing retirement village developer was one of the best performing picks for the year. “Summerset has been a standout performer in 2024 and remains our top pick in the retirement sector,“ Craigs’ Don said. “We have a favourable view of Summerset’s development strategy and think it can deliver strong cash flows and significant value for shareholders in the future.” Both Craigs and Nikko cited official interest rate cuts as benefiting the company’s position. “These rate cuts oil the wheels of the housing market, increasing turnover, and making it easier for retirees to sell up and move into retirement villages, therefore stock sentiment continues to improve,” Nikko’s Sherrock said. Infratil was the most shared pick for the year and played out as expected with a 23.3% total return, largely due to a higher revaluation of its CDC data centres investment. “Although, CDC didn’t catch quite the degree of euphoria and hype that propelled some other data centre names around the world,” Salt Funds Management’s Matt Goodson said of his team’s pick. In comparison to Spark, Infratil, which owns the telecommunications company One New Zealand, was added to the MSCI World index, which resulted in a large amount of stock buying. Salt Funds was the best-performing stock picker of the year, with its backing of insurer Tower, which managed to hike premiums on the back of a tough period of claim volumes following Cyclone Gabrielle and flooding events. Tower’s total return came in at 127.8% in 2024, making it a market stand out. “Tower played out as well as we could have hoped with a very supportive insurance cycle for the first time in years,” Goodson said. “Having no major [weather] events was a piece of overdue luck. “We still see Tower as being cheap. Premium growth will be a lot slower from here, but they have a number of growth levers and the market still values them as though they get hit by their full retained exposure to large disasters each and every year forever.” Salt’s outperformance was also bolstered by its Freightways pick, which made a total return of 27.8%, “despite the hideously weak NZ economy," Goodson said. “October onwards has been a lot better for many cyclical companies as the Reserve Bank of New Zealand reverses its earlier over-tightening.” Salt was continuing to back Freightways in 2025. Another benefiter of interest rate cuts was Contact Energy, which made a bullish $1.86 billion takeover offer for retail power player Manawa and opened its new geothermal station outside of Taupō in the year. The power player was picked by both Craigs and Nikko Asset this year, and Nikko and Forsyth Barr had it as a top pick for 2025. “Performance has been supported by solid customer demand and sales channel options, confirmation that the Tiwai Point aluminium smelter will keep operating for a further 20 years, and the RBNZ lowering the Official Cash Rate,” Craigs’ Don said. On its potential Manawa purchase which was yet to be approved, Don said: “The generation assets of these businesses are complementary and we think there is a high probability the Commerce Commission will approve the transaction.” Forsyth Barr’s best pick for the year turned out to be a2 Milk, which by mid-year was the best performing stock on the NZX. It defied concerns of the impact a declining birth rate in China could have on its infant formula product, and was now sitting on $1b in cash and looking to pay a dividend for the first time in its 20-year history. Hamilton Hindin Greene made a bold bet on the market itself in 2024, picking the NZX to be a stand out - and it was. “The company’s revenue and net income saw significant growth, driven by increased trading volumes and new product offerings,” Jeremy Sullivan said. “This strong financial performance was reflected in the substantial capital appreciation and a healthy dividend yield.” In total, the NZX Top 50 index was sitting 9.7% higher by mid-December, on par with Australia’s Top 200 index, but well below the major US market, the S&P500, which had returned 27% year to date by December. The offshore outperformance in 2024 paid off for investors with international exposure, especially for those in technology stocks. Craigs' US-based pick Amazon “has had an excellent year and has consistently outperformed analyst estimates,” Hamish Don said, with a total shareholder return of 51.5%. While it was commonly known for its online retail business, the technology giant’s data centre and artificial intelligence division, Amazon Web Services, was increasingly impressive. “AWS is an exceptional business with growing earnings and margins,” Don said. “The company should benefit from ongoing advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and management is becoming more convinced of the opportunities that AI presents.” Australia delivered for Forsyth Barr, with its Fisher & Paykel Healthcare competitor pick ResMed returning 50.6%. Although healthcare was inconsistent, with Johnson & Johnson coming in negative for the year for Hamilton Hindin Greene. The best-performing stock-picking firm for 2024 was Salt Funds Management, with an average total shareholder return of 36%. Salt knocked Forsyth Barr from its previously highly ranked spot - it made the smallest return for the year with a, still positive, 13.7%.

Title: We Must Build International Solidarity Against US-China Imperial Rivalry

An interview with Ashley Smith about the rise of capitalist China by Thomas Hummel Thomas Hummel: First of all, congratulations on getting this book out. The book covers several key themes: the rise of capitalism in China, class struggle, China’s place in the new world of inter-imperialist rivalry and crisis, and the possibilities for international working-class solidarity. Why do you think this book is so important at this moment in world politics? Ashley Smith: I believe the starting point for any discussion of world politics today is the state of global capitalism, which I think is in its greatest period of crisis since the 1970s, and possibly since the 1930s. While it’s not on the scale of the Great Depression, since the Great Recession, we’ve been in what David McNally has referred to as “a long global slump.” Michael Roberts calls it a “long depression.” This crisis is interwoven with other systemic crises, the most obvious being the climate crisis, the migration crisis—which stems from the Great Recession, climate change, and other large-scale issues—and the rising levels of interstate conflict, inter-imperial rivalry, and war. These factors are driving millions of people to move across the globe. On top of this, we’re seeing the return of pandemics. COVID-19 is just one of many to come, given the world’s increasing integration and the zoonotic spillover of diseases from animals to humans. This is happening with growing regularity. So, we are dealing with multiple, overlapping crises of global capitalism that are creating unprecedented struggles from below in nearly every state around the world. Over the past 15 years, we’ve seen massive uprisings of people across the globe. At the same time, these crises have intensified inter-imperial rivalries and interstate conflicts, leading to an increasing number of wars, both between states and within states in the form of civil wars. There are thus two axes of conflict in the world: one between capitalist states, and the other between those states and the workers, peoples, and nations they exploit and oppress. Our epoch’s central inter-imperial conflict is between the United States and China. This conflict is the top priority for both the U.S. and Chinese states, and it’s leading them to produce symmetrically opposed policies—economic, political, and military—as their rivalry intensifies and plays out globally. At the same time, both the U.S. and China are experiencing growing struggles from below, as oppressed and exploited people become fed up with their own ruling classes. In this conjuncture, the Left is really being put to the test. The challenge is whether we can oppose both these powers and the inter-imperial rivalry they are locked in while also supporting and building solidarity with the struggles from below in both countries. This book was written in that spirit: as an attempt to offer an alternative of anti-imperialist internationalism and solidarity from below against the escalating inter-imperial rivalry between the U.S. and China. TH: Many on the Left consider China and its so-called “socialist” system to be an alternative to the American-dominated world system. Can you speak a little bit about why you believe this is not true? AS: I think you have to start by understanding why people would be looking for an alternative to the U.S., because as we know, it has been the hegemonic imperialist power in the 20th and 21st centuries. It has the largest economy, the largest military force, with 800 bases around the world, the most developed set of imperial alliance structures, and it’s the main enemy of liberation struggles in almost every part of the world. So, it’s completely understandable that people repulsed by U.S. imperialism would seek some kind of alternative—some state that stands up to the U.S. and offers an alternative to its vicious capitalist and imperialist policies. But I don’t think China or any other state offers any real alternative. The book goes into this in detail, as do many other works. First and foremost, China is a capitalist state that oversees a capitalist economy. Its state and private corporations are thoroughly integrated into the world system. It used this integration with the world system to transform itself from an isolated, marginal economy in the 1970s into the second-largest capitalist economy today. It is the world’s largest manufacturer and not just in low-end commodities. Its “China 2025” plan is designed to leap ahead in high-tech industries, challenging the U.S., Europe, and Japan in research, development, and production. China is now leading in key innovations like green technology and electric vehicles, while also becoming more self-sufficient in critical industries like microchip production. With this massive capitalist expansion, there has been an enormous concentration of wealth in the hands of China’s ruling class. It has the second-highest number of billionaires, after the U.S., and its Gini coefficient, which measures income inequality, is on par with that of the U.S. All the wealth and massive economic expansion we’ve seen in China is based on the exploitation of working-class people, especially the migrant labor force, which has been pushed out of the countryside into the vast factories of both Chinese and multinational capital. They make everything from electric vehicles for Chinese corporations to iPhones for Apple. They work in what can only be called giant sweatshops policed by the Chinese state. Exploitation is at the heart of the vast growth of the Chinese economy. As with any capitalist power, this expansion has been accompanied with all sorts of oppression. China holds Xinjiang, Tibet, and Hong Kong under national oppression within its self-proclaimed borders. It is a regional power, threatening Taiwan with invasion. China is also very aggressive in the South China Sea, claiming large sections as its own and coming into conflict with smaller powers in the region, like the Philippines, and, of course, with the United States. China’s development as a capitalist power has transformed it into a rising imperialist power. Economically, it’s one of the largest exporters of capital globally, particularly through its Belt and Road Initiative—a massive trillion-dollar investment project aimed not at helping other countries, but at securing raw materials to fuel China’s economic expansion. Additionally, China is building a rival axis to the U.S.-led alliance structures, especially with Russia, with which it has a deep economic and geopolitical alliance, but also with regional powers like Iran. It participates in organizations like the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, BRICS, and others. To back up this economic and geopolitical power, China has dramatically modernized its military. It now has the second-largest military budget in the world, an increasingly powerful navy and airforce, and a growing stockpile of advanced missiles, including the third-largest stash of nuclear ones after Russia and the U.S. Thus, China is an imperialist power competing with the U.S. on multiple fronts: economic, geopolitical, and military. It along with Russia and their allies advocates for a new multipolar world order. This order would allow China to assert its economic, geopolitical, and military interests on a global scale. Some see this development as a positive shift from the unipolarity dominated by the U.S. since the end of the Cold War towards a more multipolar world. On the surface, that might seem convincing because unipolarity under the U.S. has been horrific, with Washington’s countless wars and acts of state terror against people around the world to enforce its previously unrivaled hegemony over global capitalism. But multipolarity is no solution. Remember the last great era of multipolarity, in the late 19th and 20th centuries, led to the scramble to divide the world up into colonies, two world wars, and with all that the death of hundreds of millions of people. So, while unipolarity is bad, multipolarity is not a solution and, with the real possibility of inter-imperial war, it could, in fact, be worse. TH: The image presented in Western media of the people of China is that they passively accept a dictatorial regime. Your book draws out the rich history of social and class struggle in China since the reforms of Deng Xiaoping. Can you speak a little bit on this and its importance? AS: First, it is profoundly orientalist to depict Chinese people as passively accepting exploitation and oppression. In reality, just like in any capitalist country, when there’s exploitation and oppression, there’s always going to be resistance. With the rise of China as a capitalist and imperialist power, we’ve seen a dramatic intensification of class exploitation, national oppression, and other forms of oppression related to gender, sexuality, ethnicity, and more. Along with that has come a rise in various forms of resistance—class and social resistance—over the last few decades. The first wave of this resistance came in response to China’s restructuring of state-owned industries. Just like the Rust Belt workers in the U.S. in the 1970s and 80s, China’s old industrial working class tried to resist closures and layoffs with massive strikes in the 1990s. Although many of these were defeated, they didn’t extinguish class struggle in China. In fact, with the rise of new industries in the special economic zones and the influx of multinational capitalist investment—along with new Chinese state and private investment—a new layer of workers engaged in militant forms of class struggle, especially from the late 1990s through the 2000s. This wave of struggle was largely driven by the huge migrant labor force of about 300 million people who left the countryside to work in the new industries. These struggles were radical, happening both outside and inside the state-controlled unions, with migrant workers fighting for better wages and working conditions. But these struggles didn’t just take place in the workplaces. There was also significant resistance over land rights, as China underwent one of the most rapid rates of urbanization in world history. The state seized and sold off people’s land to real estate capitalists to build vast new cities. People rose up to resist the state’s land grabs, triggering ongoing conflicts over land and land rights. There have also been other forms of resistance, including struggles against national oppression. There’s been resistance in Tibet against the national oppression of Tibetans, and similar resistance by Uyghurs against the horrific cultural genocide being carried out by the Chinese state in Xinjiang. There have been massive uprisings in Hong Kong that were brutally put down by the Chinese state. Additionally, there’s been feminist resistance against the increasing oppression of women in China. Another significant development is the return of demonstrations and strikes in the last couple of years, largely triggered by China’s zero-COVID policy during the pandemic. China locked down entire cities, forcing people to stay in their apartment buildings for months, sometimes for over 100 days. The state also implemented “closed-loop management,” which locked workers inside factories to keep them producing commodities amidst the pandemic. The lockdown didn’t eliminate COVID, especially the omicron strain which started to spread throughout the country and in workplaces. The state’s policy led to tremendous struggles. Outside the workplace, one of the key events was a horrific fire in Urumqi, Xinjiang, where an entire apartment block burned down, killing many people—mainly Uyghurs—who were locked inside. This sparked nationwide protests called the White Paper Movement. At the same time, there were massive workplace struggles against the closed-loop management system, which resulted in physical confrontations between workers and company security forces and the police. One of the largest strikes happened in an Apple manufacturing hub, where workers rebelled against being locked in the factory while the virus spread inside. Ultimately, the Chinese government abandoned Zero-COVID, letting the virus rip through society to achieve herd immunity, sickening and killing unknown numbers of people. All these struggles show that there is massive resistance against class exploitation, social inequalities, national oppression, and the brutal policies of China’s capitalist state. TH: China’s commitment to dominating emerging green sectors like renewables and electric vehicles seems to align with the government’s stated goals of achieving environmental sustainability. Why shouldn’t we take these commitments at face value? AS: First of all, we should reject the lies and hypocrisy coming from the U.S., European states, and Japan among many others that claim they’re serious about mitigating climate change and transitioning away from fossil fuels. They’re all lying. Adam Hanieh’s new book Crude Capitalism explains this in great detail. Europe, the US, and Japan are the historical culprits responsible for the climate crisis. Their claims about addressing climate change have consistently been proven false. All of these Western powers are currently engaged in massive fossil fuel expansion. In fact, the U.S. saw its largest extraction of fossil fuel in history last year. Hanieh points out that the development of green technologies has gone hand-in-hand with the expansion of fossil fuel extraction. The two are not separate; green investment isn’t stopping the growth of fossil fuels—it’s happening alongside it. So, while we see major investments in things like electric vehicles, the rate of fossil fuel extraction continues to rise, as do greenhouse gas emissions, which means climate change is getting worse. We’re hitting critical tipping points for environmental disaster, yet the Western powers keep insisting they’re leading the charge against climate change. It’s all lies. As for China, I would argue it’s no different. It’s not a special case; it’s not uniquely bad compared to these historical polluters. It’s just part of the same system—capitalism—that is the fundamental cause of climate change. China has just become the new epicenter of global capitalism’s environmental destruction. This isn’t a China-specific problem, but a problem of the system. Like other states, China is lying about its commitment to the environment. At the same time that it’s investing in green technologies, it’s also massively expanding its fossil fuel industry. In 2023, it was reported that over the previous seven years, China built more coal plants than any other country in the world. In fact, new coal plants are being built at a rate of about two per day. China continues to invest in coal because it needs the energy to fuel its industrial growth, and so far, investments in green technologies like solar haven’t been able to replace coal and other fossil fuels as China’s main energy source. In fact, China is also the world’s largest importer of oil and natural gas and the biggest emitter of greenhouse gasses. So, it’s just as dirty a fossil capitalist as the other great powers. So, why is China investing so heavily in green tech? The reason is simple: it’s a growth sector. That’s why all the great powers and capitalists are investing in it—not to replace fossil fuels, but to profit from this new sector. China has invested enormous amounts of capital into producing electric vehicles, solar panels, and batteries. It also controls a large share of the rare earth minerals that are critical to solar and battery manufacturing. But like capitalists everywhere, China has overinvested in green industries, creating a huge glut of factories and commodities. Because of its cheap labor, China can undercut the prices of other countries’ electric vehicle and solar panel manufacturers and dump their products into their markets. That has led to a classic protectionist response from the U.S., the EU, Japan, and others as they try to shield their own investments in these industries. The bottom line is that none of these powers are genuinely “green.” They’re all dirty. They’re all expanding their fossil fuel industries while simultaneously investing in green tech for profit, not to mitigate climate change. TH: In the book, you define the rivalry between the U.S. and China as essential to understanding the dynamics of the modern world system. Can you expand on the core tensions between these two states and the potential outcomes of their conflict? AS: First, it’s important to understand the fundamentals. Capitalism produces imperialism. Inter-state and inter-imperialist rivalry is built into the DNA of capitalism. Imperialism isn’t just a policy decision made by this or that government to project economic or geopolitical power. It’s actually a structural result of capitalist competition. National capitals turn to their respective states to protect and project their interests globally. This competition leads states into competition, including armed conflict, over geopolitical hegemony and the division and redivision of the global market. This imperial struggle for dominance has created unstable imperial orders that change over time. We’ve thus seen a sequence of imperial orders: from the multipolar rivalry of the late 19th century, which caused World Wars I and II to the Cold War’s bipolar order, the unipolar moment after the fall of the Soviet bloc, and today’s asymmetric multipolar world order where the central rivalry is between the U.S. and China. As I’ve laid out, China is attempting to assert itself as an imperial power and rival to the US for the division of the world market. The U.S. has responded to the rise of China in ways we’ve seen historically from other hegemonic powers faced with new rivals. It has tried to shore up its dominance and contain and confront its challengers. Before China’s rise, the U.S. had sought to avoid the emergence of a peer competitor with a strategy of superintending global capitalism. But it failed. As a result, the U.S. has adopted a new strategy of great power competition, using classic tactics seen throughout the history of imperialism: economic protectionism, rallying allies to contain its rising rivals, and bolstering its military power. Under the Trump and Biden administrations, the U.S. has mainly focussed mainly on confronting and containing China. This has involved shoring up old alliances like NATO and forming new alliances like the Quad (with Japan, India, and Australia) and the AUKUS pact (with Australia and the UK). Thus, what we’re seeing is classic inter-imperial rivalry playing out across economic, geopolitical, and military dimensions. But this doesn’t mean we’re inevitably headed toward another world war. There are several mitigating factors today that prevent the rivalry from escalating into a full-scale global conflict. For one, the U.S. and China are deeply economically integrated. It’s hard to imagine a product like the iPhone existing without Chinese plants, for example. This integration decreases the likelihood of outright military conflict, as both economies would suffer tremendous costs. However, this interdependence is gradually being unraveled as the U.S. and its corporations seek alternative bases for manufacturing in other parts of the world. Another mitigating factor is the fact that both powers possess nuclear weapons, which they are both expanding and modernizing to ensure greater effectiveness and lethality. So, any conflict between them risks mutually assured destruction (MAD), something that deterred the two great powers during the Cold War from engaging in direct military conflict. Of course, that didn’t rule out their going to war as they nearly did during the Cuban Missile Crisis. These factors do not entirely eliminate the risk of conflict. We didn’t expect to see a large-scale war in Europe, yet Russia launched one with its imperialist invasion of Ukraine. Similarly, a potential flashpoint like Taiwan could trigger a conflict between the U.S. and China, given the high stakes economically and geopolitically. The risk is very real. TH: What does this rivalry and the new dynamics of global capitalism mean for U.S. allies, like the EU and the Spanish state? AS: I touched on this a bit in my previous answer regarding the nature of the rivalry. The key thing to understand is that with the U.S. shift towards great power competition, it’s attempting to bring together all of its historic allies as vassals in its conflict with China. The U.S. is applying heavy pressure on Europe—both through economic institutions like the European Union and military institutions like NATO—to side with it against China. One of the ways the U.S. is doing this is by turning to protectionism, especially in high-tech sectors. They describe it as a “high fence around a small yard,” but that yard keeps expanding, and more and more industries are being protected from Chinese competition—particularly those with military applications. Microchips are a prime example, as they’re critical components in everything from cars to military aircraft like the F-35 fighter jet. Whoever controls the capacity to make microchips, controls large parts of military and surveillance technologies, including artificial intelligence. So the U.S. is building a protectionist barrier around these strategic industries, and it’s pushing the EU to do the same—blocking the export of technology like microchips and the lasers used to manufacture them to China. They’re also trying to prevent the sale of Chinese electric vehicles under the guise of national security, claiming that China could use them to track people’s behavior. Additionally, the U.S. is exerting pressure on EU states to stay out of China’s Belt and Road Initiative. In short, the U.S. wants its allies to adopt the same economic protectionism that it has in place against China. This puts European capital, especially German capital, in a profound economic dilemma. It depends on exports to China, but now faces competition with it, especially in electric vehicles. But if it adopts protectionism, it risks China retaliating and closing off its vital export market. On the military front, the U.S. is pressuring Europe to line up with its military containment of China’s rise. For example, it has pressured NATO—the North Atlantic Treaty Organization—to identify China as a strategic concern and start focusing on the Indo-Pacific region. Essentially, the U.S. is weaponizing NATO against China, and the U.S. will continue to pressure all its allies—including the Spanish state—to align with its strategy economically, militarily, and geopolitically. That pressure is going to be relentless, and it will play out in various, sometimes unpredictable, ways. But Spain will be no exception to this trend. TH: At the moment, the events of the greatest geopolitical consequence are happening in Gaza, and there’s now an increasingly likely possibility of a wider regional war. Could you speak on the consequences of the rivalry between the U.S. and China in this context? AS: Gaza has become the epicenter of regional and imperial conflict, but it’s not the only flashpoint. Taiwan is another, as is Ukraine, and there are other hotspots like the Philippines. These are all countries where questions of national self-determination and inter-imperial conflict intersect. The key for the Left is to support all struggles for national self-determination without exception while opposing any imperial power’s attempts to weaponize these struggles for their own purposes, which all powers will inevitably try to do. That’s the broader framework for understanding what’s happening in Gaza. The U.S. is the main sponsor—militarily, economically, and politically—of the Israeli state, which serves as its enforcer in the Middle East. The U.S. uses Israel, along with reactionary Arab states, to ensure that no Arab country or Iran challenges U.S. control over the region’s oil, which underpins the entire world economy. This means the U.S. is deeply implicated in the genocide in Gaza. It’s not just a sponsor; it’s a co-partner in the settler colonialism, apartheid, occupation, and now the genocide that Israel is carrying out. The U.S. has supported, funded, and armed Israel in its aggression in Gaza, the West Bank, Lebanon, Syria, Iran, and Yemen. While the U.S. is the central imperial player in the region, it’s not the only one. Russia, for example, has consistently supported counterrevolution and reaction in the region. It played a key role in helping Assad crush the Syrian revolution and has maintained a close relationship with Netanyahu, with Putin and Netanyahu publicly celebrating their ties. China’s role isn’t clean either. China is mainly concerned with ensuring the flow of oil from the Middle East to fuel its economic expansion, so it has cultivated both economic and geopolitical relations with any state that can provide that fuel. China has an alliance with Iran, but it has also pushed for normalized relations between Israel and other states in the region—not out of principle, but simply because it wants stability and the oil flowing. China even brokered a deal between Iran and Saudi Arabia, and it’s the second-largest investor in Israel. So, if you support the BDS movement (Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions), you’d need to raise it as a demand against China and its corporations. In response to the current crisis, China has largely taken a symbolic stance. While it’s criticized U.S. support for the genocide to score political points, it has done nothing to aid the Palestinian struggle for self-determination. Any role China has played, such as hosting talks between rival Palestinian factions, has been largely symbolic. China even supports the two-state solution, which has historically been the fake solution U.S. imperialism has proposed for Palestine. Washington’s biggest concern is that its relative loss of power in the region over the last two decades is creating openings for China and Russia to play more aggressive roles in the Middle East. Israel’s expansion of its genocidal war into the region is going to intensify this dynamic, potentially disrupting the normalization deals between Israel and other Arab states and pushing states into rival blocs. You can already see an emerging axis of Russia, Iran, and China aligning against Israel and the U.S. The question now is what the Arab regimes aligned with the U.S. will do, as it’s increasingly untenable for them to openly support the U.S. amid Israel’s genocide. So, there’s a potential for interstate antagonisms to split into a bloc of the U.S. and its allies on one side, and China, Iran, and Russia on the other. But at the same time, all these powers are deeply invested in maintaining the flow of oil, so they may be hesitant to risk destabilizing the region with sharp inter-state schisms. But Israel’s aggression has opened a very unpredictable and volatile moment, and the dynamics at play are dangerous. We’re already witnessing genocide, and the expansion of that genocide into Lebanon could lead to an all-out regional war between Israel and Iran with international repercussions. TH: On that note, I think this next question becomes even more important. What do you think the tasks are for the international Left, and how can we find a way out of this current state of affairs? AS: In some ways, we’re back to the classic questions that the revolutionary Left faced at the start of the 20th century. We’re now in a situation with enormous inter-imperial antagonisms and widespread revolts from below across the globe. The Left faces a strategic question: How do we oppose all the different states—not just imperial ones, but all capitalist states—from below, and build solidarity between labor movements and movements of the oppressed in every country against all imperial powers, capitalist states, and their wars? In the U.S., the most important thing for the Left is to guard against aligning with the U.S. state and its imperial project. There’s a tendency to do that, often by those with reformist politics and an allegiance to the Democratic Party, which is currently co-partner in the genocide. Our primary obligation in the U.S. is to oppose U.S. imperialism—full stop. At the same time, we need to guard against a second temptation, which is to fall into the trap of thinking “my enemy’s enemy is my friend.” That position leads some on the Left to view Washington’s opponents as either lesser evils or even alternatives. But as I’ve discussed earlier, these so-called alternatives like China and Russia are also imperialist, capitalist states built on exploitation, oppression, and reactionary politics. Supporting another imperialist power like China betrays the class struggle and social struggles within China by siding with its state against the country’s workers and oppressed peoples. It also alienates people in the U.S. who rightly view China as a dictatorial, capitalist regime that keeps workers locked in factories amidst a pandemic. That’s no kind of alternative and claiming it is one will only isolate the Left from U.S. class and social struggles, weakening them in the process. The real alternative is to oppose all imperial powers—first and foremost the U.S., but also China—while building solidarity across borders. Today, the global system is deeply interconnected, and this presents real opportunities for such solidarity. Take the iPhone, for instance. It connects workers in Chinese factories, international shipping companies, distributors like Amazon, and retail outlets in the U.S and elsewhere. This interconnected world economy allows for the possibility of forging bonds of solidarity between workers across the globe. Additionally, we have international educational systems with Chinese students participating in campus struggles all over the world, including in the U.S., where they’re often involved in graduate student unionization and strikes. Thus, there are real opportunities within the U.S. to build solidarity with Chinese students, both in common struggles in the U.S. and with those in China. This means we must oppose any kind of U.S. nationalism and anti-Chinese racism, as such bigotry would divide graduate students and undermine union solidarity. The objective basis for international solidarity from below is greater than ever before, and the necessity of it is obvious for anyone seriously thinking about these issues. The problem is subjective and political. We need to build a Left that is militantly committed to internationalism from below—not just as a principle, but as an organizing strategy. How we do this is complex, and every part of the international Left needs to think through how to do it. But either we find a way to build such solidarity, or we will suffer our ruler’s barbarism–their domestic class wars at home and their imperialist wars abroad. So, the Left must organize a new generation of socialist militants who understand the centrality of the old socialist slogan, “Workers of the world unite; we have nothing to lose but our chains.” That is not some quaint historical mantra, but our epoch’s central political project. Either we succeed in this or we face the barbarism in Gaza and the ever-growing list of climate catastrophes.

Title: What will 2025 bring for Linux PCs?

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. The year ahead has a lot in store for Linux users. Many of the trends, hardware products, and software developments below comprise a colorful mix that focuses on the use of Linux in particular. We also include other current and future events in hardware and software that will influence or characterize everyday IT life — Linux or otherwise. The upshot is that Linux users will see a lot of change on the horizon. Raspberry Pi Foundation Since the Raspberry Pi Foundation went public in mid-2024, the future of the successful board computer has been quite uncertain. The share price has been volatile since then, but has held up reasonably well overall. The fresh millions on the stock market open up opportunities for technical innovations for the mini-computer, but on the other hand the project is moving away from its non-profit origins. Nothing concrete is currently known about future models, but prices will be higher than before. The continued production and stocking of older models, as was previously the case, could also fall victim to profit maximization. See also: 10 surprisingly practical Raspberry Pi projects anybody can do The Gnome 47 and KDE Plasma 6 desktops are forcing the switch to the Wayland display protocol by setting Wayland as the standard despite some remaining detail problems. Most Linux distributions with these desktops (Fedora, Ubuntu, Kubuntu, KDE Neon, Endeavour, et cetera) will follow this specification in 2025. The fact remains, however, that apart from Gnome and KDE, only the niche desktop Enlightenment (current version E20) is aggressively pushing for Wayland. The Gnome-like Budgie desktop, as well as Cinnamon (Linux Mint) and Mate, still offer Wayland as an “experimental” option. XFCE (announced for the upcoming version 4.20) and LXQT are just starting their Wayland conversion. Cinnamon running in Wayland. Linux Mint The replacement of the old X11 window system will obviously continue well beyond 2025. This is a stumbling block, not least because every Wayland operation currently still has to drag along the Xwayland mediation layer in order to be able to display older X11 windows. The current Gnome 47 is the first Linux desktop that is at least technically prepared to completely dispense with Xwayland in the future. Debian A new Debian version is released approximately every two years. After version 12 “Bookworm,” which was released in 2023, Debian 13 (“Trixie”) is due in 2025. With Debian “Forky,” the name for version 14 has already been decided. Debian 13 will continue to offer a variant for 32-bit processors, but no longer for very old i386 CPUs, but at least from i686 onwards. i686 CPUs are also ancient processors such as Pentium Pro, Pentium II, Pentium III, and some early Pentium 4 models. The oldest of these CPUs are over 25 years old and date back to the 20th century. Regardless of Debian’s 32-bit continuity, the recycling of such oldies is usually unsatisfactory. New Debian is always immensely important because many derivatives are based on Debian and must also be updated as a result — such as Antix, Bunsenlabs, Kanotix, MX Linux, Linux Mint Debian, Ope Media Vault, Pi-OS, Rescuezilla, Sparky, Q4-OS, Tails, and many more (Ubuntus!). Ubuntu After April 2025, there will be no more update support for Ubuntu 20.04, unless you have taken out the 10-year ESM (Expanded Security Maintenance) support with Ubuntu Pro. On devices with version 20.04, you will then either have to reinstall or make up for several upgrade stages. A new installation with the current LTS version Ubuntu 24.04 is particularly recommended for systems that work as servers. After 14 October 2025, Microsoft will no longer offer free updates for Windows 10 and technical support will be discontinued (EOL, End of Life). As a simple upgrade to Windows 11 will fail for many laptops and PCs due to the high hardware requirements, a significant wave of users switching to Linux desktops can be expected over the course of the next year. Last year’s Linux growth to a market share of around 4.5 percent is probably already linked to this Windows date. Unicon is launching the eLux operating system for companies. The system is designed to combine security, hardware flexibility, and performance. The download requires registration with an email address. Windows 10 will be discontinued on 1 October 2025. If Windows 11 does not run on the hardware, any (even more demanding) Linux will run. Anton Watman/Shutterstock.com Experience has shown that Linux distributions are generally too fragmented to make concerted and aggressive use of the opportunities offered by the Windows runtime. Only some of the typical Windows detractors such as Linux Mint or Zorin-OS will refer to their Windows-like concepts and optimize them. In addition, most tried-and-tested Linux desktops (mostly Debian/Ubuntu-based, in some cases also Arch-based) are also suitable as Windows 10 alternatives. See also: 3 free Linux distros that look and feel like Windows Open Suse Leap 16.0, the successor to Leap 15.6, is not expected until mid-2025 at the earliest. Version 16 aims to end the technical continuity with the previous Leap, but at least promises the possibility of a direct upgrade to Leap 16. If necessary, an interim version 15.7 will be added. openSUSE Open Suse Leap 16 will be an “immutable” Linux. Suse is developing its own Adaptable Linux Platform (ALP) architecture with a write-protected base system that increases security and stability. The required software is to be provided by isolated containers — presumably flatpaks. With its focus on cloud systems and automated system management, Open Suse Leap 16 is likely to follow the trend of recent years. The Suse system is becoming increasingly uninteresting for the needs of a flexible end-user desktop. The same applies to Fedora Workstation, which in the Silverblue “Immutable” version is signalling the path that Fedora generally wants to take. The security and maintenance advantages of the immutable concept are aimed at cloud and server instances and mainly have disadvantages on the desktop. Nix It is perhaps not necessarily the Linux distribution Nix-OS itself, but its concept of “declarative configuration,” which probably has a great future ahead of it. Nix-OS uses a central configuration file as a meta-level. This allows the entire system to be reproduced identically (e.g. for cloud and server instances), but can also be reset to previous system states (relevant for servers and desktops). Package dependencies are avoided because — similar to container formats — software is always stored separately with all dependencies. The concept requires a lot of storage space and the adoption of completely customized methods for package installations and updates. Cloud providers are already in the thick of it, but Nix-OS should still provide some additional convenience features for desktop users. While Microsoft has included the sudo tool as an option for developers in Windows 10/11 in 2024, leading Linux developers want to abolish sudo or offer a better alternative. The new run0 tool is already available in the latest versions of the Systemd init system. IDG In future Linux distributions, run0 will certainly not immediately replace the familiar sudo, but will at best run as an alternative for the time being. The run0 tool has several advantages over sudo: In principle, it requires no configuration, whereas sudo requires the not entirely uncomplicated “/etc/ sudoer.” run0 is based on Polkit, whose individual configuration is not simpler, but is usually unnecessary. As run0 loads an isolated systemd target, it is more secure than sudo, which relies on rights masks in the file system (SUID bit). In addition, run0 gives visual signals in the terminal and window title to indicate the current elevated permissions. We have barely gotten used to the new term IoT (Internet of Things) when the next “internet” is added. IoB — Internet of Behavior — is more or less a consequence of IoT: the Internet of Things with smartwatches, webcams, health trackers, sensors, measuring stations, and smart home devices expands the data material that websites and apps collect through direct communication. IoT provides masses of additional data that can be analyzed statistically (trends, anomalies, causalities). These IoB statistics and behavioral analysis are not only driven by the retail and advertising industries: IoB can provide insurance companies, health insurance companies, traffic planners, the police, and entrepreneurs with interesting information and correlations that do not necessarily have to be personalized. It is not yet clear which IoB analysis will become part of everyday life in the future. Data protectionists are already warning that there is a lack of transparent user consent for data collection. In the context of the growing customs dispute between the USA, EU, and China, Huawei is preparing to say goodbye to Windows operating systems on its laptops. In the future, the Chinese manufacturer intends to offer its self-developed Harmony OS operating system. Harmony OS is based on its own Linux-independent (Hongmeng) kernel. The operating system was previously only planned for Huawei smartphones, but will also be available for laptops in the future. Huawei laptops will run Harmony OS from mid-2025. Microsoft is thus losing a major Windows customer. Huawei Harmony OS is said to perform better than Linux desktops. It is entirely plausible that the Chinese IT giant can achieve this for the hardware it produces itself. However, compatibility with software is problematic. It is not yet clear to what extent Harmony OS will also offer customized standard software or integrate it via a translation layer. Potential buyers of the attractively priced Huawei laptops should consider this question carefully. TP-Link Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) is five years old, many older routers and devices still work with 802.11ac or even older 802.11n. From 2024, there will be more and more devices with radio chips of the new Wi-Fi generation 7 (802.11be). The Linux kernel is prepared for this — from version 6.5 to be precise. Wi-Fi 7 will not only significantly increase data throughput, but will also use MLO (Multi-Link Operation) to communicate across multiple radio bands between the transmitter and receiver devices. This improves both throughput and stability. New DDR5 RAM modules with higher speeds and lower latency will come onto the market in 2025. However, DDR6 is already on the runway: The next generation of DDR RAM is not due to be released until the end of 2025 at the earliest. DDR6 will again be significantly faster than current DDR5 RAM. The specification speaks of at least 8800 MT/s (megatransfers per second) for the first DDR6 generation, which is roughly double that of DDR5. Later DDR6 components should then achieve up to 21,000 MT/s. G.Skill Innovative graphics formats have been flourishing in photography and imaging for years, but they have been very slow to catch on. While all browsers and many image editing applications now support the Google Webp format, the Apple HEIF/HEIC format and the JPEG successor JPEG XL still need help from add-ons for software or additional packages for the system on many systems and image viewers. REDPIXEL.PL The High Efficiency Image File Format (HEIF) is favored by iPhones for photos. HEIC is the associated container format that also stores image sequences, comments, and audio in addition to (HEIF) images. JPEG XL (jxl) is the designated successor to the long-standing JPG standard. In 2025, it is expected that all Linux distributions will increasingly prepare their viewers and file managers for these formats. Experience has shown that the question of which image format will prevail is obsolete: There will simply be a few more in the future, while JPG, PNG, and others will continue to exist. There is no question that there will be no standstill in CPU development in 2025. AMD will introduce new Ryzen CPUs such as “Kraken” and Intel is planning Panther Lake processors based on its latest production technology (18A). The goals are the same — more performance, more efficiency. Alexander56891 / Shutterstock.com Regardless of new CPU records, the new (marketing) term “AI PC” or Copilot PC (Microsoft) will come into focus. In this product class, which performs AI functions on the local device, a fast CPU is not enough — at least a dedicated GPU graphics chip (preferably Nvidia), plenty of DDR5 RAM, and a fast SSD are also required. The more obvious feature that distinguishes an AI PC from a gaming PC or a powerful workstation is the additional NPU chip (Neural Processing Unit). NPUs cannot process AI models any better or faster than the GPU, but they are much more energy-efficient. In other words: computer bolides are AI-capable, but only energy-efficient with an additional NPU. Processors with an NPU extension already exist — from Intel (Lunar Lake), AMD (Ryzen AI), and Qualcomm (Snapdragon). However, it is not yet clear how future-proof these first NPUs are. See also: The AI PC revolution: 18 essential terms you need to know Mass storage devices are experiencing continuous capacity growth every year. New records are on the horizon for 2025: SSD: The maximum capacity of SSDs is expected to increase from the current maximum of around 60TB to 128TB by mid-2025, more than doubling. This has been announced by several manufacturers such as Western Digital, Huawei, and Samsung. Mechanical drives: The classic hard drive is reaching its technical limits and has already seen its greatest leaps in capacity. However, the current maximum of 24- to 32TB should be able to be increased again in future thanks to new HAMR technology (Heat Assisted Magnetic Recording). Seagate is announcing drives with 40TB for 2025, and up to 60- or 80TB by the end of the decade. Jon L. Jacobi NVMe SSD: Capacities of up to 16TB are expected for M.2 NVMe storage on the PCI Express bus by 2025. This means a doubling of the currently largest NVMe SSDs. For end users, the record capacities are hardly relevant and generally hardly affordable. More important is the market law that with new, faster, and larger media, the prices for smaller and medium capacities will fall. USB 4 is the joint successor to USB 3.2 and Thunderbolt 3 with a theoretical maximum throughput of 40Gbps (approx. 5GB/s). USB 4v2 (also “USB 4.0 Gen 4” and more recently “USB4 2.0”) theoretically achieves 80- or 120Gbps. The first controllers and drives of this generation are already on the market. Drivers for USB 4v2 are included in the current Linux kernel. This article originally appeared on our sister publication PC-WELT and was translated and localized from German.

The firm also named the company its “Top Pick.” Concerns include slower demand for previous-generation Hopper products and staggered availability of Blackwell versions. The firm sees this as a natural phase-out rather than a revenue decline, given a substantial backlog expected to sustain sales for several quarters Despite these challenges, the firm expects strong demand for Blackwell to persist and continues to rate Nvidia shares as Overweight, adjusting the price target slightly to $166 from $168. Overall, NVDA ranks 4th on our list of AI news and ratings investors are watching right now. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 13 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy Under $50. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) stands against the other dividend stocks. AI stocks are stealing the spotlight today as the appetite for these services continues to gain traction globally. This surge in interest has temporarily diverted investor attention from dividend-paying equities. This year, dividend stocks have once again lagged behind the market, a trend highlighted by Dan Lefkovitz, a strategist at Morningstar Indexes, during a recent interview with the firm. Here are some commeants from the analyst: “I just want to mention two interesting observations. One, interest rates have come down this year, yet dividend-paying stocks have underperformed. There’s this conventional wisdom that we’ve talked about in the past that falling rates are good for dividend payers and rising rates are bad for dividend payers, yet dividend stocks have underperformed in a falling rate environment. Second, outside of the US, dividend stocks are a little bit ahead of the broad market. We can table those, but I just thought they’re interesting to note.” That said, analysts predict this trend won't persist, as dividend stocks are expected to regain their strength and prominence soon. Bank of America analyst Ohsung Kwon suggested that a dividend revival might be on the horizon. His team anticipates a 10% increase in overall dividends from the companies in the broader market in 2025, driven by investors' growing preference for cash. Highlighting this trend, major tech firms began paying dividends for the first time this year. According to Janus Henderson, these tech giants accounted for roughly 25% of the total underlying dividend growth in the US during the third quarter.

Dan Lefkovitz, a strategist with Morningstar's Index team, emphasized this approach, pointing out that dividend growth is a completely different ball game compared to high-dividend investing. He explained that dividend growth signals a company's strong competitive position and improving prospects. A dividend-growth portfolio typically mirrors the market more closely in terms of sector exposure and growth-versus-value traits, including metrics like price-to-earnings ratios. While it maintains a value bias, it leans more toward the core market than a high-dividend portfolio. Over the years, companies with a track record of steadily increasing their dividends have generally outperformed non-dividend-paying firms while experiencing lower volatility. Although dividends are not set in stone and can vary, as seen in the current climate, they have significantly contributed to overall equity returns over time. Between 1930 and 2023, dividends and their reinvestment made up 40% of the annualized total returns in the broader market, with the rest driven by capital gains. Maintaining steady dividend growth is a demanding goal, as it necessitates exceptional financial stability. For businesses still in their growth phase with relatively lower stock prices, assessing the sustainability of their dividends becomes an essential and simple factor to analyze. This article explores some of the top dividend stocks currently priced under $50. Our Methodology: For this list, we used a Finviz stock screener to find dividend stocks trading below $50 as of the close of December 20. From the initial list, we narrowed down the selection to companies that pay regular dividends to shareholders and possess strong dividend policies, ensuring consistent future dividends. From the resultant list, we picked 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, using Insider Monkey’s Q3 2024 database of 900 hedge funds and their holdings. These stocks are ranked in ascending order of hedge funds having stakes in them. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

This milestone solidified Bitcoin’s standing as a cornerstone financial asset, driven by institutional demand, macroeconomic trends, and regulatory support.

However, caution emerged as: Gold vs Bitcoin Bitcoin’s milestone of surpassing $100,000 underscores its evolution from a speculative asset to a recognized financial instrument. While the rally reflects growing adoption and institutional interest, its sustainability hinges on a balance between regulatory developments, technological progress, and market dynamics. As 2025 approaches, Bitcoin’s role in the global financial ecosystem is poised to grow further. Key global crypto regulatory updates The cryptocurrency regulatory landscape in December 2024 witnessed significant strides globally, marked by pro-crypto policies, pivotal legal precedents, and increased institutional adoption. These developments not only bolstered investor confidence but also highlighted the growing acceptance of digital assets as a mainstream financial category.

Crypto market trust and institutional concerns The increasing involvement of institutions has fundamentally altered market perception. An overwhelming 64.8% of respondents stated that institutional presence significantly boosted trust, thanks to enhanced legitimacy and stability. In contrast, only 9.4% reported a decline in trust.

Regulations vs. innovation Institutions are viewed as both enablers and potential barriers: AMBCrypto’s survey highlights the growing prominence of institutional players in the crypto market, reflecting their ability to bring trust and liquidity while raising questions about decentralization and fairness. As 2025 approaches, the balance between institutional and retail influence will be pivotal in defining the future trajectory of cryptocurrencies. Ethereum’s trajectory in December 2024 reflected its adaptability and innovation, bolstered by performance metrics, staking growth, and ecosystem developments. As a cornerstone of the crypto industry, Ethereum remained pivotal in driving decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs forward, even as it prepared for major upcoming upgrades.

Title: The Rise and Future Fall of MicroStrategy

Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Emil Sandstedt Follow -- 1 Listen Share TLDR: My interest in the story of MicroStrategy started out tangential at first — it was just one of many unconventional outcomes born out of the rising Bitcoin phenomenon. The publicly traded company, although first in the world to pursue a Bitcoin accumulation strategy, flew under the radar of most conventional investors, and it was only after the long Bitcoin winter of 2022 and early 2023 that both old and new narratives from the company and its de facto leader, Michael Saylor, broke through the thawing ice and began to spread among a bewildered audience. 2024 catapulted MicroStrategy to new sensational heights, and I soon realized I was witnessing financial history in the making. The general enthusiasm was unparalleled; sons went “all in” with the savings of their parents while old investors bought new houses from quick gains on leveraged positions. Any public display of hesitation to the many optimistic narratives energizing investment circles was met with scorn or silence. When logical arguments against the company’s ever higher valuation to net assets were put forward, they were answered by vague appeals to unofficial thought leaders or to a vision of a utopian future. On the verge of letting this one be altogether and mentally filing it as just another financial bubble soon to pop, I finally made the decision to work on this report as a veiled but growing Ponzi-scheme element of MicroStrategy’s business became ever clearer. So, having delved deep into the facts and fiction underlying common investor assumptions, it is now my firm belief that what is going on with MicroStrategy will end in disaster for most investors, should affairs not radically alter. It is a play of five parts, presented chronologically to the reader. Emil Sandstedt, 2024–12–06 MicroStrategy’s early history is laid to rest behind a thin curtain, mostly undisturbed by the hands of modern investors. It is known by a few that the company reached big and fell even bigger in the Dotcom Crash of the year 2000, but which growing Internet-focused company wasn’t experiencing great hardships at that time? Yet, could there be clues from those years which could be relevant today, to where the fate of MicroStrategy is heading? Let’s blow away the dust, break the crypt open and see what the passing of decades has caused to be all but forgotten. Starting out as a software company helping other companies make strategic decisions based on large amounts of accumulated data, MicroStrategy had enjoyed considerable interest and growth since it went public in 1998. CEO Michael Saylor had aimed at going public at $6 per share, had filed for $8–10 per share, sold the stock at $12 per share, only to see it rapidly continue all the way up to $46 per share. The appetite for intelligently utilizing digital data was, at this time, enormous. As an example, fast food restaurant clients could, by using MicroStrategy’s software analytics services, understand customer preferences within a geographical context; a customer in Florida was less likely to purchase a certain product than a customer in Chicago, given local circumstances. In a world where the customer is king, predicting what they actually wanted, when, and how, was profits in the making. So with Internet usage growing exponentially in 1999, Saylor thought it was time to ramp up his vison of the digital disruption of the economy. By analyzing and processing data in real-time, MicroStrategy now wanted to deliver a service which could feed useful information, not just to large companies, but to the public. The product, an anywhere personal information network called Strategy.com, was to be offered for a small monthly fee — today a very common model for software companies — and was therefore arguably ahead of its time. Starting modestly, the service was initially to focus on sending out useful information on fickle changes in financial markets to phones, pagers and other outlets. But the goal was more far-reaching than that — when the Washington Post asked Michael Saylor for more details on his vision, he simply noted that “I believe in fate, but all things being equal, I’d rather not be standing in front of a truck when it comes down the street.” With the sprawling information network and with the help of ear-pieces, civilians would be able to receive warnings of an ongoing robbery in the street ahead of them, drivers would receive proactive, intelligent heads-ups about traffic jams before finding themselves in one, and athletes would receive real-time data on weather approaching the game field. Michael Saylor, characteristically, painted a dramatic picture: “Take the police database in D.C. loaded into a network and then call me on the phone when there’s a robbery in my neighborhood going on right now. Don’t walk the dog, right now. There are police with sirens and shotguns running around in your neighborhood looking for three guys with knives. Right now.” The service, in other words, would help make life both easier and safer, with the help of a never-ending tsunami of intelligently processed data. Saylor, having observed the success Amazon had built by utilizing the personalized data of customers, noted casually in an interview, “So we started to ask the question ‘How do we get embedded into everyone’s life?’”. As the theory of the new business was reaching completion, Saylor now sought a $100 million investment, about the size of the company’s annual revenues, to bring it to market. Though a somewhat vague term, the company in other words wanted to bet on “proactive intelligence”. Adding to the examples above, Michael Saylor in another interview brought up the subject of fraud, and how an intelligent software could help mitigate it. In his example, a client is notified about the strange movement of funds from one account to another, followed by an automated text whether or not the client wants to cancel the transaction. It is not hard to see the advantages of such proactive warnings, and they are in fact implemented in multiple forms in today’s digitized economy. But in a way which would later become distinctive of Michael Saylor, he couldn’t help adding that his company was “to take everything from being unintelligent to intelligence…”, and that MicroStrategy was not an ”Internet company”, but an “intelligence company”. That also included disrupting the massive medical insurance industry with the anonymous processing of customer data. The idea that almost all data could be gathered and properly processed for all sorts of clients was a driving force in the appreciation of the value of MicroStrategy shares. Strategy.com was such a bold attempt in these early times of the internet, so all-encompassing, that it was hard to comprehend the potential ramifications stemming from a success of it. If the company could enhance data from hospitals, police stations, stock markets etc. in real-time, there seemed to be no limit to how valuable the output of the algorithms could be. Michael Saylor himself confidently stated that his system ultimately was going to “purge ignorance from the planet”. On a question whether or not going public with his company had changed him, Michael Saylor answered: “I think it’s made me better. It’s forced me to deal with more constituencies. It teaches you some things. Like integrity, for instance. In a public-company world, your word really means something. When you’re private you say, I’m going to do this, and if it doesn’t happen it doesn’t matter. In the public world, you say you’re going to do it, you have to do it. In the public world there’s a difference between 11:59 and 12:01, the last day of March. There’s a tangible difference. One of them is you go to jail if the thing gets signed at 12:01. One of them is the stock is up $500 million and the other one is you’ve just torched the life and livelihood of a thousand families. One minute.” Finishing up the Washington Post interview, he predicted his company would eventually reach $10–20 billion in annual revenue. And at the time, perhaps the prediction did not sound altogether unreasonable. Saylor had after all confidently stated that “I think my software is going to become so ubiquitous, so essential, that if it stops working, there will be riots. […]. I mean that literally. I mean that people will die this year because they didn’t buy my software.” Shares continued to climb in 1999, and in the beginning of the ominous year 2000 the company had become one of the most admired in the Washington region. Shares rose ever higher, and Michael Saylor threw grand parties at his Florida mansion. A plan to build a massive 50-acre Versailles was drafted. But the celebrations and toasts to new times were not to last long. In March, MicroStrategy felt compelled to adapt to new accounting standards put in place a few years earlier to better reflect the reality of the operations of a growing number of software companies in the nation. In practice, this meant that MicroStrategy had overstated its revenues two years in a row, and what was priorly booked as profitable years now turned deeply red. The original 1999 annual profit of $12.6 million was now restated as a loss of as much as $40 million. In a market sensitive to even small misses on investor expectations, the company shares crashed about 62% in a day, reducing Michael Saylor’s net worth by multiple billions of dollars — one of the largest daily personal losses in the world to that date. PricewaterhouseCoopers, the company’s auditors, had put a stamp of approval on past reporting, so the change did not exactly stem from a complete failure in that regard. What had happened with the revenue discrepancy was extremely ironic; a late-night business deal had been struck with the large technology company NCR Corp on September 30th, 1999, but as no flow of goods or money occurred that day, NCR booked it in the fourth quarter of the year, while MicroStrategy booked it in the third quarter. In other words, Michael Saylor had found himself in exactly the situation he so much dreaded during the interviews with the Washington Post earlier in the summer. Had he not booked the revenues stemming from the business deal in the third quarter, the company shares would likely have crashed and severely complicated the funding of the company’s ongoing Strategy.com transformation. Instead, Saylor and the other higher-ups in the company saw shares increase 72% in value since that fateful meeting, paving the way for large sales of their personal holdings for a total of $82 million during the period. That was more than four times the value of previous insider sales since going public. Not only was the revenue booked wrongly, but the deal also included the promise by MicroStrategy to purchase a business unit and some software from NCR, thus netting the total effect of the deal on revenues. “Revenue washing” is a well-established way to artificially inflate booked revenues while not being properly reflected in actual business activity. So, three problems were now glaringly obvious to investors who had just lost a lot of money: revenues had likely been booked in the wrong quarter, the $27.5 million NCR deal involved a tit-for-tat purchase of about $25 million, and the MicroStrategy executives and board members had sold shares that they likely knew were severely overvalued, to the open market. While the details of the NCR deal came to light, a later deal with Primark Corp. to distribute financial information to investors, also attracted the eyes of market analysts. Quite incredibly, Michael Saylor seems to have found himself in the situation yet again, where a business deal was signed and booked in the fourth quarter of 1999, while it was actually carried out and paid for in the first quarter the year after. Investors, oblivious at the time to any wrongdoings in the two separate business deals, had bid up shares above $300 before all the accounting issues came to light. All this seems to have become too much for the SEC, which promptly launched an investigation into the company. It eventually compelled MicroStrategy to admit to booking revenues wrong over the last three years rather than the last two. At this time, shares were down more than 80% since their all-time high. Michael Saylor’s company stake had dropped in value, from $13.6 billion to $1.7 billion. The Strategy.com investment never materialized as the company failed to get approval for new share issuance and sales before the value of the shares cratered in March 2000. A plan to raise up to $2 billion, then the largest stock offering in software industry history, came to nothing. Michael Saylor’s vision of a large proactive intelligence network was put on ice, and the company returned to its tried ways of conventional data mining. The abrupt fall was distinct enough to prompt James Cramer, columnist for TheStreet.com, to state that “This one popped the bubble. MicroStrategy forever changed the Internet mania.” The rise and fall of MicroStrategy would, except for the whispers in obscure investor circles, eventually be followed by a long silence. But the years passed, and Bitcoin finally entered the world and caused an ever-larger stir around the globe. Saylor initially discarded the phenomenon, writing that “#Bitcoin days are numbered. It seems like just a matter of time before it suffers the same fate as online gambling.” But as the network grew, and after various decadent money printing schemes had been put in motion by governments in 2020, something seems to have changed within Michael Saylor. A growing opportunity now lay before him and his company, perhaps larger than all his prior visions put together, as a new untrodden path opened under the gaze of an orange sun. MicroStrategy entered its Bitcoin Exploration phase simply as an enterprise analytics software and services company with a checkered past and with fading growth. There is nothing wrong with that — the company made small profits on the capital it applied to the purpose. Few assumed much future growth in revenues, and valued the company shares accordingly. Total revenues for the second quarter of 2020 were reported as $110.6 million, a 6.1% decrease from the year before. In that same report (10-Q, 2020–06–30), however, the word “Bitcoin” appeared for the first time. What followed was the company with its investors, under the surprised gaze of its peers, boldly moving away from competing with IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, and Salesforce, to standing alone at the door to the growing Bitcoin sector. The report, after announcing the buyback of $250M worth of shares through a modified Dutch Auction, added that: MicroStrategy will seek to invest up to another $250 million over the next 12 months in one or more alternative investments or assets, which may include stocks, bonds, commodities such as gold, digital assets such as bitcoin, or other asset types. (10-Q, 2020–06–30, Exhibit 99.1.) In August 2020, an 8-K document (8-K, 2020–08–11) was filed at the SEC, announcing the purchase of 21,454 Bitcoin at an aggregate purchase price of $250.0 million. The risk factors section of the previously published quarterly report was amended, and Saylor noted in the document that: “Bitcoin is digital gold — harder, stronger, faster, and smarter than any money that has preceded it. We expect its value to accrete with advances in technology, expanding adoption, and the network effect that has fueled the rise of so many category killers in the modern era.” (8-K, 2020–08–11, Exhibit 99.1.) The conventional Treasury Reserve Policy of the company was updated with a Bitcoin-focus in September the same year, with a new 8-K filing. And after the Q2 report had mentioned the word “Bitcoin” once, the Q3 report mentioned it 154 times. The air in the company was now thick with change. During the third quarter of 2020, MicroStrategy ended up owning about 38,250 Bitcoin, purchased for $425 million ($11,111 per Bitcoin). This from a considerable portion of the company cash position. By September 30, 2020, MicroStrategy had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $52.7 million, compared to $565.6 million by the end of 2019. On the 4th of December 2020, MicroStrategy bought 2,574 more Bitcoin (8-K, 2020–12–04). For the annual report of that year, the shift in strategy is again palpable, and the mention of raising capital for the purpose of buying Bitcoin through debt or share issuance could be spotted for the first time: MicroStrategy® pursues two corporate strategies in the operation of its business. One strategy is to grow our enterprise analytics software business and the other strategy is to acquire and hold bitcoin. […]. [A]nd we may from time to time, subject to market conditions, issue debt or equity securities in capital raising transactions with the objective of using the proceeds to purchase bitcoin. (10-K, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, p.5.) Approximately 70,469 Bitcoin were purchased in total in the year 2020, indicating many were purchased at the very end of the year. All Bitcoin now had an average purchase price of approximately $15,964 per coin. The later batches of purchases were made with an issuance of $650 million principal amount of 0.75% convertible senior notes due 2025. The issuance was announced in December 2020, and had a conversion price of about $397.99 ($39.799 for the post-split shares of August 2024) and thus MicroStrategy went from purchasing the new volatile asset with surplus cash, to purchasing it with convertible debt. One of the first things incredulous onlookers reacted to was the low interest rate for the bonds — something which we will return to later. In early 2021, MicroStrategy, already operating under its amended Treasury Reserve Policy, officially adopted a Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy, further strengthening that focus. Within weeks, a new convertible bond issue was announced (8-K, 2021–02–16), this time of up to $1,050 million of 0% convertible senior notes due 2027. Though larger than the first issue, its zero coupon meant the lender’s full focus was on the equity component of the convertible bond. The focus of the borrower was, as we know, to purchase more Bitcoin with the proceeds. Conversion price of the bonds was priced at about $1,432, meaning about $143 in 2024 post-split shares. After the purchase of more Bitcoin, the number of Bitcoin per share climbed above 0.001. For the first time, investors in the company had to contemplate the nuances of MicroStrategy having issued multiple types of convertible bonds, as the conversion into shares of one issue could affect the parameters allowing conversion for other issues. Some confusion arose out of this, which we will speak more of later. In June 2021, a third bond issue was announced, this time of $500 million worth of 6.125% senior secured notes due 2028. This being a conventional straight bond, it can be observed how the market viewed the risk of MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy, through the coupon payments. Herein lies the first clue in how to view the low coupon payments of the first two issues. Were the earlier bonds really as cheap as they seemed at a first glance? It was a relevant question that investors could now ponder. At the time of this third bond issue MicroStrategy owned 92,079 Bitcoin, and now more could be acquired. As of January 31, 2022, MicroStrategy held approximately 125,051 Bitcoin (8-K, 2022–02–01) which were acquired at an average purchase price of about $30,200 per coin. On the 29th of March 2022, a fourth debt issue was announced, this time with Silvergate Bank, of $205 million secured by Bitcoin held in MicroStrategy’s collateral account. The loan had a floating rate equal to the SOFR 30 Day Average plus 3.70%, with a floor of 3.75%. The collateral was set at double the loaned amount, $410 million. Saylor concluded that “the SEN Leverage loan gives us an opportunity to further our position as the leading public company investor in bitcoin.” The Silvergate loan was paid back in March 2023 at a discount (8-K, 2023–03–24), due to the interest rate climbing up towards 8%. The payment could be made by the company issuing new MicroStrategy shares, though not yet at a premium to net assets. This meant that three bond issues, of which two were convertible, were still outstanding. In the 2022 annual report the company’s Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy had clearly overtaken any focus on the software business, as seen in the number of mentions of “Bitcoin”, and in the stated order of company objectives. As of February 15, 2023, MicroStrategy held approximately 132,500 Bitcoin with an average purchase price of approximately $30,137 per Bitcoin. Further purchases that year were funded mainly by the issuance and sale of new shares (8-K, 2023–06–28). As MicroStrategy at the time traded near its net asset valuation, meaning its cash and Bitcoin holdings, the share issuance and purchases were not much affecting the company capital structure. Not until the end of 2023 did the Bitcoin price recover enough to surpass MicroStrategy‘s cost basis. At that time, the company held 189,150 Bitcoin, with an average purchase price of $31,168 per coin. Starting in 2024, the market valuation of MicroStrategy in proportion to its Bitcoin holdings quickly increased to about two. This meant that the implied valuation of a Bitcoin held by the company was double that of a Bitcoin trading at exchanges. The software business, now a very small part of the company’s dealings, had become more or less irrelevant and could share no consideration in the total valuation. Investors were bidding on shares because of the Bitcoin exposure, and nothing else. Before the approval of the Bitcoin ETF in January 2024, a popular narrative circulated around the assumption that the premium earlier had manifested itself due to MicroStrategy offering the only possible exposure to Bitcoin for various institutional investors. MicroStrategy mentioned this dynamic in its annual report for 2023: On January 10, 2024, the SEC approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin ETPs, the shares of which can be sold in public offerings and are traded on U.S. national securities exchanges. The approved ETPs commenced trading directly to the public on January 11, 2024, with a trading volume of $4.6 billion on the first trading day. On January 11, 2024, and in the subsequent days following the SEC’s approval of the listing and trading of spot bitcoin ETPs, the trading price of our shares of class A common stock declined significantly relative to the value of our bitcoin. To the extent investors view our class A common stock as providing exposure to bitcoin, it is possible that the value of our class A common stock may also have included a premium over the value of our bitcoin due to the prior scarcity of traditional investment vehicles providing investment exposure to bitcoin, and that the value declined due to investors now having a greater range of options to gain exposure to bitcoin and investors choosing to gain such exposure through ETPs rather than our class A common stock. (10-K, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, pp. 24–25.) As the premium to the company’s net asset value quickly recovered and continued to increase in the following months, despite the approval, some went in search of other explanations or narratives. The quickly increasing share price mostly dissuaded such considerations, however, and optimism reigned supreme. While some mulled over the rising premium to net asset value, the company issued more convertible debt for the first time in almost three years (8-K, 2024–03–11). $800 million worth of unsecured convertible senior notes due 2030 with a 0.625% interest rate meant more Bitcoin could be accumulated with the proceeds. Here, for the first time in a long time, could MicroStrategy make use of the premium to its net asset value. A few days later, another issue was made of $600 million worth of unsecured convertible senior notes due 2031 with a 0.875% interest rate (8-K, 2024–03–19). As of February 14, 2024, the company held about 190,000 Bitcoin, with a purchase price of $31,224 per coin. MicroStrategy had now officially morphed into the “world’s first Bitcoin development company”, according to its annual report for 2023 (10-K, 2023, p.7). What, exactly, this entailed is hard to determine, but a qualified guess is an internal focus was shifting towards building blockchain analytics tools, first layer Bitcoin clients, Lightning Network clients, and so on. Any Bitcoin software useful to the entity running it, could fetch a continuous yield as real as the yield from Microsoft software. As of April 26, MicroStrategy had accumulated 214,400 Bitcoin, meaning the milestone of owning more than 1% of all supply had finally been achieved. The coins were acquired for approximately $35,180 per coin. Total revenues, per the Q1 report (8-K, 2024–04–29), was $115.2 million, down 5% year-over-year, further emphasizing the fading relevance of the non-Bitcoin parts of the company. In June, a fifth convertible bond issue was conducted (8-K, 2024–06–17). The bonds were $800 million worth of unsecured convertible senior notes due 2032 with a 2.25% interest rate. Almost simultaneously, the company’s first convertible bond issue with a principal of $650M and a conversion price below the current share price, was prematurely redeemed by converting it all into equity (8-K, 2024–06–13). Capital structure decisions taken three and a half years ago now made themselves known. Though more Bitcoin were purchased with the proceeds from the fifth convertible bond issue, the Bitcoin per share ratio seems to have increased only marginally at this time. In July, MicroStrategy announced a 10-for-1 split (8-K, 2024–07–11). All debt contracts automatically changed in proportion, and the report has previously dealt with post-split conversion prices for the convenience of the reader. In September, the company announced Bitcoin purchases for over $1 billion, conducted with proceeds from share issuance (8-K, 2024–09–13). This meant it continued to take advantage of the premium to net asset value, and its accelerating accumulation now reached 244,800 Bitcoin. Also in September, a sixth convertible bond issue was planned, to raise enough funds to redeem the 6.125% 2028 Senior Secured Notes issued in June 2021 (8-K, 2024–09–16). The move is in line with a capital structure optimization strategy, as the new convertible bond issue would be done with shares at a premium. The issue was $1.01 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.625% convertible senior notes due 2028 with a $183.19 conversion price, and all the secured bonds of 6.125% were consequently redeemed — a good move by the MicroStrategy team. The company’s bond schedule now looked something like the following: The exploration phase was concluded; the company had now found its orange path to success, and it lay not in Bitcoin- or non-Bitcoin software development, but in pursuing accretive treasury operations. In a historical announcement in connection with the 2024 Q3 earnings report (10-K, 2024–10–31), the company, in a hat-tip to Satoshi, announced the goal of a $21 billion at-the-market (ATM) equity offering — meaning share issuance — as well as a target of raising $21 billion using fixed-income securities. The plan was to conclude over the course of the next three years. At the time of the launch of the plan the debt approximately amounted to a $4.26 billion principal. The rapid shift from being a Bitcoin Development Company to a Bitcoin Treasury Company is clearly seen in the change of the Business Overview section of the Q2 report and the Q3 report. The latter, having pushed all software development, on Bitcoin or otherwise, to the background, now stated: MicroStrategy® is the world’s first and largest Bitcoin Treasury Company. We are a publicly traded company that has adopted Bitcoin as our primary treasury reserve asset. By using proceeds from equity and debt financings, as well as cash flows from our operations, we strategically accumulate Bitcoin and advocate for its role as digital capital. Our treasury strategy is designed to provide investors varying degrees of economic exposure to Bitcoin by offering a range of securities, including equity and fixed income instruments. In addition, we provide industry-leading AI-powered enterprise analytics software, advancing our vision of Intelligence Everywhere. We leverage our development capabilities to explore innovation in Bitcoin applications, integrating analytics expertise with our commitment to digital asset growth. We believe our combination of operational excellence, strategic Bitcoin reserve, and focus on technological innovation positions us as a leader in both the digital asset and enterprise analytics sectors, offering a unique opportunity for long-term value creation. (10-K, 2024–10–31, p.26.) What a Bitcoin Treasury Company meant in practice was simultaneously explained by the new MicroStrategy CEO Phong Le, in an 8K-filing: “As a Bitcoin Treasury Company, we plan to use the additional capital to buy more bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset in a manner that will allow us to achieve higher BTC Yield.” (8-K, 2024–10–30, Exhibit 99.1.) So with yet another rebranding of the business to a Bitcoin Treasury company, with a stated goal to create Bitcoin yield — a metric first spotted in September (8-K, 2024–09–16) — MicroStrategy entered The Golden Age in its pursuit of a place in the history books. Now fully focused on extracting Bitcoin yield to the fullest extent, the company defined the yield as, BTC Yield is a key performance indicator (“KPI”) that represents the % change period-to-period of the ratio between the Company’s bitcoin holdings and its Assumed Diluted Shares Outstanding. Assumed Diluted Shares Outstanding refers to the aggregate of the Company’s actual shares of common stock outstanding as of the end of each period plus all additional shares that would result from the assumed conversion of all outstanding convertible notes, exercise of all outstanding stock option awards, and settlement of all outstanding restricted stock units and performance stock units. (8-K, 2024–10–30, Exhibit 99.1.) The Bitcoin yield could come from multiple sources, and MicroStrategy has to this date utilized some of them more than others. By selling shares through ATM offerings at a premium to net asset value, the Bitcoin yield could come out of the proceeds from buyers of the newly issued shares. The total Bitcoin yield is in that situation precisely equal to the total premium paid by these marginal buyers. In other words, it is not inherent to the ATM offering itself, but is provided from outside the corporate structure. By raising funds through convertible bond issues, a positive Bitcoin yield could similarly come from Bitcoin purchases made with the proceeds from buyers of the bonds, while a negative yield could later materialize should the convertible bonds not convert in the future. By issuing straight bonds, a positive Bitcoin yield could also come from the immediate proceeds, but would very likely turn negative in the future when the debt had to be repaid. This last method has been employed only once by the company (twice if counting the short-lived Silvergate Bank issue). The first two methods are much more lucrative with shares trading at a premium to company net assets. If shares are at a premium, this constitutes an arbitrage opportunity for MicroStrategy when utilizing the ATM offerings. Though not strictly an arbitrage, convertible bonds issued while the company trades at a premium create opportunities as well. If the bond holders in the future convert the bonds at inflated conversion prices, they receive newly issued shares at a price often above the company’s net asset value, and the generated Bitcoin yield would then stand in proportion to this premium. All this considered, the company’s 21/21 Plan logically focused on the first two types of treasury operations; more shares and more convertible bonds were to be issued. Within two weeks of the bold 21/21 Plan MicroStrategy had bought approximately 27,200 Bitcoin for $2.03 billion, at an average price of approximately $74,463 per coin (8-K, 2024–11–12, Item 8.01). The purchase seems however to have been made by depleting the previously undertaken ATM offerings, and any new purchase was now to be made through the new plan. On the 18th of November, we could first see such a filing (8-K, 2024–11–18). The company had bought 51,780 new Bitcoin for $4.6 billion in cash, at an average price of about $88,627 per coin. This catapulted the company’s Bitcoin holdings to over 300,000 for the first time, marking yet another milestone. Over 13 million new shares were issued to fund this. Two days later, on the 20th of November, the company’s largest convertible bond issue to date was announced (8-K, 2024–11–20). $3 billion was raised at 0%, with a conversion price of $672.40 at 55% premium, and with maturity in 2029. This meant that both the ATM offering arm and the convertible debt arm of the 21/21 Plan were being utilized. Issuance now occurred at a pace hard to keep up with, as the MicroStrategy team wanted to take advantage of the company’s shares trading at a premium to net assets. On the 2nd of December the company’s Bitcoin holdings reached above 400,000 for the first time as more shares had been issued and sold (8-K, 2024–12–02). Bitcoin yield for 2024 was now enormous, and about half of the ATM offering arm of the 21/21 Plan had been exhausted. With Bitcoin yield surpassing even the highest company estimates of the Q3-report, everything was going better than planned. The new shares hitting the bid on enthusiastic buyers in record numbers did nothing to dent the premium to net assets — in fact, November saw net asset multiples at the highest levels in years. With shares trading at 200% above net asset value, this meant the MicroStrategy treasury team could issue and sell shares representing ownership of 1 Bitcoin, to fund the purchase of 3 new Bitcoin. Net proceeds, 2 Bitcoin, would then be the Bitcoin yield, divided and given to all shareholders in proportion to ownership of the company. The 2 Bitcoin would be the Bitcoin per share increase in aggregate. There are a number of reasons the company could extract Bitcoin yield at the pace it now was doing. Investors argued that MicroStrategy’s debt was cheap. And indeed, it borrowed billions of dollars and paid often less than 1% in annual coupons — far below official inflation numbers. In a world swimming in surplus cash, it seemed lenders were willing to part with capital at record low interest rates. While this debt mostly came in the form of convertible bonds, it was argued that the company would not suffer dilution, because the debt was accretive with shares trading at a premium to net asset value. In fact, investors clamored for this type of dilution, seeing as the Bitcoin per share metric could continuously increase. The premium to net assets, it was also argued, came from the fact that MicroStrategy was a “levered play” on Bitcoin. With ETFs, investors either had to suffer the dull movements of an asset without leverage, or face the large risks and volatility decay of levered ETFs. With MicroStrategy, you could get a levered upside, but withstand being wiped out in prolonged downturns, as proven in 2022 and 2023. Because of the company’s flexibility to use “intelligent leverage”, the premium seemed reasonable to any thrill-seeking bitcoiner. It was argued that the premium also originated from “regulatory arbitrage”. With this, investors pointed to the fact that the company helped facilitate exposure to Bitcoin for institutional portfolios not allowed to own Bitcoin, or even an ETF, outright. The bond market, very large but also very restricted, had with MicroStrategy’s innovative convertible bonds finally a way to get exposure to Bitcoin on the upside, while being protected to the downside through the bond “floor” — the principal amount. It did not seem unreasonable to assume that if MicroStrategy now was the main actor providing such financial products, it of course should reap profits from the operations, manifesting itself in the share premium. At this time, the popular narrative of an “infinite money glitch” was used to rationalize a premium as well. And on the face of it, it seemed reasonable. MicroStrategy could issue convertible bonds with conversion price at a premium and buy Bitcoin with the proceeds. As the price of Bitcoin increased, the company’s fundamental value increased, meaning shares increased in value as well. With the higher valued shares, the company could now issue even more bonds, in a seemingly circular flywheel dynamic. Another version of this narrative is the notion that MicroStrategy conducts a “speculative attack” on the fiat currencies. So when the 21/21 Plan was initiated, and with the above considerations in mind, investors could foresee large Bitcoin yield payments to the shareholder owned company coffers. The shares increased in price accordingly. Within less than a month, Saylor could announce that the company had achieved a Bitcoin yield surpassing 40% year-to-date — an enormous number compared to the yield of traditional finance. Within five weeks since launch, the year-to-date Bitcoin yield had surpassed 60%. Everything crushed expectations, and it appeared to many as if the Bitcoin yield could soon be extracted in a near unlimited supply as a stagnant fiat economy realigned its rusting axis with a new, pristine Bitcoin foundation. While the ATM offering activities were absorbed by the market happily enough, the demand for the company’s convertible bond issues seemed near bottomless as well as they grew ever larger in size. Michael Saylor had become the uncontested hero of many bitcoiners. Having accumulated the single largest Bitcoin hoard the world had ever seen, nothing could stop the company’s ascendancy. Or could it? While foreshadowing clearly can be read between the lines of the earlier rationalizations of MicroStrategy’s valuation, it should be remembered that all this mainly took place in a market where equities reached all time highs, gold reached all time highs, and finally, Bitcoin and MicroStrategy reached all time highs. Whatever unstructured thoughts investors had in their heads all seemed vindicated by the reality of riches quickly made. No one had much appetite to consider what was happening through a lens of first principles, where complex financial dynamics are broken down in smaller and smaller parts that you know to be true. As the premium on MicroStrategy shares to net assets increased and not decreased with the accelerating ATM offerings, it was simply accepted by some as a truth within the asset, rather than as a contradiction in need of logical inquiry through laws of finance. Let us now go through many of the popular narratives and see what substance they all really hold. “Don’t forget the dirt cheap loan (.063%) he secured for 6 or 700M.” — Reddit user #1. “Imagine loaning someone 700M and 0% interest instead of buying btc.” — Reddit user #2. It is an easy mistake to make, in assuming that a low interest rate on a debt instrument means it is cheap. But because MicroStrategy’s many bond issues for the purpose of buying Bitcoin are convertible to equity at a predefined conversion price, a low interest rate on the bonds can’t be compared with interest rates on normal loans. It should go without saying that if lenders demand more than 4% from the US Government, they will not simultaneously demand less than 1% from MicroStrategy — a company with decreasing revenues and where the main business now consists of buying and holding Bitcoin. Convertible bonds are hybrid securities with debt-like and equity-like features. They are in practice regular bonds with free embedded call options, meaning the price (also known as the premium) of the call options makes up for the lender’s loss of a high yield, or coupons. Here is a simplified illustration of a convertible bond’s value at maturity: In other words, with the convertible bond issues, MicroStrategy had not found a philosopher’s stone, but could bypass a high interest rate on its debt only by giving away upside as the bonds convert into equity at conversion price. Just because investors wish the company could borrow cheaply, does not make it so. The company’s straight bond issue in June 2021 was priced at 6.125% coupon payments, giving a truer indication of the company’s cost of capital. To further emphasize the point, consider for a second what could happen if MicroStrategy were to move the maturity date further away, or lower the conversion price of the convertible bond issue, meaning the strike price of the embedded call option. A situation could then arise where a lender pays MicroStrategy for the privilege of lending to the risky company! The yield on the bonds turns negative. While seemingly unreasonable at first glance, it is simply a result of a large prepayment by MicroStrategy in the form of the free call options, for the privilege of “borrowing cheaply”. We can conclude that the narrative breaks down, yet it is repeated regularly by many MicroStrategy investors every time another convertible bond issue is undertaken. Some investors seem to have misunderstood another aspect of the company’s convertible bonds. It concerns the notion that the company is protected from dilution due to how the convertible bond issues are structured. And it is not a surprise that many are confused. Consider for example the wording from the very first company announcement of a new issue: “Subject to certain conditions, on or after December 20, 2023, MicroStrategy may redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any […].” This sounds like a great deal to MicroStrategy — not so much for the lender. But this is common wording for convertible bonds. It does not mean that if the share price surpasses the higher conversion price stipulated for the convertible bond, MicroStrategy can somehow redeem the bonds just before they were to convert into equity (and as a consequence stop the dilution of existing shareholders). The wording is to force the bond holder to convert to equity, should that not happen for some reason. Certain bond investors may for example be market neutral hedge funds that short sell the shares while buying the convertible bonds. Many of them would rather the bonds not quickly convert — they seek volatility to profit from gamma trading. In practice, non-conversion is a situation which should never occur if conversion conditions have been fulfilled. Given a choice, bond holders of course want the higher valued shares at conversion price, rather than the initial principal amount plus a bit of interest. Looking at an SEC filing from MicroStrategy three and a half years after the first convertible bonds were issued, when early conversion of these notes to new shares actually took place, further strengthens this understanding: On June 13, 2024, the Company announced that it delivered a notice of full redemption (the “Notice”) to the trustee of the Company’s outstanding 0.750% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the “2025 Notes”). The aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes being redeemed is $650.0 million, which is equal to the current aggregate principal amount of 2025 Notes outstanding and held by investors. The Notice calls for the redemption of all of the outstanding 2025 Notes (the “Redemption”) on July 15, 2024 (the “Redemption Date”), at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2025 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the Redemption Date, unless earlier converted. As a result of the delivery of the Notice, at any time prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on July 11, 2024, the 2025 Notes are convertible, at the option of the holders of the 2025 Notes, at the applicable conversion rate of 2.5126 shares of the Company’s class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount (reflecting a conversion price of $397.99 per share). (8-K, 2024–06–13) In summary, if the share price increases, there will be conversion of these debt instruments into equity, meaning new shares. BitMEX research understood this to be the case as well while recently investigating the company’s capital structure. MicroStrategy is not protected from dilution — if it were, the lenders in the first convertible bond issue would not agree to a 0.75% coupon, but would likely demand something closer to a 6–10% coupon. As MicroStrategy issued more convertible debt, a question arose as to whether the potential dilution of equity by some convertible bonds affects the other convertible bonds or not. The answer lies in anti-dilutionary clauses. Consider that for convertible bonds the conversion ratio = principal amount/conversion price. Anti-dilutionary clauses means that the conversion ratio increases in proportion to dilution, meaning the conversion price decreases in proportion (as principal amount stays the same). A 5% dilution from one bond converting into equity, in other words, lowers the conversion price of the other bonds accordingly. Another way to view it is that the “strike prices” of all other issued call options, as baked into the convertible bonds, decrease in proportion to dilution. If there were no anti-dilutionary clauses, the company could simply issue shares and sell them to keep the share price from ever reaching the conversion price stipulated for the various issues. Lenders would for obvious reasons not accept such a convertible bond at low yield, because the free call option would be engineered to expire worthless. Again, they would demand perhaps a 6–10% coupon, not less than 1%, which has been the case for MicroStrategy. “Buy Bitcoin, Bitcoin goes up, Stock is tied to Bitcoin, Stock goes up, Sell stock, use cash to buy more Bitcoin, repeat. Infinite money glitch.” — Reddit user Somewhat related to the narrative of “cheap debt”, is the popular claim that MicroStrategy has found an “infinite money glitch”. An investor may for example argue that MicroStrategy can issue shares or convertible debt, sell it, purchase Bitcoin with the proceeds, the price of Bitcoin increases, the MicroStrategy share price increases as a function of the underlying Bitcoin holdings, and the company issues and sells even more convertible debt. And round it goes. But MicroStrategy does not have control over the Bitcoin price; the size of the issues is dwarfed by Bitcoin’s total market capitalization. Whatever buy pressure the company can apply on the Bitcoin price through these treasury operations, is multiple times offset by the sell pressure applied by the new issuance on the MicroStrategy share price. Note that the sell pressure is immediate if from share issuance or from convertible bond issues bought by market neutral hedge funds. The sell pressure is latent and may occur in the future if from convertible bond issues bought by regulatory restricted investors seeking Bitcoin exposure in roundabout ways. But there is ultimately no way around it all, unless the company were to pursue regular bond issuance, meaning the total risk undertaken by the company increases in proportion to the leverage. So any “infinite money glitch”, could just as well transform into permanent monetary losses should the company have to liquidate parts of its Bitcoin holdings or raise funds in a depressed market environment as the convertible bonds finally mature below conversion price. In other words, there is no glitch, but mainly debt-fueled risk taking which may give a certain boost to the upside, or a fatal blow to the downside. It remains to be seen how current treasury operations will affect the company when times are bad. The potential for creating shareholder value through capital structure shenanigans must obviously be discounted by the very real risk of future fire sales. “It is going up forever Laura”, though a catchy meme, is not economic reality. With the continued issuance of shares through ATM offerings to purchase more Bitcoin, onlookers thought that Saylor conducted some sort of magic trick, where he with no additional risk could increase the company’s Bitcoin per share ratio. It needs to be stressed that the issuance in 2023 and early 2024 was conducted with little to no premium to net asset value. In practice, this meant that any Bitcoin purchase through such a measure is fully offset by the dilution of the shares. The company may own 10% more Bitcoin after everything has been concluded, but any old shareholder has been diluted by about 10% as well. The Bitcoin per share ratio can’t increase this way — it is only possible with instruments such as regular bonds (meaning higher risk), convertible bonds (meaning higher risk), or with the issuance of new shares if the premium to net asset value is above one. Being generous to the prominent bitcoiners discussing the dynamics in the referenced video, they do in fact mention issuance during high price to earnings (P/E) ratios. The P/E ratio for MicroStrategy is currently irrelevant, however, and what they need to look at is, as has been pointed out, the premium to net asset value. MicroStrategy has no earnings to speak of, in relation to its high market valuation. Its P/E can in the future increase or decrease while booking unrealized gains or losses on the Bitcoin it owns, but that does not mean it is time to issue shares and buy more Bitcoin (or sell Bitcoin to buy back shares). The company should only consider such issuance if the premium has climbed some way above one. And such a scenario, in fact, happened a few months after the above discussion. It can be added here that the same dynamic holds true for convertible bond issuance. MicroStrategy can, if shares trade at a premium to net asset value, issue and sell the convertible bonds with a high conversion price, to the detriment of potential buyers of the bonds. As the shares trade at a premium, it is evident that the bond conversion price must be at an even higher premium, causing conversion conditions to be unusually hard to meet. As with the ATM offerings, MicroStrategy is better off issuing convertible debt when shares are at a premium. This share premium should not be assumed, however, but that will be discussed later in the report. More P/E-related confusion came years later, as MicroStrategy’s treasury operations brought heaps of Bitcoin yield to excited investors. In a clever twist of definitions, Saylor took this yield to be equivalent to earnings, and from there implied an extremely high fundamental value of the company based on a “P/E ratio” as well as “earnings growth” snapshot. There were multiple things wrong with this narrative. For P/E to be relevant in company valuation, the denominator must be somewhat consistent over time. A high one-off earnings number can make any company look undervalued versus peers, but it is all an illusion should that high earning not be followed by similar numbers. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin yield is provided mostly by retail investors buying company shares at a premium, and there is a finite supply of those. It is not honest to extrapolate temporarily high Bitcoin yield and imply the company should be valued much higher — that’s not how it works. Capturing the premium in ATM offerings is an activity with a finite lifespan, given the nature of the operation. Furthermore, part of the Bitcoin yield also stems from the convertible bond issues, and they come with a risk; the bonds may not always convert, meaning the principal amount would need to be paid back. Having then already categorized the Bitcoin yield stemming from such proceeds as earnings, is an Enron-like categorization error. The outstanding bonds in question must mature or redeem before booking the Bitcoin yield as earnings. Mark Meldrum pointed out exactly this. “#Bitcoin is a swarm of cyber hornets serving the goddess of wisdom, feeding on the fire of truth, exponentially growing ever smarter, faster, and stronger behind a wall of encrypted energy.” — Michael Saylor While MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin accumulation strategy kicked into high gear in 2024, it was argued that Bitcoin was the best reserve asset to hold there is for a company, because it has no drag, or no decay. The asset’s low maintenance costs were compared to those of the heavy machinery of Bristol-Myers Squibb, technical monstrosities that for obvious reasons are in need of constant service and care. The comparison fails because the machinery has an inherent yield — it produces more than what it consumes, or it would not have been painstakingly constructed — whereas the Bitcoin of MicroStrategy so far is a “dead asset”, sound asleep at the custodians without any conventional yield. While the comparison to physical capital is halting, it should be realized that even if one were to view them that way, MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings still impose costs. Someone, somewhere, is paying the Bitcoin miners, or the network has no hashrate and subsequently is susceptible to DoS attacks. Assuming that it is others, and not MicroStrategy, that will bear the brunt of this cost is probably a mistake. It should also be added that MicroStrategy makes use of US custodians — the decay being the annual costs and risk of theft and confiscation there. Bitcoin is not a completely cost-less asset to own, and should not be characterized that way. A master wordsmith of analogies, Michael Saylor has provided his share of comparisons as well. One of the more famous ones is that Bitcoin is a “Cyber Manhattan”, digital real estate which people should want to buy and own for a hundred years. Having accumulated a considerable portion of this digital real estate within a company framework, investors were soon to realize the true value of MicroStrategy. This comparison halts on many accounts. While painting real estate in Cyber Manhattan as immortal, as not subject to a fickle or corrupt mayor, to physical decay, to taxes, to regulations, to break-ins etc., this is first of all forgetting that all such factors can change. Many nations are already considering taxes on unrealized gains, and to prop up their own failing currencies and bonds, such assets may obviously be excluded from the tax schemes. But the most obvious difference between Bitcoin and real estate is the yield received from rental properties. This is a sector which will never go away, because investors always seek yield. Even in a hypothetical hyperbitcoinized world, investors can invest in the real estate market and earn Bitcoin yield forever. Again, Bitcoin is mostly a dead asset, as is a gold coin, or a seashell. It does not yield in itself (and shouldn’t). For yield it must first be traded for a capital good, such as ownership in factories, skyscrapers, service firms etc. Another popular but vague Saylor analogy is that the company’s Bitcoin are digital capital, and that this is something novel and exclusive in the economy. Capital are production goods — goods of higher order. They are goods that are aquired for the purpose of producing consumption goods. Any software used by companies around the globe is digital capital. Any currencies used by banks to create financial products or services are digital capital. The term is not at all exclusive to Bitcoin, and ironically, most of the time when Bitcoin owners think they hold “digital capital”, they hold the coins in cold storage, just as a gold owner may keep gold coins in a vault. If the good is not used for producing another good, then it is simply not capital. There is nothing wrong with that — not everything you own must be geared towards production. “Don’t try to put some premium trading bullshit. Don’t try to make something up from thin air. Because all your models are fucking broken.” — MicroStrategy thought leader. Notwithstanding the fact that the belief in a persisting premium to net asset value, or NAV, is itself a model, we are now approaching the most critical takeaways of the report. As 2024 proceeded with MicroStrategy shares exploding upward, and as the premium to the company’s net assets persisted in spite of the go-ahead of new Bitcoin instruments, some onlookers voiced their confusion about all this. Simultaneously, the popular Quant Bros duo released their first video on pre-split MicroStrategy, titled “Can MicroStrategy (MSTR) hit $10,000?”, outlining something which “the Ben Graham philosophy would just never understand”. The high valuation forecasting was based on the assumption that shares could uphold the premium. Together with the Bitcoin yield narrative explored later on, it is the most important narrative within MicroStrategy investment circles today. They form the basis from which an immense wealth transfer from new buyers to old ones is occurring. Let us start by investigating this premium to net asset value narrative, and the many shapes and forms it currently comes in. With the growing amount of issued convertible debt for the purpose of accumulating more Bitcoin, investors found themselves warming to the notion that owning MicroStrategy shares instead of owning actual Bitcoin, was a “leveraged play” on the latter. Intuitively, it felt like the leverage was in strict proportion to the debt ratio. But Mark Meldrum rightly pointed out that this is misleading. If shareholders are levering by senior convertible debt, the leverage is rather to the downside than to the upside. If the share price increases, the debt is all converted into equity at conversion prices, diluting shareholders. If the share price decreases, the debt is not converted, but the shareholders must eventually pay the principal amount as well as coupons, if any. Meldrum is slightly too harsh in his conclusion that there is no leverage to the upside. It should be remembered that the conversion prices of the various bond issues in general are about 35–50% above the price of MicroStrategy shares at the time of bond issuance. Because of this, there is leverage to the upside in proportion to the debt ratio of the company, but only up to the conversion price, at which the debt of the bond issue is eventually converted, and old shareholders must share in further price appreciation with the new ones. The upside from conversion price and onward has been given to the bond holders in the form of the free call options mentioned earlier, to make up for the low yield on the convertible bond issues. There was of course a valid reason MicroStrategy paid nothing in interest rate for some of its convertible bonds. The loans were not free. So with a conservative debt ratio of about 25%, the leverage quickly loses much power should the share price surpass conversion prices in a parallel move with Bitcoin. A large premium to net asset value can therefore not be explained by the company’s convertible bond issuance. For investors seeking leverage on Bitcoin price movements, there is also an ever-increasing arsenal of instruments catering to that demand, such as levered Bitcoin ETFs as well as options with a Bitcoin ETF as underlying asset. None of these “levered bets” on Bitcoin carry the premium that MicroStrategy does. So paying more for a Bitcoin held by MicroStrategy, than for one you could hold yourself, must therefore not be excessively rationalized by pointing at “the leveraged play”. If anything, indirectly purchasing Bitcoin for a premium through MicroStrategy shares trading at high multiples to net asset value, means the investor is overpaying in proportion to the premium, for the doubtful privilege of getting leverage with equity features. And finally, it is important to realize that past performance of the shares is not evidence of a “leveraged play” — it is only evidence of buyers bidding up the price. If the shares indeed have increased in price much more than Bitcoin — the company’s main underlying asset — it is simply because many investors believe that is how the stock “ought to behave”. If shares were to decline for a period of time while the price of Bitcoin goes up, that does not mean the company is some type of short play on Bitcoin. It would simply mean investors are selling shares for some reason, and others are buying Bitcoin for another reason. Causality hides in the fundamentals of company operations, not in the price discovery of jittery speculators. Looking at the slope of a Bitcoin per (diluted) share metric could give an investor a better picture of how large any “leveraged play” in practice really is, but the surest path is to dive into how the company capital structure actually functions. Quant Bros, and others, also argued that the premium must persist due to the nature of the future awaiting a Bitcoin-laden MicroStrategy. Holding close to 2% of all existing Bitcoin by beginning of December 2024, it was now argued that the Bitcoin were to form the basis of the vague banking system of tomorrow, meaning any premium to net asset value must be due to various future banking activities with the Bitcoin as digital capital. There are multiple things wrong with this assumption. First, MicroStrategy is a software company which has issued debt and equity to purchase Bitcoin. It is extremely generous to simply assume that they have an edge in banking, of all things. What is to say that other custodians such as Coinbase, Kraken, Binance or the likes, can’t offer better financial Bitcoin banking products and services? Or that more conventional banks such as Blackrock or JP Morgan ultimately won’t start accepting Bitcoin deposits? Banking is a sector which has painstakingly developed over many centuries, and to think that outsized profits related to it can be made by simply having accumulated a Bitcoin hoard is very naïve. Who will borrow the Bitcoin? For what purpose? What if there are large credit losses, private key incidents, or wrong choices in future chain splits? No such considerations are given when the Quant Bros are discussing, not a 2X premium, not a 3X premium, but a 60X premium to net asset value. Looking at Nvidia, not in the business of lending Bitcoin, but of producing extremely competitive microchips and related software, the comparison was still thought a valid one by the enthusiastic duo. Curiously, Saylor also has a habit of comparing MicroStrategy to totally different companies: “For people that haven’t been paying attention or don’t really do any research, if you actually logged into our earnings call or if anybody studied the company, that’s like saying there’s a perception that Microsoft trades are a premium to its underlying assets. Oh yeah, it does trades 50 times greater than its net tangible assets. So does Apple, so does Standard Oil, so does every operating company, so that the myth, the misunderstanding here is people don’t understand what our operating business is.” (x.com spaces, “Bitcoin as a National and Corporate Asset w/ Senator Lummis & Saylor”, 2024–11–19.) What does it mean to MicroStrategy’s valuation, were it to actually become a proper Bitcoin bank? The average price-to-book ratio in the banking industry is slightly above one, as banks periodically mark-to-market assets and liabilities. Any multiple above one represents a premium stemming from expectations of future growth and excess earnings. Why a MicroStrategy morphing into an adventurous Bitcoin bank should fetch a high premium remained unexplained by the Quant Bros duo, which instead speculated that it didn’t “[…] think [MicroStrategy] being the most valuable company on the planet is widely unreasonable.” We have to remember that a premium for the company can’t be rationalized by pointing at general increases in the price of Bitcoin or in the past price action of the shares themselves — that is all irrelevant. A fund or an ETF trades at net asset value, regardless of whether the underlying asset goes up 100% or down 50%. So, a premium on MicroStrategy shares must come from investors expecting future growth, not in the price of Bitcoin, but rather in the Bitcoin per share metric. This expectation must also take into account the additional risk the company accepts in order to achieve this growth. Any conservative investor should not accept a valuation much higher than net assets, especially considering how the Bitcoin per share metric is engineered to increase, but more on that later. Many banks, while borrowing more cheaply than they lend out, trade at deep discounts to net assets due to the uncertainty of how solid the asset side of the balance sheet really is. As MicroStrategy ramps up convertible bond offerings, an outsized increase in a Bitcoin per share metric can very well be met with cracks spreading within its capital structure, should things take a turn for the worse in Bitcoin markets. Saylor’s comparisons to Apple, Microsoft, Standard Oil and other companies trading at a premium to book value, are misleading mainly for the reason that those companies are not banks. Their assets are not liquid financial assets like MicroStrategy’s, and they may also have depreciated book values over decades to lower taxable profits, or simply booked assets a long time ago so that they no longer happen to reflect profits actually generated. Current cash flows from Windows software products likely far exceed whatever once was booked on the asset side of Microsoft’s balance sheet. It should also be mentioned that most companies can’t very well issue shares and conduct arbitrage trades by simultaneously buying factories, office space, software or oil fields. MicroStrategy, however, can conduct arbitrage trades by issuing shares in order to buy Bitcoin, a liquid, fungible asset traded on hundreds of regulated exchanges, at all times of the day. The comparisons to fantastic price-to-book ratios in totally different industries are made to dazzle potential buyers of shares with back-of-the-napkin calculations on ridiculous net asset multiples. But none of it is real. Michael Saylor may speak of Bitcoin as digital energy, or of MicroStrategy as the crude oil refiner of futuristic finance — it is still wrong to assume that net asset valuations from that industry are at all relevant. There is no doubt that a lot of confident talk can be heard everywhere in MicroStrategy investor circles, with regards to the company’s premium to net assets. But talk is cheap as they say. Turning instead to the actions of the company and its leadership, greatly supported by investors, we will note that these actions fly in the face of the arguments the investors themselves simultaneously are making for any premium. MicroStrategy issues shares (equity), and convertible debt (equity if the share price goes up). This is, again, not a bad strategy while the shares trade at a premium to net assets. But it should be remembered that the company in this way slowly helps close the valuation gap that is the premium, by using the proceeds to purchase Bitcoin or pay off old debt. With a premium to net asset value close to three, at time of the commencement of the 21/21 Plan, the company could sell one Bitcoin worth of shares, and purchase about three Bitcoin on the open market, or redeem three Bitcoin worth of debt. This is an arbitrage by definition — Saylor labeled the 200% risk-free return as exactly that while on CNBC in December. The glaringly obvious arbitrage explains why Saylor himself, as well as other company executives, have continuously sold shares throughout the year. It should be noted that Saylor’s selling plan was set in motion before Spring of 2024, when a considerable premium to net asset value had not yet materialized. Some investors argued that Saylor had to sell the shares, as previously received call options neared maturity date. But exercising the call options does not mean selling the shares is mandatory, unless there is some special clause we don’t know about. It just means the call options convert into shares at strike price. And even if it were the case that Saylor for one reason or another had to sell his newly received shares, the massive issuance and sale of company treasury shares would still have to be explained. Some optimistic MicroStrategy investors were then quick to note that though Saylor’s selling was not mandatory, it was done to buy more Bitcoin personally. But if they believed it was in his interest to do so — in fact that it was “a genius financial move” — why did they fail to consider why it is not in their own interest to do the same? If Saylor considers the shares overvalued in terms of Bitcoin, perhaps due to the arbitrage he himself has mentioned on national television, why do investors who idolize his every financial move argue the exact opposite? On the whole it may be concluded that the company and its executives do exactly what some defenders of the premium deem “NAV multiple trading bullshit”, and there is a logical reason for that. The constantly reoccurring SEC filings of executives selling company shares while never buying, do in fact hint of this truth which so few MicroStrategy investors dare think about. One wonders how many of these filings we must see before investors take note. Just after the announcement of the largest ATM offering in history, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Andrew Kang sold 5,700 shares (Form 144, 2024–11–06). One day after, board member Leslie Rechan sold 20,000 shares (Form 144, 2024–11–07). The same day Senior Executive Vice President & General Counsel Wei-Ming Shao sold 20,000 shares as well (Form 144, 2024–11–07). Not a week later, Leslie Rechan cashed out on 20,000 shares yet again, netting about $5.5 million (Form 144, 2024–11–12). On the 13th of November, board member Stephen Graham sold 30,000 shares, netting over $11 million (Form 144, 2024–11–13). That very same day, Wei-Ming Shao sold another 18,000 shares, and the day after he sold more. CEO Phong Le sold shares on the 14th as well (Form 4, 2024–11–15). A week later, Stephen Graham sold a massive 20,000 shares further, netting $9 million (Form 144, 2024–11–21). In the face of all this selling, investors still remained oblivious to the valuation conundrum the many narratives had obfuscated in their minds: Saylor, the other company executives, as well as the company treasury all appear to be massively selling the very shares that are supposed to be severely undervalued. Seeing as company executives and the company treasury keep selling shares in ever larger numbers, consider for a second a situation where the premium is slowly captured in this manner, so that shares end up with a valuation closing in on that of actual Bitcoin holdings. In other words, where the net asset value multiple is nearing one. Is it suddenly impossible for Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy to pursue the banking adventure, which supposedly is a foundation to the premium in the first place? Of course not. The company can just as easily pursue its wild career starting with 500,000, 600,000 or 700,000 Bitcoin. There are no incentives whatsoever for the company to leave arbitrage on the table for others to try to capture, since Bitcoin banking does not depend on any premium persisting. It is rather amazing to watch MicroStrategy thought leaders viciously defend the premium while the company and its higher-ups are franticly devouring it. There is another popular idea floating around in the MicroStrategy investing space, supporting the claim that the company should trade at a premium to net assets. It is the notion that “no one can catch MicroStrategy” in terms of the number of accumulated Bitcoin. The obvious question must then be, what this claim actually means, and why it should justify shares at a premium. If we are to assume that no other company will ever be able to own 2% of the total supply of all Bitcoin, that is all well and good, but what does that have to do with the premium? If owning such a large share of the supply somehow implies great profits in a future economy, it means the premium arises from being able to deploy the large Bitcoin stash for specific purposes. Why would not large Bitcoin custodians such as Coinbase, Kraken or Binance, perhaps sitting on even larger portions of Bitcoin, be able to apply their hoards in a similar fashion while sharing the profits with willing depositors? Would it be logical to say MicroStrategy “could never catch up”, because the company only sits on a few hundred thousand Bitcoin whereas some of these exchanges may have up to a million coins in custody? The notion is nonsense and has almost nothing to do with the fundamental value of MicroStrategy. Blinded by vast returns, many investors have stopped thinking when they assign a monopoly premium to the notion of simply owning more Bitcoin than others. Additionally, it should be noted that smaller Bitcoin banks (or “treasury companies”) can compete with larger ones. Though consolidation occurs naturally in a free market, there have been many thousands of banks competing for customers over the centuries, some specializing in order to survive. The same would occur within a growing Bitcoin bank sector. There are no natural monopolies. One prevalent argument in support of a sustained company premium to net assets concerns the so-called “regulatory arbitrage”. It is claimed that through innovative treasury operations, MicroStrategy can offer financial products to a regulated market which otherwise would have no opportunity to get exposure to Bitcoin. It should be remembered that MicroStrategy previously has discussed the premium in relation to the go-ahead of a Bitcoin ETF in January 2024. That day, shares fell sharply, only to quickly recover. Could it be that the premium to net asset value can be sustained due to the fact that, while many equity investors now have proper vehicles to get Bitcoin exposure, bond investors do not? The company’s convertible bonds have multiple times achieved large successes, so it has been logical to assume the regulatory arbitrage is real, and that MicroStrategy as sole issuer now could profit from it. But there are many things wrong with this assumption. First, we must ask ourselves why there are all these huge funds that are allowed to own only bonds. The prevention does not stem from nowhere, but from self-regulation in the case of family offices, and from laws in the case of pension funds etc. These rules were put in place by someone for the specific purpose of minimizing risk, while still generating returns to clients. As bond owners, these funds stand first in line to company assets should bankruptcy threaten. Now, Bitcoin is a very volatile asset, and while it may seem obvious to some why potential returns from it can look tempting to bond portfolio managers, it is likely not obvious to those enforcing the risk management rules. Any loophole suddenly allowing for large exposure to a non-yielding digital asset which very few have expertise on, can be closed just as quickly as it was innovatively created. For this reason alone should it not be assumed that a “regulatory arbitrage” premium is large and long-lived. How about other daredevils wanting Bitcoin exposure but can’t seem to find it due to regulations? Certain pension equity accounts may buy MicroStrategy shares, but not Bitcoin outright. Can a regulatory arbitrage premium persist through this type of investors? There is a case to be made here, but any premium would likely be very small, as agile investors could simply increase exposure to Bitcoin with their conventional savings, instead of paying a fee in proportion to the premium to net asset value when adding MicroStrategy to their pension accounts. It should not be assumed that people are not creative in finding the amount of Bitcoin exposure they are comfortable with, while minimizing more expensive, roundabout Bitcoin exposure through MicroStrategy. So, we are mainly left with a, perhaps temporary, demand for bonds with Bitcoin exposure, before regulators swing their hammers. And while observing MicroStrategy history up to the 21/21 Plan but also after, we indeed see such actors willingly buying the bonds, even when conversion price is reflecting a huge premium to net assets. Has MicroStrategy actually found an alchemic formula here so strong, to start attracting trillions of dollars from the untapped bond market? The answer is likely no. The buyers of the bonds are likely not the type of family offices where an ”orange-pilled” heir has convinced the managers that “Bitcoin bonds” is the exposure needed to increase pitiful past performance. No, what is likely happening with all the convertible bond issues is that MicroStrategy prices the bonds in a manner to attract market neutral hedge fonds, meaning arbitrageurs. Saylor has briefly mentioned these firms, as opposed to firms seeking actual Bitcoin exposure. For issue after issue, they can be spotted as the largest bond holders by anyone with a Bloomberg terminal. By buying the bonds, even when conversion price is at a large premium, and by simultaneously shorting the shares, these arbitrage funds can lock in close to risk-free profits. Due to the convex nature of the value of the convertible bonds, the hedge funds attempt to profit no matter whether MicroStrategy shares rise or decline: When shares go up in value, the (green) straight bond and embedded call option increase more in value than the (red) short position decreases in value. When shares go down in value, the short position increases more in value than the straight bond and embedded call option decrease in value. This is the lucrative gamma trading offered by MicroStrategy to the hedge funds to have the bond issues appear highly successful. Note that the “danger” of gamma trading — shrinking volatility — can be offset by pricing the bond issues at lower implied volatility than the market assigns the underlying asset, meaning shrinking the grey area of the graphs as they move away from each other. To conclude, whatever profits are made by these hedge funds are taken mainly from MicroStrategy shareholders; the profits do not materialize from thin air. The narrative of regulatory arbitrage continues to spread among retail investors, while little such demand is spotted in actual market activity. By talking about all these regulations, and by perhaps mispricing a bond issue or two to appease the hedge funds even more, Michael Saylor can regularly breathe life into the narrative that his company ought to trade at a premium to net assets because it alone can offer the financial products the regulated market demands. Mark Meldrum is even so cynical that he speculates that the hedge funds can attempt to engineer volatility outright, because it is the soil in which their gamma trades can grow and thrive. In other words, it may be in both the company’s and the hedge funds’ interest to see shares violently crash and recover, perhaps related to a leak to journalists, or to short report analysts. But all that is pure speculation. What we do know for sure is that though the narrative fails under scrutiny, it is still alive and well out there and helps absorb massive insider and company selling, resulting in enormous wealth transfers from new investors to old ones. The narratives surrounding the fact that MicroStrategy trades at a large premium to net assets are strong and in many cases convincing at a first glance. But here, they have all been investigated in detail and consequently dispelled. For large investors in MicroStrategy, it is of highest importance that the premium persists, because it is only from the golden goose that is the premium, that the egg, the “Bitcoin yield”, materialises. This metric, the increase in Bitcoin per share, is what continuously increases the fundamental value of the company, given any specific Bitcoin price. So let us now turn to the narratives surrounding the Bitcoin yield, and what they produce when working in tandem with those of the premium to net assets. “A Ponzi scheme is a type of financial fraud in which the ‘success’ of the entity is propped up by paying returns to initial investors from the money invested by subsequent investors.” (Investopedia.com) “Bitcoin yield” is the growth in Bitcoin per share — a metric mentioned many times in the report, and which has been excessively used to argue in support of shares trading at a premium to net assets. The logic provided is something to the tune of, while a Bitcoin is worth itself, a Bitcoin with a steady Bitcoin yield must be worth more. It is an honest metric for MicroStrategy in the sense that it takes into account conversion of convertible bond issues into equity. But it is dishonest in the sense that the yield is not stemming from conventional business operations such as lending out Bitcoin or developing Bitcoin related software applications. The company, likely for legal reasons, recognizes this to a degree in its SEC filings but still proceeds heavily with the metric. All that the “Bitcoin yield” ultimately is, is a transfer of wealth from new shareholders to old ones. Overvalued shares are sold, and understandably so, to fund new purchases of Bitcoin. These new Bitcoin increase the floor to where the share price must eventually go by the mechanic of arbitrage trades. The fundamental value of MicroStrategy, meaning the total valuation of the company’s Bitcoin holdings, increases in proportion to the proceeds from buyers of newly issued shares, because the shares trade at a premium. In other words, the new buyers are the Bitcoin yield. They are the arbitrage. There is no way of really knowing whether or not Saylor understands this himself — he might be lost in his own analogies. After the valuation of his company imploded in the year 2000, one of his friends noted that, “Mike let himself become this image that kept feeding on itself. After a while it’s drinking your own bathwater. After a while it became hubris.” Be that as it may, it is not with a little amount of irony that one of the company’s official principles today is to “treat all investors with respect, consistency and transparency.” The issuing of new overvalued shares to increase the Bitcoin per share metric helps securing a profit for old shareholders (as the fundamental value rises above what they paid for their shares). It also helps securing a loss for the new buyers (as the market value falls towards the rising fundamental value). It is a mechanical operation which at this very moment runs its course with $42B worth of muscle behind it, until there are no new buyers of shares at a premium. The circular reasoning binding the two most important narratives together, and which is feeding trusting souls to Saylor’s massive yield extractor, can be visualized like this: This has formed the core of the sentiment given rise to the extreme run-up to $500 per share while share issuance has been running hot. The higher the shares run, the higher Bitcoin yield can be demonstrated to new investors. As the new investors are buying with previous Bitcoin yield numbers in mind, the base from which the yield is extracted must by definition be ever larger for everything to work. Mark Meldrum came to the same conclusion and visualized it wittily in a YouTube video which may one day become a financial market classic. By rotating the company’s own 21/21 Plan slides, he built a pyramid from which MicroStrategy’s highly sought after Bitcoin yield were to be extracted in the years to come. As there is a limit of the number of new MicroStrategy investors, the ever-lower foundations of this pyramid must start crumbling soon. It is now evident that uninformed retail investors are providing the Ponzi yield through the company’s ATM offerings, but what about the convertible bond issues? Who are the victims in that case? If the buyers of the bonds were investors hindered by regulation to own Bitcoin outright, a yield could indeed stem from these investors as they acquired shares at conversion prices far above the net asset value of the company. But as we have seen, almost all bond holders are hedge funds that sell short the stock at the time they take a bond position. By borrowing the shares to sell them, we are sadly back at the incredulous retail buyer once more, acquiring shares at a large premium. The sobering conclusion is the following: the Ponzi yield is extracted from retail investors both through the ATM offerings and through the convertible bond issuance, by the fact that the latter so far is a façade, a Potemkin Village. All narratives have fallen. MicroStrategy’s new KPI is extracted within the framework of a corporation, and is, if not the exact definition of a Ponzi scheme, something very close to it. In other words, a greater fool’s dance seems to be playing out to the tune of a multitude of confused narratives. And as with all Ponzi-like financial structures, this one will eventually face reality as well. Having shown mainly with first principles thinking how the many MicroStrategy narratives are false or flawed, it is time to explore the result of a dawning realization in these matters. As company management continuously captures the premium to net asset value through more ATM offerings and convertible bond issuance, there is an incrementally growing portion of investors whose future Bitcoin yield will not cover the cost of entering the Ponzi scheme. Finding themselves in one of the bottom layers, they observe how new Bitcoin yield is shared among an ever-growing mass of investors, and while the metric declines, the hesitation of potential new investors increases. It is likely that investors then will attempt to front run the increasingly obvious conclusion of the Ponzi mechanics and sell their shares to recoup some of what they paid to enter. With a drastically declining Bitcoin yield, it could otherwise take many decades for a latecomer to recoup what he or she paid with a high multiple to net asset value. It is both quicker and much less risky to simply sell immediately into the bid, while a premium still exists. The declining premium and share price will have further consequences, as we soon shall see. Before thinking about what a premium collapse means to the company’s ability to handle its debt, let us consider whether or not a declining Bitcoin yield actually is the only factor which will send shares crashing towards net asset value. It has already been concluded that the convertible bond issues are vital to nurture a company premium to net assets through the regulatory arbitrage narrative. The company feeds retail investors the narrative so that they can be used for exit liquidity as well as for yield. But the problem is that the bond buyers are gamma traders — they need volatility to continuously profit, and they don’t care much whether or not the shares decline, go sideways, or rise in value, as long as they do it in a volatile manner. Mark Meldrum was to my knowledge the first to point this out; if MicroStrategy fails to provide this volatility — the convexity of the long position in the arbitrage trade — then the bond buyers quickly abandon ship. Taking their place are cross-asset arbitrage hedge funds shorting the shares while entering long positions in the underlying Bitcoin on a volatility neutral basis. Such operations could collapse the premium to net asset value even quicker than retail investors slowly coming to the realization that when Saylor says he loves Bitcoin, he really does mean it and has no plans to abandon the capture of the premium. What further makes the whole convertible bond capital structure strategy precarious is that the larger the debt issues, the more the gamma traders will tame the volatility of the shares as they add to short positions when shares go up, and exit short positions when shares go down — all to stay as delta neutral as possible. In other words, they inadvertently pave the way for their own future indifference to the company, to the company’s concern. While trading at a premium to the company’s net assets is highly advantageous given the treasury strategy pursued by MicroStrategy, it has to be remembered that MicroStrategy’s ability to buy Bitcoin mainly occurs in such good times as well, after Bitcoin has already gone up in price. In other words, the advantage is often offset to a degree. The June 2021 convertible debt issue was the last one in nearly three years, owing to the brutal downturn starting in the beginning of 2022. MicroStrategy, riskier to lenders as the valuation of its underlying assets falls while its debt obligations stay the same, could not take true advantage of a low price of the asset it so highly believed in. By not issuing convertible debt in 2022 or 2023, the company could only make smaller Bitcoin purchases from past issuance, from small proceeds of the software business, and from small issues of shares and of debt with Bitcoin as collateral. To further make the point, the three largest bond issues to date have all occurred when Bitcoin was near its all-time high at the time, in February 2021, in September 2024, and in November 2024. MicroStrategy is tied to the mast when a storm hits, and can walk around on deck only in calm waters. The decline in the cost basis of its Bitcoin holdings, when it happened, was always negligible. The endpoint of this dynamic first makes itself known in longer market downturns. Debt must always be paid back. As MicroStrategy’s convertible debt is raised mainly in good times, it should go without saying that the fact that the size of it persists while the value of the asset it bought can fall, means balance sheet distress is a real possibility. Paying back the debt in the future may lead to very high dilution, at or below net asset value, or to the raising of new debt at exorbitant interest rates due to debt overhang as lenders demand yield in proportion to the risk they take on. In 2021, when the company’s balance sheet was not in distress, lenders demanded over 6% on straight bonds. Should none of these alternatives prove feasible, selling company assets may be the only option left for MicroStrategy. Since its only assets are the hoarded Bitcoin, those are what’s going to hit the bid on the open market in a frantic fire sale, where MicroStrategy must sell at any price. This is one possible endpoint of shares losing their premium to net asset value; falling below previously reached bond issue conversion prices, one after another, paves the way for the fire sale of pristine assets to creditors. What previously proudly was proclaimed “permanent capital”, then morphs into anything but. The claim could perhaps have been made should MicroStrategy’s balance sheet have contained no debt, but that is not the case. In a twist of irony not unfamiliar to Michael Saylor, the forced selling of assets, while making a mockery of previous “permanent capital” statements, would also be conducted in the light of previous arrogance shown the short sellers now about to flock. Saylor has famously begged people to short his company, because “they will have to buy our shares when we need them to.” Potentially on its head, Saylor would have to sell his permanent capital “when creditors and short sellers need him to.” Once this has occurred, it will be very hard to start up Bitcoin yield generation again as retail investors hesitate to bid up shares to a premium. While a 25% debt ratio may be of no immediate danger, the euphoria emerging from a Bitcoin bull market, combined with dreams of imminent hyperbitcoinization, may very well see this ratio creep up at a time when it should rather decrease. An increasing debt ratio would come hand in hand with an even faster increasing cost basis for the company Bitcoin. Any prolonged market downturn would then be able to cause severe damage, and Saylor might yet come to regret ever uttering the phrase “volatility is vitality”. The picture emerging in mainly Washington Post articles from 1999 and 2000 is clear enough to draw some final conclusions when tying together the past with what we can observe in the present. Though journalists often have to put a flair on things, to put it lightly, Michael Saylor’s own way of talking and his own actions are hard to twist. The man back then showed definite signs of being a cult leader, and the word “cult” is mentioned many times in articles from those days, long before the obscure mentions of cyber hornets and encrypted energy, and the daily posts of AI generated images of himself. Whether or not the word applies today, I leave for the reader to judge. Saylor’s convoluted analogies could capture a room full of educated people back then, and they do it today as well. Coming in new shapes and forms, investor hype for “proactive intelligence” morphed into investor hype for “intelligent leverage”. The likelihood that the company eventually will face a second collapse is high enough to stay far away. -- -- 1 Bitcoin. Austrian Economics. Monetary History.

Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Emil Sandstedt Follow -- 1 Listen Share TLDR: My interest in the story of MicroStrategy started out tangential at first — it was just one of many unconventional outcomes born out of the rising Bitcoin phenomenon. The publicly traded company, although first in the world to pursue a Bitcoin accumulation strategy, flew under the radar of most conventional investors, and it was only after the long Bitcoin winter of 2022 and early 2023 that both old and new narratives from the company and its de facto leader, Michael Saylor, broke through the thawing ice and began to spread among a bewildered audience. 2024 catapulted MicroStrategy to new sensational heights, and I soon realized I was witnessing financial history in the making. The general enthusiasm was unparalleled; sons went “all in” with the savings of their parents while old investors bought new houses from quick gains on leveraged positions. Any public display of hesitation to the many optimistic narratives energizing investment circles was met with scorn or silence. When logical arguments against the company’s ever higher valuation to net assets were put forward, they were answered by vague appeals to unofficial thought leaders or to a vision of a utopian future. On the verge of letting this one be altogether and mentally filing it as just another financial bubble soon to pop, I finally made the decision to work on this report as a veiled but growing Ponzi-scheme element of MicroStrategy’s business became ever clearer. So, having delved deep into the facts and fiction underlying common investor assumptions, it is now my firm belief that what is going on with MicroStrategy will end in disaster for most investors, should affairs not radically alter. It is a play of five parts, presented chronologically to the reader. Emil Sandstedt, 2024–12–06 MicroStrategy’s early history is laid to rest behind a thin curtain, mostly undisturbed by the hands of modern investors. It is known by a few that the company reached big and fell even bigger in the Dotcom Crash of the year 2000, but which growing Internet-focused company wasn’t experiencing great hardships at that time? Yet, could there be clues from those years which could be relevant today, to where the fate of MicroStrategy is heading? Let’s blow away the dust, break the crypt open and see what the passing of decades has caused to be all but forgotten. Starting out as a software company helping other companies make strategic decisions based on large amounts of accumulated data, MicroStrategy had enjoyed considerable interest and growth since it went public in 1998. CEO Michael Saylor had aimed at going public at $6 per share, had filed for $8–10 per share, sold the stock at $12 per share, only to see it rapidly continue all the way up to $46 per share. The appetite for intelligently utilizing digital data was, at this time, enormous. As an example, fast food restaurant clients could, by using MicroStrategy’s software analytics services, understand customer preferences within a geographical context; a customer in Florida was less likely to purchase a certain product than a customer in Chicago, given local circumstances. In a world where the customer is king, predicting what they actually wanted, when, and how, was profits in the making. So with Internet usage growing exponentially in 1999, Saylor thought it was time to ramp up his vison of the digital disruption of the economy. By analyzing and processing data in real-time, MicroStrategy now wanted to deliver a service which could feed useful information, not just to large companies, but to the public. The product, an anywhere personal information network called Strategy.com, was to be offered for a small monthly fee — today a very common model for software companies — and was therefore arguably ahead of its time. Starting modestly, the service was initially to focus on sending out useful information on fickle changes in financial markets to phones, pagers and other outlets. But the goal was more far-reaching than that — when the Washington Post asked Michael Saylor for more details on his vision, he simply noted that “I believe in fate, but all things being equal, I’d rather not be standing in front of a truck when it comes down the street.” With the sprawling information network and with the help of ear-pieces, civilians would be able to receive warnings of an ongoing robbery in the street ahead of them, drivers would receive proactive, intelligent heads-ups about traffic jams before finding themselves in one, and athletes would receive real-time data on weather approaching the game field. Michael Saylor, characteristically, painted a dramatic picture: “Take the police database in D.C. loaded into a network and then call me on the phone when there’s a robbery in my neighborhood going on right now. Don’t walk the dog, right now. There are police with sirens and shotguns running around in your neighborhood looking for three guys with knives. Right now.” The service, in other words, would help make life both easier and safer, with the help of a never-ending tsunami of intelligently processed data. Saylor, having observed the success Amazon had built by utilizing the personalized data of customers, noted casually in an interview, “So we started to ask the question ‘How do we get embedded into everyone’s life?’”. As the theory of the new business was reaching completion, Saylor now sought a $100 million investment, about the size of the company’s annual revenues, to bring it to market. Though a somewhat vague term, the company in other words wanted to bet on “proactive intelligence”. Adding to the examples above, Michael Saylor in another interview brought up the subject of fraud, and how an intelligent software could help mitigate it. In his example, a client is notified about the strange movement of funds from one account to another, followed by an automated text whether or not the client wants to cancel the transaction. It is not hard to see the advantages of such proactive warnings, and they are in fact implemented in multiple forms in today’s digitized economy. But in a way which would later become distinctive of Michael Saylor, he couldn’t help adding that his company was “to take everything from being unintelligent to intelligence…”, and that MicroStrategy was not an ”Internet company”, but an “intelligence company”. That also included disrupting the massive medical insurance industry with the anonymous processing of customer data. The idea that almost all data could be gathered and properly processed for all sorts of clients was a driving force in the appreciation of the value of MicroStrategy shares. Strategy.com was such a bold attempt in these early times of the internet, so all-encompassing, that it was hard to comprehend the potential ramifications stemming from a success of it. If the company could enhance data from hospitals, police stations, stock markets etc. in real-time, there seemed to be no limit to how valuable the output of the algorithms could be. Michael Saylor himself confidently stated that his system ultimately was going to “purge ignorance from the planet”. On a question whether or not going public with his company had changed him, Michael Saylor answered: “I think it’s made me better. It’s forced me to deal with more constituencies. It teaches you some things. Like integrity, for instance. In a public-company world, your word really means something. When you’re private you say, I’m going to do this, and if it doesn’t happen it doesn’t matter. In the public world, you say you’re going to do it, you have to do it. In the public world there’s a difference between 11:59 and 12:01, the last day of March. There’s a tangible difference. One of them is you go to jail if the thing gets signed at 12:01. One of them is the stock is up $500 million and the other one is you’ve just torched the life and livelihood of a thousand families. One minute.” Finishing up the Washington Post interview, he predicted his company would eventually reach $10–20 billion in annual revenue. And at the time, perhaps the prediction did not sound altogether unreasonable. Saylor had after all confidently stated that “I think my software is going to become so ubiquitous, so essential, that if it stops working, there will be riots. […]. I mean that literally. I mean that people will die this year because they didn’t buy my software.” Shares continued to climb in 1999, and in the beginning of the ominous year 2000 the company had become one of the most admired in the Washington region. Shares rose ever higher, and Michael Saylor threw grand parties at his Florida mansion. A plan to build a massive 50-acre Versailles was drafted. But the celebrations and toasts to new times were not to last long. In March, MicroStrategy felt compelled to adapt to new accounting standards put in place a few years earlier to better reflect the reality of the operations of a growing number of software companies in the nation. In practice, this meant that MicroStrategy had overstated its revenues two years in a row, and what was priorly booked as profitable years now turned deeply red. The original 1999 annual profit of $12.6 million was now restated as a loss of as much as $40 million. In a market sensitive to even small misses on investor expectations, the company shares crashed about 62% in a day, reducing Michael Saylor’s net worth by multiple billions of dollars — one of the largest daily personal losses in the world to that date. PricewaterhouseCoopers, the company’s auditors, had put a stamp of approval on past reporting, so the change did not exactly stem from a complete failure in that regard. What had happened with the revenue discrepancy was extremely ironic; a late-night business deal had been struck with the large technology company NCR Corp on September 30th, 1999, but as no flow of goods or money occurred that day, NCR booked it in the fourth quarter of the year, while MicroStrategy booked it in the third quarter. In other words, Michael Saylor had found himself in exactly the situation he so much dreaded during the interviews with the Washington Post earlier in the summer. Had he not booked the revenues stemming from the business deal in the third quarter, the company shares would likely have crashed and severely complicated the funding of the company’s ongoing Strategy.com transformation. Instead, Saylor and the other higher-ups in the company saw shares increase 72% in value since that fateful meeting, paving the way for large sales of their personal holdings for a total of $82 million during the period. That was more than four times the value of previous insider sales since going public. Not only was the revenue booked wrongly, but the deal also included the promise by MicroStrategy to purchase a business unit and some software from NCR, thus netting the total effect of the deal on revenues. “Revenue washing” is a well-established way to artificially inflate booked revenues while not being properly reflected in actual business activity. So, three problems were now glaringly obvious to investors who had just lost a lot of money: revenues had likely been booked in the wrong quarter, the $27.5 million NCR deal involved a tit-for-tat purchase of about $25 million, and the MicroStrategy executives and board members had sold shares that they likely knew were severely overvalued, to the open market. While the details of the NCR deal came to light, a later deal with Primark Corp. to distribute financial information to investors, also attracted the eyes of market analysts. Quite incredibly, Michael Saylor seems to have found himself in the situation yet again, where a business deal was signed and booked in the fourth quarter of 1999, while it was actually carried out and paid for in the first quarter the year after. Investors, oblivious at the time to any wrongdoings in the two separate business deals, had bid up shares above $300 before all the accounting issues came to light. All this seems to have become too much for the SEC, which promptly launched an investigation into the company. It eventually compelled MicroStrategy to admit to booking revenues wrong over the last three years rather than the last two. At this time, shares were down more than 80% since their all-time high. Michael Saylor’s company stake had dropped in value, from $13.6 billion to $1.7 billion. The Strategy.com investment never materialized as the company failed to get approval for new share issuance and sales before the value of the shares cratered in March 2000. A plan to raise up to $2 billion, then the largest stock offering in software industry history, came to nothing. Michael Saylor’s vision of a large proactive intelligence network was put on ice, and the company returned to its tried ways of conventional data mining. The abrupt fall was distinct enough to prompt James Cramer, columnist for TheStreet.com, to state that “This one popped the bubble. MicroStrategy forever changed the Internet mania.” The rise and fall of MicroStrategy would, except for the whispers in obscure investor circles, eventually be followed by a long silence. But the years passed, and Bitcoin finally entered the world and caused an ever-larger stir around the globe. Saylor initially discarded the phenomenon, writing that “#Bitcoin days are numbered. It seems like just a matter of time before it suffers the same fate as online gambling.” But as the network grew, and after various decadent money printing schemes had been put in motion by governments in 2020, something seems to have changed within Michael Saylor. A growing opportunity now lay before him and his company, perhaps larger than all his prior visions put together, as a new untrodden path opened under the gaze of an orange sun. MicroStrategy entered its Bitcoin Exploration phase simply as an enterprise analytics software and services company with a checkered past and with fading growth. There is nothing wrong with that — the company made small profits on the capital it applied to the purpose. Few assumed much future growth in revenues, and valued the company shares accordingly. Total revenues for the second quarter of 2020 were reported as $110.6 million, a 6.1% decrease from the year before. In that same report (10-Q, 2020–06–30), however, the word “Bitcoin” appeared for the first time. What followed was the company with its investors, under the surprised gaze of its peers, boldly moving away from competing with IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, and Salesforce, to standing alone at the door to the growing Bitcoin sector. The report, after announcing the buyback of $250M worth of shares through a modified Dutch Auction, added that: MicroStrategy will seek to invest up to another $250 million over the next 12 months in one or more alternative investments or assets, which may include stocks, bonds, commodities such as gold, digital assets such as bitcoin, or other asset types. (10-Q, 2020–06–30, Exhibit 99.1.) In August 2020, an 8-K document (8-K, 2020–08–11) was filed at the SEC, announcing the purchase of 21,454 Bitcoin at an aggregate purchase price of $250.0 million. The risk factors section of the previously published quarterly report was amended, and Saylor noted in the document that: “Bitcoin is digital gold — harder, stronger, faster, and smarter than any money that has preceded it. We expect its value to accrete with advances in technology, expanding adoption, and the network effect that has fueled the rise of so many category killers in the modern era.” (8-K, 2020–08–11, Exhibit 99.1.) The conventional Treasury Reserve Policy of the company was updated with a Bitcoin-focus in September the same year, with a new 8-K filing. And after the Q2 report had mentioned the word “Bitcoin” once, the Q3 report mentioned it 154 times. The air in the company was now thick with change. During the third quarter of 2020, MicroStrategy ended up owning about 38,250 Bitcoin, purchased for $425 million ($11,111 per Bitcoin). This from a considerable portion of the company cash position. By September 30, 2020, MicroStrategy had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $52.7 million, compared to $565.6 million by the end of 2019. On the 4th of December 2020, MicroStrategy bought 2,574 more Bitcoin (8-K, 2020–12–04). For the annual report of that year, the shift in strategy is again palpable, and the mention of raising capital for the purpose of buying Bitcoin through debt or share issuance could be spotted for the first time: MicroStrategy® pursues two corporate strategies in the operation of its business. One strategy is to grow our enterprise analytics software business and the other strategy is to acquire and hold bitcoin. […]. [A]nd we may from time to time, subject to market conditions, issue debt or equity securities in capital raising transactions with the objective of using the proceeds to purchase bitcoin. (10-K, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, p.5.) Approximately 70,469 Bitcoin were purchased in total in the year 2020, indicating many were purchased at the very end of the year. All Bitcoin now had an average purchase price of approximately $15,964 per coin. The later batches of purchases were made with an issuance of $650 million principal amount of 0.75% convertible senior notes due 2025. The issuance was announced in December 2020, and had a conversion price of about $397.99 ($39.799 for the post-split shares of August 2024) and thus MicroStrategy went from purchasing the new volatile asset with surplus cash, to purchasing it with convertible debt. One of the first things incredulous onlookers reacted to was the low interest rate for the bonds — something which we will return to later. In early 2021, MicroStrategy, already operating under its amended Treasury Reserve Policy, officially adopted a Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy, further strengthening that focus. Within weeks, a new convertible bond issue was announced (8-K, 2021–02–16), this time of up to $1,050 million of 0% convertible senior notes due 2027. Though larger than the first issue, its zero coupon meant the lender’s full focus was on the equity component of the convertible bond. The focus of the borrower was, as we know, to purchase more Bitcoin with the proceeds. Conversion price of the bonds was priced at about $1,432, meaning about $143 in 2024 post-split shares. After the purchase of more Bitcoin, the number of Bitcoin per share climbed above 0.001. For the first time, investors in the company had to contemplate the nuances of MicroStrategy having issued multiple types of convertible bonds, as the conversion into shares of one issue could affect the parameters allowing conversion for other issues. Some confusion arose out of this, which we will speak more of later. In June 2021, a third bond issue was announced, this time of $500 million worth of 6.125% senior secured notes due 2028. This being a conventional straight bond, it can be observed how the market viewed the risk of MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy, through the coupon payments. Herein lies the first clue in how to view the low coupon payments of the first two issues. Were the earlier bonds really as cheap as they seemed at a first glance? It was a relevant question that investors could now ponder. At the time of this third bond issue MicroStrategy owned 92,079 Bitcoin, and now more could be acquired. As of January 31, 2022, MicroStrategy held approximately 125,051 Bitcoin (8-K, 2022–02–01) which were acquired at an average purchase price of about $30,200 per coin. On the 29th of March 2022, a fourth debt issue was announced, this time with Silvergate Bank, of $205 million secured by Bitcoin held in MicroStrategy’s collateral account. The loan had a floating rate equal to the SOFR 30 Day Average plus 3.70%, with a floor of 3.75%. The collateral was set at double the loaned amount, $410 million. Saylor concluded that “the SEN Leverage loan gives us an opportunity to further our position as the leading public company investor in bitcoin.” The Silvergate loan was paid back in March 2023 at a discount (8-K, 2023–03–24), due to the interest rate climbing up towards 8%. The payment could be made by the company issuing new MicroStrategy shares, though not yet at a premium to net assets. This meant that three bond issues, of which two were convertible, were still outstanding. In the 2022 annual report the company’s Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy had clearly overtaken any focus on the software business, as seen in the number of mentions of “Bitcoin”, and in the stated order of company objectives. As of February 15, 2023, MicroStrategy held approximately 132,500 Bitcoin with an average purchase price of approximately $30,137 per Bitcoin. Further purchases that year were funded mainly by the issuance and sale of new shares (8-K, 2023–06–28). As MicroStrategy at the time traded near its net asset valuation, meaning its cash and Bitcoin holdings, the share issuance and purchases were not much affecting the company capital structure. Not until the end of 2023 did the Bitcoin price recover enough to surpass MicroStrategy‘s cost basis. At that time, the company held 189,150 Bitcoin, with an average purchase price of $31,168 per coin. Starting in 2024, the market valuation of MicroStrategy in proportion to its Bitcoin holdings quickly increased to about two. This meant that the implied valuation of a Bitcoin held by the company was double that of a Bitcoin trading at exchanges. The software business, now a very small part of the company’s dealings, had become more or less irrelevant and could share no consideration in the total valuation. Investors were bidding on shares because of the Bitcoin exposure, and nothing else. Before the approval of the Bitcoin ETF in January 2024, a popular narrative circulated around the assumption that the premium earlier had manifested itself due to MicroStrategy offering the only possible exposure to Bitcoin for various institutional investors. MicroStrategy mentioned this dynamic in its annual report for 2023: On January 10, 2024, the SEC approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin ETPs, the shares of which can be sold in public offerings and are traded on U.S. national securities exchanges. The approved ETPs commenced trading directly to the public on January 11, 2024, with a trading volume of $4.6 billion on the first trading day. On January 11, 2024, and in the subsequent days following the SEC’s approval of the listing and trading of spot bitcoin ETPs, the trading price of our shares of class A common stock declined significantly relative to the value of our bitcoin. To the extent investors view our class A common stock as providing exposure to bitcoin, it is possible that the value of our class A common stock may also have included a premium over the value of our bitcoin due to the prior scarcity of traditional investment vehicles providing investment exposure to bitcoin, and that the value declined due to investors now having a greater range of options to gain exposure to bitcoin and investors choosing to gain such exposure through ETPs rather than our class A common stock. (10-K, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, pp. 24–25.) As the premium to the company’s net asset value quickly recovered and continued to increase in the following months, despite the approval, some went in search of other explanations or narratives. The quickly increasing share price mostly dissuaded such considerations, however, and optimism reigned supreme. While some mulled over the rising premium to net asset value, the company issued more convertible debt for the first time in almost three years (8-K, 2024–03–11). $800 million worth of unsecured convertible senior notes due 2030 with a 0.625% interest rate meant more Bitcoin could be accumulated with the proceeds. Here, for the first time in a long time, could MicroStrategy make use of the premium to its net asset value. A few days later, another issue was made of $600 million worth of unsecured convertible senior notes due 2031 with a 0.875% interest rate (8-K, 2024–03–19). As of February 14, 2024, the company held about 190,000 Bitcoin, with a purchase price of $31,224 per coin. MicroStrategy had now officially morphed into the “world’s first Bitcoin development company”, according to its annual report for 2023 (10-K, 2023, p.7). What, exactly, this entailed is hard to determine, but a qualified guess is an internal focus was shifting towards building blockchain analytics tools, first layer Bitcoin clients, Lightning Network clients, and so on. Any Bitcoin software useful to the entity running it, could fetch a continuous yield as real as the yield from Microsoft software. As of April 26, MicroStrategy had accumulated 214,400 Bitcoin, meaning the milestone of owning more than 1% of all supply had finally been achieved. The coins were acquired for approximately $35,180 per coin. Total revenues, per the Q1 report (8-K, 2024–04–29), was $115.2 million, down 5% year-over-year, further emphasizing the fading relevance of the non-Bitcoin parts of the company. In June, a fifth convertible bond issue was conducted (8-K, 2024–06–17). The bonds were $800 million worth of unsecured convertible senior notes due 2032 with a 2.25% interest rate. Almost simultaneously, the company’s first convertible bond issue with a principal of $650M and a conversion price below the current share price, was prematurely redeemed by converting it all into equity (8-K, 2024–06–13). Capital structure decisions taken three and a half years ago now made themselves known. Though more Bitcoin were purchased with the proceeds from the fifth convertible bond issue, the Bitcoin per share ratio seems to have increased only marginally at this time. In July, MicroStrategy announced a 10-for-1 split (8-K, 2024–07–11). All debt contracts automatically changed in proportion, and the report has previously dealt with post-split conversion prices for the convenience of the reader. In September, the company announced Bitcoin purchases for over $1 billion, conducted with proceeds from share issuance (8-K, 2024–09–13). This meant it continued to take advantage of the premium to net asset value, and its accelerating accumulation now reached 244,800 Bitcoin. Also in September, a sixth convertible bond issue was planned, to raise enough funds to redeem the 6.125% 2028 Senior Secured Notes issued in June 2021 (8-K, 2024–09–16). The move is in line with a capital structure optimization strategy, as the new convertible bond issue would be done with shares at a premium. The issue was $1.01 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.625% convertible senior notes due 2028 with a $183.19 conversion price, and all the secured bonds of 6.125% were consequently redeemed — a good move by the MicroStrategy team. The company’s bond schedule now looked something like the following: The exploration phase was concluded; the company had now found its orange path to success, and it lay not in Bitcoin- or non-Bitcoin software development, but in pursuing accretive treasury operations. In a historical announcement in connection with the 2024 Q3 earnings report (10-K, 2024–10–31), the company, in a hat-tip to Satoshi, announced the goal of a $21 billion at-the-market (ATM) equity offering — meaning share issuance — as well as a target of raising $21 billion using fixed-income securities. The plan was to conclude over the course of the next three years. At the time of the launch of the plan the debt approximately amounted to a $4.26 billion principal. The rapid shift from being a Bitcoin Development Company to a Bitcoin Treasury Company is clearly seen in the change of the Business Overview section of the Q2 report and the Q3 report. The latter, having pushed all software development, on Bitcoin or otherwise, to the background, now stated: MicroStrategy® is the world’s first and largest Bitcoin Treasury Company. We are a publicly traded company that has adopted Bitcoin as our primary treasury reserve asset. By using proceeds from equity and debt financings, as well as cash flows from our operations, we strategically accumulate Bitcoin and advocate for its role as digital capital. Our treasury strategy is designed to provide investors varying degrees of economic exposure to Bitcoin by offering a range of securities, including equity and fixed income instruments. In addition, we provide industry-leading AI-powered enterprise analytics software, advancing our vision of Intelligence Everywhere. We leverage our development capabilities to explore innovation in Bitcoin applications, integrating analytics expertise with our commitment to digital asset growth. We believe our combination of operational excellence, strategic Bitcoin reserve, and focus on technological innovation positions us as a leader in both the digital asset and enterprise analytics sectors, offering a unique opportunity for long-term value creation. (10-K, 2024–10–31, p.26.) What a Bitcoin Treasury Company meant in practice was simultaneously explained by the new MicroStrategy CEO Phong Le, in an 8K-filing: “As a Bitcoin Treasury Company, we plan to use the additional capital to buy more bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset in a manner that will allow us to achieve higher BTC Yield.” (8-K, 2024–10–30, Exhibit 99.1.) So with yet another rebranding of the business to a Bitcoin Treasury company, with a stated goal to create Bitcoin yield — a metric first spotted in September (8-K, 2024–09–16) — MicroStrategy entered The Golden Age in its pursuit of a place in the history books. Now fully focused on extracting Bitcoin yield to the fullest extent, the company defined the yield as, BTC Yield is a key performance indicator (“KPI”) that represents the % change period-to-period of the ratio between the Company’s bitcoin holdings and its Assumed Diluted Shares Outstanding. Assumed Diluted Shares Outstanding refers to the aggregate of the Company’s actual shares of common stock outstanding as of the end of each period plus all additional shares that would result from the assumed conversion of all outstanding convertible notes, exercise of all outstanding stock option awards, and settlement of all outstanding restricted stock units and performance stock units. (8-K, 2024–10–30, Exhibit 99.1.) The Bitcoin yield could come from multiple sources, and MicroStrategy has to this date utilized some of them more than others. By selling shares through ATM offerings at a premium to net asset value, the Bitcoin yield could come out of the proceeds from buyers of the newly issued shares. The total Bitcoin yield is in that situation precisely equal to the total premium paid by these marginal buyers. In other words, it is not inherent to the ATM offering itself, but is provided from outside the corporate structure. By raising funds through convertible bond issues, a positive Bitcoin yield could similarly come from Bitcoin purchases made with the proceeds from buyers of the bonds, while a negative yield could later materialize should the convertible bonds not convert in the future. By issuing straight bonds, a positive Bitcoin yield could also come from the immediate proceeds, but would very likely turn negative in the future when the debt had to be repaid. This last method has been employed only once by the company (twice if counting the short-lived Silvergate Bank issue). The first two methods are much more lucrative with shares trading at a premium to company net assets. If shares are at a premium, this constitutes an arbitrage opportunity for MicroStrategy when utilizing the ATM offerings. Though not strictly an arbitrage, convertible bonds issued while the company trades at a premium create opportunities as well. If the bond holders in the future convert the bonds at inflated conversion prices, they receive newly issued shares at a price often above the company’s net asset value, and the generated Bitcoin yield would then stand in proportion to this premium. All this considered, the company’s 21/21 Plan logically focused on the first two types of treasury operations; more shares and more convertible bonds were to be issued. Within two weeks of the bold 21/21 Plan MicroStrategy had bought approximately 27,200 Bitcoin for $2.03 billion, at an average price of approximately $74,463 per coin (8-K, 2024–11–12, Item 8.01). The purchase seems however to have been made by depleting the previously undertaken ATM offerings, and any new purchase was now to be made through the new plan. On the 18th of November, we could first see such a filing (8-K, 2024–11–18). The company had bought 51,780 new Bitcoin for $4.6 billion in cash, at an average price of about $88,627 per coin. This catapulted the company’s Bitcoin holdings to over 300,000 for the first time, marking yet another milestone. Over 13 million new shares were issued to fund this. Two days later, on the 20th of November, the company’s largest convertible bond issue to date was announced (8-K, 2024–11–20). $3 billion was raised at 0%, with a conversion price of $672.40 at 55% premium, and with maturity in 2029. This meant that both the ATM offering arm and the convertible debt arm of the 21/21 Plan were being utilized. Issuance now occurred at a pace hard to keep up with, as the MicroStrategy team wanted to take advantage of the company’s shares trading at a premium to net assets. On the 2nd of December the company’s Bitcoin holdings reached above 400,000 for the first time as more shares had been issued and sold (8-K, 2024–12–02). Bitcoin yield for 2024 was now enormous, and about half of the ATM offering arm of the 21/21 Plan had been exhausted. With Bitcoin yield surpassing even the highest company estimates of the Q3-report, everything was going better than planned. The new shares hitting the bid on enthusiastic buyers in record numbers did nothing to dent the premium to net assets — in fact, November saw net asset multiples at the highest levels in years. With shares trading at 200% above net asset value, this meant the MicroStrategy treasury team could issue and sell shares representing ownership of 1 Bitcoin, to fund the purchase of 3 new Bitcoin. Net proceeds, 2 Bitcoin, would then be the Bitcoin yield, divided and given to all shareholders in proportion to ownership of the company. The 2 Bitcoin would be the Bitcoin per share increase in aggregate. There are a number of reasons the company could extract Bitcoin yield at the pace it now was doing. Investors argued that MicroStrategy’s debt was cheap. And indeed, it borrowed billions of dollars and paid often less than 1% in annual coupons — far below official inflation numbers. In a world swimming in surplus cash, it seemed lenders were willing to part with capital at record low interest rates. While this debt mostly came in the form of convertible bonds, it was argued that the company would not suffer dilution, because the debt was accretive with shares trading at a premium to net asset value. In fact, investors clamored for this type of dilution, seeing as the Bitcoin per share metric could continuously increase. The premium to net assets, it was also argued, came from the fact that MicroStrategy was a “levered play” on Bitcoin. With ETFs, investors either had to suffer the dull movements of an asset without leverage, or face the large risks and volatility decay of levered ETFs. With MicroStrategy, you could get a levered upside, but withstand being wiped out in prolonged downturns, as proven in 2022 and 2023. Because of the company’s flexibility to use “intelligent leverage”, the premium seemed reasonable to any thrill-seeking bitcoiner. It was argued that the premium also originated from “regulatory arbitrage”. With this, investors pointed to the fact that the company helped facilitate exposure to Bitcoin for institutional portfolios not allowed to own Bitcoin, or even an ETF, outright. The bond market, very large but also very restricted, had with MicroStrategy’s innovative convertible bonds finally a way to get exposure to Bitcoin on the upside, while being protected to the downside through the bond “floor” — the principal amount. It did not seem unreasonable to assume that if MicroStrategy now was the main actor providing such financial products, it of course should reap profits from the operations, manifesting itself in the share premium. At this time, the popular narrative of an “infinite money glitch” was used to rationalize a premium as well. And on the face of it, it seemed reasonable. MicroStrategy could issue convertible bonds with conversion price at a premium and buy Bitcoin with the proceeds. As the price of Bitcoin increased, the company’s fundamental value increased, meaning shares increased in value as well. With the higher valued shares, the company could now issue even more bonds, in a seemingly circular flywheel dynamic. Another version of this narrative is the notion that MicroStrategy conducts a “speculative attack” on the fiat currencies. So when the 21/21 Plan was initiated, and with the above considerations in mind, investors could foresee large Bitcoin yield payments to the shareholder owned company coffers. The shares increased in price accordingly. Within less than a month, Saylor could announce that the company had achieved a Bitcoin yield surpassing 40% year-to-date — an enormous number compared to the yield of traditional finance. Within five weeks since launch, the year-to-date Bitcoin yield had surpassed 60%. Everything crushed expectations, and it appeared to many as if the Bitcoin yield could soon be extracted in a near unlimited supply as a stagnant fiat economy realigned its rusting axis with a new, pristine Bitcoin foundation. While the ATM offering activities were absorbed by the market happily enough, the demand for the company’s convertible bond issues seemed near bottomless as well as they grew ever larger in size. Michael Saylor had become the uncontested hero of many bitcoiners. Having accumulated the single largest Bitcoin hoard the world had ever seen, nothing could stop the company’s ascendancy. Or could it? While foreshadowing clearly can be read between the lines of the earlier rationalizations of MicroStrategy’s valuation, it should be remembered that all this mainly took place in a market where equities reached all time highs, gold reached all time highs, and finally, Bitcoin and MicroStrategy reached all time highs. Whatever unstructured thoughts investors had in their heads all seemed vindicated by the reality of riches quickly made. No one had much appetite to consider what was happening through a lens of first principles, where complex financial dynamics are broken down in smaller and smaller parts that you know to be true. As the premium on MicroStrategy shares to net assets increased and not decreased with the accelerating ATM offerings, it was simply accepted by some as a truth within the asset, rather than as a contradiction in need of logical inquiry through laws of finance. Let us now go through many of the popular narratives and see what substance they all really hold. “Don’t forget the dirt cheap loan (.063%) he secured for 6 or 700M.” — Reddit user #1. “Imagine loaning someone 700M and 0% interest instead of buying btc.” — Reddit user #2. It is an easy mistake to make, in assuming that a low interest rate on a debt instrument means it is cheap. But because MicroStrategy’s many bond issues for the purpose of buying Bitcoin are convertible to equity at a predefined conversion price, a low interest rate on the bonds can’t be compared with interest rates on normal loans. It should go without saying that if lenders demand more than 4% from the US Government, they will not simultaneously demand less than 1% from MicroStrategy — a company with decreasing revenues and where the main business now consists of buying and holding Bitcoin. Convertible bonds are hybrid securities with debt-like and equity-like features. They are in practice regular bonds with free embedded call options, meaning the price (also known as the premium) of the call options makes up for the lender’s loss of a high yield, or coupons. Here is a simplified illustration of a convertible bond’s value at maturity: In other words, with the convertible bond issues, MicroStrategy had not found a philosopher’s stone, but could bypass a high interest rate on its debt only by giving away upside as the bonds convert into equity at conversion price. Just because investors wish the company could borrow cheaply, does not make it so. The company’s straight bond issue in June 2021 was priced at 6.125% coupon payments, giving a truer indication of the company’s cost of capital. To further emphasize the point, consider for a second what could happen if MicroStrategy were to move the maturity date further away, or lower the conversion price of the convertible bond issue, meaning the strike price of the embedded call option. A situation could then arise where a lender pays MicroStrategy for the privilege of lending to the risky company! The yield on the bonds turns negative. While seemingly unreasonable at first glance, it is simply a result of a large prepayment by MicroStrategy in the form of the free call options, for the privilege of “borrowing cheaply”. We can conclude that the narrative breaks down, yet it is repeated regularly by many MicroStrategy investors every time another convertible bond issue is undertaken. Some investors seem to have misunderstood another aspect of the company’s convertible bonds. It concerns the notion that the company is protected from dilution due to how the convertible bond issues are structured. And it is not a surprise that many are confused. Consider for example the wording from the very first company announcement of a new issue: “Subject to certain conditions, on or after December 20, 2023, MicroStrategy may redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any […].” This sounds like a great deal to MicroStrategy — not so much for the lender. But this is common wording for convertible bonds. It does not mean that if the share price surpasses the higher conversion price stipulated for the convertible bond, MicroStrategy can somehow redeem the bonds just before they were to convert into equity (and as a consequence stop the dilution of existing shareholders). The wording is to force the bond holder to convert to equity, should that not happen for some reason. Certain bond investors may for example be market neutral hedge funds that short sell the shares while buying the convertible bonds. Many of them would rather the bonds not quickly convert — they seek volatility to profit from gamma trading. In practice, non-conversion is a situation which should never occur if conversion conditions have been fulfilled. Given a choice, bond holders of course want the higher valued shares at conversion price, rather than the initial principal amount plus a bit of interest. Looking at an SEC filing from MicroStrategy three and a half years after the first convertible bonds were issued, when early conversion of these notes to new shares actually took place, further strengthens this understanding: On June 13, 2024, the Company announced that it delivered a notice of full redemption (the “Notice”) to the trustee of the Company’s outstanding 0.750% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the “2025 Notes”). The aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes being redeemed is $650.0 million, which is equal to the current aggregate principal amount of 2025 Notes outstanding and held by investors. The Notice calls for the redemption of all of the outstanding 2025 Notes (the “Redemption”) on July 15, 2024 (the “Redemption Date”), at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2025 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the Redemption Date, unless earlier converted. As a result of the delivery of the Notice, at any time prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on July 11, 2024, the 2025 Notes are convertible, at the option of the holders of the 2025 Notes, at the applicable conversion rate of 2.5126 shares of the Company’s class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount (reflecting a conversion price of $397.99 per share). (8-K, 2024–06–13) In summary, if the share price increases, there will be conversion of these debt instruments into equity, meaning new shares. BitMEX research understood this to be the case as well while recently investigating the company’s capital structure. MicroStrategy is not protected from dilution — if it were, the lenders in the first convertible bond issue would not agree to a 0.75% coupon, but would likely demand something closer to a 6–10% coupon. As MicroStrategy issued more convertible debt, a question arose as to whether the potential dilution of equity by some convertible bonds affects the other convertible bonds or not. The answer lies in anti-dilutionary clauses. Consider that for convertible bonds the conversion ratio = principal amount/conversion price. Anti-dilutionary clauses means that the conversion ratio increases in proportion to dilution, meaning the conversion price decreases in proportion (as principal amount stays the same). A 5% dilution from one bond converting into equity, in other words, lowers the conversion price of the other bonds accordingly. Another way to view it is that the “strike prices” of all other issued call options, as baked into the convertible bonds, decrease in proportion to dilution. If there were no anti-dilutionary clauses, the company could simply issue shares and sell them to keep the share price from ever reaching the conversion price stipulated for the various issues. Lenders would for obvious reasons not accept such a convertible bond at low yield, because the free call option would be engineered to expire worthless. Again, they would demand perhaps a 6–10% coupon, not less than 1%, which has been the case for MicroStrategy. “Buy Bitcoin, Bitcoin goes up, Stock is tied to Bitcoin, Stock goes up, Sell stock, use cash to buy more Bitcoin, repeat. Infinite money glitch.” — Reddit user Somewhat related to the narrative of “cheap debt”, is the popular claim that MicroStrategy has found an “infinite money glitch”. An investor may for example argue that MicroStrategy can issue shares or convertible debt, sell it, purchase Bitcoin with the proceeds, the price of Bitcoin increases, the MicroStrategy share price increases as a function of the underlying Bitcoin holdings, and the company issues and sells even more convertible debt. And round it goes. But MicroStrategy does not have control over the Bitcoin price; the size of the issues is dwarfed by Bitcoin’s total market capitalization. Whatever buy pressure the company can apply on the Bitcoin price through these treasury operations, is multiple times offset by the sell pressure applied by the new issuance on the MicroStrategy share price. Note that the sell pressure is immediate if from share issuance or from convertible bond issues bought by market neutral hedge funds. The sell pressure is latent and may occur in the future if from convertible bond issues bought by regulatory restricted investors seeking Bitcoin exposure in roundabout ways. But there is ultimately no way around it all, unless the company were to pursue regular bond issuance, meaning the total risk undertaken by the company increases in proportion to the leverage. So any “infinite money glitch”, could just as well transform into permanent monetary losses should the company have to liquidate parts of its Bitcoin holdings or raise funds in a depressed market environment as the convertible bonds finally mature below conversion price. In other words, there is no glitch, but mainly debt-fueled risk taking which may give a certain boost to the upside, or a fatal blow to the downside. It remains to be seen how current treasury operations will affect the company when times are bad. The potential for creating shareholder value through capital structure shenanigans must obviously be discounted by the very real risk of future fire sales. “It is going up forever Laura”, though a catchy meme, is not economic reality. With the continued issuance of shares through ATM offerings to purchase more Bitcoin, onlookers thought that Saylor conducted some sort of magic trick, where he with no additional risk could increase the company’s Bitcoin per share ratio. It needs to be stressed that the issuance in 2023 and early 2024 was conducted with little to no premium to net asset value. In practice, this meant that any Bitcoin purchase through such a measure is fully offset by the dilution of the shares. The company may own 10% more Bitcoin after everything has been concluded, but any old shareholder has been diluted by about 10% as well. The Bitcoin per share ratio can’t increase this way — it is only possible with instruments such as regular bonds (meaning higher risk), convertible bonds (meaning higher risk), or with the issuance of new shares if the premium to net asset value is above one. Being generous to the prominent bitcoiners discussing the dynamics in the referenced video, they do in fact mention issuance during high price to earnings (P/E) ratios. The P/E ratio for MicroStrategy is currently irrelevant, however, and what they need to look at is, as has been pointed out, the premium to net asset value. MicroStrategy has no earnings to speak of, in relation to its high market valuation. Its P/E can in the future increase or decrease while booking unrealized gains or losses on the Bitcoin it owns, but that does not mean it is time to issue shares and buy more Bitcoin (or sell Bitcoin to buy back shares). The company should only consider such issuance if the premium has climbed some way above one. And such a scenario, in fact, happened a few months after the above discussion. It can be added here that the same dynamic holds true for convertible bond issuance. MicroStrategy can, if shares trade at a premium to net asset value, issue and sell the convertible bonds with a high conversion price, to the detriment of potential buyers of the bonds. As the shares trade at a premium, it is evident that the bond conversion price must be at an even higher premium, causing conversion conditions to be unusually hard to meet. As with the ATM offerings, MicroStrategy is better off issuing convertible debt when shares are at a premium. This share premium should not be assumed, however, but that will be discussed later in the report. More P/E-related confusion came years later, as MicroStrategy’s treasury operations brought heaps of Bitcoin yield to excited investors. In a clever twist of definitions, Saylor took this yield to be equivalent to earnings, and from there implied an extremely high fundamental value of the company based on a “P/E ratio” as well as “earnings growth” snapshot. There were multiple things wrong with this narrative. For P/E to be relevant in company valuation, the denominator must be somewhat consistent over time. A high one-off earnings number can make any company look undervalued versus peers, but it is all an illusion should that high earning not be followed by similar numbers. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin yield is provided mostly by retail investors buying company shares at a premium, and there is a finite supply of those. It is not honest to extrapolate temporarily high Bitcoin yield and imply the company should be valued much higher — that’s not how it works. Capturing the premium in ATM offerings is an activity with a finite lifespan, given the nature of the operation. Furthermore, part of the Bitcoin yield also stems from the convertible bond issues, and they come with a risk; the bonds may not always convert, meaning the principal amount would need to be paid back. Having then already categorized the Bitcoin yield stemming from such proceeds as earnings, is an Enron-like categorization error. The outstanding bonds in question must mature or redeem before booking the Bitcoin yield as earnings. Mark Meldrum pointed out exactly this. “#Bitcoin is a swarm of cyber hornets serving the goddess of wisdom, feeding on the fire of truth, exponentially growing ever smarter, faster, and stronger behind a wall of encrypted energy.” — Michael Saylor While MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin accumulation strategy kicked into high gear in 2024, it was argued that Bitcoin was the best reserve asset to hold there is for a company, because it has no drag, or no decay. The asset’s low maintenance costs were compared to those of the heavy machinery of Bristol-Myers Squibb, technical monstrosities that for obvious reasons are in need of constant service and care. The comparison fails because the machinery has an inherent yield — it produces more than what it consumes, or it would not have been painstakingly constructed — whereas the Bitcoin of MicroStrategy so far is a “dead asset”, sound asleep at the custodians without any conventional yield. While the comparison to physical capital is halting, it should be realized that even if one were to view them that way, MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings still impose costs. Someone, somewhere, is paying the Bitcoin miners, or the network has no hashrate and subsequently is susceptible to DoS attacks. Assuming that it is others, and not MicroStrategy, that will bear the brunt of this cost is probably a mistake. It should also be added that MicroStrategy makes use of US custodians — the decay being the annual costs and risk of theft and confiscation there. Bitcoin is not a completely cost-less asset to own, and should not be characterized that way. A master wordsmith of analogies, Michael Saylor has provided his share of comparisons as well. One of the more famous ones is that Bitcoin is a “Cyber Manhattan”, digital real estate which people should want to buy and own for a hundred years. Having accumulated a considerable portion of this digital real estate within a company framework, investors were soon to realize the true value of MicroStrategy. This comparison halts on many accounts. While painting real estate in Cyber Manhattan as immortal, as not subject to a fickle or corrupt mayor, to physical decay, to taxes, to regulations, to break-ins etc., this is first of all forgetting that all such factors can change. Many nations are already considering taxes on unrealized gains, and to prop up their own failing currencies and bonds, such assets may obviously be excluded from the tax schemes. But the most obvious difference between Bitcoin and real estate is the yield received from rental properties. This is a sector which will never go away, because investors always seek yield. Even in a hypothetical hyperbitcoinized world, investors can invest in the real estate market and earn Bitcoin yield forever. Again, Bitcoin is mostly a dead asset, as is a gold coin, or a seashell. It does not yield in itself (and shouldn’t). For yield it must first be traded for a capital good, such as ownership in factories, skyscrapers, service firms etc. Another popular but vague Saylor analogy is that the company’s Bitcoin are digital capital, and that this is something novel and exclusive in the economy. Capital are production goods — goods of higher order. They are goods that are aquired for the purpose of producing consumption goods. Any software used by companies around the globe is digital capital. Any currencies used by banks to create financial products or services are digital capital. The term is not at all exclusive to Bitcoin, and ironically, most of the time when Bitcoin owners think they hold “digital capital”, they hold the coins in cold storage, just as a gold owner may keep gold coins in a vault. If the good is not used for producing another good, then it is simply not capital. There is nothing wrong with that — not everything you own must be geared towards production. “Don’t try to put some premium trading bullshit. Don’t try to make something up from thin air. Because all your models are fucking broken.” — MicroStrategy thought leader. Notwithstanding the fact that the belief in a persisting premium to net asset value, or NAV, is itself a model, we are now approaching the most critical takeaways of the report. As 2024 proceeded with MicroStrategy shares exploding upward, and as the premium to the company’s net assets persisted in spite of the go-ahead of new Bitcoin instruments, some onlookers voiced their confusion about all this. Simultaneously, the popular Quant Bros duo released their first video on pre-split MicroStrategy, titled “Can MicroStrategy (MSTR) hit $10,000?”, outlining something which “the Ben Graham philosophy would just never understand”. The high valuation forecasting was based on the assumption that shares could uphold the premium. Together with the Bitcoin yield narrative explored later on, it is the most important narrative within MicroStrategy investment circles today. They form the basis from which an immense wealth transfer from new buyers to old ones is occurring. Let us start by investigating this premium to net asset value narrative, and the many shapes and forms it currently comes in. With the growing amount of issued convertible debt for the purpose of accumulating more Bitcoin, investors found themselves warming to the notion that owning MicroStrategy shares instead of owning actual Bitcoin, was a “leveraged play” on the latter. Intuitively, it felt like the leverage was in strict proportion to the debt ratio. But Mark Meldrum rightly pointed out that this is misleading. If shareholders are levering by senior convertible debt, the leverage is rather to the downside than to the upside. If the share price increases, the debt is all converted into equity at conversion prices, diluting shareholders. If the share price decreases, the debt is not converted, but the shareholders must eventually pay the principal amount as well as coupons, if any. Meldrum is slightly too harsh in his conclusion that there is no leverage to the upside. It should be remembered that the conversion prices of the various bond issues in general are about 35–50% above the price of MicroStrategy shares at the time of bond issuance. Because of this, there is leverage to the upside in proportion to the debt ratio of the company, but only up to the conversion price, at which the debt of the bond issue is eventually converted, and old shareholders must share in further price appreciation with the new ones. The upside from conversion price and onward has been given to the bond holders in the form of the free call options mentioned earlier, to make up for the low yield on the convertible bond issues. There was of course a valid reason MicroStrategy paid nothing in interest rate for some of its convertible bonds. The loans were not free. So with a conservative debt ratio of about 25%, the leverage quickly loses much power should the share price surpass conversion prices in a parallel move with Bitcoin. A large premium to net asset value can therefore not be explained by the company’s convertible bond issuance. For investors seeking leverage on Bitcoin price movements, there is also an ever-increasing arsenal of instruments catering to that demand, such as levered Bitcoin ETFs as well as options with a Bitcoin ETF as underlying asset. None of these “levered bets” on Bitcoin carry the premium that MicroStrategy does. So paying more for a Bitcoin held by MicroStrategy, than for one you could hold yourself, must therefore not be excessively rationalized by pointing at “the leveraged play”. If anything, indirectly purchasing Bitcoin for a premium through MicroStrategy shares trading at high multiples to net asset value, means the investor is overpaying in proportion to the premium, for the doubtful privilege of getting leverage with equity features. And finally, it is important to realize that past performance of the shares is not evidence of a “leveraged play” — it is only evidence of buyers bidding up the price. If the shares indeed have increased in price much more than Bitcoin — the company’s main underlying asset — it is simply because many investors believe that is how the stock “ought to behave”. If shares were to decline for a period of time while the price of Bitcoin goes up, that does not mean the company is some type of short play on Bitcoin. It would simply mean investors are selling shares for some reason, and others are buying Bitcoin for another reason. Causality hides in the fundamentals of company operations, not in the price discovery of jittery speculators. Looking at the slope of a Bitcoin per (diluted) share metric could give an investor a better picture of how large any “leveraged play” in practice really is, but the surest path is to dive into how the company capital structure actually functions. Quant Bros, and others, also argued that the premium must persist due to the nature of the future awaiting a Bitcoin-laden MicroStrategy. Holding close to 2% of all existing Bitcoin by beginning of December 2024, it was now argued that the Bitcoin were to form the basis of the vague banking system of tomorrow, meaning any premium to net asset value must be due to various future banking activities with the Bitcoin as digital capital. There are multiple things wrong with this assumption. First, MicroStrategy is a software company which has issued debt and equity to purchase Bitcoin. It is extremely generous to simply assume that they have an edge in banking, of all things. What is to say that other custodians such as Coinbase, Kraken, Binance or the likes, can’t offer better financial Bitcoin banking products and services? Or that more conventional banks such as Blackrock or JP Morgan ultimately won’t start accepting Bitcoin deposits? Banking is a sector which has painstakingly developed over many centuries, and to think that outsized profits related to it can be made by simply having accumulated a Bitcoin hoard is very naïve. Who will borrow the Bitcoin? For what purpose? What if there are large credit losses, private key incidents, or wrong choices in future chain splits? No such considerations are given when the Quant Bros are discussing, not a 2X premium, not a 3X premium, but a 60X premium to net asset value. Looking at Nvidia, not in the business of lending Bitcoin, but of producing extremely competitive microchips and related software, the comparison was still thought a valid one by the enthusiastic duo. Curiously, Saylor also has a habit of comparing MicroStrategy to totally different companies: “For people that haven’t been paying attention or don’t really do any research, if you actually logged into our earnings call or if anybody studied the company, that’s like saying there’s a perception that Microsoft trades are a premium to its underlying assets. Oh yeah, it does trades 50 times greater than its net tangible assets. So does Apple, so does Standard Oil, so does every operating company, so that the myth, the misunderstanding here is people don’t understand what our operating business is.” (x.com spaces, “Bitcoin as a National and Corporate Asset w/ Senator Lummis & Saylor”, 2024–11–19.) What does it mean to MicroStrategy’s valuation, were it to actually become a proper Bitcoin bank? The average price-to-book ratio in the banking industry is slightly above one, as banks periodically mark-to-market assets and liabilities. Any multiple above one represents a premium stemming from expectations of future growth and excess earnings. Why a MicroStrategy morphing into an adventurous Bitcoin bank should fetch a high premium remained unexplained by the Quant Bros duo, which instead speculated that it didn’t “[…] think [MicroStrategy] being the most valuable company on the planet is widely unreasonable.” We have to remember that a premium for the company can’t be rationalized by pointing at general increases in the price of Bitcoin or in the past price action of the shares themselves — that is all irrelevant. A fund or an ETF trades at net asset value, regardless of whether the underlying asset goes up 100% or down 50%. So, a premium on MicroStrategy shares must come from investors expecting future growth, not in the price of Bitcoin, but rather in the Bitcoin per share metric. This expectation must also take into account the additional risk the company accepts in order to achieve this growth. Any conservative investor should not accept a valuation much higher than net assets, especially considering how the Bitcoin per share metric is engineered to increase, but more on that later. Many banks, while borrowing more cheaply than they lend out, trade at deep discounts to net assets due to the uncertainty of how solid the asset side of the balance sheet really is. As MicroStrategy ramps up convertible bond offerings, an outsized increase in a Bitcoin per share metric can very well be met with cracks spreading within its capital structure, should things take a turn for the worse in Bitcoin markets. Saylor’s comparisons to Apple, Microsoft, Standard Oil and other companies trading at a premium to book value, are misleading mainly for the reason that those companies are not banks. Their assets are not liquid financial assets like MicroStrategy’s, and they may also have depreciated book values over decades to lower taxable profits, or simply booked assets a long time ago so that they no longer happen to reflect profits actually generated. Current cash flows from Windows software products likely far exceed whatever once was booked on the asset side of Microsoft’s balance sheet. It should also be mentioned that most companies can’t very well issue shares and conduct arbitrage trades by simultaneously buying factories, office space, software or oil fields. MicroStrategy, however, can conduct arbitrage trades by issuing shares in order to buy Bitcoin, a liquid, fungible asset traded on hundreds of regulated exchanges, at all times of the day. The comparisons to fantastic price-to-book ratios in totally different industries are made to dazzle potential buyers of shares with back-of-the-napkin calculations on ridiculous net asset multiples. But none of it is real. Michael Saylor may speak of Bitcoin as digital energy, or of MicroStrategy as the crude oil refiner of futuristic finance — it is still wrong to assume that net asset valuations from that industry are at all relevant. There is no doubt that a lot of confident talk can be heard everywhere in MicroStrategy investor circles, with regards to the company’s premium to net assets. But talk is cheap as they say. Turning instead to the actions of the company and its leadership, greatly supported by investors, we will note that these actions fly in the face of the arguments the investors themselves simultaneously are making for any premium. MicroStrategy issues shares (equity), and convertible debt (equity if the share price goes up). This is, again, not a bad strategy while the shares trade at a premium to net assets. But it should be remembered that the company in this way slowly helps close the valuation gap that is the premium, by using the proceeds to purchase Bitcoin or pay off old debt. With a premium to net asset value close to three, at time of the commencement of the 21/21 Plan, the company could sell one Bitcoin worth of shares, and purchase about three Bitcoin on the open market, or redeem three Bitcoin worth of debt. This is an arbitrage by definition — Saylor labeled the 200% risk-free return as exactly that while on CNBC in December. The glaringly obvious arbitrage explains why Saylor himself, as well as other company executives, have continuously sold shares throughout the year. It should be noted that Saylor’s selling plan was set in motion before Spring of 2024, when a considerable premium to net asset value had not yet materialized. Some investors argued that Saylor had to sell the shares, as previously received call options neared maturity date. But exercising the call options does not mean selling the shares is mandatory, unless there is some special clause we don’t know about. It just means the call options convert into shares at strike price. And even if it were the case that Saylor for one reason or another had to sell his newly received shares, the massive issuance and sale of company treasury shares would still have to be explained. Some optimistic MicroStrategy investors were then quick to note that though Saylor’s selling was not mandatory, it was done to buy more Bitcoin personally. But if they believed it was in his interest to do so — in fact that it was “a genius financial move” — why did they fail to consider why it is not in their own interest to do the same? If Saylor considers the shares overvalued in terms of Bitcoin, perhaps due to the arbitrage he himself has mentioned on national television, why do investors who idolize his every financial move argue the exact opposite? On the whole it may be concluded that the company and its executives do exactly what some defenders of the premium deem “NAV multiple trading bullshit”, and there is a logical reason for that. The constantly reoccurring SEC filings of executives selling company shares while never buying, do in fact hint of this truth which so few MicroStrategy investors dare think about. One wonders how many of these filings we must see before investors take note. Just after the announcement of the largest ATM offering in history, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Andrew Kang sold 5,700 shares (Form 144, 2024–11–06). One day after, board member Leslie Rechan sold 20,000 shares (Form 144, 2024–11–07). The same day Senior Executive Vice President & General Counsel Wei-Ming Shao sold 20,000 shares as well (Form 144, 2024–11–07). Not a week later, Leslie Rechan cashed out on 20,000 shares yet again, netting about $5.5 million (Form 144, 2024–11–12). On the 13th of November, board member Stephen Graham sold 30,000 shares, netting over $11 million (Form 144, 2024–11–13). That very same day, Wei-Ming Shao sold another 18,000 shares, and the day after he sold more. CEO Phong Le sold shares on the 14th as well (Form 4, 2024–11–15). A week later, Stephen Graham sold a massive 20,000 shares further, netting $9 million (Form 144, 2024–11–21). In the face of all this selling, investors still remained oblivious to the valuation conundrum the many narratives had obfuscated in their minds: Saylor, the other company executives, as well as the company treasury all appear to be massively selling the very shares that are supposed to be severely undervalued. Seeing as company executives and the company treasury keep selling shares in ever larger numbers, consider for a second a situation where the premium is slowly captured in this manner, so that shares end up with a valuation closing in on that of actual Bitcoin holdings. In other words, where the net asset value multiple is nearing one. Is it suddenly impossible for Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy to pursue the banking adventure, which supposedly is a foundation to the premium in the first place? Of course not. The company can just as easily pursue its wild career starting with 500,000, 600,000 or 700,000 Bitcoin. There are no incentives whatsoever for the company to leave arbitrage on the table for others to try to capture, since Bitcoin banking does not depend on any premium persisting. It is rather amazing to watch MicroStrategy thought leaders viciously defend the premium while the company and its higher-ups are franticly devouring it. There is another popular idea floating around in the MicroStrategy investing space, supporting the claim that the company should trade at a premium to net assets. It is the notion that “no one can catch MicroStrategy” in terms of the number of accumulated Bitcoin. The obvious question must then be, what this claim actually means, and why it should justify shares at a premium. If we are to assume that no other company will ever be able to own 2% of the total supply of all Bitcoin, that is all well and good, but what does that have to do with the premium? If owning such a large share of the supply somehow implies great profits in a future economy, it means the premium arises from being able to deploy the large Bitcoin stash for specific purposes. Why would not large Bitcoin custodians such as Coinbase, Kraken or Binance, perhaps sitting on even larger portions of Bitcoin, be able to apply their hoards in a similar fashion while sharing the profits with willing depositors? Would it be logical to say MicroStrategy “could never catch up”, because the company only sits on a few hundred thousand Bitcoin whereas some of these exchanges may have up to a million coins in custody? The notion is nonsense and has almost nothing to do with the fundamental value of MicroStrategy. Blinded by vast returns, many investors have stopped thinking when they assign a monopoly premium to the notion of simply owning more Bitcoin than others. Additionally, it should be noted that smaller Bitcoin banks (or “treasury companies”) can compete with larger ones. Though consolidation occurs naturally in a free market, there have been many thousands of banks competing for customers over the centuries, some specializing in order to survive. The same would occur within a growing Bitcoin bank sector. There are no natural monopolies. One prevalent argument in support of a sustained company premium to net assets concerns the so-called “regulatory arbitrage”. It is claimed that through innovative treasury operations, MicroStrategy can offer financial products to a regulated market which otherwise would have no opportunity to get exposure to Bitcoin. It should be remembered that MicroStrategy previously has discussed the premium in relation to the go-ahead of a Bitcoin ETF in January 2024. That day, shares fell sharply, only to quickly recover. Could it be that the premium to net asset value can be sustained due to the fact that, while many equity investors now have proper vehicles to get Bitcoin exposure, bond investors do not? The company’s convertible bonds have multiple times achieved large successes, so it has been logical to assume the regulatory arbitrage is real, and that MicroStrategy as sole issuer now could profit from it. But there are many things wrong with this assumption. First, we must ask ourselves why there are all these huge funds that are allowed to own only bonds. The prevention does not stem from nowhere, but from self-regulation in the case of family offices, and from laws in the case of pension funds etc. These rules were put in place by someone for the specific purpose of minimizing risk, while still generating returns to clients. As bond owners, these funds stand first in line to company assets should bankruptcy threaten. Now, Bitcoin is a very volatile asset, and while it may seem obvious to some why potential returns from it can look tempting to bond portfolio managers, it is likely not obvious to those enforcing the risk management rules. Any loophole suddenly allowing for large exposure to a non-yielding digital asset which very few have expertise on, can be closed just as quickly as it was innovatively created. For this reason alone should it not be assumed that a “regulatory arbitrage” premium is large and long-lived. How about other daredevils wanting Bitcoin exposure but can’t seem to find it due to regulations? Certain pension equity accounts may buy MicroStrategy shares, but not Bitcoin outright. Can a regulatory arbitrage premium persist through this type of investors? There is a case to be made here, but any premium would likely be very small, as agile investors could simply increase exposure to Bitcoin with their conventional savings, instead of paying a fee in proportion to the premium to net asset value when adding MicroStrategy to their pension accounts. It should not be assumed that people are not creative in finding the amount of Bitcoin exposure they are comfortable with, while minimizing more expensive, roundabout Bitcoin exposure through MicroStrategy. So, we are mainly left with a, perhaps temporary, demand for bonds with Bitcoin exposure, before regulators swing their hammers. And while observing MicroStrategy history up to the 21/21 Plan but also after, we indeed see such actors willingly buying the bonds, even when conversion price is reflecting a huge premium to net assets. Has MicroStrategy actually found an alchemic formula here so strong, to start attracting trillions of dollars from the untapped bond market? The answer is likely no. The buyers of the bonds are likely not the type of family offices where an ”orange-pilled” heir has convinced the managers that “Bitcoin bonds” is the exposure needed to increase pitiful past performance. No, what is likely happening with all the convertible bond issues is that MicroStrategy prices the bonds in a manner to attract market neutral hedge fonds, meaning arbitrageurs. Saylor has briefly mentioned these firms, as opposed to firms seeking actual Bitcoin exposure. For issue after issue, they can be spotted as the largest bond holders by anyone with a Bloomberg terminal. By buying the bonds, even when conversion price is at a large premium, and by simultaneously shorting the shares, these arbitrage funds can lock in close to risk-free profits. Due to the convex nature of the value of the convertible bonds, the hedge funds attempt to profit no matter whether MicroStrategy shares rise or decline: When shares go up in value, the (green) straight bond and embedded call option increase more in value than the (red) short position decreases in value. When shares go down in value, the short position increases more in value than the straight bond and embedded call option decrease in value. This is the lucrative gamma trading offered by MicroStrategy to the hedge funds to have the bond issues appear highly successful. Note that the “danger” of gamma trading — shrinking volatility — can be offset by pricing the bond issues at lower implied volatility than the market assigns the underlying asset, meaning shrinking the grey area of the graphs as they move away from each other. To conclude, whatever profits are made by these hedge funds are taken mainly from MicroStrategy shareholders; the profits do not materialize from thin air. The narrative of regulatory arbitrage continues to spread among retail investors, while little such demand is spotted in actual market activity. By talking about all these regulations, and by perhaps mispricing a bond issue or two to appease the hedge funds even more, Michael Saylor can regularly breathe life into the narrative that his company ought to trade at a premium to net assets because it alone can offer the financial products the regulated market demands. Mark Meldrum is even so cynical that he speculates that the hedge funds can attempt to engineer volatility outright, because it is the soil in which their gamma trades can grow and thrive. In other words, it may be in both the company’s and the hedge funds’ interest to see shares violently crash and recover, perhaps related to a leak to journalists, or to short report analysts. But all that is pure speculation. What we do know for sure is that though the narrative fails under scrutiny, it is still alive and well out there and helps absorb massive insider and company selling, resulting in enormous wealth transfers from new investors to old ones. The narratives surrounding the fact that MicroStrategy trades at a large premium to net assets are strong and in many cases convincing at a first glance. But here, they have all been investigated in detail and consequently dispelled. For large investors in MicroStrategy, it is of highest importance that the premium persists, because it is only from the golden goose that is the premium, that the egg, the “Bitcoin yield”, materialises. This metric, the increase in Bitcoin per share, is what continuously increases the fundamental value of the company, given any specific Bitcoin price. So let us now turn to the narratives surrounding the Bitcoin yield, and what they produce when working in tandem with those of the premium to net assets. “A Ponzi scheme is a type of financial fraud in which the ‘success’ of the entity is propped up by paying returns to initial investors from the money invested by subsequent investors.” (Investopedia.com) “Bitcoin yield” is the growth in Bitcoin per share — a metric mentioned many times in the report, and which has been excessively used to argue in support of shares trading at a premium to net assets. The logic provided is something to the tune of, while a Bitcoin is worth itself, a Bitcoin with a steady Bitcoin yield must be worth more. It is an honest metric for MicroStrategy in the sense that it takes into account conversion of convertible bond issues into equity. But it is dishonest in the sense that the yield is not stemming from conventional business operations such as lending out Bitcoin or developing Bitcoin related software applications. The company, likely for legal reasons, recognizes this to a degree in its SEC filings but still proceeds heavily with the metric. All that the “Bitcoin yield” ultimately is, is a transfer of wealth from new shareholders to old ones. Overvalued shares are sold, and understandably so, to fund new purchases of Bitcoin. These new Bitcoin increase the floor to where the share price must eventually go by the mechanic of arbitrage trades. The fundamental value of MicroStrategy, meaning the total valuation of the company’s Bitcoin holdings, increases in proportion to the proceeds from buyers of newly issued shares, because the shares trade at a premium. In other words, the new buyers are the Bitcoin yield. They are the arbitrage. There is no way of really knowing whether or not Saylor understands this himself — he might be lost in his own analogies. After the valuation of his company imploded in the year 2000, one of his friends noted that, “Mike let himself become this image that kept feeding on itself. After a while it’s drinking your own bathwater. After a while it became hubris.” Be that as it may, it is not with a little amount of irony that one of the company’s official principles today is to “treat all investors with respect, consistency and transparency.” The issuing of new overvalued shares to increase the Bitcoin per share metric helps securing a profit for old shareholders (as the fundamental value rises above what they paid for their shares). It also helps securing a loss for the new buyers (as the market value falls towards the rising fundamental value). It is a mechanical operation which at this very moment runs its course with $42B worth of muscle behind it, until there are no new buyers of shares at a premium. The circular reasoning binding the two most important narratives together, and which is feeding trusting souls to Saylor’s massive yield extractor, can be visualized like this: This has formed the core of the sentiment given rise to the extreme run-up to $500 per share while share issuance has been running hot. The higher the shares run, the higher Bitcoin yield can be demonstrated to new investors. As the new investors are buying with previous Bitcoin yield numbers in mind, the base from which the yield is extracted must by definition be ever larger for everything to work. Mark Meldrum came to the same conclusion and visualized it wittily in a YouTube video which may one day become a financial market classic. By rotating the company’s own 21/21 Plan slides, he built a pyramid from which MicroStrategy’s highly sought after Bitcoin yield were to be extracted in the years to come. As there is a limit of the number of new MicroStrategy investors, the ever-lower foundations of this pyramid must start crumbling soon. It is now evident that uninformed retail investors are providing the Ponzi yield through the company’s ATM offerings, but what about the convertible bond issues? Who are the victims in that case? If the buyers of the bonds were investors hindered by regulation to own Bitcoin outright, a yield could indeed stem from these investors as they acquired shares at conversion prices far above the net asset value of the company. But as we have seen, almost all bond holders are hedge funds that sell short the stock at the time they take a bond position. By borrowing the shares to sell them, we are sadly back at the incredulous retail buyer once more, acquiring shares at a large premium. The sobering conclusion is the following: the Ponzi yield is extracted from retail investors both through the ATM offerings and through the convertible bond issuance, by the fact that the latter so far is a façade, a Potemkin Village. All narratives have fallen. MicroStrategy’s new KPI is extracted within the framework of a corporation, and is, if not the exact definition of a Ponzi scheme, something very close to it. In other words, a greater fool’s dance seems to be playing out to the tune of a multitude of confused narratives. And as with all Ponzi-like financial structures, this one will eventually face reality as well. Having shown mainly with first principles thinking how the many MicroStrategy narratives are false or flawed, it is time to explore the result of a dawning realization in these matters. As company management continuously captures the premium to net asset value through more ATM offerings and convertible bond issuance, there is an incrementally growing portion of investors whose future Bitcoin yield will not cover the cost of entering the Ponzi scheme. Finding themselves in one of the bottom layers, they observe how new Bitcoin yield is shared among an ever-growing mass of investors, and while the metric declines, the hesitation of potential new investors increases. It is likely that investors then will attempt to front run the increasingly obvious conclusion of the Ponzi mechanics and sell their shares to recoup some of what they paid to enter. With a drastically declining Bitcoin yield, it could otherwise take many decades for a latecomer to recoup what he or she paid with a high multiple to net asset value. It is both quicker and much less risky to simply sell immediately into the bid, while a premium still exists. The declining premium and share price will have further consequences, as we soon shall see. Before thinking about what a premium collapse means to the company’s ability to handle its debt, let us consider whether or not a declining Bitcoin yield actually is the only factor which will send shares crashing towards net asset value. It has already been concluded that the convertible bond issues are vital to nurture a company premium to net assets through the regulatory arbitrage narrative. The company feeds retail investors the narrative so that they can be used for exit liquidity as well as for yield. But the problem is that the bond buyers are gamma traders — they need volatility to continuously profit, and they don’t care much whether or not the shares decline, go sideways, or rise in value, as long as they do it in a volatile manner. Mark Meldrum was to my knowledge the first to point this out; if MicroStrategy fails to provide this volatility — the convexity of the long position in the arbitrage trade — then the bond buyers quickly abandon ship. Taking their place are cross-asset arbitrage hedge funds shorting the shares while entering long positions in the underlying Bitcoin on a volatility neutral basis. Such operations could collapse the premium to net asset value even quicker than retail investors slowly coming to the realization that when Saylor says he loves Bitcoin, he really does mean it and has no plans to abandon the capture of the premium. What further makes the whole convertible bond capital structure strategy precarious is that the larger the debt issues, the more the gamma traders will tame the volatility of the shares as they add to short positions when shares go up, and exit short positions when shares go down — all to stay as delta neutral as possible. In other words, they inadvertently pave the way for their own future indifference to the company, to the company’s concern. While trading at a premium to the company’s net assets is highly advantageous given the treasury strategy pursued by MicroStrategy, it has to be remembered that MicroStrategy’s ability to buy Bitcoin mainly occurs in such good times as well, after Bitcoin has already gone up in price. In other words, the advantage is often offset to a degree. The June 2021 convertible debt issue was the last one in nearly three years, owing to the brutal downturn starting in the beginning of 2022. MicroStrategy, riskier to lenders as the valuation of its underlying assets falls while its debt obligations stay the same, could not take true advantage of a low price of the asset it so highly believed in. By not issuing convertible debt in 2022 or 2023, the company could only make smaller Bitcoin purchases from past issuance, from small proceeds of the software business, and from small issues of shares and of debt with Bitcoin as collateral. To further make the point, the three largest bond issues to date have all occurred when Bitcoin was near its all-time high at the time, in February 2021, in September 2024, and in November 2024. MicroStrategy is tied to the mast when a storm hits, and can walk around on deck only in calm waters. The decline in the cost basis of its Bitcoin holdings, when it happened, was always negligible. The endpoint of this dynamic first makes itself known in longer market downturns. Debt must always be paid back. As MicroStrategy’s convertible debt is raised mainly in good times, it should go without saying that the fact that the size of it persists while the value of the asset it bought can fall, means balance sheet distress is a real possibility. Paying back the debt in the future may lead to very high dilution, at or below net asset value, or to the raising of new debt at exorbitant interest rates due to debt overhang as lenders demand yield in proportion to the risk they take on. In 2021, when the company’s balance sheet was not in distress, lenders demanded over 6% on straight bonds. Should none of these alternatives prove feasible, selling company assets may be the only option left for MicroStrategy. Since its only assets are the hoarded Bitcoin, those are what’s going to hit the bid on the open market in a frantic fire sale, where MicroStrategy must sell at any price. This is one possible endpoint of shares losing their premium to net asset value; falling below previously reached bond issue conversion prices, one after another, paves the way for the fire sale of pristine assets to creditors. What previously proudly was proclaimed “permanent capital”, then morphs into anything but. The claim could perhaps have been made should MicroStrategy’s balance sheet have contained no debt, but that is not the case. In a twist of irony not unfamiliar to Michael Saylor, the forced selling of assets, while making a mockery of previous “permanent capital” statements, would also be conducted in the light of previous arrogance shown the short sellers now about to flock. Saylor has famously begged people to short his company, because “they will have to buy our shares when we need them to.” Potentially on its head, Saylor would have to sell his permanent capital “when creditors and short sellers need him to.” Once this has occurred, it will be very hard to start up Bitcoin yield generation again as retail investors hesitate to bid up shares to a premium. While a 25% debt ratio may be of no immediate danger, the euphoria emerging from a Bitcoin bull market, combined with dreams of imminent hyperbitcoinization, may very well see this ratio creep up at a time when it should rather decrease. An increasing debt ratio would come hand in hand with an even faster increasing cost basis for the company Bitcoin. Any prolonged market downturn would then be able to cause severe damage, and Saylor might yet come to regret ever uttering the phrase “volatility is vitality”. The picture emerging in mainly Washington Post articles from 1999 and 2000 is clear enough to draw some final conclusions when tying together the past with what we can observe in the present. Though journalists often have to put a flair on things, to put it lightly, Michael Saylor’s own way of talking and his own actions are hard to twist. The man back then showed definite signs of being a cult leader, and the word “cult” is mentioned many times in articles from those days, long before the obscure mentions of cyber hornets and encrypted energy, and the daily posts of AI generated images of himself. Whether or not the word applies today, I leave for the reader to judge. Saylor’s convoluted analogies could capture a room full of educated people back then, and they do it today as well. Coming in new shapes and forms, investor hype for “proactive intelligence” morphed into investor hype for “intelligent leverage”. The likelihood that the company eventually will face a second collapse is high enough to stay far away. -- -- 1 Bitcoin. Austrian Economics. Monetary History.

On track to build the most powerful supercomputer. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Elon Musk's xAI has raised $6 billion in its latest funding round, pushing its total capital raised to $12 billion at a valuation of $50 billion, reports TechCrunch. The round, which involved 97 investors, followed a doubling of xAI's valuation within six months and solidified the company's position as a growing competitor in the AI sector. Major investors in this funding round include Nvidia, AMD, Andreessen Horowitz, Blackrock, Fidelity, Kingdom Holdings, and Sequoia Capital, among others. Only previous investors who backed Musk's earlier ventures, such as the Twitter acquisition, could participate. The minimum investment per participant was $77,593, but the identities of most investors remain undisclosed. The company plans to raise additional funds next year to sustain its growth as it seeks to challenge larger rivals in the generative AI market. xAI has already built the Colossus supercomputer, which is powered by 100,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs. In the coming months, it is expected to expand to 200,000 Nvidia GPUs, and eventually, Elon Musk hopes to build a supercomputer with one million GPUs. For reference, $6 billion is roughly enough to procure a supercomputer with servers containing 100,000 Nvidia GPUs at $30,000 per processor. Typically, GPUs account for around half of the cost of a supercomputer cluster. With more powerful supercomputers, xAI will be able to train more sophisticated large language models to gain an edge over OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini. Musk has positioned xAI to compete directly with industry leaders like OpenAI. He has accused OpenAI and its partner Microsoft of engaging in anti-competitive practices that hinder funding for alternative companies. Also, Musk claims that xAI benefits from data drawn from X. At the same time, X's recent privacy policy change allows xAI to train its models using user-generated content on the X platform. Beyond X, xAI leverages data from other Musk enterprises like Tesla and SpaceX to enhance its AI models. xAI has rapidly advanced its technology with its flagship AI model, Grok, which powers several tools on X, including a chatbot accessible to X Premium users and image generator Flux. Unlike politically correct OpenAI, Grok can answer provocative questions while maintaining some boundaries on sensitive topics. Grok currently supports customer service for SpaceX's Starlink internet service, and xAI is exploring potential collaborations with Tesla for R&D purposes. However, some Tesla shareholders have expressed concerns, accusing Musk of reallocating resources from Tesla to xAI and viewing the two companies as competitors. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. xAI generates approximately $100 million annually, significantly trailing competitors like Anthropic and OpenAI, which are targeting billions in revenue. They also received significantly more funding: Anthropic and OpenAI have secured billions in funding. The report claims that AI venture capital activity reached $31 billion in Q3 2024, and as xAI accelerates its development, it aims to carve out a larger share of this booming market.

By exploring crypto trends, investors, businesses and policymakers alike can harness the ... [+] transformative power of blockchain technology to build a more inclusive and sustainable future. The world of cryptocurrency is evolving rapidly, moving beyond the headlines of Bitcoin’s market dominance and Ethereum’s smart contracts. In 2025, this ecosystem will witness profound changes influenced by global economic trends, regulatory clarity and technological advancements. In this article, we’ll explore five key trends shaping the future of cryptocurrencies—some widely anticipated, others emerging quietly but promising transformative impacts. By understanding these trends, readers can prepare for the opportunities and challenges ahead in this dynamic landscape. Cryptocurrencies have made monumental strides in recent years, moving from niche interest to mainstream adoption. The year 2024 was pivotal, marked by the approval of multiple Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), legitimizing digital assets as a mainstream financial tool. Bitcoin’s halving event further spurred a bullish market, propelling the cryptocurrency to new all-time highs. Simultaneously, institutional adoption surged as major financial players like BlackRock and Fidelity entered the crypto space, while decentralized finance (DeFi) continued to disrupt traditional financial services. However, challenges remain, including navigating fragmented regulations and addressing environmental concerns tied to blockchain technologies. These developments set the stage for 2025, a year that promises even more innovation and integration. Environmental sustainability is a critical concern in the crypto industry, and regenerative finance (ReFi) aims to address this by funding ecological restoration projects through blockchain. ReFi goes beyond sustainability to actively repair environmental damage, leveraging financial incentives to achieve these goals. Projects utilizing carbon-negative mechanisms and renewable energy-powered mining operations are leading the charge. The implications of these innovations are vast. Not only could ReFi reshape public perception of blockchain technology, but it also paves the way for crypto’s integration with global environmental goals. With public and private partnerships focusing on green technology, ReFi projects may become a cornerstone of crypto’s future. As blockchain networks grow, the need for efficient dispute resolution mechanisms has become apparent. In 2025, on-chain governance systems and smart contract-based arbitration are gaining traction as viable solutions to disputes arising in decentralized ecosystems. These systems offer automated and transparent ways to address conflicts without relying on traditional legal frameworks. The benefits are clear: faster resolution times, reduced costs and enhanced trust among network participants. This trend holds particular importance for enterprises adopting blockchain technology, as robust governance structures will be essential to scaling their operations securely and confidently. Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) have become a focal point in the financial world, and 2025 is poised to be their breakout year. Countries across both developed and emerging markets are actively rolling out CBDC projects to modernize payment systems and promote financial inclusion. According to a 2024 report from PYMNTS.com, 134 nations are currently exploring digital currency initiatives. For underbanked populations, CBDCs represent a secure, low-cost alternative to traditional banking. “CBDCs, designed as virtual tokens, hold the promise of providing a modern and efficient digital infrastructure for the most liquid and trusted financial asset in the world: central bank money, also known as cash,” says Carmelle Cadet, founder and CEO of EMTECH. “Digital cash not only enables anyone with trusted onboarding to access financial markets but also provides essential liquidity for the new digital rails, all while minimizing money laundering and protecting consumers.” By reducing reliance on physical cash and enhancing transaction efficiency, CBDCs have the potential to reshape economic policy and boost financial literacy. However, their integration into existing financial systems is likely to spark critical debates about privacy and centralization—especially in countries where governments maintain strict control over monetary systems. The rise of decentralized identity (DID) systems is reshaping how individuals manage and protect their digital identities. Built on blockchain technology, DID systems allow users to maintain control over their personal data while providing secure authentication for online services. Unlike traditional identity solutions, these systems eliminate the need for centralized authorities, reducing the risks of data breaches and identity theft. DID solutions are poised to transform industries such as healthcare and e-commerce, offering more secure and user-centric experiences. As concerns about privacy and data misuse grow, DID systems represent a critical step toward empowering individuals in the digital age. As I explain in Top Decentralized AI Projects Of 2025 Amid OpenAI Copyright Concerns, decentralized artificial intelligence (deAI) is set to reshape how AI operates by leveraging blockchain to distribute computation and data storage across a decentralized network. Unlike traditional AI systems controlled by centralized entities, deAI enhances transparency, security and privacy by enabling individuals and organizations to access machine learning tools while retaining control over their data. This shift addresses growing concerns about data misuse and centralized monopolies. The integration of deAI with blockchain is unlocking transformative potential across industries like healthcare, finance and logistics. For example, anonymized patient data shared via deAI networks can improve diagnostics while safeguarding privacy, and financial institutions can use decentralized models to detect fraud collaboratively without exposing proprietary data. These advancements democratize AI access, empowering smaller players to compete in traditionally closed markets. As we move into 2025, deAI's role in decentralizing innovation will be pivotal, addressing ethical concerns around AI governance and fostering collaboration across sectors. By combining the strengths of blockchain and AI, deAI represents a major step toward equitable and secure technology solutions in an increasingly data-driven world. Cryptocurrencies are no longer confined to speculative trading. As the trends for 2025 demonstrate, they are becoming integral to global finance, technology and social equity. From ReFi’s environmental solutions to CBDCs’ potential for financial inclusion, the crypto ecosystem is tackling some of the world’s most pressing challenges. At the same time, advances in governance and decentralized identity are ensuring these innovations remain secure and trustworthy. To thrive in this evolving space, staying informed and engaged is essential. By exploring these trends, investors, businesses and policymakers alike can harness the transformative power of blockchain technology to build a more inclusive and sustainable future. The crypto industry’s key challenges include navigating a fragmented and evolving regulatory landscape, addressing scalability and energy efficiency concerns and increasing public trust through education and transparent governance. Privacy debates surrounding CBDCs and regulatory clarity for DeFi projects will also be pivotal. Over regulations could slow innovation in the short term, particularly for decentralized platforms and privacy-focused projects. However, the establishment of clear, uniform rules and fair enforcement could enhance trust, attract institutional players, and promote sustainable growth in the long term. The most transformative trends include institutional adoption of Bitcoin ETFs, the mainstream rollout of CBDCs to enhance financial inclusion and the rapid rise of green crypto projects aligning blockchain innovation with global sustainability goals. These developments will shape the future of both the industry and global financial systems.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses 17 Stocks And Blasts Zero Day Options. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) stands against the other stocks. In his second appearance on Squawk on the Street after the Fed's interest rate cut, Jim Cramer had a lot to say about the Fed's decision and the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) data release. The PCE data was a boon for investors as it signaled that inflation was dropping. Cramer started by pointing out that the PCE data release was "somewhat reassuring. Because if we do get lower inflation, I think it's certainly a possibility because we're starting to get our arms around what's really causing inflation. Then it doesn't seem so devastating, what happened on Wednesday." He added that the release doesn't reverse the market fall since he thinks that the market fell after "rampant Bitcoin speculation, after speculation in nuclear power, after speculation in quantum computing, after speculation in what I regard as being these, really kind of, I'll put them in commercial aerospace, because of Musk." Cramer believes that the central bank officials " don't wanna see that. They don't point blank say it. I wish they had. But that's what's going on here, it's the air going out of that balloon." However, while he believes that the market might have fallen because of the balloon 'deflating', this has created an interesting opportunity. According to Cramer, the speculation in the market has been replaced by "some really interesting fundamental news. And I think that we are the most oversold that we've been in, you're up there in terms of the ten-year low, if you bought, and I've got some numbers that are saying if you bought today, three months later, you made money. In every single case, it's really rather extraordinary." While the threat of a US government shutdown over the holidays has been averted, Cramer also had some interesting takes on the conflict in Congress. He shared that "I studied shutdowns for my last book. And every shutdown was a buying opportunity. They're always as frightening as the way we've been covering this morning. Uh, and they always end up being a buying opportunity. Because they are considered to be so frightening." Cramer backed his claims by sharing data that took all night to calculate. He added "What I'm saying, I know this is against the grain of what I'm hearing, but you're supposed to buy today not sell it. All the data I have, all the data I have, I mean I've got data going back ten years. And. . . [THE] oscillator, the S&P oscillator that I follow. It's minus eight, uh, thank you to the S&P people." The negative oscillator reading means that buying stocks at the dip and then holding them for certain time periods has historically yielded returns. Cramer pointed out "You have a median gain three months later of 4.55, sixty days, 11.0. I mean, this is unassailable stuff. I couldn't believe it. I asked them to calculate it. Took them all night to calculate. But oh my! You buy today, you make money! I don't know what to say, the data is the data! The forecast is the forecast! The guidance is the guidance!" He continued and added that while watching the markets early morning on Friday, he wondered "Who are these numbskulls who're doing this. They are people who are sleep-deprived, they don't know what they're doing. And frankly, we now know we have become the crack house. We are the crack house!" Cramer didn't hold back when criticizing investors who are obsessed with zero-day options. These options expire after the trading day ends, and therefore, they are for those investors who seek to profit from the market's daily moves. According to Cramer, people who trade these options "are debilitated. They are, they believe the long term means you gotta hold it to the afternoon. Uh, these people I feel bad for them because they're losing fortunes, they don't know what they're doing." He believes that day trading is more "addictive" than online gambling. "Depression, anxiety, all the things that are tell-tale of how to wreck your life are now part of our market," believes Cramer. In fact, according to him, options trading needs to be talked about more. Cramer pointed out that "$538 million is options! Out of $1.9 billion. $538 million! Crypto is $268 million! Their next big line is margin interest! $220 mil! Why aren't people talking about this?" According to Cramer, "These people are losing a lot of money. And maybe they ought to take a little more long-term approach. We have to say, look, if you think that you can trade up against professionals, and the professionals have software, the professionals have algorithms, the professionals know more than the people who are day trading. That's what I'm saying." However, he does believe that "you can balance it. You can do some of this stuff for fun if you want to. But my father was wiped out by trading the National Video. Now go Google National Video. He did day trading for it all the way down." Our Methodology To make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC's Squawk on the Street aired on Friday. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A close-up of a worker inspecting a galvanised sheet steel product in a well-lit warehouse. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 32 Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) is an American steel company that sells manufactured products and iron-based raw materials. Steel has been one of the poorest-performing sectors in the American economy in 2024. Steel spot prices have struggled throughout 2024, leading to Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE)'s peers such as US Steel posting disappointing earnings. Amidst industry troubles, the firm has kept up with stock repurchases despite the fact that its shares have lost 33.6% year-to-date. These repurchases were also on Cramer's mind as he noted: "Well Nucor bought a ton of stock when it was much much higher. And in many of the greats are going down in this country. If you looked at Nucor which is obviously the gold standard. I mean this company has lost 34% of its value this year and that's an example Carl of why if you really think that the Fed made a mistake, you would say well listen I'm looking at that company which is incredibly important for construction. Or incredibly important for, uh, every single manufacturing plant in this country. And it shows you, look out, we're, we're showing real weakness there. So we've got an economy that's weak and an economy that's strong. It's hard to reconcile." Overall NUE ranks 16th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of NUE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NUE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Wall Street shares 4 predictions for AI going into 2025 — including 3 trades to maximize returns
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-investing-strategy-tips-2025-data-center-infrastructure-stock-picks-2024-12

It's looking like the AI hype will continue for a third consecutive year. The technology has polarized investors and market experts across Wall Street, with some believing it'll completely transform the economy and others believing it's creating a stock-market bubble ripe for popping. Regardless of what you think about AI, it's had an undeniable impact on the market. Hardware, Big Tech, anything data-center-related — investors who bet on these areas of the market this year reaped handsome rewards. But technology advances fast, and today's AI playbook may very well become outdated in the new year. Business Insider compiled views from four Wall Street firms to see what some of the most influential financial institutions think about the future of AI. Here's what Wall Street is predicting about the technology and how you can update your portfolio. If there's one thing that AI proponents and naysayers can agree on, it's that the technology is expensive to produce. Building data centers, stocking up on GPUs, powering AI — all of that doesn't come cheap. In 2024, Big Tech companies poured mind-boggling amounts of capital into building out AI infrastructure. By the end of the year, it's likely that Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft will have spent $222 billion on AI capital expenditures, which is a 50% increase from last year, according to UBS. But that's just the tip of the iceberg, according to some Wall Street firms. According to BlackRock's 2025 outlook, "major tech companies are starting to rival the U.S. government on research and development spending." "We estimate spending on this infrastructure could top $700 billion by 2030, equivalent to 2% of U.S. GDP," the asset manager added. Expect continued investment in data centers, chips, and power systems as AI models become more complex. That means investors who bought into the picks and shovels AI trade in 2024 should stay invested, UBS argues. Going into next year, the bank recommends looking into utilities, as the electricity providers fueling AI data centers are seeing a steady uptick in demand. Examples of utilities funds include the Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLU) and the Fidelity MSCI Utilities Index ETF (FUTY). AI investing in 2024 was largely defined by what Goldman Sachs calls the Phase 1 and Phase 2 trades of AI infrastructure. Investors flocked to Nvidia, the superstar Phase 1 stock, as well as the Phase 2 AI picks and shovels, including data centers and other semiconductor companies. While those trades are clearly still hot, there'll be new opportunities to invest in AI as more use cases emerge, many on Wall Street believe. 2025 will see a widening field of investment opportunities, particularly in so-called Phase 3 companies that are monetizing AI and using it to boost their revenue streams, Goldman Sachs says. The bank has identified 11 stocks that are using AI to increase their revenues, per their last quarterly earnings calls. They include ACV Auctions, Commvault Systems, Cloudflare, Datadog, DigitalOcean, Dynatrace, Fortinet, Gartner, Hubspot, Mastercard, and ServiceNow. UBS also highlights a few areas of the market in particular for investors to keep an eye out for in the coming years. "We expect successful generative AI applications across a range of industries, including in health care, cybersecurity, and fintech," UBS said. US stocks have outperformed global markets in 2024 thanks in large part to AI. The large sums being spent on AI are paying off for US companies. According to Apollo, the US has more data centers than all other major countries combined, giving it a significant advantage in the industry. "The US is experiencing a surge in corporate and research spending on the back of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution—a dynamic not seen in other developing nations or even China," Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo, wrote in the firm's 2025 outlook. Robust AI investment may be part of the reason why the overall US economy has performed so well. "The federal government's investments in green energy and infrastructure, along with private sector investments in AI, have been crucial to the nation's economic resilience," Sløk added. The boom in construction from building AI infrastructure, as well as the ongoing energy transition to power data centers, is a powerful tailwind for the US economy and the AI trade going into 2025. For that reason, BlackRock is betting on US equities going into 2025. "We think the AI mega force will benefit U.S. stocks more and that's why we stay overweight, particularly relative to international peers such as European stocks," the asset manager wrote in its 2025 outlook. Some examples of US-based AI funds include the Xtrackers Artificial Intelligence and Big Data ETF (XAIX) and the iShares US Technology ETF (IYW). AI could have an overlooked benefit to the stocks in your portfolio: it could lower inflation. The technology has the potential to usher in a new era of labor and productivity gains for the economy, according to BlackRock and UBS. As more companies adopt AI tools, routine tasks will be automated and new business models will be implemented. That'll lead to decreasing inflation as the supply of goods and services increases, thanks to automation. This won't be an instantaneous change, but rather one that slowly emerges over the next few years, UBS said in its 2025 outlook. That's a promising side effect of AI, especially as the Federal Reserve has battled to bring inflation down in 2024 and some economists speculate that inflation could remain elevated in the long term. "If AI's potential can be realized, we believe it could augur a productivity revolution and contribute to lower prices for various goods and services and higher rates of economic growth," UBS said. "For investors, at a macroeconomic level, we believe the AI revolution is likely to help lower inflation, boost growth, and therefore result in higher real interest rates in the years ahead," the bank added.

Title: More Reasons for Cautious Optimism About the Demise of The Green Energy Fantasy
URL: https://wattsupwiththat.com/2024/12/25/more-reasons-for-cautious-optimism-about-the-demise-of-the-green-energy-fantasy/
Time Published: 2024-12-25T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change From the MANHATTAN CONTRARIAN Francis Menton My post on Saturday noted one big reason for optimism that the green energy fantasy is coming to the end of its run: the first country, Germany, has apparently begun to hit the green energy “wall.” Although Germany has never consistently reached even 50% of its electricity production from wind and solar, its ability to continue its green energy dreams has stalled: its electricity prices have soared, its manufacturing sector has been seriously undermined, its economy is in recession, and recently its green-promoting government has fallen. Its failed example now stands for others to see and avoid. And as I look around at developments since the election, I see a number of other reasons to reinforce my cautious optimism. Maybe it’s that the political environment has changed, and maybe it’s that some people are starting to recognize that you can’t beat the laws of physics; and maybe it’s some of both. Here are examples: Banks and investment firms quitting net zero “alliances” On Saturday’s post, commenter William Bell asked “Who, exactly, is preventing third-world inhabitants from using wood, charcoal, coal, petroleum derivatives, and/or natural gas for fuel and by what means?” Apparently Mr. Bell, and maybe many others, is unaware of the many “alliances” of banks and investors seeking to starve fossil fuels of investment capital, and thus prevent third-world countries (and everybody else) from continuing to use them. Most of these groups are somehow directed and overseen by the UN. Examples of these groups include the Net Zero Banking Alliance (“Bank-led, UN-convened”), the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, and Climate Action 100+. I’m sure that I have not got them all. The members are, or have been, a who’s who of all the biggest banks and investment firms in the world. The Center Square reports here on December 20 that two rather significant banks, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo, have just quit the NZBA: Not soon after the general election, and within two weeks of each other, two major financial institutions have left a United Nations Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA). This is after they joined three years ago, pledging to require environmental social governance standards (ESG) across their platforms, products and systems. House Judiciary Committee issues report accusing large money managers of running a “climate cartel” On December 13, the House Judiciary Committee issued a Report titled “Sustainability Shakedown: How a Climate Cartel of Money Managers Colluded to Take Over the Board of America’s Largest Energy Company.” The Report documents the process by which the Climate Action 100+ alliance, “emboldened” by encouragement from the Biden/Harris administration, orchestrated replacement of three board members of Exxon in May 2021. The collusive actions of the largest investment firms and proxy advisors are described as a “cartel” clearly violative of the antitrust laws. Red state AGs sue investment firms for antitrust violations for colluding on “climate” issues Maybe it’s coincidence, but shortly before the issuance of the Judiciary Committee Report, an antitrust suit was brought on November 27 by eleven red state AGs, led by Ken Paxton of Texas, accusing participants in the investment industry of collusive conduct in enforcing “climate” and other “ESG” goals. The defendants in the case include the three largest money managers, Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street. From Bloomberg Law, November 27: BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. were sued by a group of states led by Texas for allegedly breaking antitrust law by boosting electricity prices through their investments, in the highest-profile lawsuit yet against the beleaguered ESG industry. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and 10 other states claim the money managers, as part of their green agenda, combined their market clout and membership in climate groups to pressure coal producers to cut output. TotalEnergies pauses major wind farm in the waters off New York and New Jersey Also on November 27, French energy giant TotalEnergies announced that it was “pausing” its major Attentive Energy off-shore wind project in the Atlantic Ocean off New York and New Jersey. In his announcement of the “pause,” Total’s Chairman specifically attributed the action to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. From Offshore, November 27: TotalEnergies has reportedly paused development of the Attentive Energy wind farm it planned to build off the coast of New York and New Jersey, CEO Patrick Pouyanne said Tuesday at an energy industry conference in London. “I have decided to put the project on pause,” TotalEnergies’ CEO Patrick Pouyanne said at the Energy Intelligence Forum, according to reports from Bloomberg and Reuters. The decision is one of the first tangible signs of a halt in investment in renewable power sources due to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. Trump has vowed to stop offshore wind energy development “on day one” of his next term starting in January 2025. The new Trump administration is still almost a month away from taking office, but already the anticipation of its arrival is having the positive effect of driving some of the parasites into hiding. There are many more such positive developments out there. I’ll see if I can assemble a few more before year’s end. Meanwhile, I’m as hopeful as I’ve ever been that the green energy mania is fading. Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email. Type your email… Subscribe It looks as if the green energy bandwagon may be slowing in America. However, in Europe, it’s still full steam ahead. Ed Miliband is utterly determined that Britain will be the first lemming off the edge of the cliff and will do absolutely anything to achieve this. He wouldn’t care if a million Britons froze to death in winter if his insane climate goals were achieved. Miliband is not dictator for life. The UK is still a democracy and the voters will be heard. The outcome of the Labour foolishness is predetermined – it is only a matter of time before the voters demand change. The support for Net Zero will only end in the UK when the actual electricity grid cannot support the population and randomly fails during the coldest weather. Therefore Labour/Conservative/LibDem alliance is in not danger at the moment. It’s probably going to be more problematic as Rachel from Complaints will have to raise more taxes in April at the current rate of progress. In the mean time percentage on ZE vehicles being sold rises as total sales of cars falls. That part of the plan is working well. The UK is not a functional democracy since the choices we have are limited and as many already know, the Davos Uniparty have infected our system so all the main parties are variants of socialism. But the fastest growing party Reform gives us hope as while they may have got only 5 MPs, their proportion of the vote was higher than the LimpDumbs who got the third highest number of MPs. Reform were very close to winning a lot of seats that went to Labour in the north and are close to Tory seats in the south. The local council elections in May will be a popularity poll on our Student Union government and the signs are they will get hammered. That could bring about a new leader for Labour. As for the inexperienced Rachel from Accounts/Complaints? She might be toast come the spring as the UK will be in recession with inflation rising and interest rates stuck, but more importantly government bond rates will be high and that drives the mortgage interest rates which ‘working people’ – something Labour have struggled to define – will be feeling. You are almost right. actually, all political parties are variants of socialism and this includes Reform. I see a small chink of light growing as the notion of independents takes root. This is where the future of the right lays. Eventually, we will see democracy by the people, of the people, and for the people. Aren’t lemmings closely related to ‘rats’? RATS was the last UK coal fired power station (Ratcliffe on Soar). A target of 50% “green” energy – in itself, difficult to achieve – would have reduced CO2 emissions by, errr… 50%, but zealots are never happy, for them it’s 100% or nothing – except, of course, that it never can be 100%. That’s why I doubt the sanity of people like Red Ed Miliband. The most dangerous man since that bloke in Germany some while back… Happy Christmas everyone! Actually, it is doubtful that “green energy” (whatever that is**) reduces CO2 emission much at all The US reduced its CO2 emissions by converting coal to gas. Germany and the UK have reduced their emissions by destroying their manufacturing base and sending it to China , India etc, probably increasing the overall CO2 released. ** wind and solar are the exact opposite of “green”.. Both are hugely environmentally polluting at every stage… mining , manufacture (absolutely horrendous), installation (environmentally destructive), usage (avian destruction), and final disposal in landfill , or left to rot in place. I don’t disagree, Brice, I was just arguing on the “Even if one accepts that “green” energy is desireable…” basis in order to underline Miliband’s madness in trying to get to 100%. I agree Bnice, Green and Energy do not belong together as the result is an oxymoron! The Greens have had enough say about what they want about energy, now it’s time for the rest of us ordinary people-90% to demand, cheap reliable electricity by whatever means are available, be it fossil fuels, hydro, nuclear and even solar in moderation. None of this energy business has anything to do with climate change, so people get over this non- existent fake environmental climate crisis. If we don’t get a positive response about our cheap energy requirements from responsible governments, we will vote them out sooner rather than later. First was the US then Germany and Australia will follow if they are smart enough in 2025! However, in the UK, Labour is totally delusional about energy, so the process will take longer unless the people riot or occupy the House of Commons. Just yesterday in another thread that Warren Beeton fool was trying gaslight me, claiming that steel manufacturing with electric blast furnaces was feasible. They can’t even keep the lights on now, how is uninterrupted power for molten steel possible with wind turbines? Any manufacturer trying this insanity would be quickly out-of-business. Swedish SSAB plans to be the first steel company in the world to deliver ‘fossil free steel’ to the market on a commercial scale in 2026. How successful and competitively priced it will be remains to be seen. Access to plentiful hydro electric power is probably essential. I want to see what the metallurgy reports on this hydrogen-reduced steel say. How they overcome the embrittlement problem has been mostly a hand-wave in the press releases. I am not sure I want to live on the 12th floor of a high-rise made with H2Steel. Agree. SSAB have been collaborating with Mercedes for some time so I think steel for vehicle production will be their initial step. According to current data, around 70% of steel in the United States is manufactured using electric arc furnaces (EAFs), which are considered electric furnaces; this means a significant majority of American steel production relies on electric furnaces. Big River Steel In 2024, this facility in Osceola, Arkansas became the first steel plant in the world to receive ResponsibleSteel certification. ResponsibleSteel is a nonprofit that audits companies’ progress toward “net-zero steel” production. Big River Steel also gets more than 60% of its electricity from non-fossil-fuel sources. THAT IS THE CLOSEST TO GREEN STEEL IN THE US. I did a Bing search on electric arc furnaces and found that these are used for recycling scrap steel. Blast furnaces are still used for smelting iron ore. Didn’t find any info on use of hydrogen for smelting iron ore. I recall reading awhile back that a pilot process for smelting iron ore with hydrogen malfunctioned, resulting in an explosion that killed a worker and injured several other workers. particularly for reducing iron to make steel possible, a coking furnace is required. After the iron is in the right oxidation state it really doesn’t matter how one heats it for the final mix. The innovation is with using hydrogen as the reducing agent, but any hydrogen left in the matrix will lead to brittle steal that won’t hold up to stresses as well as the traditional carbon-reduced steal. I doubt that Millivolt is insane, atticman. But he has a very low (and alas accurate) assessment of how well British education prepares the population for critical thinking. In plain sight, he and Sir Stalin are obliterating the ancient rights of Englishmen along with the utter replacement of Englishmen. I don’t believe that it is the accidental outcome of insanity. But indeed, happy Christmas! Turn to thoughts of hope and joy. ancient rights- maybe time for a constitution and bill of rights? nobody pitching for that? Perhaps not – we wouldn’t be $34T in debt if our Federales had actually been constrained by our Constitution. How often is it even 50% in Germany? Under ideal conditions only? At night in windy weather? If it’s only under ideal conditions- it would be useful to get the average for all the hours in a year. Even if “green energy” was to reach 50%, the CO2 “reduction” wouldn’t be anywhere close to 50%. This is because fossil fuel plants need to kept on warm standby, at a minimum, so that they can take over whenever “green energy” fails. I’ve seen no blowback from Microsoft’s announcement that they will be reopening Three Mile Island — certainly a good sign. Yes, I agree it’s a good thing. I hope Microsoft has employed some experienced “restart” experts who know what they are getting into. I have no knowledge of Three Mile Island’s current mechanical condition. However, recommissioning equipment that has sat idle, unpowered and/or unmaintained for any number of years can quickly become uneconomical. I’m not sure you just walk back in and flip on the switches. Microsoft isn’t restarting Three Mile Island, they contracted to use the electricity, if I’m not mistaken. Doesn’t someone have to restart it first? Reactor 1 was running until 2019. Thanks Bob. Those that haven’t kept up could start here: Restarting Three Mile Island: Quick Facts “Maybe it’s that the political environment has changed, and maybe it’s that some people are starting to recognize that you can’t beat the laws of physics; and maybe it’s some of both.” The myopic obsession with the physics of the so-called “greenhouse effect” must come to an end one way or another. And the physics of electrical power generation and hydrocarbon fuels cannot be faked. It may take a few more years for this to be fully realized, but it is from the physics of the general circulation that the claims of GHG “warming” are directly refuted. Are rising concentrations of CO2 capable of “forcing” absorbed energy to accumulate down here (i.e. “warming.”) as sensible heat gain in the land + ocean + atmosphere system? No. Energy conversion explains why not. [internal energy + potential energy] is constantly being converted to/from [kinetic energy]. Lorenz described this concept. The ERA5 reanalysis model explicitly computes it. More here. Please read the full text description of this very short time-lapse video. I will paste that full text in a reply. In my view, this is important for skeptics of the climate movement to understand. https://youtu.be/hDurP-4gVrY The text description for that video. ************ Are CO2 emissions a risk to the climate? No. The static “warming” effect of incremental CO2 (~4 W/m^2 for 2XCO2) disappears as kinetic energy (wind) is converted to/from internal energy (including temperature) + potential energy (altitude). This time lapse video shows the daily minimum, median, and maximum values of the computed “vertical integral of energy conversion” hourly parameter from the ERA5 reanalysis for 2022. Values for each 1/4 degree longitude gridpoint at 45N latitude are given. The vertical scale is from -10,000 to +10,000 W/m^2. The minor incremental radiative absorbing power of non-condensing GHGs such as CO2, CH4, and N2O vanishes on the vertical scale as the rapidly changing energy conversion in both directions is tens to thousands of times greater. So what? The assumed GHG “forcings” cannot be isolated for reliable attribution of reported surface warming. And with all the circulation and energy conversion throughout the depth of the troposphere, heat energy need not be expected to accumulate on land and in the oceans to harmful effect from incremental non-condensing GHGs. The GHGs add no energy to the land + ocean + atmosphere system. Therefore the radiative properties of CO2, CH4, and N2O, and other molecules of similar nature, should not be assumed to produce a perturbing climate “forcing.” The concept of energy conversion helps us understand the self-regulating delivery of energy to high altitude for just enough longwave radiation to be emitted to space. References: The ERA5 reanalysis model is a product of ECMWF, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. The computed parameters “vertical integral of potential + internal energy” and “vertical integral of energy conversion” are described at these links. https://codes.ecmwf.int/grib/param-db/?id=162061 https://codes.ecmwf.int/grib/param-db/?id=162064 Further comment: This is for just one latitude band at 45N. Similar results were observed for 45S, 10N/S, 23.5N/S, and 66N/S. More Background: From Edward N. Lorenz (1960) “Energy and Numerical Weather Prediction” https://doi.org/10.3402/tellusa.v12i4.9420 “2. Energy, available potential energy, and gross static stability Of the various forms of energy present in the atmosphere, kinetic energy has often received the most attention. Often the total kinetic energy of a weather system is regarded as a measure of its intensity. The only other forms of atmospheric energy which appear to play a major role in the kinetic energy budget of the troposphere and lower stratosphere are potential energy, internal energy, and the latent energy of water vapor. Potential and internal energy may be transformed directly into kinetic energy, while latent energy may be transformed directly into internal energy, which is then transformed into kinetic energy. It is easily shown by means of the hydrostatic approximation that the changes of the potential energy P and the internal energy l of the whole atmosphere are approximately proportional, so that it is convenient to regard potential and internal energy as constituting a single form of energy. This form has been called total potential energy by Margules (1903). … In the long run, there must be a net depletionof kinetic energy by dissipative processes. It follows that there must be an equal net generation of kinetic energy by reversible adiabatic processes; this generation must occur at the expense of total potential energy. It follows in turn that there must be an equal net generation of total potential energy by heating of all kinds. These three steps comprise the basic energy cycle of the atmosphere. The rate at which these steps proceed is a fundamental characteristic of the general circulation.” ************** Yep, as I keep saying, “There are no free lunches in physics.” I concur. It seems to me the most realistic mechanism. The uncertainty comes w the attribution equations which rely on assumed mechanisms that cannot be properly equated as in essense one cannot separate the signals as one could in a lab. That guesswork is fine as far as im concerned. The issue is w politics in regards to ‘settled science’. I understand that particular mechanism. In order to implement impactful policies you A: create a narrative of ‘settled science’ and act like a religious group w a control/ comply structure, coupled w B: a fear of Armageddon and percecution of heretics. People are fed up with woke left wing insanity. There’s some evidence that led to Trump’s election, and the Republicans taking both senate and house. Peter Zeihan points out that the voting patterns in the election weren’t typical. … it means the culture war is a big determining factor on how people vote … Folks who have enough education can convince themselves that CAGW is a serious problem, that Anthony Fauci is a hero, and that a woman can have a penis. Fortunately, the majority of voters know better. Defund the universities. This video, Why Smart People Believe Stupid Things, is worth a look. I don’t think it’s clear that Republicans have a firm grip on the Senate. Too many RINOs can still spoil the soup. And isn’t the House majority even narrower than it was before the election? True but even just a one seat majority means control of all the committees which means bad democrat legislative junk will seldom get to the floor for a vote. Why sources always brag on renewable wind and solar Capacity rather than actual production? 2023 annual World wind production 2.33 milllion GWh; wind capacity 1017.2 GW ((2,330,000/8760 Hrs/Yr)/1017.2)) equals actual production of 26.14% of Capacity. 2023 annual World Solar production 1.64 milllion GWh; solar capacity 1419.0 GW ((1.640,000/8760 Hrs/Yr)/1419.0)) equals actual production of 13.2% of Capacity. 2023 annual combined World production 3.97 milllion GWh; combined capacity 2436.2 GW ((3.970,000/8760 Hrs/Yr)/2436.2)) equals actual production of 18.6% of Capacity. 2023 Wind and Solar renewable production was 18.6% of capacity and I suspect that 2024 will be some what lower. Depending on the source wind and Solar contributed 11-13.4% of total world electricity production during 2023. Forgot the sources: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/wind-energy-consumption-vs-installed-wind-energy-capacity https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/solar-pv-energy-consumption-vs-solar-pv-capacity And specifically for Germany:  Wind Energy: Around 142.1 TWh, which accounted for approximately 27% of Germany’s total electricity consumption in 2023.  Solar Energy: Approximately 59.9 TWh, which should account for roughly 11-12% of the total electricity consumption. Germany wind and solar are both grid saturated according to “The Pollack Limit” discussed at length a couple years ago here on WUWT. The Wind CF in Germany is right at 27% and Solar at 12%.Time to give it up, it was an irresponsible waste of capital up to this point, continuing the insanity is well, insane. The new German ruling Coalition after The February 2025 will surely early on end the energewende.. Leftist fantasies never end but eventually they run out of other people’s money to waste. In the US the investment growth rate for wind power is slow. But solar power and EV investment growth rates still far too high: The United States’ solar energy capacity has been growing rapidly in recent years, with the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projecting a 75% increase in solar power capacity from 2023 to 2025 In 2023, the United States’ wind capacity increased by 4% from 2022, reaching a total of 147.5 gigawatts (GW). This is a 10% average annual increase since 2010, when the capacity was 45 GW. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects wind capacity to increase by 7 gigawatts (GW) in 2024, which is a 5% increase from the previous year. This would bring the total wind capacity in the U.S. to 153.8 GW by the end of 2024. In 2024, the US is expected to invest $312 billion in EV manufacturing, with $223 billion already allocated to specific initiatives. This is a nearly $66 billion increase from January 2023 All cash down the crapper. Oh, and “capacity” does not equal production. The percentage increase of investment correlates with the percentage increase of capacity. Exactly. It has absolutely nothing to do with electricity actually generated that can be used when generated. Yes — Greene can’t read. Number of bad investments correlates well with number of government investments. Germany may have fatally damaged its manufacturing base as companies close or announce job cuts or relocations out of Germany virtually every week. Sky high energy costs mean that a twelfth of the population are not able to fund a full year forcing consideration to be given to banning disconnections for non-payment even if only during the winter months. Energy companies in the UK are facing an increasing amount of customers in debt and these may be pushed on to those of us who are paying, as if our costs were not high enough already. Many of the companies that haven’t moved or downsized already, are having trouble finding enough money to maintain their equipment, much less modernize it. This will hamper those companies in the future. Germany is poised to begin repairing Merkel’s damage: (It won’t be easy and it won’t be quick). Christoph Strack 4 hours ago4 hours ago Friedrich Merz, an erstwhile rival of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel, has been a beacon of hope for the conservative CDU party. He now wants to unseat Chancellor Olaf Scholz and take over as Germany’s leader. Merz has always been a supporter of nuclear energy and has expressed doubts over renewable energy sources such as “ugly” wind turbines. He drew flak in 2022 for flying his private jet to attend Finance Minister Christian Lindner’s wedding on the island of Sylt at a time of rising energy prices caused by Russia’s war on Ukraine. Merz has also been accused of pandering to the far right with denigrating remarks about refugees. He represents a CDU that has become more conservative, although he has stated his refusal to cooperate with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).(We’ll see about that, I think he’ll change his mind, he must IMHO) Shortly after Germany’s center-left government collapsed on November 6, 2024, Merz stated in clear terms that the years of Scholz’s coalition were now history, arguing that this had been a long time coming. Merz is hoping that he and the CDU/CSU will replace Olaf Scholz and his minority government with the Greens following the February 23 election. It remains to be seen which coalition partners he would choose to form a new government. The renewable energy business has been built on lies pure and simple. If we had the strength to hold government, media and academia accountable we wouldn’t be in this mess. If we held individuals accountable and didn’t allow them to hide behind their organizations all of this would end. Remove the free money, remove the commitment. The clear indicator of a specious cause. RE has always been a means for the wealthy to extract public money through subsidies, never about reducing CO2 emissions. I am optimistic for a different reason. For years, it seemed like the climate skeptics spoke alone, and in a disjointed fashion, making no headway with GQ public. Now, I’m watching organizations pull together, and some even coordinate their efforts. Recently, someone told me that 20% of people are hypnotized idiots, 20% question everything, and 60% can be convinced with logic but mostly they just go along with whichever group is loudest. By coordinating efforts, we can appear to be the winners and pull in the 60%. Just a thought about “ never consistently reached even 50% of its electricity production from wind and solar” A true but misleading statement. “Electricity production” is not full-time electric service–as we are used to and require. “Electricity” from intermittent, sporadic machines does not/cannot provide full time, on-demand electric service. (for typical residential, commercial, industrial use). To contribute at all, solar and wind must connect to a grid of rotating generation from coal, natural gas, oil, large hydro, or nuclear. With specialized equipment at various grid locations calculated for reliability, stability and regulation. AC frequency, voltage, current, reactances, and other instant (frequency in HZ or AC cycles are usually 1/50 or 1/60 of a second. A transmission grid or distribution network requires controls that continuously monitor and take stabilizing actions as needed to provide AC within best engineering practices. Best engineering practices used to include lowest capital, construction, and operational costs. Sadly no longer used. Do not be surprised if they invent something new to kick start the mad rush to One World Order.

Title: More Reasons for Cautious Optimism About the Demise of The Green Energy Fantasy

Full Content:
The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change From the MANHATTAN CONTRARIAN Francis Menton My post on Saturday noted one big reason for optimism that the green energy fantasy is coming to the end of its run: the first country, Germany, has apparently begun to hit the green energy “wall.” Although Germany has never consistently reached even 50% of its electricity production from wind and solar, its ability to continue its green energy dreams has stalled: its electricity prices have soared, its manufacturing sector has been seriously undermined, its economy is in recession, and recently its green-promoting government has fallen. Its failed example now stands for others to see and avoid. And as I look around at developments since the election, I see a number of other reasons to reinforce my cautious optimism. Maybe it’s that the political environment has changed, and maybe it’s that some people are starting to recognize that you can’t beat the laws of physics; and maybe it’s some of both. Here are examples: Banks and investment firms quitting net zero “alliances” On Saturday’s post, commenter William Bell asked “Who, exactly, is preventing third-world inhabitants from using wood, charcoal, coal, petroleum derivatives, and/or natural gas for fuel and by what means?” Apparently Mr. Bell, and maybe many others, is unaware of the many “alliances” of banks and investors seeking to starve fossil fuels of investment capital, and thus prevent third-world countries (and everybody else) from continuing to use them. Most of these groups are somehow directed and overseen by the UN. Examples of these groups include the Net Zero Banking Alliance (“Bank-led, UN-convened”), the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, and Climate Action 100+. I’m sure that I have not got them all. The members are, or have been, a who’s who of all the biggest banks and investment firms in the world. The Center Square reports here on December 20 that two rather significant banks, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo, have just quit the NZBA: Not soon after the general election, and within two weeks of each other, two major financial institutions have left a United Nations Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA). This is after they joined three years ago, pledging to require environmental social governance standards (ESG) across their platforms, products and systems. House Judiciary Committee issues report accusing large money managers of running a “climate cartel” On December 13, the House Judiciary Committee issued a Report titled “Sustainability Shakedown: How a Climate Cartel of Money Managers Colluded to Take Over the Board of America’s Largest Energy Company.” The Report documents the process by which the Climate Action 100+ alliance, “emboldened” by encouragement from the Biden/Harris administration, orchestrated replacement of three board members of Exxon in May 2021. The collusive actions of the largest investment firms and proxy advisors are described as a “cartel” clearly violative of the antitrust laws. Red state AGs sue investment firms for antitrust violations for colluding on “climate” issues Maybe it’s coincidence, but shortly before the issuance of the Judiciary Committee Report, an antitrust suit was brought on November 27 by eleven red state AGs, led by Ken Paxton of Texas, accusing participants in the investment industry of collusive conduct in enforcing “climate” and other “ESG” goals. The defendants in the case include the three largest money managers, Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street. From Bloomberg Law, November 27: BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. were sued by a group of states led by Texas for allegedly breaking antitrust law by boosting electricity prices through their investments, in the highest-profile lawsuit yet against the beleaguered ESG industry. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and 10 other states claim the money managers, as part of their green agenda, combined their market clout and membership in climate groups to pressure coal producers to cut output. TotalEnergies pauses major wind farm in the waters off New York and New Jersey Also on November 27, French energy giant TotalEnergies announced that it was “pausing” its major Attentive Energy off-shore wind project in the Atlantic Ocean off New York and New Jersey. In his announcement of the “pause,” Total’s Chairman specifically attributed the action to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. From Offshore, November 27: TotalEnergies has reportedly paused development of the Attentive Energy wind farm it planned to build off the coast of New York and New Jersey, CEO Patrick Pouyanne said Tuesday at an energy industry conference in London. “I have decided to put the project on pause,” TotalEnergies’ CEO Patrick Pouyanne said at the Energy Intelligence Forum, according to reports from Bloomberg and Reuters. The decision is one of the first tangible signs of a halt in investment in renewable power sources due to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. Trump has vowed to stop offshore wind energy development “on day one” of his next term starting in January 2025. The new Trump administration is still almost a month away from taking office, but already the anticipation of its arrival is having the positive effect of driving some of the parasites into hiding. There are many more such positive developments out there. I’ll see if I can assemble a few more before year’s end. Meanwhile, I’m as hopeful as I’ve ever been that the green energy mania is fading. Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email. Type your email… Subscribe It looks as if the green energy bandwagon may be slowing in America. However, in Europe, it’s still full steam ahead. Ed Miliband is utterly determined that Britain will be the first lemming off the edge of the cliff and will do absolutely anything to achieve this. He wouldn’t care if a million Britons froze to death in winter if his insane climate goals were achieved. Miliband is not dictator for life. The UK is still a democracy and the voters will be heard. The outcome of the Labour foolishness is predetermined – it is only a matter of time before the voters demand change. The support for Net Zero will only end in the UK when the actual electricity grid cannot support the population and randomly fails during the coldest weather. Therefore Labour/Conservative/LibDem alliance is in not danger at the moment. It’s probably going to be more problematic as Rachel from Complaints will have to raise more taxes in April at the current rate of progress. In the mean time percentage on ZE vehicles being sold rises as total sales of cars falls. That part of the plan is working well. The UK is not a functional democracy since the choices we have are limited and as many already know, the Davos Uniparty have infected our system so all the main parties are variants of socialism. But the fastest growing party Reform gives us hope as while they may have got only 5 MPs, their proportion of the vote was higher than the LimpDumbs who got the third highest number of MPs. Reform were very close to winning a lot of seats that went to Labour in the north and are close to Tory seats in the south. The local council elections in May will be a popularity poll on our Student Union government and the signs are they will get hammered. That could bring about a new leader for Labour. As for the inexperienced Rachel from Accounts/Complaints? She might be toast come the spring as the UK will be in recession with inflation rising and interest rates stuck, but more importantly government bond rates will be high and that drives the mortgage interest rates which ‘working people’ – something Labour have struggled to define – will be feeling. You are almost right. actually, all political parties are variants of socialism and this includes Reform. I see a small chink of light growing as the notion of independents takes root. This is where the future of the right lays. Eventually, we will see democracy by the people, of the people, and for the people. Aren’t lemmings closely related to ‘rats’? RATS was the last UK coal fired power station (Ratcliffe on Soar). A target of 50% “green” energy – in itself, difficult to achieve – would have reduced CO2 emissions by, errr… 50%, but zealots are never happy, for them it’s 100% or nothing – except, of course, that it never can be 100%. That’s why I doubt the sanity of people like Red Ed Miliband. The most dangerous man since that bloke in Germany some while back… Happy Christmas everyone! Actually, it is doubtful that “green energy” (whatever that is**) reduces CO2 emission much at all The US reduced its CO2 emissions by converting coal to gas. Germany and the UK have reduced their emissions by destroying their manufacturing base and sending it to China , India etc, probably increasing the overall CO2 released. ** wind and solar are the exact opposite of “green”.. Both are hugely environmentally polluting at every stage… mining , manufacture (absolutely horrendous), installation (environmentally destructive), usage (avian destruction), and final disposal in landfill , or left to rot in place. I don’t disagree, Brice, I was just arguing on the “Even if one accepts that “green” energy is desireable…” basis in order to underline Miliband’s madness in trying to get to 100%. I agree Bnice, Green and Energy do not belong together as the result is an oxymoron! The Greens have had enough say about what they want about energy, now it’s time for the rest of us ordinary people-90% to demand, cheap reliable electricity by whatever means are available, be it fossil fuels, hydro, nuclear and even solar in moderation. None of this energy business has anything to do with climate change, so people get over this non- existent fake environmental climate crisis. If we don’t get a positive response about our cheap energy requirements from responsible governments, we will vote them out sooner rather than later. First was the US then Germany and Australia will follow if they are smart enough in 2025! However, in the UK, Labour is totally delusional about energy, so the process will take longer unless the people riot or occupy the House of Commons. Just yesterday in another thread that Warren Beeton fool was trying gaslight me, claiming that steel manufacturing with electric blast furnaces was feasible. They can’t even keep the lights on now, how is uninterrupted power for molten steel possible with wind turbines? Any manufacturer trying this insanity would be quickly out-of-business. Swedish SSAB plans to be the first steel company in the world to deliver ‘fossil free steel’ to the market on a commercial scale in 2026. How successful and competitively priced it will be remains to be seen. Access to plentiful hydro electric power is probably essential. I want to see what the metallurgy reports on this hydrogen-reduced steel say. How they overcome the embrittlement problem has been mostly a hand-wave in the press releases. I am not sure I want to live on the 12th floor of a high-rise made with H2Steel. Agree. SSAB have been collaborating with Mercedes for some time so I think steel for vehicle production will be their initial step.

Big River Steel In 2024, this facility in Osceola, Arkansas became the first steel plant in the world to receive ResponsibleSteel certification. ResponsibleSteel is a nonprofit that audits companies’ progress toward “net-zero steel” production. Big River Steel also gets more than 60% of its electricity from non-fossil-fuel sources. THAT IS THE CLOSEST TO GREEN STEEL IN THE US. I did a Bing search on electric arc furnaces and found that these are used for recycling scrap steel. Blast furnaces are still used for smelting iron ore. Didn’t find any info on use of hydrogen for smelting iron ore.

In plain sight, he and Sir Stalin are obliterating the ancient rights of Englishmen along with the utter replacement of Englishmen. I don’t believe that it is the accidental outcome of insanity. But indeed, happy Christmas! Turn to thoughts of hope and joy. ancient rights- maybe time for a constitution and bill of rights? nobody pitching for that? Perhaps not – we wouldn’t be $34T in debt if our Federales had actually been constrained by our Constitution. How often is it even 50% in Germany? Under ideal conditions only? At night in windy weather? If it’s only under ideal conditions- it would be useful to get the average for all the hours in a year. Even if “green energy” was to reach 50%, the CO2 “reduction” wouldn’t be anywhere close to 50%. This is because fossil fuel plants need to kept on warm standby, at a minimum, so that they can take over whenever “green energy” fails. I’ve seen no blowback from Microsoft’s announcement that they will be reopening Three Mile Island — certainly a good sign. Yes, I agree it’s a good thing. I hope Microsoft has employed some experienced “restart” experts who know what they are getting into. I have no knowledge of Three Mile Island’s current mechanical condition. However, recommissioning equipment that has sat idle, unpowered and/or unmaintained for any number of years can quickly become uneconomical. I’m not sure you just walk back in and flip on the switches. Microsoft isn’t restarting Three Mile Island, they contracted to use the electricity, if I’m not mistaken. Doesn’t someone have to restart it first? Reactor 1 was running until 2019. Thanks Bob. Those that haven’t kept up could start here: Restarting Three Mile Island: Quick Facts “Maybe it’s that the political environment has changed, and maybe it’s that some people are starting to recognize that you can’t beat the laws of physics; and maybe it’s some of both.” The myopic obsession with the physics of the so-called “greenhouse effect” must come to an end one way or another. And the physics of electrical power generation and hydrocarbon fuels cannot be faked. It may take a few more years for this to be fully realized, but it is from the physics of the general circulation that the claims of GHG “warming” are directly refuted. Are rising concentrations of CO2 capable of “forcing” absorbed energy to accumulate down here (i.e. “warming.”) as sensible heat gain in the land + ocean + atmosphere system? No. Energy conversion explains why not. [internal energy + potential energy] is constantly being converted to/from [kinetic energy]. Lorenz described this concept. The ERA5 reanalysis model explicitly computes it. More here. Please read the full text description of this very short time-lapse video. I will paste that full text in a reply. In my view, this is important for skeptics of the climate movement to understand. https://youtu.be/hDurP-4gVrY The text description for that video. ************ Are CO2 emissions a risk to the climate? No. The static “warming” effect of incremental CO2 (~4 W/m^2 for 2XCO2) disappears as kinetic energy (wind) is converted to/from internal energy (including temperature) + potential energy (altitude). This time lapse video shows the daily minimum, median, and maximum values of the computed “vertical integral of energy conversion” hourly parameter from the ERA5 reanalysis for 2022. Values for each 1/4 degree longitude gridpoint at 45N latitude are given. The vertical scale is from -10,000 to +10,000 W/m^2. The minor incremental radiative absorbing power of non-condensing GHGs such as CO2, CH4, and N2O vanishes on the vertical scale as the rapidly changing energy conversion in both directions is tens to thousands of times greater. So what? The assumed GHG “forcings” cannot be isolated for reliable attribution of reported surface warming. And with all the circulation and energy conversion throughout the depth of the troposphere, heat energy need not be expected to accumulate on land and in the oceans to harmful effect from incremental non-condensing GHGs. The GHGs add no energy to the land + ocean + atmosphere system. Therefore the radiative properties of CO2, CH4, and N2O, and other molecules of similar nature, should not be assumed to produce a perturbing climate “forcing.” The concept of energy conversion helps us understand the self-regulating delivery of energy to high altitude for just enough longwave radiation to be emitted to space.

The computed parameters “vertical integral of potential + internal energy” and “vertical integral of energy conversion” are described at these links. https://codes.ecmwf.int/grib/param-db/?id=162061 https://codes.ecmwf.int/grib/param-db/?id=162064 Further comment: This is for just one latitude band at 45N. Similar results were observed for 45S, 10N/S, 23.5N/S, and 66N/S. More Background: From Edward N. Lorenz (1960) “Energy and Numerical Weather Prediction” https://doi.org/10.3402/tellusa.v12i4.9420 “2. Energy, available potential energy, and gross static stability Of the various forms of energy present in the atmosphere, kinetic energy has often received the most attention. Often the total kinetic energy of a weather system is regarded as a measure of its intensity. The only other forms of atmospheric energy which appear to play a major role in the kinetic energy budget of the troposphere and lower stratosphere are potential energy, internal energy, and the latent energy of water vapor. Potential and internal energy may be transformed directly into kinetic energy, while latent energy may be transformed directly into internal energy, which is then transformed into kinetic energy. It is easily shown by means of the hydrostatic approximation that the changes of the potential energy P and the internal energy l of the whole atmosphere are approximately proportional, so that it is convenient to regard potential and internal energy as constituting a single form of energy. This form has been called total potential energy by Margules (1903). … In the long run, there must be a net depletionof kinetic energy by dissipative processes. It follows that there must be an equal net generation of kinetic energy by reversible adiabatic processes; this generation must occur at the expense of total potential energy. It follows in turn that there must be an equal net generation of total potential energy by heating of all kinds. These three steps comprise the basic energy cycle of the atmosphere. The rate at which these steps proceed is a fundamental characteristic of the general circulation.” ************** Yep, as I keep saying, “There are no free lunches in physics.” I concur. It seems to me the most realistic mechanism. The uncertainty comes w the attribution equations which rely on assumed mechanisms that cannot be properly equated as in essense one cannot separate the signals as one could in a lab. That guesswork is fine as far as im concerned. The issue is w politics in regards to ‘settled science’. I understand that particular mechanism. In order to implement impactful policies you A: create a narrative of ‘settled science’ and act like a religious group w a control/ comply structure, coupled w B: a fear of Armageddon and percecution of heretics. People are fed up with woke left wing insanity. There’s some evidence that led to Trump’s election, and the Republicans taking both senate and house. Peter Zeihan points out that the voting patterns in the election weren’t typical. … it means the culture war is a big determining factor on how people vote … Folks who have enough education can convince themselves that CAGW is a serious problem, that Anthony Fauci is a hero, and that a woman can have a penis. Fortunately, the majority of voters know better. Defund the universities. This video, Why Smart People Believe Stupid Things, is worth a look. I don’t think it’s clear that Republicans have a firm grip on the Senate. Too many RINOs can still spoil the soup. And isn’t the House majority even narrower than it was before the election? True but even just a one seat majority means control of all the committees which means bad democrat legislative junk will seldom get to the floor for a vote. Why sources always brag on renewable wind and solar Capacity rather than actual production? 2023 annual World wind production 2.33 milllion GWh; wind capacity 1017.2 GW ((2,330,000/8760 Hrs/Yr)/1017.2)) equals actual production of 26.14% of Capacity. 2023 annual World Solar production 1.64 milllion GWh; solar capacity 1419.0 GW ((1.640,000/8760 Hrs/Yr)/1419.0)) equals actual production of 13.2% of Capacity. 2023 annual combined World production 3.97 milllion GWh; combined capacity 2436.2 GW ((3.970,000/8760 Hrs/Yr)/2436.2)) equals actual production of 18.6% of Capacity. 2023 Wind and Solar renewable production was 18.6% of capacity and I suspect that 2024 will be some what lower. Depending on the source wind and Solar contributed 11-13.4% of total world electricity production during 2023. Forgot the sources: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/wind-energy-consumption-vs-installed-wind-energy-capacity https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/solar-pv-energy-consumption-vs-solar-pv-capacity And specifically for Germany:  Wind Energy: Around 142.1 TWh, which accounted for approximately 27% of Germany’s total electricity consumption in 2023.  Solar Energy: Approximately 59.9 TWh, which should account for roughly 11-12% of the total electricity consumption. Germany wind and solar are both grid saturated according to “The Pollack Limit” discussed at length a couple years ago here on WUWT. The Wind CF in Germany is right at 27% and Solar at 12%.Time to give it up, it was an irresponsible waste of capital up to this point, continuing the insanity is well, insane. The new German ruling Coalition after The February 2025 will surely early on end the energewende.. Leftist fantasies never end but eventually they run out of other people’s money to waste. In the US the investment growth rate for wind power is slow. But solar power and EV investment growth rates still far too high: The United States’ solar energy capacity has been growing rapidly in recent years, with the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projecting a 75% increase in solar power capacity from 2023 to 2025 In 2023, the United States’ wind capacity increased by 4% from 2022, reaching a total of 147.5 gigawatts (GW). This is a 10% average annual increase since 2010, when the capacity was 45 GW. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects wind capacity to increase by 7 gigawatts (GW) in 2024, which is a 5% increase from the previous year. This would bring the total wind capacity in the U.S. to 153.8 GW by the end of 2024. In 2024, the US is expected to invest $312 billion in EV manufacturing, with $223 billion already allocated to specific initiatives. This is a nearly $66 billion increase from January 2023 All cash down the crapper. Oh, and “capacity” does not equal production. The percentage increase of investment correlates with the percentage increase of capacity. Exactly. It has absolutely nothing to do with electricity actually generated that can be used when generated. Yes — Greene can’t read. Number of bad investments correlates well with number of government investments. Germany may have fatally damaged its manufacturing base as companies close or announce job cuts or relocations out of Germany virtually every week. Sky high energy costs mean that a twelfth of the population are not able to fund a full year forcing consideration to be given to banning disconnections for non-payment even if only during the winter months. Energy companies in the UK are facing an increasing amount of customers in debt and these may be pushed on to those of us who are paying, as if our costs were not high enough already. Many of the companies that haven’t moved or downsized already, are having trouble finding enough money to maintain their equipment, much less modernize it. This will hamper those companies in the future. Germany is poised to begin repairing Merkel’s damage: (It won’t be easy and it won’t be quick). Christoph Strack 4 hours ago4 hours ago Friedrich Merz, an erstwhile rival of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel, has been a beacon of hope for the conservative CDU party. He now wants to unseat Chancellor Olaf Scholz and take over as Germany’s leader. Merz has always been a supporter of nuclear energy and has expressed doubts over renewable energy sources such as “ugly” wind turbines. He drew flak in 2022 for flying his private jet to attend Finance Minister Christian Lindner’s wedding on the island of Sylt at a time of rising energy prices caused by Russia’s war on Ukraine. Merz has also been accused of pandering to the far right with denigrating remarks about refugees. He represents a CDU that has become more conservative, although he has stated his refusal to cooperate with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).(We’ll see about that, I think he’ll change his mind, he must IMHO) Shortly after Germany’s center-left government collapsed on November 6, 2024, Merz stated in clear terms that the years of Scholz’s coalition were now history, arguing that this had been a long time coming. Merz is hoping that he and the CDU/CSU will replace Olaf Scholz and his minority government with the Greens following the February 23 election. It remains to be seen which coalition partners he would choose to form a new government. The renewable energy business has been built on lies pure and simple. If we had the strength to hold government, media and academia accountable we wouldn’t be in this mess. If we held individuals accountable and didn’t allow them to hide behind their organizations all of this would end. Remove the free money, remove the commitment. The clear indicator of a specious cause. RE has always been a means for the wealthy to extract public money through subsidies, never about reducing CO2 emissions. I am optimistic for a different reason. For years, it seemed like the climate skeptics spoke alone, and in a disjointed fashion, making no headway with GQ public. Now, I’m watching organizations pull together, and some even coordinate their efforts. Recently, someone told me that 20% of people are hypnotized idiots, 20% question everything, and 60% can be convinced with logic but mostly they just go along with whichever group is loudest. By coordinating efforts, we can appear to be the winners and pull in the 60%. Just a thought about “ never consistently reached even 50% of its electricity production from wind and solar” A true but misleading statement. “Electricity production” is not full-time electric service–as we are used to and require. “Electricity” from intermittent, sporadic machines does not/cannot provide full time, on-demand electric service. (for typical residential, commercial, industrial use). To contribute at all, solar and wind must connect to a grid of rotating generation from coal, natural gas, oil, large hydro, or nuclear. With specialized equipment at various grid locations calculated for reliability, stability and regulation. AC frequency, voltage, current, reactances, and other instant (frequency in HZ or AC cycles are usually 1/50 or 1/60 of a second. A transmission grid or distribution network requires controls that continuously monitor and take stabilizing actions as needed to provide AC within best engineering practices. Best engineering practices used to include lowest capital, construction, and operational costs. Sadly no longer used. Do not be surprised if they invent something new to kick start the mad rush to One World Order.

RAIN, HAIL, OR snow, every Christmas Day troves of people across the country take to bodies of water for a Christmas Day swim. Luckily, today you don’t need to worry about hail or snow if you are planning on participating. According to the Met Éireann forecast, today will be mild and quite cloudy, though some brighter breaks will develop. Speaking to The Journal, meteorologist Brandon Creagh said that it is unseasonably mild, and this morning will have temperatures of between 10 and 11 degrees across the whole country. “The sea is actually going to be pretty much fairly close to that as well,” he said. “The sea surface temperatures are forecast to be around 10 or 11 degrees. “But I would encourage people to keep an eye on the advice from water safety Ireland and the Irish coast guard, which has been circling around on Christmas Day.” Advertisement Creagh said that the unseasonable weather is the result of mild air that has been pushed up from the south due to a high pressure system centered around Europe. “So the whole country is going to experience fairly similar conditions tomorrow, some places might get a little bit more sun than others, but exactly where that will be remains to be seen,” he said. Most places will be dry but a few patches of light rain and drizzle will affect the western half of the country. Highest temperatures of 11 to 13 degrees in moderate southwest winds, fresh at times on west and northwest coasts.

Alamy Stock Photo Alamy Stock Photo COPE Galway has issued a list of precautions for swimmers to be aware of as they take on the Christmas Day swim. The charity is organising the swim, which takes place this morning at Blackrock Pier in Salthill. Last year, over 850 people took place in the swim. COPE Galway said for swimmers to stay visible, not to swim alone, avoid diving and swimming after consuming alcohol or a large meal. It also said to avoid staying in the water for too long and to bring a warm drink and warm clothes to change into. Lifeguards will be present at the swim, but it warned that participants should be aware of the safety guidelines. Organised swims are taking place all across the country today. Despite the mild weather, it is still recommended to wrap up warm and not too spend too long in the water. Readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

Title: The work trends that dominated the headlines in 2024

Ghost jobs. Coffee badging. Quiet firing. Quiet vacationing. The buzziest workplace trends this year didn't just become well-known tropes but also highlighted an ongoing power struggle between workers and bosses after the pandemic shook up the way people do their jobs. The year's biggest movements reflect "shifts in work models, technological integration, and employee expectations," says Lauren Winans, CEO and HR consultant at Next Level Benefits. While some of these are by no means new fads, they all featured prominently in the discourse around work this year. Here are the trends that dominated the cultural conversation in 2024: Ghost jobs are nothing new but got a lot of attention this year. These are roles which employers claim to be looking to fill even though they may not actually be hiring for such positions. Employers may list ghost jobs for a few reasons. They might want to suggest they're doing well and growing; they could be trying to ready a talent pool for actual positions opening in the future; or they may want to imply to overworked employees that they'll get some additional help soon. This one pretty much explains itself, but just in case: When employees go on vacation without using any time off or telling their bosses, they're said to be quiet vacationing. Return-to-office mandates continued rolling out at big firms this year. Amazon, one of the country's biggest employers, became one of the highest-profile companies to announce a full 5-day-a-week return to the office. (Its implementation has been delayed for some employees though, due to a lack of space.) As employers tightened the reins on remote work, some employees started carving out a new working arrangement under the table. Enter the hushed hybrid schedule, in which employees skirt RTO mandates by getting their manager's approval to continue working from home on days they're technically required to be in the office. Managers, for their part, might agree to do this to keep their employees happy (or to keep them, period). They also probably have a more personal connection with the workers affected by a mandate than the executives enforcing it. And of course, managers who are themselves opposed to RTO plans might also cut employees some slack out of sympathy. Another method of evading RTO is coffee badging — though it still technically requires that an employee return to the office. The practice involves going to work to swipe your badge so your attendance is logged. But instead of spending the rest of the workday there, you kill some time by grabbing a coffee, or showing face with a quick lap around the office, before returning home to do most of your actual work there. Performance improvement plans, or PIPs, usually consist of a series of goals set for an employee to improve in areas where a boss says they're underperforming. If they're not completed in the allotted time, usually a few months or less, the employee will face termination. PIPs are certainly not unique this year but statistically have been more frequently issued in recent years. They got renewed attention in 2024 as part of the discussion around ways employers trim headcount unannounced. Yes, these are all somehow different things. Between RTO mandates and PIPs, "quiet firing," which gained a lot of buzz in recent years, stayed in the spotlight in 2024. It refers to a boss or employer's unspoken attempt to encourage employees to quit by making the role more uncomfortable, as opposed to facing the monetary and reputational costs associated with explicitly laying them off. Related phrases include "silent layoffs," which refers to giving employees severance packages but asking them to be discreet about their exiting the firm. There's also "stealth sackings," coined by the Financial Times to describe firing employees over minor offenses. The newspaper cited Meta's dismissal of two dozen staff for using $25 GrubHub meal credits to buy non-food items as an example, and EY's firing of dozens of staffers for watching multiple online training courses simultaneously. There were also other trends that, though they lack flashy names, also shaped how we worked in 2024. The main one, of course, was the growing adoption of AI in the workplace, the "standout trend" of the year, according to Amy Schabacker Dufrane, CEO of the Human Resource Certification Institute and the Human Resource Standards Institute. Winans says other trends included an emphasis on upskilling and reskilling to keep up with technological advancements and changing job requirements, as well as increased labor organizing efforts. Next year, the integration of AI at work will no doubt continue. "Employees expect training and transparency about AI's role, while employers navigate concerns about job security and ethics," says Dufrane. Other themes to watch include an emphasis on skills-based hiring and employee wellness programs, as well as ongoing changes to companies' ESG and DEI strategies. Employee engagement in the US hitting an 11-year low in 2024, coupled with the possibility it may be easier to change jobs in 2025 mean that revenge quitting may also be the next big thing in workplace trends come next year, according to a Glassdoor report. The phrase refers to dissatisfied employees being vocal with their discontent and resigning, often with little or no notice, knowing it could negatively impact their employer. Heading into 2025, "monitoring employee satisfaction will be more important than ever," says Dufrane. "We may see an increase in trends like bare-minimum attendance or revenge quitting as return-to-work mandates require employees to be on-site more than the post-COVID norm," she adds. "Prioritizing open communication, as well as autonomy, fairness, and a high-trust environment, will be critical for organizations to succeed." Jump to

We recently published a list of 12 AI News and Ratings Investors Are Watching Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against other AI news and ratings investors are watching right now. At CNBC’s ‘Money Movers’, Jack Hidary, CEO of Sandbox AQ, emphasized the shift towards B2B-focused AI, positioning it as the next major evolution in artificial intelligence. While language models like those from OpenAI have excelled in consumer applications, Hidary highlighted the untapped potential of quantitative AI (QAI) in driving innovation across industries like pharmaceuticals, automotive, and energy. QAI uses fundamental equations to generate new data, which enables advancements in drug development, materials for energy storage, and aerospace. Hidary pointed out that large quantitative models are set to transform product development by creating significant economic value, unlike large language models, which primarily reduce operational costs. He predicts that 2025 and beyond will see a growing focus on AI’s role in addressing critical challenges in B2B sectors, from building better batteries to accelerating medical breakthroughs. This evolution underscores a future where AI goes beyond text-based applications, becoming a cornerstone for innovation across various industries.

Looking ahead, AI integration is expected to redefine sales models, emphasizing customer outcomes, long-term success, and collaboration between human and AI-driven agents.

Title: My Top Retirement Strategy For 14% Dividends In 2025
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelfoster/2024/12/24/my-top-retirement-strategy-for-14-dividends-in-2025/

Adirondack chairs on a wooden dock on a calm lake in Muskoka, Ontario Canada. Cottages nestled ... [+] between trees are visible across the water. Not many people know this, but if you really want to diversify—deftly balancing and rebalancing to maximize (and protect) your gains, you need to invest in closed-end funds (CEFs). Doing this with CEFs, which yield around 8% on average, gives you two key advantages: First, you get a much bigger income stream. That’s great on its own. But if you’re reinvesting your income, you get an even bigger edge because you can easily redirect your dividends from one CEF to another in a different sector. You just can’t do this with an index fund. Let’s dig into how that works in practice. While 2024 has been a great year for stocks, some sectors are lagging, as is always the case. And right now, as we look ahead to 2025, is a good time to reallocate a bit from your winners into the stragglers. That’s because, over time, these laggards will likely revert to their long-term average performance. A look at the sectors making up the S&P 500 tells us that the biggest winners this year have been the communication services, finance, consumer discretionary and tech sectors. These firms are picking up the slack we’ve seen in materials, energy and healthcare. I want to focus on healthcare, because the gap between this year’s performance (up just around 1.1% following last week’s selloff) and what the sector has done in the long run is striking. With about a 9% annualized return over the last decade, healthcare has performed relatively well, making it a good target for rebalancing by moving profits (or CEF dividends) into it from the stronger-performing sectors of 2024. The highest-yielding healthcare CEF is the abrdn Healthcare Investors Fund (HQH), a 14.2% payer whose portfolio includes key pharma names like Gilead Sciences (GILD), Amgen (AMGN) and Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY). It would take just $705,000 invested in this fund to get $100,000 per year in income. Plus, HQH’s focus on healthcare means we could pair it with other sector-specific CEFs and rebalance to ensure we aren’t overexposed to any particular industry—and also profit from the performance differences between those sectors. But to make certain HQH is the best CEF for this strategy, we need to dig deeper. As of this writing, HQH has beaten the healthcare sector as a whole, with a 7.9% total NAV return year to date (this is a CEF-specific measure that examines the performance of a fund’s underlying portfolio, rather than its price on the open market), about seven times the return of the benchmark Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV). However, on the open market, the fund has returned 10.6%, including dividends paid out. This gap largely stems from the fund’s big discount to NAV (or the difference between the NAV- and market price–based return), which was over 15% at the start of the year and has now returned to that overly generous discount following the big selloff last week. This is a new buying opportunity, and momentum could drive that discount smaller still over the coming months if the market’s recent panic subsides, pulling up the fund’s market price with it. And if HQH doesn’t cut its payout, we may indeed see that discount get smaller still. There are two problems, however: Obviously, the market pullback might not yet be done and, more importantly, HQH raised its dividend in May, which means it’s now paying a 12.6% yield on NAV, much higher than that 7.9% total NAV return we just talked about. This means the dividend might need to be cut. Or HQH will need to pay out shareholder capital, shrinking the fund’s size—and its gain potential. That’s a tough situation, made worse by management’s decision to raise the payout. Now let’s consider the BlackRock Health Sciences Trust (BME), whose 7% yield is half that of HQH. BME trades at a less generous 10.3% discount, but the trend in this discount (in orange below) is very different than that of HQH (in purple). BME Discount HQH went from being priced at par to a huge discount to going back toward par over the last three years to plummeting last week. BME, meantime, has been on a steady descent toward a bigger discount (although the vector of decline has flattened out significantly in 2024, and it didn’t change all that much with the recent selloff). This would suggest BME is at risk of getting cheaper, but there’s a key detail: The fund is part of BlackRock’s “discount management program,” under which the company buys a certain amount of some CEFs (including BME) if their average discount is more than 7.5% during a three-month measurement period. HQH has no such initiative, which is why its discount grew so large late last year and why its discount could grow so massively. This means BME is unlikely to see its discount go much lower. And even if it does, BlackRock’s discount-management program means the firm will buy back shares on a quarterly basis at a 2% discount. If you tender your shares during this offer after buying at the fund’s current price, the result would be an instant 9.3% profit. There’s one more reason to prefer BME over HQH, despite its lower yield. BME Total Returns Over the last five years, BME (in orange above) has outperformed HQH on a total-NAV-return basis. This suggests it should be priced at a much smaller discount than HQH, on the strength of its stronger management. This also suggests BME is the better buy when its discount gets unusually wide. Thus, while HQH’s huge dividends make it look like the better choice, if you want to buy and hold a sector fund for the long term, BME is likely to outperform HQH, especially if BlackRock continues its discount-management program. However, if abrdn were to start its own discount-management program, HQH might have the edge. Until that happens, though, my money’s on BME.

Title: The Biggest TV Stories Of 2024
URL: https://deadline.com/gallery/biggest-tv-stories-2024/
Time Published: 2024-12-24T18:17:29Z

By Lynette Rice Senior TV Writer Contraction continued to upend the television world in 2024, which also saw the departure of several high profile news anchors, the death of two very beloved soap actors, and the pillorying of a once very successful Nickelodeon producer. The good news? The Paris Olympics were a delight, Dancing with the Stars proved that an old dog still has new tricks, and Ted Lasso isn’t done sharing his pearls of wisdom just yet. Here are the biggest TV stories of 2024. Fans went into the back half of season 5 expecting that something had to be done to address the absence of Kevin Costner, who made it official in June that he was not returning to the Paramount Network drama that relaunched his stardom. But no one expected that creator Taylor Sheridan would go so far as to kill the family patriarch, though it really was the only way to address Costner’s abrupt departure while bringing this version of Yellowstone to a tidy (and massively viewed) close. The contraction continued this year with layoffs at just about every company, including Paramount, Disney, Lionsgate, Televisa Univision, The CW, CAA, UTA, A+E Networks, Warner Bros. Discovery, Netflix, Hallmark, Great American Media, Amazon and CNN. Ryan Murphy’s latest installment to his Monster franchise not only blew away expectations and became a viewership behemoth for the streamer, it cracked the zeitgeist by prompting the L.A. District Attorney’s Office to consider resentencing the brothers who are incarcerated together in San Diego. In the final SNL episode before the election, Kamala Harris made a surprise appearance opposite Maya Rudolph in the cold open — a tiny cameo that would prompt FCC commissioner Brendan Carr to accuse SNL of a “clear and blatant effort” to evade the FCC’s Equal Time Rule, which requires that broadcasters offer comparable time to opposing candidates. NBC ended up giving Donald Trump a spot during NASCAR. Instead of a complete third season, Amazon decided to give Neil Gaiman’s Good Omens a 90-minute sendoff after he was accused of sexual assault by a slew of women. At one point, Gaiman offered to step back so that the series would be able to finish its story. Michael Sheen and David Tennant, who play the angel Aziraphale and demon Crowley, respectively, will return for the one-off television movie that will begin shooting in early 2025 in Scotland. Two of daytime’s most beloved stars died this year — Days of Our Lives‘ veteran Bill Hayes, the actor who played Doug Williams for more than 50 years, and his colleague Drake Hogestyn, who portrayed John Black since 1986. The Morning Joe hosts faced an online backlash after they met with Donald Trump for what they described as a “restart” of their communication with the president-elect to raise concerns about his attacks on the media. Despite the public spanking, Scarborough claimed they’ve been “flooded with [supportive] phone calls from people” after the now infamous meeting. Kurt Sutter — who was fired from FX’s Mayans M.C. in 2019 — got the ‘ol heave-ho yet again in October, this time from his Netflix series The Abandons just three weeks before it was slated to wrap production in Calgary. Sutter was the executive producer/showrunner on the series, which he also created. The departure was believed to stem from creative differences over the direction of the big-scale production — a western that Sutter had always wanted to make. Bro, your fans miss you. Get it together, man! The season that culimated with Jenna Johnson and Joey Graziadei winning the Mirror Ball Trophy was definitely one for the record books. The long-running variety show on ABC hit multiple milestones with its voting, but that was only just the beginning. The November finale broke the fan voting record once again with 32 million votes for the five finalists — 12 million more than what was received for the semi-finals. The Investigation Discovery docuseries that set out to uncover the toxic and dangerous culture on the sets of Dan Schneider’s Nickelodeon children’s shows in the late 1990s and early 2000s was a pearl clutcher for Gen Xers who grew up loving the goofy tween comedies. After the limited series dropped, Schneider apologized for his behavior that was depicted on Quiet On Set and vowed to hold himself accountable for how he acted on his Nickelodeon shows. Then, he sued Warner Bros, Maxine Productions, Sony Pictures and producers Mary Robertson and Emma Schwartz for defamation. Good luck with that, big guy. The strong reaction to the soap’s decision to boot the popular actress who’s played Sam McCall since 2003 was a keen reminder to the broadcast networks that yes, people do still care about their stories. Despite a looming defamation suit and the lingering questions over what should or shouldn’t constitute a “true story” for TV, the semi-autobiographical series Baby Reindeer took home Emmys in September for Best Series, Writing, Actor (Gadd) & Actress (Jessica Gunning). “The show has done some phenomenal things worldwide for so many people,” Gadd told the press after the ceremony. In a major step toward the long-awaited fourth season of Apple TV+’s hugely popular soccer comedy, the series’ studio Warner Bros. Television in August picked up the options for Hannah Waddingham, who plays AFC Richmond owner Rebecca Walton; Brett Goldstein, who plays hardman Roy Kent; and Jeremy Swift, who plays Director of Football Operations Leslie Higgins. If the heavens align, production on a fourth season may start in early 2025. NBC Universal’s coverage of the Paris Olympics was a cornucopia of delight and intrigue, from Celine Dion’s appearance on the Eiffel Tower during the opening ceremony to Stephen Nedoroscik’s stellar performance on the pommel horse for the U.S. Men’s Gymastic Team. Even Raygun of Team Australia — aka the embattled B-girl — became a veritable pop-cultural sensation even though she lost during the round-robin stage of the women’s breaking competition. Also, Snoop Dogg. The NBA and WBD end their months-long legal dispute in November by agreeing to an 11-year partnership for b-ball content. The pact is also meant to accelerate global growth of WBD’s TNT Sports Bleacher Report & House of Highlights. The year saw significant exits from the cable news world. Just this month, Fox News anchor Neil Cavuto announced he was exiting after 28 years with the network. Alisyn Camerota, Poppy Harlow, Chris Wallace and Gloria Borger signed off from CNN, Andrea Mitchell ditched MSNBC, Eric Molling departed Newsmax, and León Krauze and Jorge Ramos left Univision. President Biden’s first and subsequently last debate with Donald Trump in June was a historic game-changer, as his poor performance panicked Democrats into calling for an immediate change to the ticket. VP Kamala Harris stepped up and gave an impressive performance in the next debate against Trump on ABC, but, alas — we know what happened after that. CBS couldn’t help but feel bullish about its development for the 2024-25 season; it had NCIS: Origins, Matlock and Watson in the pipeline in addition to a second season of the Australian NCIS: Sydney. But that meant something had to go. In that case, it was the sleeper hit So Help Me Todd, not to mention NCIS: Hawaii and the legacy powerhouse that is Blue Bloods. Fans revolted with emails and petitions but CBS stood firm by saying things like “everything needs to come to an end sometime” but not acknowledging that NCIS has been on the air since the Dubya administration. Netflix‘s much-hyped matchup between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul took some hits before the former heavyweight champion and the YouTuber even landed their first blows. The event was plagued with glitches because just about every subscriber — and then some — hoped to see the senior Tyson clobber the lippy whippersnapper. Sadly, that didn’t happen. But lots of money was made! The soap world got a huge vote of confidence this year when CBS decided to develop Beyond the Gates, a new daytime series from CBS Studios / NAACP Venture in partnership with P&G Studios. It’s the first one-hour, Black daytime drama to air on television and the first daytime drama to premiere since Passions in 1999. But something had to give to make way for another sudser; the victim was The Talk, which launched in 2010 as CBS’ response to ABC’s The View. The Talk evolved over the years, which included introducing a co-ed panel. But modest ratings and high costs prompted the network to say goodbye to the talker after 15 seasons. In September, Hoda Kotb revealed that she was leaving Today, after co-anchoring since 2018, “I’ve been weighing this decision for quite a while – Am I truly ready? But, my sixtieth birthday celebration on the Plaza felt like a shift. Like a massive, joyful YES, you are! I saw it all so clearly: my broadcast career has been beyond meaningful, a new decade of my life lies ahead, and now my daughters and my mom need and deserve a bigger slice of my time pie.” Her last day is January 10. The FX remake of Shōgun took home a staggering 18 Emmys in September, including one for Outstanding Drama Series. During the acceptance speech for the latter award, Co-creator/executive producer/showrunner Justin Marks thanked Disney and FX executives for greenlighting “a very expensive subtitled Japanese period piece whose central climax revolves around a poetry competition.” The series has been picked up for another season. In a not-so-coincidental turn of events, George Stephanopoulos signed a new deal with ABC News after the network agreed to a $16 million settlement with President-elect Donald Trump, who sued in March over comments that Stephanopoulos made on This Week about the defamation case brought against Trump by writer E. Jean Carroll. A source told Deadline that the new contract was agreed to before the settlement. Sure, Jan. Significant change occurred at the behemoth media companies this year. Warner Bros. Discovery slimmed down from three divisions to two and established a clear separation between linear networks and the streaming and studios businesses. And Comcast formally unveiled plans to spin out most of its linear cable networks (except Bravo) into a separate company, a move that President Mike Cavanagh said puts all of NBCUniversal “on a new growth trajectory.” Norah O’Donnell exited her role as anchor of CBS Evening News after five years in the chair. She had previously been co-anchor of CBS This Morning and, before that, chief White House correspondent. In the meantime, layoffs at Paramount further impacted the network’s news division; CBS Saturday Morning co-host Jeff Glor got the boot, along with Anna Werner, senior consumer investigative correspondent, and Ben Tracy, senior national and environmental correspondent.

Title: The Goal is Higher Testosterone, Not Muscle?
URL: https://erickimphotography.com/blog/2024/12/24/the-goal-is-higher-testosterone-not-muscle/
Time Published: 2024-12-24T17:51:26Z
Full Content:
For example ,,, ￼ you would not want to be the world’s most muscular and glorious demigod body if you only got two hours of sleep a night, and felt like you were physiologically dying, and had very low testosterone. ￼ Similarly speaking, it wouldn’t matter if you were like the worlds strongest man, you could lift like 100,000 pounds or whatever, but, once again, you had naturally low mood, low testosterone, and once again only slept two hours a night? So one random thought I have in regards to fitness is the criticality of sleep and recovery. For example, I think I have a simple antidote, to reset your circadian rhythm, or sleep patterns, for dinner, the night prior, eat a shit load of beef ribs. Why beef ribs? First, ancient Greek literature, the Iliad confirms this. ￼￼ For example, when Achilles had his friends joined him in his hut, he carved out the backbone of the ox, often prized, the most choice meat. Also, it is easily accessible, you could find it at any Costco, even Food 4 Less. Even with the price of inflation, it is still affordable, around 499 a pound, or 449 a pound. I found a very very simple recipe, just take a baking tray and cover it with aluminum foil, and you don’t even have to season the ribs or prepare them, just put them directly on the aluminum foil, heat the oven at 325°, let it cook for an hour and a half, and boom you’re done! And then later you could just coat it with some salt pepper and garlic powder, and smoked paprika is actually good too. Anyways, after consuming about two trays of beef ribs, I’ve been sleeping way better, like on average another two or three hours a night, which I feel at least 500% better in the morning? The weird idea is in a lot of self improvement circles is that waking up super early every day, at like 3:30 AM or for whatever is considered virtuous. No. I would actually say that the ultimate virtue and active mainlines is to try to secure at least 8 to 12 hours of sleep a night. Why? Simple biology; assuming that during the day you are doing some sort of physical exercise and weightlifting, then what that then means is that the corresponding rest and recovery time will also be in similar accordance. Also, a simple thoughts; the stronger you become the heavier way to lift, you must also correspondingly spend equal amounts of time stretching, warming up etc. For example on the road to hitting my legendary thousand pound Atlas lift, all of these low testosterone guys would always tell me ￼“be careful”, which was their strange way of trying to feel superior to me that they thought I was doing something foolish in which I actually might injure myself? The simple idea that I have is once again, obviously! The higher weight you go, the more careful you become. And my personal way of mitigating safety was simple; spending at least two or three times more effort stretching warming up, doing dynamic exercise exercises like a bunch of yoga stuff on steroids. And this is where a lot of fools also don’t understand; when that would be warming up for my really really heavy weight lifts, I would also do a lot of calisthenics that looks like I would just do a single muscle up to warm up, planches etc. ￼ So currently my practical thought is the best car or vehicle to own in LA, maybe anywhere in Southern California, maybe even America is probably a white Toyota plug-in Prius prime. Why? First, once again you want to have the best of all worlds! For example, when you become dumb rich, it ain’t about showing off, rather, it is about adding more convenience to your life. For example, you want maximum optionality. What that means is you want to have access to gasoline pumps when necessary, and also you want to have access to electric charging ports when also available. But you don’t want to be dependent on either. ￼ Once again, do you want to have the optional not the dependence. So I just finished reading principles of economics by Saifedean, and one really really fascinating idea I encountered is this idea that perhaps, what if a lot of these doomsday Colts were simply predicated on false science math and philosophical principles? For example, just ChatGPT; what percentage of the earths crust has been mined for oil, and it will spit out an absurdly tiny number. Also all this hysteria when it comes to carbon dioxide and carbon footprint whatever; also once again, just ChatGPT the percentage of carbon in the earths atmosphere, compared to nitrogen which is about 70%, oxygen which is about 20%, and carbon which I think is like .01%? Anyways, I think the biggest issue here is that almost 99.9999% of all these doomsday cults is that once again, the world is going to shit, and it is precisely because we are boiling the earth, carbon footprint, running out of oil etc. But what if I could tell you, that with 100% certainty that human beings will be fine for the next hundred million years on planet earth, and even at the rate we are going, we have only tapped .001% of the earths natural gas and oil supply, in that, we would never run out of natural minerals even for the next hundred billion years? Certainly I cannot make this prediction but this is a thought experiment. If this were the case, then what? ￼￼ anyways, the reason why I think this is important is that even though I am 100% fan of Tesla Elon Musk, the truth is, getting an electric vehicle or a Tesla is more about fashion rather than saving the planet or whatever. Even an ancient Taoist philosophy says this; How dare you have the audacity to think that somehow the planet needs your help? I think there are virtues to arrogance, but also, the arrogant line of thinking that somehow the Earth needs our help, is also an arrogant thought? Sandbox thinking So currently I really really like this idea of a sandbox. The general idea is that what if we lived in the world in which we had unlimited time unlimited resources, essentially god mode, then how would we proceeded and live life? ￼￼ first, I think 99.9999% of the current modern-day misery that most humans face is body poverty. It don’t matter if you make seven figures or eight figures at Google, at Apple, Meta or Facebook whatever; it seems that almost all these people that I know who work in tech, all of them have extreme bodily poverty? Once again, not enough time weightlifting, too much time jerking off to VR porn, or going on Reddit late at night, with incognito browser on, or their VPN on with pirate bay, whatever it may be. Also, not enough meat consumption. All of these bizarre virtues signaling folks with plant-based diets whatever. Also once again, this anti-sleep mentality, the strange idea that sleeping is a vice? I find everybody on all sides of the political spectrum bad. Republicans and Democrats are bad, Libertarians are bad, moderates are bad etc. The left the right the alt left the alt right whatever. ￼ I don’t know any independent thinkers. All thinkers are dependent on others, nobody stands on their own two feet. I think currently the only independent thinkers that I appreciate and love include Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, Kanye West, Jeff Bezos, Michael Saylor, NASSIM Taleb etc. But once again, these individuals are good role models but not the end in itself. For example you could spend 100,000 years studying Elon Musk but the truth of the matter is you do not want to become Elon Musk. Why? The critical issue here is he has extreme body poverty until you see him topless on a yacht, with a golden bronze tan, and a six pack, don’t follow him. In some ways Jeff Bezos might be a better guide, look at him, he’s so fucking jacked. But then again I’m pretty sure that Bezos is on the juice, I’m sure he trains good, but he also does steroids good. Michael Saylor is a good example, he knows the virtues of intermittent fasting, and at the age of 59 he looks great! But I also think that maybe he could get into weightlifting; I want to see a sleeveless Michael Saylor with huge guns. MSTR FOLKS email me at Eric@erickim.com for tips So some simple training ideas: First, killing 10 birds with one stone. What that means is just go on a morning walk around town, with your 60 pound weight vest on! Titan.fitness is good ￼ Also, a very simple thing you could do is just get those wooden gymnast rings, you get on Amazon or Titan fitness, and just hook it up in your garage or backyard your front lawn, on a tree, your parking spot whatever ,,, and with your 60 pound weighted vest on, just do a few ups dips, “skin the cat”, Essentially an exercise in which you’re holding the rings you do kind of a backflip and un backflip it again, planches etc. ￼ Currently I think actually one of the most underrated exercises is the rack pull. Essentially, you rack your barbell at around waist level, and then you load it up with weights, and then you kind of do like a mini hip thrust, and you just get it off the rack for like half an inch and you’re done. Imagine like doing like a super mini deadlift, but it is far superior because you don’t have to deal with racking and unracking the weights annoyingly off the floor, and also, the transfer injury is almost nailed because there is not much load on your lower back. A rack pull is more like a hip thrust, meets thigh exercise, meets upper back and trap exercise? ￼ Another very simple one is the Atlas lift, once again, you don’t have to squat all the way down. You just rack up the weight, like you’re doing a squad, and the only goal is to just lift it up half an inch. For the fools who say this don’t do nothing, I have like the most insanely jacked legs thighs calves quads of all time and once again I’m not on steroids. It don’t matter if they are vegan plant-based, professional or whatever, everyone is on steroids! Even your favorite vegan power lifter and weightlifter is on steroids! Even your favorite yoga instructor or calisthenics or CrossFit instructor is also on steroids. Note, steroids are vegan! Ha ha. My massage therapist Aaron at massage envy in Beverly Hills, 100% recommended, told me something interesting that all body mechanics are pretty much the same, but the only difference is our levels of fitness. Also he encouraged me that because I am so physically active, to once again, the more physically active you become, the more time you must also dedicate to stretching mobility work etc. As an investor, you need to have big balls and high testosterone, good mood, good sleep, good physiological and mental health. The primary issue is that a lot of these degenerate traders, have very very poor physical and physiological health. If you’re checking prices like 100 times a day, this is bad. I would actually make the argument if you’re like a single person, and assuming that you’re trading bitcoin and investing a micro strategy stock whatever, the intelligence strategy is if you want to get your mind off things, invest in your physical fitness and health 10x. What that then means is like spend maximum time outside, outdoors, walking outside in the elements, go on nice hikes, be a nature, spend some time with the gym or weightlifting at home, essentially embrace a natural lifestyle. Also, quit marijuana, alcohol. These are all bad toxins. Just be sober. When in Doubt, Buy More Bitcoin! ALL OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING! EK IDEAS

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 closed higher Tuesday in thin trading ahead of the Christmas holiday, as tech stocks continued their strong start to the week. At 1:00 p.m. ET (18:00 GMT), both S&P 500 rose 1.1%, the Nasdaq 100 added 1.4%, while Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.9%, or 350 points. The New York Stock Exchange is set to close early Tuesday for Christmas Eve, and the market is shut on Christmas Day. Tech added to its strong start to the week as the so-called Mag 7 including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) climbed, though NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) traded flat. Chip stocks, which racked up stocks gains a day earlier, were marginally higher Biden after the Biden administration launched a new trade investigation into Chinese-made legacy chips, which could elad to fresh tariffs on Chinese semiconductors. American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) shares were flat recovering intraday loss Tuesday as the airline briefly grounded all flights in the U.S. due to a "technical issue." The ground stop was later lifted. Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) slipped, halting its recovery from a recent plunge that was triggered by results from a late-stage study of its weight loss drug that fell of expectations. BofA Securities stated its clients continued to buy US equities for the seventh straight week. Specifically, inflows reached $10 billion – the second-largest amount since 2008 and the biggest since January 2017. Similar to recent weeks, purchases were spread across both individual stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with stronger inflows directed toward single stocks. Large-cap stocks saw the bulk of the buying activity, while small caps experienced more subdued inflows. Institutional and retail investors increased their equity holdings for another week – the third for institutions and the second for retail clients. In contrast, hedge funds were net sellers for the second consecutive week. The rolling four-week average of inflows from institutional clients hit its highest point in nine months, reflecting a typical pattern of renewed buying activity following October’s tax-loss selling by mutual funds. “Private clients typically are big sellers in December amid tax loss selling vs. big net buyers in January. While this group has been a buyer of ETFs this month, it has sold single stocks, though slightly less so than in the average December,” BofA strategists led by Jill Carey Hall noted.

From crypto CEOs who advocate for the industry to NFT project founders who use their good fortune to help others, several Web3 workhorses made their way onto Saint Nick's “nice list” this year. Here's who can expect presents under the tree when Santa comes to town. Brian Armstrong is the face of the digital assets industry's fight for more favorable regulations in the U.S. The soft-spoken CEO of Coinbase spent ample time in Washington this year, participating in discussions with Republican and Democratic lawmakers alike on the future of crypto in the U.S. Meanwhile, Armstrong’s team led initiatives to center digital assets-related issues in the 2024 U.S. elections, sponsoring studies on crypto holders' political leanings and facilitating Republican candidate Donald Trump's push to accept campaign donations in crypto. Armstrong and his team were instrumental in building up pro-crypto super PAC Fairshake's $200 million war chest. Coinbase donated roughly $50 million each to Fairshake between 2023 and 2024, helping secure the election of the most pro-crypto U.S. Congress ever. Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo is the face of the crypto industry’s tokenization craze—a trend that has helped catapult digital asset prices to new heights in 2024. In June, the executive delivered testimony on Capitol Hill about the importance of real-world asset tokenization and its implications for the future of finance. Domingo is also an important ally to institutional investors looking to pour funds into crypto. Earlier this year, the Spanish founder's tokenization platform partnered with BlackRock to launch the investment titan's USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor has continued to be a fierce advocate for Bitcoin, adding more than $15 billion worth of the world’s oldest cryptocurrency to his company’s balance sheet in the last few weeks, according to the company’s filing with U.S. regulators. Saylor’s firm holds 423,650 Bitcoin (worth $41.5 billion) as of publication time, the company’s financial statements show. Despite HODLing roughly 2% of all the Bitcoin that will ever be mined, Saylor has contributed to the future of the cryptocurrency in another big way—by encouraging other tech giants to hold the asset. Earlier this month, Saylor pitched Microsoft’s directors on a proposal to add Bitcoin to the company’s balance sheet—a proposal its shareholders ultimately rejected. In addition, he urged Amazon shareholders to also nudge the delivery company toward investing in the digital currency. Many other smaller companies have also followed MicroStrategy’s playbook. Maggie Love is the founder of SheFi, a community for women in the cryptocurrency industry. SheFi offers dedicated job boards, courses and networking opportunities for women, a demographic group that remains largely underrepresented in Web3 and the broader technology sector. Less than 15% of startups within the Web3 ecosystem have at least one female founder, while just 3% have an all-female founding team, according to a Boston Consulting Group analysis of Crunchbase data. A year ago, SheFi Summit was an experiment. Today it's a movement. Grateful to all 500+ of you who came out to the biggest SheFi Summit yet and made it incredibly clear: The frontier is feminine. pic.twitter.com/PnuUZgv2Az — maggie love wu (@maggielove_) July 7, 2024 SheFi is challenging that lack of representation, however. Since its inception, SheFi has amassed more than 3,000 members, making it one of the largest women-led communities in crypto. NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden has continued to advocate for privacy rights at a time when cryptocurrency and blockchain network adoption is accelerating. The vector of development that the internet and society is traveling leads away from extraordinary people sharing unique beliefs, and toward a tyranny of mediocrity. It is a preference for "normal" so strong that it extinguishes excellence; a ruthless allegiance to the average. — Edward Snowden (@Snowden) September 16, 2024 At the annual Bitcoin conference in Nashville, TN, this summer, Snowden warned the conference’s attendees to vote independently in the upcoming U.S. presidential elections, which posed major consequences for the future of the crypto industry. He also flagged that governments could use artificial intelligence-powered tools to mine people’s metadata—a much-needed warning at a time when the use of AI tools is gaining traction. Pudgy Penguins CEO and IP owner Luca Netz has built an NFT empire of adorable avian creatures despite a deep downturn in the market for crypto collectibles. Pudgy Penguins’ remarkable growth kicked into high gear with the launch of Webkinz-like Pudgy World in 2024, and it was later helped by the hype around its upcoming Solana-based PENGU token launch. The future is tokenized 🐧 pic.twitter.com/ismhUS5KLW — Luca Netz 🐧✳️ (@LucaNetz) December 8, 2024 Pudgy Penguins’ floor price—meaning the price of a given collection's least valuable token—surged to an all-time high of about $134,000 worth of Ethereum in mid-December, more than tripling in price since the start of the year, CoinGecko data shows. It’s the second most valuable profile picture (PFP) project on the market as of this writing, behind only the influential CryptoPunks. Pudgy Penguins also continued to waddle its way into the hearts of mainstream consumers in 2024, as its real-world toy collection expanded into Walmart, Target, and Walgreens shelves across the U.S. and Canada. In addition to his work on Pudgy Penguins, Netz is also a devoted angel investor to several Web3 projects, including women-led companies such as Chipped. Bitget CEO Gracy Chen has led the world's 11th-largest exchange by daily trading volume since May 2024. And despite the newness of her tenure, Chen is already making her mark. Chen helped the trading platform strike a major deal with Spanish soccer league La Liga, raising the exchange’s profile in Europe and Latin America. And under her leadership, Bitget also expanded its presence in Europe, establishing its first regional hub in Lithuania. The moves are part of the platform's broader strategy to court new users in markets throughout the world. Meanwhile, Chen’s Bitget has promoted the development of the crypto industry through its $100 million “Web3 Fund.” In addition to her work at Bitget, the executive has also spearheaded charitable programs such as Blockchain4Her, an initiative that aims to promote gender inclusivity and diversity in the crypto industry. Chen is also a delegate to the United Nations’ Conference on the Status of Women.

Discover the latest stocks recommended by top Wall Street analysts, all in one place with Analyst Top Stocks Make smarter investments with weekly expert stock picks from the Smart Investor Newsletter From the hotly-debated high-flier Tesla (TSLA), Wall Street’s newest darling Rivian (RIVN), traditional-stalwarts turned EV-upstarts GM (GM) and Ford (F) to the numerous SPAC-deal makers that have come public in this red-hot space, The Fly has you covered with “Charged,” a weekly recap of the top stories and expert calls in the sector. Q4 DELIVERIES: Barclays expects Tesla to report Q4 deliveries of 515,000 units, up 6% year-over-year and just above the consensus estimate of 511,000. A beat could keep the stock’s narrative momentum strong, but the focus on Tesla’s fundamentals is limited overall, the firm tells investors in a research note. Barclays believes a slight near-term volume miss “would likely do little to dampen” Tesla’s autonomous vehicle and artificial intelligence push, which it says has recently come into greater focus ahead of the planned “Unsupervised FSD” launch in 2025. Conversely, a slight beat on Q4 is likely immaterial to the majority of the current Tesla bull case, the firm adds. It keeps an Equal Weight rating on Tesla with a $270 price target. NOT AS POSITIVE: Barclays also said it believes the post-election rally in shares of Tesla reflects a “sharp disconnect” between the stock and the company’s fundamentals. Technicals and options are playing an outsized role in the rally, the firm tells investors in a research note. Barclays believes Tesla shares are now best comped to crypto. There are little incremental positives to Tesla’s fundamentals from the election, but Elon Musk’s premium is now elevated, contends the firm. The last six weeks “serve as a reminder that Tesla remains a narrative king within the market, with fundamentals cast aside,” it adds. While 2025 consensus earnings estimates are up slightly in the past six weeks, Tesla’s multiple has increased to a “frothy” 145-times 2025 numbers, up from 80-times immediately pre-election, Barclays points out. It calls Trump’s “not as positive as you’d think” for Tesla’s fundamentals. The firm keeps an Equal Weight rating on Tesla with a $270 price target. AV DEPLOYMENT: Tesla is in early talks with the authorities in the city of Austin, Texas, about its autonomous vehicle technology, Bloomberg’s Kara Carlson reports. A Tesla employee has been in touch with the city’s autonomous vehicle task force since at least May to establish safety expectations for the vehicles, the report says, citing emails acquired by public records requests. Click here to check out Tesla’s recent Media Buzz Sentiment as measured by TipRanks. SOLAR INDUSTRY: Roth MKM notes that the American Active Anode Material Producers has filed anti-dumping and countervailing duty petitions against imports of active anode material from China with alleged average dumping margins from 828%-921%, adding that the firm believes this case could have “a wide range of impacts” as the petition covers active anode material regardless of whether it is imported independently, as part of a compound, or in a battery. Roth, which believes the anode typically represents about 10%-15% of the cost of a battery, says a potential added tariff cost could be “disruptive to the industry” and a negative for suppliers that source anode material from China, directly or indirectly. Some names that the firm says could be impacted include Fluence Energy (FLNC), Stem (STEM), Enphase (ENPH), SolarEdge (SEDG), Energy Vault (NRGV), Clearway Energy (CWEN), Enlight (ENLT), Ormat (ORA), Sunnova (NOVA) and Sunrun (RUN). BUY SUNRUN: TD Cowen initiated coverage of Sunrun with a Buy rating and $21 price target. The company is positioned to drive contracted subscriber value growth, supported by higher battery attachment and investment tax credit levels along with fixed cost absorption, through its scale and “leading” residential solar financier market share, the firm tells investors in a research note. TD Cowen says Sunrun will raise non-recourse debt against contracted subscriber value, providing confidence its 2025 cash generation targets are achievable.

Title: Hennessy Predicts 2025 Will Be Good Year For Mid-Cap Stocks
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/lcarrel/2024/12/24/hennessy-predicts-2025-will-be-good-year-for-mid-cap-stocks/
Time Published: 2024-12-24T15:02:35Z
Full Content:
Portfolio managers of the Hennessy Cornerstone Mid Cap 30 Fund, from left, Joshua Wien, Ryan Kelley, ... [+] Neil Hennessy discussing stocks in the Hennessy Funds office. After this year’s tremendous runup in mega-cap tech growth stocks, next year the market will probably see a shift to value and mid-cap stocks predicted Neil Hennessy, chairman and chief market strategist of Hennessy Funds, at the company’s recent market outlook press conference. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, with a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 27, and the S&P 500 Index’s P/E at 24, are both distorted by tech stocks, such as Nvidia (NVDA). The year-to-date returns of the Dow, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq Composite are 15.7%, 26%, and 31% respectively, as of Dec. 20, according to Morningstar. This rapid expansion is unsustainable and will create volatility in the indexes. “People are going to end up being very disappointed with the indexes or they're going to enjoy the roller coaster ride because it's going to be all over the place,” said Hennessy, who is also the chairman and chief executive of Hennessy Advisors (HNNA), the funds’ parent company. Based in Novato, CA, the firm has 17 funds with $4.8 billion in assets under management. He predicts 2025 will see the market shift from growth stocks to value investing and stock picking, especially in small- and mid-cap stocks. Mid-caps are companies with capitalizations between $1 billion and $10 billion. He likes mid-caps because they’re undervalued, at about 18x forward earnings, compared to companies with large-capitalizations. Mid-caps are also diversified, have multiple business lines, and are more nimble than large-caps. They also have strong performance potential with lower volatility compared to small-cap stocks. Over the long-term, mid-caps outperform large-caps, and could experience a surge as large-cap stocks face increased volatility, said Hennessy. For the broader economy, the firm forecasts inflation will remain under control, and interest rates will remain stagnant, neither helping nor hurting businesses or consumers. However, consumers are expected to be resilient, with consumer spending expected to stay robust despite projections of a slower holiday season. Other positive factors include low unemployment, strong job openings, as well as, healthy corporate profits and cash flows. The perennial market bull said that aside from AI and cryptocurrencies, there is not widespread euphoria in the market, and that investors need to focus on diversification and stock picking. Going forward, he thinks U.S. equities offer moderate risk for reward because of a positive outlook for earnings, and a lot of cash for stock buybacks and dividends. Overall, there is still a lot of cash on the sidelines. As of Oct. 31, S&P 500 companies held $7.1 trillion on their balance sheets, according to Bloomberg. Money market funds held $7.0 trillion and bank deposits are at record highs of $17.3 trillion, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Investment Company Institute (ICI), a fund company trade group. He sees sector rotation into more defensive sectors —consumer discretionary, industrials, and utilities) if the growth stocks slowdown. Financial stocks are also expected to do well on improving interest rates and a healthy banking system. Hennessy pointed to the stock-picking success of the firm’s Cornerstone Mid Cap 30 Fund (HFMDX) (up 30.8% last year and year-to-date returns of 36.3%, according to Morningstar,) as a way to capture returns without relying on the "Magnificent 7" tech stocks. The fund has outperformed the S&P 500 over 1-year, 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year periods, according to Morningstar, and received the firm’s 1% ranking as of the end of the third quarter. The concentrated portfolio of just 30 stocks focuses on mid-cap stocks with a strategy of combining value investing, earnings momentum, and stock momentum. Consumer discretionary and industrials make up more than 50% of the fund. The fund has a lower valuation than the overall market with a price-to-sales ratio of 0.9 vs. the Russell Midcap Indexes’ 1.8 and a forward PE ratio of 12.6. It won the 2024 Refinitiv Lipper Fund Award for Best-in-Category performance for the 5-year period, beating 826 funds. It charges an expense ratio of 1.34%. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Retail investors buy Novo dip after disappointing weight-loss drug data

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. By Bhanvi Satija (Reuters) - U.S. retail investor fund flows into Novo Nordisk (NVO) surged 32-fold on Friday, as the Danish drugmaker's weaker-than-expected obesity drug data offered a rare dip-buying opportunity, according to Vanda Research. Daily net flows climbed to $15.6 million from $0.49 million a day earlier, after eagerly anticipated data showed Novo's experimental drug, CagriSema, helped patients cut 22.7% of their weight—short of the anticipated 25%. Novo competes with U.S. rival Eli Lilly (LLY) in the burgeoning market for weight-loss treatments, which is projected to exceed $150 billion in revenue within the next decade. "Retail investors love to buy dips, especially in popular stocks..and do so, until that doesn't work anymore," said Marco Iachini, senior vice president of research at Vanda (VNDA). Shares of Novo Nordisk dropped 27% on Friday, erasing over $100 billion in market value. Its U.S.-listed shares tumbled 21% to $81.50, their lowest level since August 2023. "Right now Novo only dipped below S&P 500 performance for the first time in 2 years so, probably too early to see them (retail investors) give up on their buy-the dip-bias," he said. The retail flows on Friday likely provided an exit for institutional investors. Funds from retail investors touched a one-day high of $23.5 million on March 7, data from Vanda shows, after Novo's amycretin drug helped obese patients cut 13% of their weight in a study. The success of Novo’s Wegovy and Lilly’s Zepbound weight-loss drugs has revived retail interest in the healthcare sector. "With their GLP-1 product in the market and Eli Lilly being a lot on the news...a lot of retail investors know about Lilly," said Sel Hardy, vice president of equity research at CFRA. She suggested that a sell-off, like Lilly's stock dip in October, and mid-November, could provide “an attractive entry point” for retail investors Net retail flows into Lilly have outpaced Novo in the second half of 2024, according to Vanda. For Lilly, net retail purchases peaked in August after its weight-loss drug sales surpassed $1 billion for the quarter, prompting a $3 billion forecast increase. However, retail activity in these stocks lags behind tech giants such as Nvidia and Tesla, where activity often reaches the high teens.

During Joe Biden’s presidency, the U.S. solar industry experienced a significant boost, primarily driven by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). This $369 billion package, signed into law in 2022, has been a game-changer for the renewable energy sector. The IRA provided substantial incentives for renewable energy, including tax credits, grants, and investments in clean energy infrastructure. The IRA has also reduced the U.S. reliance on imported energy resources. The economic benefits of the IRA have been widely recognized, with bipartisan support from both Democratic and Republican leaders. According to a report by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) published on December 4, the US solar market installed 8.6 GW of capacity in Q3, continuing the trend of record-setting quarterly volumes this year and marking a notable 21% increase compared to the same quarter in the prior year. The report also highlights significant growth in domestic solar module manufacturing capacity, which increased by over 9 GW in Q3, reaching nearly 40 GW. This marks a substantial rise from less than 7 GW at the end of Q2 2022, before the introduction of domestic manufacturing and procurement tax credits under the IRA. Additionally, the first US cell manufacturing facility opened in Q3 marking a significant milestone in reshoring cell production for the first time since 2019. Utility-scale solar remained the largest contributor, with 6.6 GW installed in Q3, which signifies a 44% increase year-over-year and marks the highest third-quarter performance on record for the segment. As Donald Trump prepares for a second term as president, the future of the U.S. solar industry is a topic of significant interest. Trump’s campaign rhetoric has signaled intentions to bolster the fossil fuel industry, repeal Biden-era policies such as the IRA, and increase trade tariffs. In an interview with CNBC on November 9, John Berger, CEO of Sunnova, discussed the impact of a potential second Trump administration on the solar industry. Berger emphasized that the market is currently driven by wild speculation and emotional responses, but he believes that the fundamentals of the solar industry remain strong and the demand for energy is increasing, suggesting it could bring even more success and growth for the solar industry and his company. Berger addressed the speculation about future policy changes, particularly regarding the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). He stated that the IRA is unlikely to change significantly, noting its success and the bipartisan support for domestic manufacturing, especially in the production of solar panels, batteries, inverters, and electric vehicles. He also stated that 85% of the plants that manufacture solar panels and batteries are located in Republican districts. Berger concluded by praising the IRA, particularly the tax credit for manufacturing (45X), which has played an instrumental role in growing and building domestic manufacturing plants in the U.S. Despite the potential for federal policy changes, the solar industry will undoubtedly play an increasingly vital role in global energy systems.

Title: BlackRock Bets on Bitcoin: Is the US Dollar Era Over?

"The rewiring of globalization is also playing out in reserve currencies," writes Tom Donilon, Chairman of the BlackRock Investment Institute. "As the world divides into competing blocs, and the US and Western governments lean on sanctions and other restrictions, some countries are shifting their reserves out of US dollars into gold and other assets, while increasingly conducting trade finance in non-dollar currencies." "As others have learned through history it is dangerous for private investors to challenge governments. That said, George Soros broke the Bank of England [in 1992] so, perhaps, a firm like BlackRock will believe it can profit from breaking over-leveraged nations that today still have 'hard' fiat currencies," Ortel concludes, referring to the 1992 sterling crisis which was estimated to have cost the British Treasury over $3.7 billion.

Title: Fintech Wrapped: Three Surprising Things That Happened In Fintech In 2024

Full Content:
Fintech wrapped for 2024 It’s always fun to do a retrospective on the year. 2024 was a year of surprises for the fintech sector. Some trends cooled. Others reignited with fervor. From a crypto renaissance in recent months, a continued slow exit environment and important shifts in emerging markets, 2024 was also a year of transformation. Here are three trends that stood out. 2024 witnessed a dramatic rebound in the cryptocurrency market. Despite a recent pull-back, bitcoin hit $100K, shattering previous highs, driven by institutional interest, macroeconomic factors and the US election. Beyond political speculation, one real driver is growing institutional interest. Nearly half of traditional hedge funds reported exposure to digital assets in 2024, up from 29% in 2023. Among these, 33% plan to increase their crypto investments by year's end. Retail investors can now access crypto more easily. U.S. regulators approved several Bitcoin ETFs. BlackRock recommends bitcoin portfolio weighting of up to 2% for interested investors. Central banks are also continuing to experiment in the space. Approximately 134 countries, including across the G20, are exploring digital versions of their currencies. Major economies like India and Brazil moved from pilots to early-stage implementation of CBDCs. Perhaps most interesting is that blockchain technology may be finding its first real use case (beyond speculation of future use cases): stablecoins. The market cap of commodity-backed stablecoins hit $1.3 billion as of August 1, 2024. This is being driven by use in ecommerce, remittances and treasury. This was one of the big stories coming out of Money 2020 this year. 2024 was certainly the year crypto came back, with new real applications emerging. Despite signs of economic recovery, fintech IPOs were nearly non-existent. Companies like Stripe and Klarna, expected to go public, opted to delay due to market volatility. However, things might change. A number of companies are predicted to go public in 2025. At Money2020 this year, one of the buzziest topics was who would be the most likely next IPO. Scott Sanborn predicted Stripe and Chime (which received a few other votes) as likely candidates, while Sandy Kimura of Money Forward suggested Klarna and Plaid (note Chime is a former portfolio company). Despite the dearth of IPOs, the exit markets were still active, particularly in strategically minded M&A transactions and other deals. The most significant deals were in the payments sector, including Capital One Financial Corp.'s $35 billion proposal to acquire Discover Financial Services and an investor group's $5.04 billion plan to take Canadian payments firm Nuvei Corp. private. Crypto & stable coins were also not left out. BRD-GE, a stablecoin infrastructure provider was acquired by Stripe for over a billion. 2024 reaffirmed that innovation thrives outside traditional hubs, particularly in emerging ecosystems. Emerging market fintech innovation is arguably most strongly seen today by the government. Real-time money transfers continue their march forward in emerging market – like India, Brazil and now a handful of other markets. The impact is clear. McKinsey & Co predicts the cash economy in many emerging markets like India, will decline from 23% today to less than 10% within this decade. Emerging markets have created regional powerhouses. Nubank is among the largest neobanks. Jio is building a multibillion-dollar ecosystem in India. Many are expanding across markets. Dlocal for example has scaled across South America, Africa, and Asia. We will see more of this over time. A number of sectors cooled, while others heated up. ESG-focused fintechs struggled as investor focus shifted away from sustainable investments, particularly in light of disappointing financial returns in 2023. Conversely, generative AI became fintech’s darling, driving personalized financial services, fraud detection, and operational automation. Examples include OpenAI’s collaboration with major banks for automated underwriting models. What I enjoyed was the comeback stories. For example, companies like Root and Dave, once fintech darlings, found themselves in the doldrums at the beginning of the year. In January, Root traded under $10/share (down from over $350 at its peak). The company grew its stock price 7x this year to over $70 as of writing. Hippo, the home insurance provider, similarly scaled from under 10 to nearly $30 today (source Yahoo Finance). 2024 was a year of unexpected twists in fintech. But like some of the stock and crypto prices, fintech has gone from down-and-out category, to a core investment area. As we look to 2025, the stage is set for further surprises in an industry that never stays static for long. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Why New Gold Inc. (NGD) Is One of the Best Gold Royalty and Small-Cap Gold Stocks to Buy?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Gold Royalty and Small-Cap Gold Stocks to Buy. In this article, we are going to look at where New Gold Inc. (NYSEAMERICAN:NGD) stands against other best gold royalty and small-cap gold stocks to buy. The U.S. Federal Reserve now anticipates just two interest rate cuts next year, a reduction from the four previously forecasted in September, due to inflation concerns and the potential economic impact of President-elect Donald Trump’s proposed trade tariffs. On November 18, in the immediate aftermath of the Fed’s announcement, the U.S. dollar surged, with the dollar index reaching a two-year high. This rally placed downward pressure on gold prices, which fell 2% to their lowest levels in a month. Traditionally, a stronger dollar and higher U.S. Treasury yields make gold less attractive as an investment. However, analysts suggest that these traditional relationships between gold, the dollar, and interest rates have become less predictable in recent years. In an interview with CNBC on December 18, Thomas Rupf, Chief Investment Officer and Head of Trading at VP Bank Asia provided detailed insights into the current market conditions and future projections for the U.S. dollar and gold. Rupf acknowledged the resilience of the U.S. dollar and attributed it to the perception of the continued strength of the U.S. economy. However, he also pointed out that the U.S. dollar is currently overvalued and expects the US economy to slow down, which could contribute to a weaker US dollar by the end of next year. Regarding gold, Rupf is optimistic and noted that the potential slowdown in the US economy and dollar as well as the ongoing trend of de-dollarization are all bullish factors for gold prices. He mentioned that ETF flows, which are still 20% below historical levels, indicate that there is significant room for retail investors to increase their investment in gold ETFs. Rupf concluded by agreeing that gold prices could realistically reach $2,800 to $2,900. He also mentioned the possibility of gold reaching up to $3,000, which he considers the top end of his forecast. Gold has historically been recognized as a reliable investment, known for its enduring value and resilience against economic uncertainties. This precious metal has been a cornerstone in many diversified investment portfolios, offering a sense of security and stability in times of financial turmoil. To compile our list of the 10 best gold royalty and small-cap gold stocks to buy, we used Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the companies that are involved in the production, extraction, processing, financing, or sale of gold and have a market capitalization between $200 million and $10 billion as of December 23. Then we used Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database to rank 10 stocks according to the largest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 23 Market Capitalization as of December 23: $1.98 Billion New Gold Inc. (NYSEAMERICAN:NGD) is a prominent intermediate gold mining company with a diversified portfolio of high-quality assets across North America. The company operates two flagship mines: Rainy River in Ontario, Canada, and New Afton in British Columbia, Canada. New Gold Inc. (NYSEAMERICAN:NGD) prioritizes exploration to generate additional value and extend the operational life of its mines. At Rainy River, the company has identified promising opportunities in the main pit and several smaller satellite pits. These prospects could further extend the open-pit mine’s life while minimizing capital expenditures. At New Afton mine, New Gold Inc. (NYSEAMERICAN:NGD) is focusing on optimizing the C-Zone, the fourth block cave at the mine, and advancing the technical study for the East Extension, which has the potential to introduce a high-grade zone in the mine’s eastern section. New Gold Inc. (NYSEAMERICAN:NGD) is also advancing several critical projects aimed at boosting production capacity and improving cost efficiency. At the C-Zone, the company has successfully commissioned the gyratory crusher and conveyor system, eliminating the need for truck haulage. At the Rainy River Mine, efforts are concentrated on developing the Underground Main Zone, the second and much larger sector of the mine compared to Intrepid. The Underground Main Zone is slated to begin production in the first half of 2025 and is expected to ramp up to processing 5,500 tonnes of gold ore per day by 2027. Overall, NGD ranks 2nd on our list of best gold royalty and small-cap gold stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NGD to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NGD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

The company’s portfolio includes a mix of producing and development-stage assets, primarily Canada, the United States, and Australia.

The Dalgaranga Gold Project has a mineral resource estimate of 1.9 million ounces at 8.7 grams per tonne, with significant exploration potential. Osisko Gold Royalties Ltd (NYSE:OR) expects a maiden reserve estimate and project feasibility study, to be completed and released in Q2 2025, which will potentially lead to the start of mining and milling operations by late 2026. This acquisition is expected to contribute over 2,500 gold Equivalent Ounces (GEOs) annually over the life of the mine. Furthermore, the East Gouldie deposit, where Osisko Gold Royalties Ltd (NYSE:OR) holds a 5% Net Smelter Return (NSR) royalty, highlighted the potential for additional mineral reserves and extended mine life.

Bitcoin has dropped back from its all-time high of over $100,000 in the last week as BlackRock quietly confirmed a worrying bitcoin bombshell. Unlock over $3,000 in NFT, web3 and crypto perks — Apply now! The bitcoin price has plunged toward $90,000 per bitcoin, with the Federal Reserve's "biggest nightmare" weighing on the crypto market. Now, as Donald Trump confirms he has huge plans for bitcoin, a financial analyst has warned a $4.1 trillion drop in the global money supply could be about to trigger a bitcoin price crash of $20,000. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has overseen a $4.1 trillion drop in the global money supply, ... [+] something some fear could cause a bitcoin price crash. "In the past, bitcoin prices have followed global money supply with ~10 week lag," analysts with The Kobeissi Letter posted to X, asking: "Is bitcoin overdue for a correction?" Kobeissi analysts pointed to the money supply dropping by $4.1 trillion, to $104.4 trillion, the lowest since August, after hitting a peak of $108.5 trillion in October. "If the relationship still holds, this suggests that bitcoin prices could fall as much as $20,000 over the next few weeks. Bitcoin's red hot run may take a pause." The Federal Reserve, which controls the money supply through monetary policy, has been fighting to keep a lid on inflation this year while also attempting to bring down interest rates to prevent the economy falling into recession. Last week, the Fed cut interest rates by a well-telegraphed 25 basis points despite prices beginning to rise again but signaled it will move more slowly along next year's expected path of rate cuts. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has surged to record highs of over $100,000 per bitcoin this year, a huge rally ... [+] that's led to fears of a looming bitcoin price crash. The Fed's "economic outlook and chair Powell's press conference suggested that inflation is going to be stickier than previously thought. This means that they will proceed with the current rate cut cycle slowly and with caution to inflation, which seems to be re-accelerating for the past couple of months," Yuya Hasegawa, bitcoin and crypto market analyst with Tokyo-based Bitbank, said in emailed comments. "There also is a chance for Fed to stop cutting rates sometime during 2025 if inflation becomes too hot, and in the worst case scenario, they might start raising again. Monetary easing has almost always favored the price of bitcoin, and the opposite has negative impact on the price." U.S. debt has soared over recent years, topping $34 trillion at the beginning of 2024, with Covid and lockdown stimulus measures contributing to massive government spending and helping to send inflation spiraling out of control in 2022. Inflation of over 10% forced the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates at a historical clip, pushing up debt interest payments and fueling fears of a "death spiral." "While Fed's potential policy shift will likely put pressure on bitcoin, high interest rates will keep pressure on the government's debt payments as well," Hasegawa said. "The ballooning Federal government debt is already raising the question about its sustainability and the government's credibility could gradually become one of the topics that the market will pay attention to in 2025."

Don’t Miss: CEO of Integris gathered a team of senior investment managers who have $34.22 billion in combined owned and managed assets in the West Coast — here’s how to invest in their private credit fund that targets 12% annual interest rate. Warren Buffett once said, "If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die." These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% make earning passive income easier than ever. Yiu sees Broadcom as the next Nvidia in terms of potential outperformance, thanks to its strong partnerships with major tech firms. “Nvidia's GPUs are very powerful, but at the same time also very expensive,” Yiu noted. “From Microsoft's perspective, you don't want to become overly dependent on one single supplier.” Broadcom’s year to date returns have climbed 103.42% this year, as of Monday pre-market hours, according to Benzinga Pro. It hit a market cap of over $1 trillion after announcing that its AI revenue tripled to $12.2 billion in 2024. The company is working with three major cloud computing customers, Meta, Alphabet, and ByteDance, to develop custom AI chips. Despite still holding an investment in Nvidia, Yiu has significantly cut it from nearly 10% of his fund's portfolio. He views Broadcom as a more attractive investment opportunity due to its smaller size. “For a $1 trillion company to grow 50% to become $1.5 trillion is reasonable. But for Nvidia to do that, they would need to add another $1.5 trillion, which is a very big number,” he elaborated. Trending: Arrived Home's Private Credit Fund’s has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%*, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with just a $100 minimum. Why It Matters: Broadcom’s CEO Hock Tan has expressed strong confidence in the sustainability of the AI boom. Big tech companies like Google, Meta, and ByteDance are investing heavily in designing custom processors to accelerate the training and deployment of AI systems. Even OpenAI and Apple have partnered with Broadcom to develop their AI server chips, diversifying their exposure to Nvidia. Kurv Investment Management’s CEO Howard Chan recently mentioned that chipmakers like Nvidia and Broadcom are leading the AI wave. He noted that demand is outstripping supply in this sector, benefiting chipmakers and cloud computing service providers. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), known for her active stock market investments as a member of Congress, disclosed in June that she had acquired call options on Broadcom. These options, adjusted to a strike price of $80 after a 10-for-1 stock split, are set to expire in June 2025. Pelosi, a widely followed Congressional trader, has drawn significant attention to her stock holdings, inspiring dedicated Pelosi portfolio trackers. Check It Out: EquityMultiple's ‘Alpine Note — Basecamp Series' is turning heads and opening wallets.

Title: Nvidia dominated 2024 big-time. Next year? Plenty of challenges.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia (NVDA) has had the kind of year most companies can only dream of. Its revenue and stock price soared thanks to prescient investments in artificial intelligence technologies that are paying off handsomely on the back of the generative AI wave. That’s not all. It’s repeatedly swapped places with Apple (AAPL) as the largest publicly traded company in the world by market cap, topping the $3 trillion mark. CEO Jensen Huang has become one of the most in-demand executives in Silicon Valley, meeting with everyone from fellow tech luminaries to world leaders and then some. And there’s more to come. The company is ramping up production of its high-powered Blackwell chip for AI applications and expects to ship several billion dollars worth of the hardware in the fourth quarter alone, with far more expected throughout the year ahead. “Nvidia really has the [hardware and software] for the AI computing era,” Futurum Group CEO Daniel Newman told Yahoo Finance. “It's all connected inside the [server] rack, outside the [server] rack, and then the software is very well … liked within the developer communities.” But the competition isn’t sitting idly by. Companies like AMD (AMD) are angling to poach Nvidia’s customers and slice into its estimated 80% to 90% market share. Even Nvidia’s own customers are working on chips meant to cut down on their reliance on the graphics giant’s semiconductors. And Wall Street is getting on board. Nvidia stock was down 1% before the bell on Thursday. Shares of Broadcom (AVGO), which works with companies like Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to design AI chips, are up 113% year to date and rocketed 44% in just the last month after CEO Hock Tan said AI could represent a $60 billion to $90 billion opportunity for the company in 2027 alone. Still, taking on Nvidia will be a tough task for any company. And dethroning it as the AI king, at least in 2025, will be all but impossible. Nvidia grabbed a first-mover advantage in the AI market on the back of early investments in AI software that unlocked its graphics chips to be used as high-powered processors. And it’s managed to hold onto that lead in the space thanks to continued advances in its hardware, as well as its Cuda software that allows developers to build apps for its chips. Because of that, so-called hyperscalers, massive cloud computing providers including Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet’s Google, Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and others continue to plow cash into buying up as many Nvidia chips as possible. In its most recent quarter, Nvidia reported total revenue of $35.1 billion. Of that, $30.8 billion, or 87% came from its data center business. “Everybody wants to build and train these huge models, and the most efficient way to do it is with CUDA software and Nvidia hardware,” TECHnalysis Research president and chief analyst Bob O’Donnell told Yahoo Finance. Nvidia is expected to continue to power the bulk of the AI industry in 2025 as well. The company’s Blackwell chip, the successor to its popular Hopper line of processors needed to power AI applications, is in production — and its customers, like Amazon, are already adding new cooling capabilities to their data centers to handle the immense heat the processors generate. “I don't know what the current backlog [for Nvidia’s chips is], but if it's not a year, it's close to a year,” O’Donnell said. “So, they're pretty much sold out for most of everything they're probably going to make next year already.” With hyperscalers calling for increased or at least the same level of capital expenditures in 2025 as in 2024, you can expect a chunk of that will end up going to the purchase of Blackwell chips. While Nvidia will retain control of the AI crown, there’s no shortage of challengers looking to take its throne. AMD and Intel (INTC) are the top contenders among chipmakers, and both have products on the market. AMD’s MI300X line of chips is designed to tackle Nvidia’s H100 Hopper chips, while Intel has its Gaudi 3 processor. AMD is better positioned to steal market share from Nvidia, though, as Intel continues to struggle amid its turnaround efforts and hunt for a new CEO. But even AMD is having a difficult time cracking Nvidia’s lead. “What AMD needs to do is make software really usable, build the systems where there's more demand …with developers, and ultimately, that could create more sell through,” Newman said. “Because these cloud providers are going to sell what their customers ask for.” It’s not just AMD and Intel, though. Nvidia’s customers are increasingly developing and pushing their own AI chips. Google has its Broadcom-based tensor processing unit chips (TPUs), while Amazon (AMZN) has its Trainium 2 processor and Microsoft (MSFT) has its Maia 100 accelerator. There’s also concern that the shift to "inferencing AI models" will reduce the need for high-powered Nvidia chips. Tech companies develop AI models by training them on huge amounts of data, otherwise referred to as the training process. Training requires incredibly powerful chips and lots of energy. Inferencing, or actually putting those AI models to work, is less resource- and power-intensive. As inferencing becomes a larger part of AI workloads, the thinking goes, companies will back away from needing to purchase so many Nvidia chips. Huang has said he is prepared for this, explaining at various events that Nvidia’s chips are just as good at inferencing as they are at training. Even if Nvidia’s market share slides, it doesn’t necessarily mean its business will be doing any worse than before. “This is definitely a case of raising all boats,” Newman said. “So even with much stronger competition, which I think they certainly will have, that doesn't mean they're going to fail. This is people building a bigger pie.” Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com. Follow him on Twitter at @DanielHowley.

Still, taking on Nvidia will be a tough task for any company. And dethroning it as the AI king, at least in 2025, will be all but impossible. Nvidia grabbed a first-mover advantage in the AI market on the back of early investments in AI software that unlocked its graphics chips to be used as high-powered processors. And it’s managed to hold onto that lead in the space thanks to continued advances in its hardware, as well as its Cuda software that allows developers to build apps for its chips. Because of that, so-called hyperscalers, massive cloud computing providers including Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet’s Google, Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and others continue to plow cash into buying up as many Nvidia chips as possible. In its most recent quarter, Nvidia reported total revenue of $35.1 billion. Of that, $30.8 billion, or 87% came from its data center business. “Everybody wants to build and train these huge models, and the most efficient way to do it is with CUDA software and Nvidia hardware,” TECHnalysis Research president and chief analyst Bob O’Donnell told Yahoo Finance. Nvidia is expected to continue to power the bulk of the AI industry in 2025 as well. The company’s Blackwell chip, the successor to its popular Hopper line of processors needed to power AI applications, is in production — and its customers, like Amazon, are already adding new cooling capabilities to their data centers to handle the immense heat the processors generate. “I don't know what the current backlog [for Nvidia’s chips is], but if it's not a year, it's close to a year,” O’Donnell said. “So, they're pretty much sold out for most of everything they're probably going to make next year already.” With hyperscalers calling for increased or at least the same level of capital expenditures in 2025 as in 2024, you can expect a chunk of that will end up going to the purchase of Blackwell chips. While Nvidia will retain control of the AI crown, there’s no shortage of challengers looking to take its throne. AMD and Intel (INTC) are the top contenders among chipmakers, and both have products on the market. AMD’s MI300X line of chips is designed to tackle Nvidia’s H100 Hopper chips, while Intel has its Gaudi 3 processor. AMD is better positioned to steal market share from Nvidia, though, as Intel continues to struggle amid its turnaround efforts and hunt for a new CEO. But even AMD is having a difficult time cracking Nvidia’s lead. “What AMD needs to do is make software really usable, build the systems where there's more demand …with developers, and ultimately, that could create more sell through,” Newman said. “Because these cloud providers are going to sell what their customers ask for.” It’s not just AMD and Intel, though. Nvidia’s customers are increasingly developing and pushing their own AI chips. Google has its Broadcom-based tensor processing unit chips (TPUs), while Amazon (AMZN) has its Trainium 2 processor and Microsoft (MSFT) has its Maia 100 accelerator. There’s also concern that the shift to "inferencing AI models" will reduce the need for high-powered Nvidia chips. Tech companies develop AI models by training them on huge amounts of data, otherwise referred to as the training process. Training requires incredibly powerful chips and lots of energy. Inferencing, or actually putting those AI models to work, is less resource- and power-intensive. As inferencing becomes a larger part of AI workloads, the thinking goes, companies will back away from needing to purchase so many Nvidia chips. Huang has said he is prepared for this, explaining at various events that Nvidia’s chips are just as good at inferencing as they are at training. Even if Nvidia’s market share slides, it doesn’t necessarily mean its business will be doing any worse than before. “This is definitely a case of raising all boats,” Newman said. “So even with much stronger competition, which I think they certainly will have, that doesn't mean they're going to fail. This is people building a bigger pie.” Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com. Follow him on Twitter at @DanielHowley.

Title: What's New With American Express Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/12/24/whats-new-with-american-express-stock/
Time Published: 2024-12-24T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
05 July 2022, Baden-Wuerttemberg, Rottweil: An American Express Gold Card is lying in an office. ... [+] Photo: Silas Stein/dpa (Photo by Silas Stein/picture alliance via Getty Images) American Express (NYSE: AXP) stock remains up by about 55% over the past year, considerably outperforming the S&P 500 which remains up by about 23% this year. In comparison, peer Capital One (NYSE: COF) is up 33% year-to-date, while Visa and Mastercard stocks are up by about 22% and 23% respectively. So what are some of the trends that have driven American Express stock higher of late? American Express has posted strong financial results, beating earnings estimates over the first three quarters of this year. For Q3 2024, American Express’ revenue was up by about 8% year-over-year to $16.6 billion, while adjusted earnings came in at $3.49 per share, up about 6% compared to last year. American Express has a large base of affluent card members compared to its key rivals and these customers have continued to spend strongly, helping the company’s business. Billings, a metric representing cardholder spending, was up by about 6% from a year ago. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. The company’s fee revenue grew by a robust 18%. The average fees per card - which includes transaction fees, subscription fees, as well as commissions - increased 13% year over year in Q3. Amex’s customer cohort is attractive to merchants given their higher spending power. This means that Amex charges merchants higher discount rates than Visa and Mastercard (about 3%). The company also added about 3.3 million new card acquisitions and this is also helping to drive up subscription fee-related revenues. Amex also has multiple partnerships including Marriott International and Delta, enabling customers to earn attractive rewards and further incentivizing spending activity. Admirably, AXP stock has generated better returns than the broader market in each of the last 4 years Returns for the stock were 37% in 2021, -9% in 2022, and 29% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk than the benchmark index, making the ride less of a roller-coaster, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, what lies ahead for Amex? The company’s full-year revenue guidance was a bit softer than expected, projecting that revenue growth would come in at the low end of its previous guidance of 9% and 11% for the year. However, the company raised its EPS guidance for the fiscal year to $13.75 to $14.05 per share, up from $13.30 to $13.80 previously. There are a couple of trends that could drive AXP stock going forward. The Federal Reserve has cut interest rates three times since September, and lower rates could likely drive consumer spending to an extent benefiting AXP’s transaction volumes and fee revenues. The strong rebound in travel-related spending is also likely to help the company given that it specializes in premium travel credit cards. The company has been expanding quickly among Gen Z and millennial customers, with its total rate of card additions coming in at about 3 million each quarter in recent quarters. Although this segment is unlikely to meaningfully drive card spending growth in the medium term, younger customers could emerge as high-value clients in the long run. The election of Donald Trump to the U.S. Presidency could signal an easier regulatory environment for financial players such as American Express and this could also help the company to an extent. We value AXP stock at about $255 per share, which is slightly below the current market price. See our American Express valuation for more details.

Title: Apple Nears $4 Trillion Valuation, Surges Past Nvidia, Microsoft. Here's Why

Apple is closing in on a historic $4 trillion stock market valuation, powered by investors cheering progress in the company's long-awaited AI enhancements to rejuvenate sluggish iPhone sales. The company has pulled ahead of Nvidia and Microsoft in the race to the monumental milestone, thanks to an about 16% jump in shares since early November that has added about $500 billion to its market capitalization. The latest rally in Apple shares reflects "investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence and an expectation that it will result in a supercycle of iPhone upgrades," said Tom Forte, an analyst at Maxim Group, who has a "hold" rating. Valued at about $3.85 trillion as of the last close, Apple dwarfs the combined value of Germany and Switzerland's main stock markets. The Silicon Valley firm, driven by the so-called iPhone supercycles, was the first U.S. company to hit previous trillion-dollar milestones. In recent years, the company has attracted criticism for being slow to map out its artificial intelligence strategy, while Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta Platforms have pulled ahead to dominate the emerging technology. Shares of Nvidia, the biggest AI beneficiary, have surged more than 800% over the past two years, compared to the near doubling in shares of Apple during the same period. Apple earlier in December started integrating OpenAI's ChatGPT into its devices after unveiling plans in June to integrate generative AI technology across its app suite. The company expects overall revenue to increase "low- to mid-single digits" during its fiscal first quarter - a modest growth forecast for the holiday shopping season - sparking questions about the momentum for the iPhone 16 series. However, LSEG data showed analysts expect revenue from iPhones to rebound in 2025. "Although near-term iPhone demand is still muted ... it is a function of limited Apple Intelligence features and geographic availability, and as both broaden, it will help to drive an improvement in iPhone demand," Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring said in a note, reiterating Apple as the brokerage's "top pick" heading into 2025. The recent surge in shares has pushed Apple's price-to-earnings ratio to a near three-year high of 33.5, compared to 31.3 for Microsoft and 31.7 for Nvidia, according to LSEG data. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has sold shares of Apple - its top holding - this year, as the conglomerate broadly retreated from equities on concerns over stretched valuations. "I suspect the stock in three years will not look as expensive as it does today," said Eric Clark, portfolio manager of the Rational Dynamic Brands Fund, which holds Apple shares. Apple faces the risk of retaliatory tariffs if U.S. President-elect Donald Trump delivers on his promise to slap tariffs of at least 10% on goods coming from China. "We believe it's likely Apple gets exclusions on products like iPhone, Mac and iPad, similar to the first round of China tariffs in 2018," Woodring said. Apple's shares tumbled last Wednesday amid a Wall Street selloff after the Federal Reserve forecast a slower pace of rate cuts next year but investors expect the broad trend of monetary easing to support stock markets next year. "Technology has been regarded by investors as a new form of a defensive sector because of their earnings growth," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. The Fed's action "could end up having a greater impact on some of the other cyclical areas such as consumer discretionary and financials and less so on technology." "Apple's approach to $4 trillion market cap is a testament to its enduring dominance in the tech sector. This milestone reinforces Apple's position as a market leader and innovator," said Adam Sarhan, chief executive officer of 50 Park Investments.

Title: Jim Cramer Says Ford Motor (F) Is in Trouble – Here’s Why

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Latest Calls Before 2025 Begins: Top 10 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F) stands against other stocks in Jim Cramer’s latest calls before 2025 begins. Jim Cramer in a latest program talked about the market reaction to the Federal Reserve’s latest rate cut and its guidance that suggested fewer rate cuts moving ahead. “I guess you could say the baby got thrown out with the bathwater. It was truly hideous, a little unexpected, and yes, wicked. Even though the market’s barely oversold, we may not get that quick snapback we normally expect in a deeply oversold market,” Cramer said. Jim Cramer said Jerome Powell’s comments and tone were “stern” and his conference call “confounded” investors. Cramer said inflation has not come down enough and that has made the Fed’s job difficult. Cramer then talked about different sectors and companies that need rate cuts amid a slowdown. “I really wish the Fed hadn’t been so defensive about the need to cut rates going forward. A slower approach would have been much better. If they had explicitly taken a wait-and-see approach before this meeting, we’d be in a better position. This time, they telegraphed the wrong thing, hence today’s meltdown. However, if the weaker part of the economy deteriorates further or inflation comes down, the Fed still has room to cut. Here’s the bottom line: a previously data-dependent Fed chose not to be data-dependent today with its pronouncements, and that’s what drove the market down. This happened despite the quarter-point rate cut—something that’s typically good news for stocks—but it turned out to be the very opposite.” READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we watched some latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 11 stocks he is talking about. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A Ford truck roaring down a highway, with powerful headlights blazing its way. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 36 Jim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC expressed his concerns over rising warranty costs of Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F) and said the stock does not have a lot of “MOJO.” “Ford does not have a lot of mojo in this note by Jefferies. This is one of the reasons—what can save the Fed when they cut. Ford has an inventory drifting up to 96 days. That says to me price cut, way too much, way too much. And by the way, that’s far more than GM—26. Wow. I mean, GM and Stellantis have much lower inventories.” Ford shares have gained about 10% over the past 10 years, a stark contrast to the S&P 500’s 250%. Legacy automakers like Ford are grappling with challenges from newer competitors, the shift to electric vehicles (EVs), and the rapid rise of autonomous technology. Ford’s Model e segment continues to drain cash as Ford works to strengthen its EV business. While the company has some strong products, it faces stiff competition from Tesla, Inc. (TSLA), Rivian Automotive, Inc. (RIVN), and other EV makers, leading to significant losses. Year-to-date, Ford’s EBIT has dropped to $8.1 billion, down from $9.4 billion in the same period last year. Ford’s struggle to reduce warranty costs remains a concern. The company issued 62 recalls in 2024, far surpassing General Motors Company (GM), which had 33. Since 2021, Ford has had the industry’s highest recall rate, reflecting poorly on management’s efforts to lower warranty expenses and damaging the brand’s reputation. Overall, F ranks 10th on our list of Jim Cramer’s latest calls before 2025 begins. While we acknowledge the potential of F, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than F but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Mega automobile mergerNissan and Honda have begun official merger discussions, the two companies announced on Monday. Negotiations will end June 2025. Japan-listed Honda shares were last up 13.4% on Tuesday and on track for their best day since October 2008, after the company announced plans to buy back 24% of its issued shares by Dec. 23 next year. Taiwan tops Asian marketsAs of Dec. 23, Taiwan's Taiex had gained 28.85%, making it the best-performing stock market in Asia-Pacific in 2024.

[PRO] Buffett's biggest war chestWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is currently holding $325 billion in cash — the largest amount it's hoarded in absolute terms. Cash now comprises around 30% of Berkshire's total assets, the highest proportion in 34 years, according to data from Oppenheimer. Buffett sold large quantities of Apple and Bank of America shares this year. Why is the 94-year-old legendary investor holding on to so much cash? Analysts weigh in. U.S. markets began the trading week in holiday cheer. The S&P 500 gained 0.73% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, recovering from earlier losses, ticked up 0.16%. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.98% on the back of strong performances from large tech firms such as Nvidia, Tesla and Meta Platforms. However, shares of bitcoin proxy MicroStrategy slumped 8.8% on its first day in the Nasdaq-100 index, following the cryptocurrency's price falling to below $93,000 on Monday. That said, MicroStrategy is still among the best-performing U.S. tech companies valued at $5 billion or more, according to FactSet data. Its shares have rocketed 426% so far this year, mostly thanks to the company's stockpile of bitcoins, which it started to amass in 2020. With the rally in bitcoin following Donald Trump's election victory, MicroStrategy's bitcoin holding is now worth around $42 billion. It's the basis for the company's market capitalization ballooning to $82 billion from roughly $1.1 billion from the time it began buying bitcoin in bulk. Investors looking to ride on MicroStrategy's explosive rise should remember that the company's share price is currently trading on the back of bitcoin prices. The flipside of it is that if bitcoin prices crater for any reason — volatile as cryptocurrency can be — MicroStrategy shares may stumble too. Trading is likely to be thin this week.

Title: Will Novo Nordisk (NVO) Stock Recover To $145 Levels?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/12/24/will-novo-nordisk-nvo-stock-recover-to-145-levels/

CEO Lars Fruergaard Joergensen delivers a statement during a presentation of the new production site ... [+] of Novo Nordisk "Site Odense" in Kroghs park in Odense, Denmark, on December 16, 2024. (Photo by Mads Claus Rasmussen / Ritzau Scanpix / AFP) / Denmark OUT (Photo by MADS CLAUS RASMUSSEN/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty Images) Novo Nordisk ADR (NYSE: NVO) currently trades at $89 per share, nearly 40% below its peak level of over $145 seen in June of this year. In contrast, its closest peer, Eli Lilly stock is down 15% over this period. NVO stock was trading around $55 in early June 2022, just before the U.S. Fed started increasing rates, and is now 60% above that level, compared to 45% gains for the S&P 500 during this period. This outperformance of NVO stock can be attributed to a ramp up in sales of its obesity drugs. Novo Nordisk is based out of Denmark. Notably, Denmark’s interest rates are lower than those in the U.S. As an aside, after dropping 20% the first half of the year, and then recovering, see Why Is Expedia Stock Up 24% This Year? NVO stock has struggled in the past few months. In fact, Novo was down over 20% on Friday, December 20, after the company reported underwhelming results from a late-stage clinical study for its obesity treatment – CagriSema. The trial showed that CagriSema helped patients reduce their weight by 22.7%, below the 25% Novo Nordisk was targeting. But, even before this fall, the stock was underperforming, with slower than anticipated sales growth for its obesity drugs. In fact, the company missed Q3 revenue and earnings estimates, weighing on its stock. While NVO stock has had a tough ride lately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. In this note, we capture trends in the company’s stock during the turbulent market conditions seen over 2022. It compares these trends to the stock’s performance during the 2008 recession. Timeline of Inflation Shock So Far: In contrast, here’s how NVO stock and the broader market performed during the 2007/2008 crisis. NVO stock declined from nearly $5.40 in April 2008 (pre-crisis peak for the stock) to $3.20 in early March 2009 (as the markets bottomed out), implying it lost 40% of its pre-crisis value. It recovered post the 2008 crisis to levels of around $5 in early 2010, rising about 56% between March 2009 and January 2010. The S&P 500 Index saw a decline of 51%, falling from levels of 1,540 in September 2007 to 757 in March 2009. It then rallied 48% between March 2009 and January 2010 to reach levels of 1,124. Novo Nordisk’s revenue rose over 2x from 127 billion DKK in 2020 to 271 billion DKK for the last twelve-month period. This can primarily be attributed to the success of its diabetes and obesity drugs – Wegovy and Ozempic. While Ozempic’s sales have risen 4.5x from $21.2 billion DKK in 2020 to 95.7 billion DKK in 2023, Wegovy’s sales have surged to $31.3 billion in 2023, since its launch in 2021. The company’s operating margin has also expanded from 42.6% to 43.7% over the same period. Higher revenues and margin expansion resulted in the bottom line of 21.20 DKK per share for the last twelve month period, versus 9.01 DKK per share in 2020. Novo Nordisk’s total debt increased from 10 billion DKK in 2020 to 57 billion DKK now, while its cash increased from around 13 billion DKK to 75 billion DKK over the same period. The company also garnered 118 billion DKK in cash flows from operations in the last twelve months. Novo Nordisk is a net debt positive company, and it has a sufficient cash cushion to meet its near-term obligations. While the Fed’s efforts to tame runaway inflation rates has helped market sentiments in the past, its recent hawkish outlook for 2025 is now worrying investors. We believe Novo Nordisk stock has the potential for some gains once markets finds a footing, digesting the news of fewer than anticipated rate cuts next year. Although the development around CagriSema doesn’t bode well for NVO stock, we think after a meaningful 40% correction from its recent highs, the headwinds appear to be priced in. Notably, the $123 average of analysts price estimates reflects a solid 45% upside potential from here. Admirably, NVO stock has generated better returns than the broader market in each of the last three years. Returns for the stock were 63% in 2021, 23% in 2022, and 55% in 2023. Similarly, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. While NVO stock looks like it has some room for growth, it is helpful to see how some of its peers, such as Eli Lilly, fare on metrics that matter.

Mega automobile mergerNissan and Honda have begun official merger discussions, the two companies announced on Monday. The merged group has the potential to deliver revenue of 30 trillion yen ($191.4 billion) and operating profit of more than 3 trillion yen, said Honda CEO Toshihiro Mibe. Shares of Honda popped 12.7% after Mibe's news conference. Taiwan tops Asian marketsAs of Dec. 23, Taiwan's Taiex had gained 28.85%, making it the best-performing stock market in Asia-Pacific in 2024. The Taiex's focus on tech and tech-related stocks helped supercharge its performance. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company soared 82.12% in 2024, and Foxconn — which trades as Hon Hai Precision Industry — advanced 77.51%. Positive start to holidaysU.S. markets rose on Monday on the back of a strong showing by large tech stocks. The New York Stock Exchange closes early Tuesday for Christmas Eve. Europe's regional Stoxx 600 index added 0.14%. Shares of Volkswagen lost 2% as the automaker reached a deal with striking workers on Friday, which involve cutting 35,000 jobs by 2030. UK GDP not OKThe U.K. economy failed to expand in the three months ending September, according to revised figure from the Office for National Statistics, published Monday. Previous estimates had pegged third-quarter gross domestic product at 0.1%. Earlier this month, data from the ONS showed the U.K. economy had unexpectedly contracted by 0.1% in October. [PRO] Stocks with room to grow in 2025The S&P 500 has enjoyed two successive years when it's gained more than 20%. And there are still stocks with plenty of room to grow in 2025. CNBC Pro used its stock screener tool and found companies that have at least 30% potential upside in 2025, based on consensus Wall Street price targets. U.S. markets began the trading week in holiday cheer. The S&P 500 gained 0.73% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, recovering from earlier losses, ticked up 0.16%. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.98% on the back of strong performances from large tech firms such as Nvidia, Tesla and Meta Platforms. However, shares of bitcoin proxy MicroStrategy slumped 8.8% on its first day in the Nasdaq-100 index, following the cryptocurrency's price falling to below $93,000 on Monday. That said, MicroStrategy is still among the best-performing U.S. tech companies valued at $5 billion or more, according to FactSet data. Its shares have rocketed 426% so far this year, mostly thanks to the company's stockpile of bitcoins, which it started to amass in 2020. With the rally in bitcoin following Donald Trump's election victory, MicroStrategy's bitcoin holding is now worth around $42 billion. It's the basis for the company's market capitalization ballooning to $82 billion from roughly $1.1 billion from the time it began buying bitcoin in bulk. Investors looking to ride on MicroStrategy's explosive rise should remember that the company's share price is currently trading on the back of bitcoin prices. The flipside of it is that if bitcoin prices crater for any reason — volatile as cryptocurrency can be — MicroStrategy shares may stumble too. Trading is likely to be thin this week. Markets in the U.S. will close early on Tuesday and take a break on Wednesday for Christmas Day. But light trading doesn't mean small moves in markets. "With the market's primary uptrends still intact, we are not giving up on the potential for a Santa Claus to come to Broad & Wall this year," Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Sandler, said in a note. As investors celebrate the festivities — and the S&P's 25.25% year-to-date pop — they might find an extra present underneath the tree. — CNBC's Yun Li, MacKenzie Sigalos and Ari Levy contributed to this report.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 closed higher Tuesday in thin trading ahead of the Christmas holiday, as tech stocks continued their strong start to the week. At 1:00 p.m. ET (18:00 GMT), both S&P 500 rose 1.1%, the Nasdaq 100 added 1.4%, while Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.9%, or 350 points. The New York Stock Exchange is set to close early Tuesday for Christmas Eve, and the market is shut on Christmas Day. Tech added to its strong start to the week as the so-called Mag 7 including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) climbed, though NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) traded flat. Chip stocks, which racked up stocks gains a day earlier, were marginally higher Biden after the Biden administration launched a new trade investigation into Chinese-made legacy chips, which could elad to fresh tariffs on Chinese semiconductors. American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) shares were flat recovering intraday loss Tuesday as the airline briefly grounded all flights in the U.S. due to a "technical issue." The ground stop was later lifted. Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) slipped, halting its recovery from a recent plunge that was triggered by results from a late-stage study of its weight loss drug that fell of expectations. BofA Securities stated its clients continued to buy US equities for the seventh straight week. Specifically, inflows reached $10 billion – the second-largest amount since 2008 and the biggest since January 2017. Similar to recent weeks, purchases were spread across both individual stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with stronger inflows directed toward single stocks. Large-cap stocks saw the bulk of the buying activity, while small caps experienced more subdued inflows. Institutional and retail investors increased their equity holdings for another week – the third for institutions and the second for retail clients. In contrast, hedge funds were net sellers for the second consecutive week. The rolling four-week average of inflows from institutional clients hit its highest point in nine months, reflecting a typical pattern of renewed buying activity following October’s tax-loss selling by mutual funds. “Private clients typically are big sellers in December amid tax loss selling vs. big net buyers in January. While this group has been a buyer of ETFs this month, it has sold single stocks, though slightly less so than in the average December,” BofA strategists led by Jill Carey Hall noted.

Title: Financial Market Volatility: Blame The Fed
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/12/23/financial-market-volatility-blame-the-fed/
Time Published: 2024-12-23T22:41:12Z
Full Content:
Despite the highly anticipated 25 basis point (0.25 percentage point) reduction in the Fed Funds Rate announced by the Fed on Wednesday, financial markets tanked.[1] The reason: the “dot plot,” the graph of the individual Federal Open Market Committee members’ (there are 19 of them) anticipated future rate levels showed only a half-percentage point (50 basis point) drop in the Fed Funds Rate (to 4.00%-4.25%) by the end of next year (2025).[1] At the September meeting, that “dot plot” showed a full percentage point drop (to 3.50%-3.75%). As a result, on Wednesday, stock prices tanked (the Dow off -1123 points (a -2.6% drop in one day), the S&P 500 fell -2.9%, the Nasdaq -3.6%, and the small cap Russell 2000, -4.4%). On Friday, the PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditure) Index, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, rose only +0.1% at both the headline and core levels.[6] That eased market angst and sent equity markets up by 1.4%. For the week, the major indexes were down about -2.0%, with the small-cap Russell 2000 off more than -4%. For the month of December, the Dow was off -4.6%, the S&P 500 –1.7%, the Russell 2000 -7.5%. Only Nasdaq had a positive reading (+1.8%).[7] Equity Markets On the bond side, rates rose swiftly on Wednesday. They had been rising since late September when the 10-Year Treasury was flirting with 3.6%. 10 Year Treasury Yield On Thursday (December 19th) that 10-Year T-Note closed at 4.57%, the highest yield since late May. After today’s PCE report, it has retreated slightly to 4.53%. The Nasdaq has been the market leader all year, mainly because of the performance of the Magnificent 7 stocks.[8] Magnificent 7 On Wednesday, December 11th, META hit a record high; as of the close of business on Friday, it is down -7.5% from that record high. This past Monday (December 16th), AMZN, and GOOG both hit record highs. APPL closed at a new record high on Friday, but AMZN and GOOG are off their peaks by -3.4% and -2.6% respectively. We are often asked if a market correction is near. No one knows when such an event might occur. What we do know is that, based on market history, a correction is long overdue. All the historical market metrics, like the PE ratio (at 23x) are two standard deviations above their historical norms. For the PE ratio, the historical norm is closer to 17x. Based on that, a -25% correction would just take the markets back to its historic norm.[3] The Fed revised its interest rate view significantly at its December meeting. The reason: stubborn inflation. That view likely changed again on Friday with the PCE number being so light. In the last couple of months, the disinflation that we had been seeing looked like it had stopped. The Fed, which had switched its focus from its inflation mandate to its full employment mandate, became worried that it was no longer on the path to its 2% inflation goal. On the other hand, we see a lot of market data that says the Fed has already achieved that 2% goal. Apparently, the FOMC doesn’t want to prematurely declare victory at the risk of another inflation flare-up. After all, they were burned several year ago when they said the inflation was “transitory.” The Fed’s work is actually done by the bond market. Since the CPI and PPI releases on December 11th and 12th, the 10-Year Treasury Note yield, which was 4.15% in early December, rose to 4.57% on Thursday (December 19th) with the last 20 basis points coming since the Fed meeting on Wednesday (December 18th). As of Friday (December 20th), the 10-Year Treasury closed at a yield of 4.53%.[4] The first data point here is the BLS’s benchmark revision to the employment data for the year ended March 31st. It was a staggering downward revision of -818K jobs, that’s -68K per month. That means that all those job market “beats” that has kept the equity market buoyant were actually “misses.” And it means that the labor market is much more fragile than the Fed currently thinks and is a major reason why our view is that there will be more rate cuts in 2025 than is currently embodied in the “dot plots.” If that is the case, bond yields will be much lower (bond prices much higher) than the market has currently priced in.[5] It is also quite likely that in next year’s benchmark revisions, we will see negative numbers emerge in Q2, Q3, and Q4 of 2024. The Fed was correct to have placed emphasis on their full-employment mandate in September; why they switched back to their inflation mandate is truly puzzling. Perhaps they felt that the pause in September and October’s disinflation readings was something they had to address. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) was released a week ago Wednesday (December 11th) and the PPI the next day. The headline CPI rose +0.3% in November from October’s level and is up +2.7% from a year earlier. This was a disappointment because the year/year inflation rate rose to +2.7% from +2.6% in October. While the Fed doesn’t use the CPI, per se, it does have an influence. The “core” rate of inflation (ex-food and energy) also rose +0.3% in November, and its year/year rate disappointingly held steady at a too high +3.3%. Consumer Prices (CPI) The headline Producer Price Index (PPI) also disappointed, coming in at a +0.4% in November, mostly due to a large rise in wholesale food prices. (Note that these rising food prices get translated pretty quickly to the consumer level and will likely show up in the CPI in the next month.) Markets expected only +0.2%, so the rise was double the expectation. If we take out the food prices, the rise was a tamer +0.2%, i.e., what the market expected. Note that Services prices, which has been driving the inflation lately, rose only +0.2%, the smallest gain since July. So that’s a positive. Another such positive is that Core PPI (the headline ex-food, energy, and trade services) did print +0.1% (market expected +0.2%). Producer Prices (PPI) What is so confusing about the Fed’s new attitude is that if we calculated the November CPI the way the Europeans calculate their CPI (the HICP method), November would show up as 0.0% from October, and 2.0% on the nose year/year, dead on the Fed’s inflation goal. Again, we are puzzled as to why the Fed has become so hawkish and is another reason why we believe that 2025 will have more than two rate cuts. We think there will be four to six cuts amounting to 100 to 150 basis points, bringing the Fed Funds Rate to the 3% to 3.5% range. Note that 3% is the Fed’s view of neutral – so if the economy weakens and there is a threat of Recession, the Fed will go to at least “neutral,” and most likely lower. Housing starts have continued on their downward path, falling -1.8% in November vs. October, and are down -14.6% on a year/year basis. By the way, market expectations were for a +2.6% increase for November, so the -1.8% was a big miss and was another reason for equity market volatility this past week. If we look at more detailed data, we find that while single-family starts rose +6.4% in November, that didn’t make up for the -9.1% fall in October’s starts. For the single-family area, starts are down -10.2% from a year ago.[6] The real action was in the multi-family space, down -23.2% in November from October’s pace. That’s the second lowest print since April 2020 (Covid). In addition, the pipeline shows that there were +780K new multi-family units under construction. The vacancy rate is already high, and it is likely going to continue to rise. The end result will be that the lower rents we’ve seen for the past year and a half will continue. Multifamily Units Under Construction The BLS uses lagged rents when it computes the CPI. We have noted in several blogs that rents have been falling for over a year.[7] So, now that those lagged rents that the BLS uses to compute the CPI have turned negative (such rents have a 35% weighting in the CPI), we expect to see much better inflation numbers going forward, another reason we see more rate cuts by the Fed that are currently priced in. Wage growth is also slowing. It was 3.8% year/year in November vs. 4.2% in October vs. 4.9% in September. Given that productivity growth is at 2%, that would put inflationary pressure from the wage side at 1.8% (that’s the 3.8% wage growth minus 2.0% productivity). That’s right in the Fed’s wheelhouse, and another reason we see more than two rate cuts in 2025. Another indicator of a softening economy is Industrial Production. It was off -0.1% in November and is down -0.9% year/year. Industrial Production has flatlined for the past year and a half and it is clear that manufacturing in the U.S. is in Recession. The only components that show any signs of life are in the tech area. Industrial Production The NY Fed’s Services Index showed up as -5.2 in December after a -0.5 print in November and has been negative for three months in a row. In the employment arena, initial claims for unemployment insurance are up and the average duration of unemployment (time between jobs) is the highest since Covid. Clearly new hiring has slowed. Yet another reason for rate reductions. Retail Sales were up a hefty +0.7% in November. The consumer is being fueled by asset growth, i.e., the stock market. According to Rosenberg Research, asset growth on consumer balance sheets was up $5 trillion in Q3 alone and it is up +10.4% from a year ago. Meanwhile, consumer liabilities have risen by a mere 3.4%. Consumer incomes have been rising too, but not nearly as much, growing at 1/8th the pace of financial assets. It appears that it is the financial asset growth that has been supporting consumption. In fact, we’ve seen a -127 billion annual rate savings drawdown in Q3, and Rosenberg notes that savings growth has been negative in four of the last five quarters. One other point: Throughout the Q3 earnings reports, the large retailers unanimously reported that the consumer is revolting against high prices. We’re not talking about the current rate of inflation, but about past inflation that has raised prices to their current high level. The consumer is looking for cheaper alternatives or is foregoing consumption altogether. Even in the buoyant Retail Sales numbers, note that November Restaurant Sales were down -0.4% vs. October, sales at the Grocery chains were off -0.2%, sales of apparel fell -0.2% (unusual for the holiday season), and Department Store sales were off -0.1%. The Fed has scared both the bond market (rates rising) and the equity market. The equity downtrend, currently in the -3% range for the week (higher for small caps) – it’s only a couple days old. Whether it becomes a trend is another issue. Markets clearly did not like the Fed’s move back to inflation fighter mode, as it is clear that disinflation will continue. The CPI and PPI disappointed for November, are the likely cause of the Fed’s return to its inflation mandate, and have contributed to the recent rise in interest rates. The main contributor to higher rates was the Fed itself as it moved away from its employment mandate and back to being the inflation doctor. It now forecasts only two rate cuts of 25 basis points each in 2025, down from four at its November meeting. Rents have been falling for more than a year and that is now set to put downward pressure on the inflation indexes, especially the CPI where rents have a 35% weight in the index. The industrial sector continues to slow and is clearly in Recession. And the unemployment data and jobs market in general are starting to cause angst. The consumer continues to spend, and it appears this has been driven by asset growth (rising stock prices) on consumer balance sheets. A long overdue stock market correction will definitely slow consumption and GDP growth. There are signs that the consumer is revolting against high prices.

Title: Where I Plan To Buy Nvidia Stock Next
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethkindig/2024/12/23/where-i-plan-to-buy-nvidia-stock-next/

Blackwell is the word for Nvidia as the AI leader heads into 2025, with multiple configurations and a mid-year upgrade (B300/GB300) for its new powerful GPU set to ramp significantly over the next few quarters. As recapped to the I/O Fund’s premium members after its Q3 earnings report, the I/O Fund is tracking multiple supply chain signals indicating Blackwell sales will likely far exceed the GPU sales we saw in 2023 and 2024 combined – to the tune of bringing Nvidia to $200 billion in data center revenue. Analysts are already increasing their forecasts for Blackwell shipments for Q4 and for Q1, with forecasts for 250,000 to 300,000 shipments in Q4 nearly tripling to 750,000 to 800,000 in Q1. This compares to previous views seeing Q4 shipments of 150,000 to 200,000 ramping to 550,000 in Q1. This suggests Blackwell revenue estimates for Q1 are already moving 40-60% higher, potentially driving positive revenue revisions throughout the year as it becomes Nvidia’s primary GPU product. SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA - MAY 30: An exterior view of the NVIDIA headquarters on May 30, 2023 in ... [+] Santa Clara, California. Chipmaker NVIDIA reached a $1 trillion market cap at the open bell of the NYSE on Tuesday morning. The company is forecasting second quarter sales of $11 billion, 50 percent higher than analyst estimates of $7.15 billion. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Nvidia has tailwinds in 2025 from increased pricing power with Blackwell, output and shipment estimates already rising before the ramp begins, AI capex still quickly growing, and GPU clusters starting in the 100K range where Hopper maxed out, even as competition from AMD, Broadcom and others begins to increase. Nvidia also has the benefit from the end of its fiscal year early next year, with the Street soon looking to 2026 numbers – which very well could be too low given the signals Blackwell is already giving. At the moment, Nvidia is trading at just 30x 2026’s estimated earnings of $4.43, its cheapest bottom line valuation since shares were $95 in May 2024 – and Blackwell still holds the potential to drive quarterly revenue beats the same way Hopper has and with margins returning to Hopper’s highs. The bigger picture for Nvidia moving forward is that Blackwell holds the potential to dwarf Hopper, and the I/O plans on keeping its members informed on what it sees ahead for Nvidia with frequent updates for members. With that in mind, here’s what the I/O Fund sees as 2024 ends and 2025 begins. Nvidia appears to be setting up for the next swing higher. As long as any further weakness holds over $116, this move should target between $165 - $173, with the potential to reach as high as $193. If this swing gets confirmed, it would likely be the final 5th wave in the historic uptrend that started in October of 2022. This does not mean that the technicals do not support significantly higher prices, it only means that Nvidia will first have to deal with a notable correction in both price and time before it sees those levels. The pattern off the October 2022 low developed as a classic 5 wave pattern. In early 2024 price went vertical. This was accompanied with max volume and peak momentum. This is the standard pattern seen in 3rd waves, and it tends to be the most powerful part of a 5 wave pattern. From the perspective of sentiment, this is the part of the trend where everyone realizes at once the direction of the trend. Shorts cover at the same time as the crowd buys, creating that standard pattern in 3rd waves. This would mean that the correction in June of 2024 was the 4th wave, and that this is likely in the final 5th wave higher. The sentiment pattern in 5th waves to new highs in price, but on lower momentum and lower volume, which is what is happening now. Nvidia appears to be setting up for the next swing higher. Zooming into the 4th wave correction that started in June of 2024 offers a better idea of the two potential paths that I am currently tracking. Zooming into the 4th wave correction that started in June of 2024 gives a better idea of the two ... [+] potential paths that I am currently tracking. · Blue – The final 5th wave is playing out as an ending diagonal pattern, which is common for 5th waves. This type of pattern is a 5 wave pattern in itself that is characterized with large swings in both directions. Our target zone for the bottom on this 4th wave is $126 - $116. If Nvidia can push over $140.75, then then odds favor this scenario. · Red – Nvidia is in a much more complex 4th wave. If this is playing out, NVDA would see the $116 level break, which opens the door to a potential low at $101, $90, or $78. One final point worth mentioning is how the broad semiconductor sector is performing in relation to the S&P 500. Semiconductors tend to be much more sensitive to the consumer, and economy than most sectors. For this reason, in periods of economic expansion, semiconductors tend to lead, outperforming the broad market. However, when this sector starts to move against the broad market, it tends to be a warning that volatility is ahead. In fact, every time that the semiconductor sector has made a lower high while the broad market made a higher high – i.e., semiconductors do not confirm the move higher – this preceded some period of volatility since the 2021 top. When semiconductors start to move against the broad market, it tends to be a warning that volatility ... [+] is ahead. This pattern can be seen going back to 2000 and consistently warned of weakness. As of now, this is one of the largest and longest periods of divergence between the semiconductor sector and the broad market on record. If the broader semiconductor sector stays below its July 2024 high, I would consider this a warning. This does not mean that I do not see potential upside, it only means that any long positions the I/O Fund takes will have strict targets at which we take gains and stops to protect us in case the market turns against us. Make no mistake, Nvidia is the best stock of the decade and it’s only four years in. The I/O Fund has an aggressive buy plan at key levels should the stock pull back, and we have a backup plan should the stock overcome the peer pressure we are seeing from the semiconductor industry and meaningfully breakout. Nvidia has been our largest position for the last 4 years. The I/O Fund sent out nine buy alerts to our readers to buy this position below $20 in 2021 – 2022. The I/O Fund believes the future is bright for Nvidia, and believe the potential next swing is worth playing. However, with all the warning signs, any new long position will have strict risk controls until these warnings reset. The I/O Fund is also closely analyzing the supply chain to identify overlooked beneficiaries of the AI infrastructure buildout, sharing this information as well as potential buy and sell plans and real time trade alerts with premium members. The I/O Fund recently entered two separate beneficiaries for gains of 23% and 17% since November. Learn more here.

Title: William O’Neil + Co. Investment Themes For 2025
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/randywatts/2024/12/23/william-oneil--co-investment-themes-for-2025/
Time Published: 2024-12-23T19:54:46Z
Full Content:
2024 by any measure has been an extremely rewarding year for U.S. stock investors. Also, it has been a year dominated with big investment themes including Artificial Intelligence (AI), the growing demand for electrical power in the U.S., the reassertion of Bitcoin and Crypto, the increasing usage of GLP-1 drugs and the rebuilding of U.S. infrastructure. As the year comes to an end, we want to look ahead to some of the possible major investment themes for 2025. These themes are from the research work by William O’Neil + Co.’s experienced equity analysts. Some of the themes are new and others are continuations of trends we saw in 2024. Themes: 1) Artificial Intelligence (AIQ) 2) Industrials: AI-Driven Demand for Data Center Infrastructure (DTCR) Key Stocks: 3) Energy - Rising Electricity Demand, Nuclear/Gas Demand to power Data Centers (RBLD) 4) Consumer - Selective Shoppers (PEJ) While inflation is easing, prices remain well above pre-pandemic levels and are likely to stay high or even increase under a potential second Trump Administration. As a result, U.S. shoppers are expected to maintain a selective spending approach focusing on purchases when they find the right products at reasonable prices. This selective spending behavior has created a clear divide between winners and losers in the consumer and retail space. Brands that resonate strongly with households earning over $100,000 continue to thrive. For instance, 75% of Walmart's market share gains last quarter came from households earning more than $100,000, contributing significantly to Walmart's stock performance in 2024. Other brands like Carvana, Cava, Sweetgreen, Sprouts, Warby Parker, On Holding, Royal Caribbean, and SharkNinja have emerged as leaders in their respective categories. Conversely, brands targeting lower-income consumers, such as Dollar Tree, Dollar General, and Savers, have struggled. Similarly, brands like Nike and Lululemon, which have failed to captivate consumers due to a lack of innovation, have also lagged. 5) Internet - Video Ad Monetization (PNQI) Over the past two years, video streamers have introduced ad-supported tiers to capitalize on the shift in viewership and align with the growing migration of ad dollars to their platforms. As these platforms begin to scale in 2025, they are set to capture a larger share of ad spend. In 2019, linear TV captured 75% of U.S. video ad spend, with digital (including CTV) at 25%. By 2027, digital video ad spending is expected to surpass linear TV, presenting a $50B opportunity for CTV streaming to capitalize on linear TV’s decline. Additionally, the shifting of live sports rights to streaming will accelerate ad dollar migration. Among streamers, Netflix (NFLX), the only profitable pure-play platform, is a major beneficiary of cord cutting. Its advertising expansion emphasizes profitability over subscriber growth. Competitors like Disney (DIS), Warner Bros Discovery (WBD), and Paramount (PARA) are also prioritizing streaming profitability alongside subscriber growth. Pure-play digital video (e.g., social and short-form video) represents 8% of the ad market, with an 18% CAGR since 2019. It is projected to grow at a high-single-digit CAGR through 2028, benefiting platforms like Meta’s Reels (META) and Alphabet’s YouTube Shorts (GOOGL). Spotify’s (SPOT) venture into video is also noteworthy. Programmatic ad players like The Trade Desk (TTD) and Magnite (MGNI) will benefit from increased video ad inventory across the digital and CTV landscape. In conclusion, while 2024 was an exciting and profitable year, William O’Neil + Co. believes 2025 can be as well. As such, we want to identify both themes from last year that can continue to perform in the new year as well as newly emerging themes that have a chance to produce large returns.

Programmatic ad players like The Trade Desk (TTD) and Magnite (MGNI) will benefit from increased video ad inventory across the digital and CTV landscape.

Title: Global markets quiet at start of Christmas festivities

Time Published: 2024-12-23T17:57:26Z

Global markets were quiet on Monday at the start of a holiday-shortened week. After a solid run since the November presidential election, Wall Street’s rally hit a bump this month, especially after the US Federal Reserve forecast just two 0.25 per cent rate reductions for 2025 – down from its September view of four cuts – and raised its annual inflation outlook. The Iseq closed down 0.18 per cent on Monday. AIB was up 1.55 per cent finishing at €5.24. Bank of Ireland dropped 0.16 per cent to €8.65. Ryanair fell 0.80 per cent to €19.10. Dalata Hotels was up 1.09 per cent to €4.63. Food supplier Kerry Group fell 0.11 per cent to €91.90 a share. Glanbia was up 0.52 per cent to €13.47. Shares in Kingspan decreased by 0.79 per cent to €69.45. Home builders Cairn Homes fell by 0.85 per cent to €2.33. Glenveagh Properties rose by 0.13 per cent to €1.59 a share. The export-oriented FTSE 100 was up 0.2 per cent after logging its worst week in more than a year on Friday. The domestically focused FTSE 250 was down 0.2 per cent. AstraZeneca rose 1.6 per cent after its lung-cancer drug was approved in the European Union, helping pharma and biotech shares lead sectoral gains with a 1.2 per cent rise. Energy companies were up 0.6 per cent after last week’s lower-than-expected U.S. inflation reading stabilised oil prices. On the flip side, industrial support services led losses with a 0.8 per cent decline. Meanwhile, official figures showed Britain’s economy failed to grow during the first three months of Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s new government, adding to signs of a slowdown that has cast a shadow over his time in office so far. Among individual stocks, Direct Line rose 3.8 per cent to the top of the mid-cap index after insurer Aviva agreed to buy the smaller rival in a 3.7 billion pound (€4.46 billion) cash-and-stock deal. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index ended the session 0.1 per cent higher. Healthcare stocks outperformed as Novo rallied, recovering from the previous session when it hit levels not seen since August 2023. European government bonds fell after European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde said policymakers remain alert to lingering price pressures in the services sector, while confident the central bank is nearing its consumer-price target. The euro-area economy will pick up less momentum next year than previously foreseen and only expand slightly more strongly than in 2024, according to a Bloomberg survey. The predictions are more downbeat than those of the ECB, which also lowered its outlook this month as it cut interest rates for the fourth time since June. The S&P 500 and the Dow fell on Monday in holiday-thinned trading after a stopgap government funding bill averted a US government shutdown and investors braced for a slower pace of rate cuts from the Federal Reserve next year. A cooler-than-expected inflation report on Friday helped U.S. stocks recoup some losses. However, overall market sentiment was still cautious, said Thierry Wizman, strategist at Macquarie. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.27 per cent, to buoyed by gains in chipmakers and megacap stocks. Nvidia added 1.6 per cent and Meta Platforms rose 1.4 per cent. Apple’s market capitalisation stood at $3.84 trillion (€3.69 trillion) as the world’s most valuable company inched closer to the $4 trillion (€3.8 trillion) milestone. Qualcomm’s shares rose 1.7 per cent after a jury found its central processors are properly licensed under an agreement with UK-based Arm Holdings. Shares of Arm, which has vowed to seek a fresh trial, fell about 5 per cent. Walmart fell 3.3 per cent after the U.S. consumer finance watchdog accused the retail giant and workforce payments company Branch Messenger of forcing more than a million delivery drivers into using accounts that cost them more than $10 million (€9.6 million) in junk fees. Eli Lilly gained 1.7 per cent after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the drugmaker’s weight-loss treatment, Zepbound, for obstructive sleep apnoea. Shares of sleep apnoea device makers ResMed and Inspire Medical fell about 4 per cent each.

Title: Party City to close all stores in bankruptcy
URL: https://www.retaildive.com/news/party-city-chapter-11-bankruptcy-close-stores-liquidation/736219/
Time Published: 2024-12-23T16:59:00Z
Full Content:
Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. About 14 months after emerging from Chapter 11, the retailer finds itself in bankruptcy court once again. This time, it’s liquidating. Party City, once a leader in the celebrations space, is going out of business. The company in October 2023 emerged from bankruptcy, shedding nearly $1 billion in debt. Then-CEO Brad Weston commented on the “bright future that lies ahead for PCHI.” After exiting bankruptcy, the company took efforts aimed at creating a more efficient and profitable business, including optimizing its inventory, initiating layoffs, updating its retail pricing methodology and exiting its manufacturing business to instead focus on retail and wholesale. In the 14 months since emerging from bankruptcy, however, Party City was faced with industry-wide challenges, including inflation, a pullback in discretionary spending, shifting consumer preferences and contracting margins, Deborah Rieger-Paganis, Party City chief restructuring officer and AlixPartners managing director, said in court documents Sunday. Party City has faced competition as specialty pop-up stores like Spirit Halloween have expanded and mass merchants like Target and Amazon have increased their party offerings, according to GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders. “While Party City previously pulled itself out of bankruptcy the first time around, its continued failure was likely inevitable,” he said by email. “A downswing in demand for party products has continued to put pressure on the business. Much of this is down to two factors: increased competition and a more constrained consumer.” Despite efforts taken by the company to reposition it for long-term growth, sales and store traffic took a significant hit in the last year. Between July 2023 and July 2024, Party City’s comparative store sales fell 9.5%, while sales in its consumer products division declined 24.8%. As of Saturday, the company had about $400 million in debt obligations. The company in September this year sought out ways to raise additional capital, but those efforts came up short, forcing the company to pivot to liquidation. “Like many retailers, we’ve been operating in an immensely challenging environment with inflationary pressures on both costs and consumer spending, and while we did everything we could to navigate these headwinds, our very best efforts were ultimately not enough to overcome these challenges,” Party City wrote in a statement on its website. Rieger-Paganis called the timing of the going-out-of-business sales “unfortunate” ahead of the holidays, but “essential” in order “to capture the benefit for all stakeholders of the Christmas and New Year’s selling seasons.” The company also said that it’s keeping on more than 95% of its 12,000 employees for an unspecified amount of time to help with the wind-down process.

It hasn't been a great kickoff for the newest members of the Nasdaq 100 Index. Shares of Palantir Technologies (PLTR), MicroStrategy (MSTR), and Axon Enterprise (AXON) all began the session trading lower on their first day of being included in the prestigious index. The Nasdaq said on Dec. 13 that the three would be part of its index before today's opening bell as part of its annual reconstitution. Also weighing on MicroStrategy shares was the company's update on a stock sale it announced Oct. 30, aimed at raising up to $21 billion, and a new bitcoin (BTC) purchase. It noted in a regulatory filing that between Dec. 16-22, it had sold about 1.3 million shares, valued at $561 million. MicroStrategy added that approximately $7.08 billion of shares remained available for purchase. The largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency also reported that from Dec. 16-22, it had paid the same amount to acquire an additional 5,262 bitcoins. The average price was $106,662, close to the cryptocurrency's all-time high. MicroStrategy explained that as of Sunday, it owned 444,262 BTC. Despite today's selloff, shares of Palantir Technologies and MicroStrategy have skyrocketed 360% and 445%, respectively, this year, while Axon Enterprise shares have jumped 140%. TradingView

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Stephen Yiu, portfolio manager of the Blue Whale Growth Fund, predicts Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) will thrive in 2025 as the next Nvidia'. As Big Tech cuts dependency on a single supplier for artificial intelligence chips, Broadcom stands to gain immensely.Yiu pointed out that although firms like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) have invested heavily in Nvidia's (NVDA) graphics processing units, they are now creating proprietary AI chips to diversify vendors. "Broadcom is not Nvidia, but we would expect Broadcom to be the next Nvidia in terms of outperformance potential," Yiu said during Wednesday's Pro Talks on CNBC, stressing Broadcom's close relationship with big tech businesses.Driven by Broadcom's AI revenue growth of over 200% to $12.2 billion in 2024, its shares have surged upwards of 126% year-to-date and its market capitalization passed $1 trillion. Under the direction of CEO Hock Tan, the company is developing bespoke artificial intelligence processors for three main cloud computing customersidentified by analysts as Meta, Alphabet, and ByteDance. By 2027 each is planned to have one million AI chips in clusters.Still among the top 10 holdings of the Blue Whale Growth Fund, Broadcom shows hope for future expansion in the evolving artificial intelligence scene.

While a ban would likely prove positive for engagement on other social media platforms offered by Meta and Alphabet, we still like those Club names even if TikTok successfully challenges the ban. 6. The Financial Times reported that Meta Platforms is looking to add displays to its line of smart glasses, possibly as soon as next year. 7. Honda and Nissan officially began merger talks, with the two signing a memorandum of understanding to consider a business integration. A second memorandum of understanding was also signed that offers Nissan's strategic partner Mitsubishi the chance to join the new company. 8. Xerox will acquire Lexmark, a Chinese-owned printer and printing software maker, in a $1.5 billion deal expected to close in the second half of 2025. 9. A U.S. federal court jury sided with Qualcomm in its chips trial against Arm Holdings, Reuters reported. The jury found that Qualcomm did not breach its licensing agreements with Arm. 10. Two Club stocks received price target bumps. Citi raised BlackRock to $1,200 from $1,150, noting that the company remains its favorite pick among traditional asset managers. Loop Capital raised Microsoft's PT to $550 from $500.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Stocks were mixed on Monday as investors considered the path of interest rates next year after the Fed hinted they would stay higher for longer. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 0.2% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) erased early session gains to hug the flatline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped more than 250 points, or 0.6%. Wall Street is coming off an upbeat Friday but a downbeat — and volatile — week, with all three major averages up above 1% Friday but down around 2% for the week. The Fed is playing the part of the Grinch, signaling that it would step back its pace of cutting next year, leading stocks to one of the worst days of the year on Wednesday. On Friday, however, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, showed further cooling on the inflation front — if still some stickiness. Still, the lone dissenter of the Fed's move to cut last week said she voted against cutting rates because "there is more work to do on inflation." For now, according to the CME FedWatch tool, investors are betting on the Fed holding rates steady next month. For its subsequent meeting in March, bets are about 50-50 on a cut vs. a hold. But this week's light schedule will provide a bit of a breather and a chance for Wall Street to digest and reflect heading into 2025. Markets will close at 1 p.m. ET on Tuesday, followed by Wednesday's Christmas holiday. Consumer Confidence expectations fell in December to 104.7, versus estimates for 113.2. The reading came in below all 47 estimates, which ranged from 109.3 to 116.00 across 47 estimates, according to Bloomberg data. Stocks opened mixed to kick off a short trading week as investors assess how the Federal Reserve will handle its interest rate policy next year. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose slightly while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) gained 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell about 0.4%. Consumer Discretionary stocks (XLY) gained while Financials (XLF) and Real Estate (XLRE) lagged in early trading. Individual movers included AI heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA), up more than 1% and 2%, respectively. Wall Street is coming off a volatile a volatile week after Fed chair Jerome Powell hinted the central bank will scale back its pace of interest rate cuts next year.

Hit your long-term targets. Earn up to 16% per year on digital assets. Share this article MicroStrategy (MSTR), along with Palantir Technologies (PLTR) and Axon Enterprise (AXON), is officially part of the Nasdaq-100 index ahead of market opening on December 23, according to data from Nasdaq. The three companies will replace Illumina Inc. (ILMN), Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI), and Moderna Inc. (MRNA). As of the latest data, MSTR entered at the 52th position, accounting for about 0.42% of the total market capitalization of all companies in the index, according to data tracked by Slickcharts. The addition comes as part of the Nasdaq-100’s annual reconstitution. MicroStrategy, with a market capitalization of $88.6 billion according to Yahoo Finance data, joins the index of the 100 largest non-financial securities listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart previously predicted that the inclusion could lead to an influx of around $2.1 billion in buying activity from ETFs that track the Nasdaq-100. The company’s stock has surged approximately 476% this year, with shares gaining momentum alongside Bitcoin’s price movements. MSTR stock reached a record high of around $473 on November 20, when Bitcoin traded above $92,000. The inclusion in the Nasdaq-100 will require index-tracking funds, including the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), to purchase MicroStrategy shares. This gives QQQ investors indirect exposure to MicroStrategy and its Bitcoin holdings. MSTR shares jumped 11.5% to close at $364 last Friday, rallying with the broader US stock market and offsetting what had been shaping up as a tough week, according to Yahoo Finance. Global markets were shaken by hawkish signals from the Federal Reserve. Bitcoin briefly dipped below $93,000 on Friday before recovering to above $96,000, per TradingView. Despite Friday’s gains, the major indices still closed the week down. The S&P 500 fell about 2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average roughly 2.3%, and the Nasdaq Composite around 1.8%. According to a Nasdaq report, while index inclusion typically leads to increased demand and higher valuations, particularly in the short term, the expected benefits are often priced in upon announcement rather than the actual inclusion date.

Title: Nvidia stock is in a 'soul-searching' moment

Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you find your favorite podcasts. Investors’ voracious appetite for all things Nvidia (NVDA) might have cooled slightly of late, but the chill is temporary and the feast itself has only just begun, according to one Wall Street semiconductor analyst. “I think some of these [issues] are growing pains,” Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi during an episode of Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above, listen below). Shares of the market darling and Dow Jones Industrial Average component are down 5.72% in the past month. The Dow is down modestly in the past month, while the S&P 500 has tacked on a 0.5% gain. Added Arya, “Look at any of these large magnificent whatever stocks. Each one of them has gone through this soul-searching moment periodically.” That soul searching for Nvidia's stock, according to Arya, is related to several factors, including execution issues while trying to push through leading innovation and concerns around China exposure ahead of potential tariffs from returning president Trump. “Some of these are company-specific forces,” Arya said of the issues, “and some of these are market forces.” The switch to Nvidia's touted AI chip Blackwell hasn't been a seamless one, Arya explained, which has unnerved the bulls. “The last two quarters have not been clean because they are going through the growing pains from one generation of product to a new generation,” said Arya. Read more: Why Nvidia's Blackwell won the 2024 Yahoo Finance Product of the Year award Blackwell, which was rolled out in March at the company's annual GPU conference, was hailed as Nvidia’s most powerful and innovative offering. But bringing the completed idea in the form of a product to the masses has proven itself to be more difficult. “Since [March], what we have seen is execution issues keeping it out of the hands of customers,” he said. Nvidia’s issues with mask and system-level configurations may be resolved, but “now we have a period of two quarters where it is very unlike Nvidia to have these question marks and where estimates have not gone up the way they were supposed to,” said Arya. Still, there is plenty of upside to Nvidia's stock long term, contends Arya. Wall Street more broadly would agree — Yahoo Finance data shows 94% of sell-side analysts rate Nvidia's stock at a Buy or Strong Buy. All eyes remain on the company as it makes more strides toward unleashing Blackwell into a market that is hungry for its offerings. Arya believes that Blackwell will rack up billions in sales in 2025. The stock could also see a near-term catalyst as Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang takes the stage as a keynote speaker at CES 2025. From there, “some of these gross margin issues will start resolving by the time the product is shipped for a quarter or two,” said Arya. Once they scale, “they are able to absorb a lot of those upfront costs.” When Blackwell rolls out, it is also expected to boost generative AI to help us go to the next generation, “more easily monetized,” said Arya, who cautions against thinking Nvidia is at its peak now. “It’s like saying the Apple App Store does not work before the App Store has even come on the phone,” he said.

Title: The AI smartphones that never materialized in 2024

Time Published: 2024-12-23T13:59:50Z

By Allison Johnson, a reviewer with 10 years of experience writing about consumer tech. She has a special interest in mobile photography and telecom. Previously, she worked at DPReview. I’ve spent the past year covering every major phone launch in the US, and each one loudly declared the same thing: AI is here, and ours is the AI phone you’ve been waiting for. Each was followed by much applause and favorable stock price movement. But when I got those phones into my hands, the AI was underwhelming, to say the least. The theory is that smartphones as we know them are evolving into something new: AI smartphones. An AI smartphone will be a new kind of device that doesn’t force you to interact with a grid of apps all day long; you’ll be able to ask it to order pizza or send an email just by using an AI-imbued voice assistant. You’ll be able to point your camera at a flyer for a show, have the AI check whether you’re free, and add it to your calendar. You’ll ask it about something a friend said to you — maybe in an email or a text, you’re not sure which — and it will go find the information for you. Personally, all of the above sounds great to me. I’d love some help with the chores I carry out a hundred times a day on my phone — and with the firehose of incoming information and notifications I deal with. But AI smartphones are not here yet, not by a long shot, despite what you may have heard. Instead, what we have feels like a collection of loosely associated tech demos. Right now, AI on your phone can help you write and rewrite an email to sound more professional or react to a text with a disco pigeon emoji. There’s AI to translate phone calls, which kind of works and is actually pretty neat. And there’s AI that can turn a nice picture of food into something horrifying. AI on our phones has offered one weird trick after another: sometimes funny, sometimes interesting, but hardly the platform shift we’ve been promised. All of the major phone makers are at fault. Samsung opened the year with its Galaxy S24 launch in January, declaring “Galaxy AI is here” at a hockey arena-appropriate volume. To be sure, the devices it announced are good smartphones, and they run a blend of Samsung and Google’s Gemini Nano models on-device, but I wouldn’t call them AI smartphones. Supposedly, they can help you take distractions out of your photos — but you might end up with something even more distracting instead. The live language interpreter feature for phone calls could come in handy for something like making a dinner reservation. But it also translated a statement from my colleague as “I am eating my chair.” (She was not.) Most users will find that these AI features fade into the background once the novelty wears off. Later in 2024, fall hardware season arrived early with AI-ified Pixels. Google has made much of AI on its phones for the past couple of years, but the company’s Gemini AI is absolutely everywhere on the Pixel 9 series. There’s an AI-generated summary at the top of the weather app, a new app that saves and tags your screenshots using AI, a new AI-powered default assistant, and lots of AI image generation tools — from silly to seriously worrying. Some of it does feel useful, particularly the screenshots app, which is the kind of thing you might find handy if you tend to keep infinite Chrome tabs open on your phone as bookmarks. But these features, siloed into their respective apps, don’t feel like they have much to do with each other. Gemini sort of connects the dots with extensions, but support for different apps is being added slowly — and even with an extension, Gemini can only do so much for you. Last but not least, we met the iPhones “built for Apple Intelligence” in September. I think it says a lot about the state of Apple’s AI that the iPhone 16 initially shipped without Apple Intelligence. AI features finally arrived in late October with iOS 18.1. And if anyone was waiting with bated breath, this first update was probably underwhelming. Right now, Apple Intelligence includes summaries for notifications and emails, tools to alter the style of your writing, and a new glowing UI for Siri. Notification summaries can be useful, but usually they’re just funny. The writing tools are standard fare at this point, and Siri is basically the same old assistant with a new coat of paint. There’s more to come, but what’s here now certainly doesn’t add up to an AI smartphone. It’s not just phones; this is a messy moment for AI in general. Depending on who you ask, AI is either a massive bubble that’s about to burst or a few months away from evolving into digital God. AI is being foisted on us in every direction: surfacing in Google search results, lurking in every Meta product, greeting you by name in the Spotify app. It’s hard to separate the signal from the noise when it comes to AI, because the noise is everywhere and it’s so goddamn loud! And there really might be a signal in there — especially when it comes to our phones. Siri really might become more useful, with an Apple Intelligence update this spring that will allow it to take action in apps through something known as App Intents. Developers will be able to surface certain actions — like ordering the pizza that AI proponents keep promising — so they’re accessible at the system level by Siri. Google seems to be preparing a similar framework in Android 16, which could help bridge the gap between Gemini and individual apps without the apps needing an entire extension. And who knows? Maybe Bixby will get in the game, too. The trouble is, after a full year of supposedly game-changing AI on our mobile devices that amounted to nothing, it’s starting to sound like the phone makers are crying wolf. The real AI smartphones need to stand up pretty soon — before our collective patience starts to run out.

By Shashwat Chauhan and Medha Singh (Reuters) -Apple is closing in on a historic $4 trillion stock market valuation, powered by investors cheering progress in the company's long-awaited AI enhancements to rejuvenate sluggish iPhone sales. The company has pulled ahead of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in the race to the monumental milestone, thanks to an about 16% jump in shares since early November that has added about $500 billion to its market capitalization. The latest rally in Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) reflects "investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence and an expectation that it will result in a supercycle of iPhone upgrades," said Tom Forte, an analyst at Maxim Group, who has a "hold" rating. Valued at about $3.85 trillion as of the last close, Apple dwarfs the combined value of Germany and Switzerland's main stock markets. The Silicon Valley firm, driven by the so-called iPhone supercycles, was the first U.S. company to hit previous trillion-dollar milestones. In recent years, the company has attracted criticism for being slow to map out its artificial intelligence strategy, while Microsoft, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) have pulled ahead to dominate the emerging technology. Shares of Nvidia, the biggest AI beneficiary, have surged more than 800% over the past two years, compared to the near doubling in shares of Apple during the same period. Apple earlier in December started integrating OpenAI's ChatGPT into its devices after unveiling plans in June to integrate generative AI technology across its app suite. The company expects overall revenue to increase "low- to mid-single digits" during its fiscal first quarter - a modest growth forecast for the holiday shopping season - sparking questions about the momentum for the iPhone 16 series. However, LSEG data showed analysts expect revenue from iPhones to rebound in 2025. "Although near-term iPhone demand is still muted ... it is a function of limited Apple Intelligence features and geographic availability, and as both broaden, it will help to drive an improvement in iPhone demand," Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) analyst Erik Woodring said in a note, reiterating Apple as the brokerage's "top pick" heading into 2025. The recent surge in shares has pushed Apple's price-to-earnings ratio to a near three-year high of 33.5, compared to 31.3 for Microsoft and 31.7 for Nvidia, according to LSEG data. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) has sold shares of Apple - its top holding - this year, as the conglomerate broadly retreated from equities on concerns over stretched valuations. "I suspect the stock in three years will not look as expensive as it does today," said Eric Clark, portfolio manager of the Rational (LON:0FRJ) Dynamic Brands Fund, which holds Apple shares. Apple faces the risk of retaliatory tariffs if U.S. President-elect Donald Trump delivers on his promise to slap tariffs of at least 10% on goods coming from China. "We believe it's likely Apple gets exclusions on products like iPhone, Mac and iPad, similar to the first round of China tariffs in 2018," Woodring said. Apple's shares tumbled last Wednesday amid a Wall Street selloff after the Federal Reserve forecast a slower pace of rate cuts next year but investors expect the broad trend of monetary easing to support stock markets next year. "Technology has been regarded by investors as a new form of a defensive sector because of their earnings growth," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. The Fed's action "could end up having a greater impact on some of the other cyclical areas such as consumer discretionary and financials and less so on technology." "Apple's approach to $4 trillion market cap is a testament to its enduring dominance in the tech sector. This milestone reinforces Apple's position as a market leader and innovator," said Adam Sarhan, chief executive officer of 50 Park Investments.

This year we've got Niko Partners' Lisa Cosmas Hanson, Midia Research's Rhys Elliott, Kantan Games' Dr. Serkan Toto, Ampere Analysis' Piers Harding-Rolls and Newzoo's Emmanuel (Manu) Rosier. As always, thanks to all our panelists for taking part in this tradition. Nintendo Switch 2 will take center stage Incorrect. The Nintendo Switch 2 has been prominent in rumor discussions rather than taking center stage officially. End of the live service domination and market saturation Partially correct. While older live service titles continue to dominate, newer entries in the space have seen mixed success, with some achieving short-lived popularity and others failing to gain traction. The industry is not fully transitioning back to premium games, but there is growing acknowledgment that the sheer volume of live service offerings exceeds players' available time. Many players appreciate taking breaks from their 'lifestyle' games to enjoy more finite, complete gaming experiences. Nostalgia takes a key role in live service titles Spot on. As major live service games reach new lifecycle milestones, there's a rising interest in revisiting the origins of these games, with players embracing 'vanilla' versions of their favourites. This mirrors the trend in single-player games with remasters and remakes driven by nostalgia. Xbox's strategic move into mobile Partially correct. Microsoft is ready to launch the Xbox app on Android but cannot until an antitrust ruling in the United States comes into force. "Without groundbreaking innovations, consumers may see little reason to upgrade to Nintendo Switch 2" The onslaught of open-world Souls-like games Incorrect. While expansions like Shadow of the Erdtree for Elden Ring and releases like Black Myth: Wukong have been successful, these do not represent a significant market shift toward open-world Souls-like games. AI in game production Correct. AI is steadily integrating into game development processes, though we have yet to see a revolutionary impact. However, its broader adoption across the industry is inevitable. The evolution of multi-game subscriptions is over True. In 2024, no major breakthroughs occurred in subscription models. The release of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 on Game Pass caused premium-to-subscription cannibalization on Xbox, but strong sales on other platforms offset this, leaving trends unclear. Epic Games is doubling down on Fortnite as a platform, adding content like Fortnite Festival and Lego Fortnite to Fortnite Crew subscriptions without raising prices, aiming to lock in players and developers. Mobile-to-PC gaming evolution Incorrect. There has not been a notable shift toward PC ports of mobile games. GTA 6: One game to rule them all Grand Theft Auto 6, scheduled for a fall 2025 release, is poised to reshape the gaming industry – much like its predecessor, GTA 5, which shattered records with 32.5 million units sold in its first year. While the market landscape has evolved, Rockstar's legacy of delivering groundbreaking experiences ensures that GTA 6 will leave a lasting mark. When GTA 5 launched in 2013, it capitalised on the late lifecycle of the PS3 and Xbox 360, leveraging a vast and mature audience. GTA 6, by contrast, will arrive earlier in the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S lifecycle, facing a smaller but rapidly growing install base. However, the enduring success of GTA Online, with millions of active players, has kept the franchise at the forefront of gaming, driving extraordinary anticipation for GTA 6. Rockstar's history of crafting genre-defining titles positions GTA 6 to set new industry standards. Yet, its challenge lies in navigating a gaming world increasingly dominated by live-service titles. How Rockstar adapts the Grand Theft Auto formula to this evolving landscape will not only determine GTA 6's success but may also redefine the future of open-world gaming. Why the Nintendo Switch 2 may struggle to outperform its predecessor The Nintendo Switch 2 faces the challenge of living up to the original Switch's monumental success, even with the appeal of backward compatibility as an upgrade incentive. With over 146 million units sold and helped by the pandemic, the original Switch has deeply penetrated the market, leaving many players satisfied with their current systems. Without groundbreaking innovations, consumers may see little reason to upgrade. Compounding the challenge, a budget-friendly version of the original Switch – if still available – could attract cost-conscious buyers, diverting attention from the new console. "The industry is not fully transitioning back to premium games, but there is growing acknowledgment that the sheer volume of live service offerings exceeds players' available time" To make an impact, the Switch 2 will need exclusive launch titles or games that fully utilize its hardware improvements. Yet, no major exclusives have been announced, leaving questions about how it will differentiate itself. While Nintendo's history suggests it may have surprises in store, surpassing the Switch's unprecedented sales figures seems like a steep climb. Ubisoft: Acquisition, privatisation, or dismantling Ubisoft finds itself at a critical juncture as financial struggles and operational missteps have severely impacted its stability. Its market value has halved in 2024, falling back to levels not seen since 2015. The poor performance of releases such as Star Wars Outlaws, XDefiant, and Rainbow Six Extraction, combined with delays of key franchises like Assassin's Creed Shadows, have exacerbated the company's challenges, leaving investors and fans increasingly disillusioned and calling for substantial change. Acquisition or privatisation appears increasingly likely. Tencent, a major shareholder in Ubisoft, is a leading candidate for a buyout, though its future M&A strategy remains unclear. Privatisation could shield Ubisoft from the pressures of the public market, offering a chance for a comprehensive strategic overhaul. However, both paths risk partial or complete dismantling, as new ownership may choose to streamline operations by selling underperforming studios or non-core assets. Fortnite's next level: Taking on Steam, PlayStation, and Xbox Fortnite is rapidly evolving from a popular game into a major digital distribution platform, poised to challenge established giants like Steam and PlayStation Store. Recent developments underscore its growing influence across gaming and entertainment. On November 30, 2024, Fortnite set a new standard for in-game events with 'Remix: The Finale,' a concert featuring performances by Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Ice Spice, and a tribute to Juice WRLD. The event attracted over 14 million concurrent players and demonstrated the platform's unparalleled ability to draw massive audiences and create cultural moments within its ecosystem. Epic Games continues to innovate by making user-generated content more accessible. Introducing unique deep links for Fortnite islands allows players to seamlessly join specific experiences directly from a shared URL. Currently available on PC and Android, this feature simplifies content discovery and enhances player engagement. Looking ahead to 2025, Fortnite could potentially strengthen its position by advancing creator tools, fostering new strategic alliances, and promoting open digital marketplaces. These efforts could signal its ambition to rival established digital distribution platforms, reshaping the industry and expanding its influence as a digital powerhouse. "The $69 billion Activision Blizzard deal, rising costs, power of forever-titles, and Sony's huge lead leave Xbox no choice but to bring all their big games to PS5 early" Weakening of large live-service titles outside of Fortnite and Minecraft Several factors are influencing the market landscape. As noted earlier, Fortnite continues to expand its growth and maintain its dominance. Meanwhile, Roblox is experiencing growth not only on mobile platforms but also on PC and consoles. On the other hand, some games are facing challenges in attracting new players. For competitive games like MOBAs, high skill barriers can deter newcomers, while in other cases, expansive storylines and increasingly complex mechanics may discourage players from starting. Additionally, 2025 is shaping up to be a standout year for new game releases. This influx of fresh titles will likely divert time and engagement away from many existing live-service games. In summary, 2025 appears to be ushering in a convergence of trends that could pose significant challenges for many traditional live-service titles. We will not see a successful new F2P multiplayer shooter launch in 2025 Looking over the past few years of shooter launches, it is increasingly plain to see that the genre is beyond saturated and that players are fixed to their franchise shooter of choice. While there may be blips on the radar that may ping every time a new one launches and players check the game out, these will ultimately fizzle out over the next year to two years without any additional fanfare. "Switch 2" will come and be $400 Incorrect. I am probably off by three to six months (Switch 2 is likely to arrive in the first half of 2025) but still believe in the other points I made, including the price point – despite potential US tariffs. Saudi Arabia will make more big moves Incorrect. But they publicly announced they will make a big move (a billion dollar acquisition) in 2025 earlier this year. AI will become an even bigger topic in 2024 Correct, and we will of course see a lot more next year. Square Enix will release a big IP game with crypto elements Incorrect. Xbox will open all floodgates and go all-in on PS5 I am aware that Microsoft has already become somewhat open to releasing Xbox games on other platforms, but 2025 might be the year where they go all-in. The $69 billion Activision Blizzard deal, rising costs across the board, the power of forever-titles, the huge lead of Sony and other factors will likely leave Microsoft no choice but to bring all their big games to PS5 early, including blockbusters such as Gears of War: E-Day or Perfect Dark. "Ubisoft at the end of 2025 will look a lot different from now" Instant gaming will have its big moment Instant gaming silently amassed vast audiences over time, but I believe 2025 will be the true breakout year in the West. The idea of not having to install apps and being able to play across various platforms with deep social hooks led to hundreds of millions of active players on WeChat in China, for example. Apple just a few weeks ago enabled in-app-purchases for instant games on iOS, a watershed moment this part of the industry has been waiting for for years. Ubisoft will change radically I hope I am wrong on this one, but I see Ubisoft closing studios and cutting stuff at a significantly larger scale next year. In my view, Assassin's Creed Shadows will get solid reviews and sell 'okay' – but not enough to make Ubisoft continue business as usual. Ubisoft at the end of 2025 will look a lot different from now. Nintendo will not have enough consoles to sell Despite Nintendo's pledge and best efforts, the new device will sell out very quickly and not be available for months in 2025. It will be even worse than 2017 when the Switch launched. Furthermore, the name will be Switch 2. I also expect deep price cuts for the original Switch in 2025. AI to supercharge games development Correct. Over 17,000 games were published on Steam, compared to around 14,000 last year. AI is also being more prominently used. For example, at EA’s annual ‘Investor Day’ in September 2024, CEO Andrew Wilson, said that AI is "at the very core of the business” and has more than "100 active novel AI projects” in development. Games subscription growth to outpace games software growth by three times Correct. At the time of writing, preliminary MIDiA forecasts suggest that by the end of 2024, subscription revenue will have grown by approximately 15% while games purchase revenue will have actually declined. Another $100 million-plus acquisition will take place Correct. Take-Two Interactive bought Gearbox Interactive for $460 million. Beacon Interactive bought Saber Interactive for $237 million. Turtle Beach bought Fortnite Festival guitar maker PDP for $118 million. Games and social media will eat into time on other formats Partially Correct. While time spent on games and social media grew by 5% and 12%, respectively, between Q2 2023 and Q2 2024, games decreased their share of entertainment time slightly, while social media grew slightly. Non-game companies will deepen their involvement with games Correct. Disney invested $1.5 billion in Epic Games to bring Disney brands into Fortnite. YouTube Playables, free games playable on YouTube, left soft launch. LinkedIn introduced New York Times-like games. Following massive success with its Fallout TV series, Amazon announced it is making a Mass Effect show. Games and social media will eat into time on other formats. Ads revenue will become more prominent on PC and console After an extended period of strong growth, the games market has begun to face growth challenges. Some game makers will turn to advertising – which has largely been untapped on console and PC – to drive growth. Advertising will become more prominent at platform level (Xbox and PlayStation menus) and at game level (immersive, interstitial, and rewarded alike). What is more, mobile developers are increasingly entering console and PC (and will bring mobile ad monetisation learnings with them). While game developers have experimented with advertising in the past, the revenue stream is more viable now as programmatic advertising means ads are more automated and specific. Gaming is now at the front of mind for marketers and there is also a necessity: the games market and advertisers alike need new revenue streams. "Advertising will become more prominent at platform level and at game level... The games market and advertisers alike need new revenue streams" Portable gaming skyrockets Nintendo will release its Switch 2 in 2025, and we should expect to see a new Mario Kart and a Super Mario title during the launch window. This console will sell well, driving game-related hardware and console revenues in 2025. However, this is just the beginning for portable gaming’s oncoming tailwind. The attention economy is oversaturated, and Nintendo was shrewd to release a hybrid handheld that allows both at-home play on the TV and portable play. Similarly, companion portables like the Steam Deck complement a gamer’s main platform (a gaming PC, in this case). Companion portables give players more opportunities to engage with their ecosystem of choice, and more opportunities for games to grow their share of the attention economy. Microsoft’s CEO of gaming Phil Spencer confirmed Xbox is working on a portable, and leaks reported by Bloomberg indicate Sony is as well. A portable strategy would also fit in with both companies’ current strategies and recent peripheral releases/partnerships, such as the PlayStation Portal (a companion device letting players stream their PS5 remotely to the Portal’s screen via WiFi) and Xbox’s play anywhere initiatives and partnership with the ASUS ROG Ally portable PC. The year of the portable is coming. Multi-game subscriptions growth will take a back seat Unlike video and music, game subscriptions will not be the sole future of distribution any time soon – but they will have their place. While a consumer can listen to hundreds of tracks and watch dozens of movies or TV episodes in a month, the majority only have time to play a few games. That is why multi-game subscriptions are only worth it for the most dedicated players. Most gamers are already served by the free-to-play markets – or are happy enough to buy a few games a year à la carte. Free-based tiers and cloud gaming could change this in the long term, but for the coming years, subscriptions will remain a secondary revenue stream for the games market. Generative AI will divide game leadership and game makers Generative AI will undoubtedly have a bigger role in game development going forward, but the transition to this new technology will face struggles in 2025. While game publishers will continue to inject generative AI to cut costs and streamline game creation, the technology will continue to worry game developers. "The year of the portable is coming" Generative AI is relatively new and more use cases will hit the market in 2025, leading to yet more debate. More developers will publicly decry generative AI and will mobilise fans of their games to do the same. Inevitably, a high-profile game will use "no AI was used in the making of this game" as a marketing bullet point. Creator-led games will start to show their worth Creators and influencers that got rich through gaming video content have their eyes – and their capital – on game development. For example, popular YouTuber Videogamedunkey already owns his own indie publisher, Bigmode. Meanwhile, several influencer-led game studios are creating game experiences on Epic Games’ Unreal Engine for Fortnite (such as Typical Gamer with his own studio JOGO). These creators are using their audiences (marketing), networks (B2B), and knowledge of games to cater to their audiences and gain momentum in the market. In 2025, we expect to see a viral hit from one of these influencer-led publishers – or at least a game becomes part of the gaming cultural zeitgeist. Asia & MENA to account for over 60% of global PC & Mobile games revenue Almost correct. Asia & MENA will generate $82 billion in player spending across PC & Mobile in 2024, which is roughly 56% of global PC & Mobile game revenue. A deal valued at more than $2.5 billion (among the Top Ten of all time) will happen Correct, but not from Asia. EQT acquired Keywords Studios for nearly $2.4 billion in 2024. EQT is not from Asia, however. Instant games will reach over one billion MAUs in Asia & MENA Correct. We believe this prediction was achieved with 800m MAUs for mini /instant games coming from WeChat and Douyin in China alone. New console hardware will be announced in 2024 Correct. While the Nintendo Switch successor was not announced, as we previously expected, Sony announced its PS5 Pro and multiple PC gaming handhelds were also announced. The new global esports landscape will be centered outside of the west Correct. There were more high-profile esports tournaments and viewership in Asia & MENA compared to the west this year by a growing margin. "In 2025, additional markets will require Apple and Google to remove their walled gardens" Blizzard will re-enter China in an official capacity Correct. Blizzard announced its return in April 2024 and re-established its partnership with NetEase More than 100 import games will be granted an ISBN for release in China Probably correct, but not yet confirmed. 98 Import Games have been approved as of writing (December 16), and we could see another batch before the end of the year taking the number over 100. Governments in Southeast Asia & India will actively support games industry growth Correct. Multiple governments in the region announced policies that include support for video games and esports in their respective markets. Indonesia, Malaysia, India, to name a few. The following predictions pertain to the primary markets that Niko Partners analyzes every day – i.e. those in Asia and MENA. These are a subset of predictions and topics that our team of analysts is considering about 2025 and beyond to help guide our clients in their global business strategic planning. China’s video game market revenue will reach $50 billion Niko Partners proprietary market model forecasts that player spending on video game software and services will surpass $50 billion in China next year – making it the first country to do so. While China is a mobile-first market, with over two-thirds of spend from smartphones and tablets, we continue to see notable growth from the PC and console game segments, especially on the heels of the successful launch of Black Myth: Wukong. China won’t be the only market to achieve a milestone in 2025. India is set to exceed $1 billion in player spending, the Philippines will reach $500 million, and Thailand will closely approach $2 billion. In fact, the Asia & MENA region as a whole will reach $89 billion in player spending across PC, mobile, and console, with a user base of 1.76 billion gamers. 2025 will be better than 2024 for the games markets in Asia & MENA The global video games industry has experienced significant fluctuations during the post-pandemic period, and Asia & MENA are not exceptions to this. However, while layoffs continue along with global economic uncertainty, we see 2025 (particularly after Q1) as a more stable year for the industry compared with 2024. India’s games revenue will grow 14.7% YoY in 2025, followed by MENA-3 (8.3% YoY) and Southeast Asia (6.1% YoY). However, Japan and Korea likely will not see positive growth rates until 2026. In emerging markets like India, MENA, and Southeast Asia, new gamers and a growing middle class will drive increased spending on video games. We also expect to see companies that significantly downsized their gaming operations, such as ByteDance and Garena, indicate recovery by greenlighting new titles and other gaming related projects. "We forecast that player spending on games will surpass $50 billion in China next year – making it the first country to do so" Over 1 billion gamers in Asia & MENA will watch gaming & esports content online Niko Partners conducts an annual online survey of 7,500 gamers across Asia & MENA to understand gamer behavior, motivations and insights across the region. One important stat that we’ve paid attention to recently is the increasing number of gamers that watch gaming and esports related video content online. In 2024, we found that just over half of all gamers surveyed watch gaming and esports content online. In 2025, we expect this to increase to nearly 60% as publishers and content creators fuel demand for video content. Southeast Asia and India already index higher than China, East Asia, and MENA, which typically fall slightly below 50%. Game video and livestreaming continues to play a greater role in the region for game discovery, marketing, and even distribution. One notable trend we’ve seen recently is the sale of in-game content via livestreams, with viewers able to make purchases without leaving the stream. Game companies will shift back to geographic expansion Niko Partners believes game companies will recognize growth through geographic expansion in 2025, after new technologies such as Web3, VR/AR/XR, and cloud gaming underperformed expectations. We anticipate firms will double down on international expansion particularly to Asia and MENA, given the growing appetite for gaming and the recent success of global IP in these markets. In 2024, Korean game Dungeon & Fighter launched in China and grossed over $2 billion. Likewise, Supercell’s Brawl Stars has recently seen South Korea, Japan, and China emerge as its Top Three markets outside the US. Geographic expansion not only diversifies a company’s player base but also mitigates the risk associated with untested new technologies, ultimately driving sustainable growth in a more predictable and stable market environment. New regulations will further open up walled gardens on mobile The past few years has seen the US, EU, Japan, South Korea, and India take antitrust action against walled gardens on mobile, primarily operated by Apple and Google. This has led to Apple and Google allowing third party app stores, alternative payment systems, and removing anti-steering provisions in certain countries. However, stakeholders and regulators continue to argue that Apple and Google are not in compliance with these rulings, and regulators in other countries have also started to take an interest in opening up digital markets after pressure from the industry. In 2025, we fully expect that additional markets will announce rulings that require Apple and Google to remove their walled gardens, and we believe that both parties will be required to remove their commission fee in at least one market when developers link out to an external web shop. We expect this to accelerate out-of-app monetization growth, benefiting game developers who will be able to earn higher gross margins on in-game payments. Not at the end of the industry layoffs Correct, unfortunately Market growth in low single digits Looks to be correct. We’re currently forecasting 1.4% growth Switch 2 release at end of the year, PS5 the best-selling console, VR to have another tough year Wrong, right, right Use of generative AI-driven NPCs Wrong. Hasn’t really happened (although plenty of tech demos!) Microsoft to challenge EA to become the biggest publisher across Xbox and PlayStation, Activision Blizzard new releases to go into Game Pass, Cheaper Game Pass with mobile content Right, Right, Wrong Mobile app store status quo to continue Right. However see below for thoughts on increasing off-platform disruption Microsoft to experiment with a mobile app store Wrong. Launch has been delayed Netflix to broaden its game streaming offer to more countries Correct MMO resurgence, uptick in games IP adaptations, more AA games from biggest publishers, GTA 6 launch date late in 2025 Generally, right. MMO resurgence hasn’t really happened although peak WoW’s player numbers in 2024 were the highest for several years. It’s been a really tough year for the industry. Slower market growth and rising costs combined with the devastating number of layoffs has created a tense and difficult operating environment. It’s likely that backdrop will continue into 2025 to an extent, though I don’t think we’ll see the same level of industry contraction and job losses. Overall market performance in 2025 I’m expecting continued slow growth in games content and services spend globally. Gone are the years of 10-15% market growth driven by huge increases in mobile gaming spend. With that fuel seemingly burned for at least the next few years, the market is in a slow growth era. However, to put this in a more positive context, total global market size is expected to be similar to historical market peak from 2021 where consumption was heavily driven by the impact of the pandemic. The console market is set to grow marginally with Switch 2 launch (currently expected it to arrive in Q2 at minimum $400/€400) and GTA 6 releasing. US import tariffs are a dark cloud on the horizon, but I’m going to positively predict that console hardware is once again made exempt from these import charges. GTA 6 will be the largest entertainment release of all time in terms of revenue generated in its launch months. Such is the size of a new GTA, if it is delayed into 2026, the console market performance will probably be down even without the potential impact of tariffs. GTA Online will continue for gamers that play on PS4, Xbox One and PC, meaning a fractured GTA userbase for Rockstar to deal with. If Switch 2 hits in Q2 (one to three months later in the year than the original Switch did), I’m forecasting sell-through of a little north of 13 million units. That’s a sales rate higher than the original Switch. I’m interested to see what Nintendo does with Nintendo Switch Online at launch. I’d like to think it will expand its content and feature set for the launch of the Switch 2. "GTA 6 will be the largest entertainment release of all time... If it is delayed into 2026, the console market performance will probably be down" Off-platform app monetisation There’s been a lot of talk about the potential for mobile app store disruption with the introduction of more third-party stores from the likes of Epic and Microsoft to compete with the incumbents following various legal ruling across different countries and regions. While this is interesting to track, shifting consumer behaviour around game discovery is challenging so I’m not expecting major changes in 2025 even if Microsoft does get around to launching its mobile app store. After all, there have been alternative app stores on Android devices for many years and, in the PC space, Epic has thrown large amounts of investment behind competing with Steam through Epic Games Store. Neither of these factors has altered the status quo in terms of consumer behaviour significantly. However, beyond new app stores offering a collection of games, the practice of driving high-spending gamers off-platform to monetise directly through publisher-specific web stores is something we’ll see a lot more of in 2025. This could drive increased profits for mobile games companies and will drive a bigger share of spending outside the App Store and Google Play than we’ve seen previously. Funding and M&A activity picking up I’m expecting funding and M&A activity to increase in 2025 compared to 2024 as investment appetite returns. A lot of recent funding has focused on the games production value chain and games technology, with less investment in developers and publishers. That trend will continue, but I expect the investment pipeline to return to games content-based companies progressively through the year. What will happen with Ubisoft? I think it depends on the performance of Assassin’s Creed Shadows to an extent. A strong performance could change the leverage different parties have in discussions to take the company private, which may delay any change in the company’s position. Content trends I think we’ll see a deeper focus on remakes and sequels as publishers stay risk averse when it comes to investment. A new wave of extractions shooters is expected in 2025, but I don’t think there is enough demand to support multiple new entrants. Unfortunately, that will result in some big budget failures. Publishers will continue to aggressively look at ways to drive more value from their existing games IP and franchises. That means more cross-game licensing, brand partnerships, cross-media licensing, sponsorship, and advertising in and around their games. "Total global market size in 2025 is expected to be similar to the historical market peak from 2021" Web3 games will probably have a decent resurgence due to coin prices, so expect to see more releases and investment again in this area. Black Myth: Wukong’s success will prompt more investment into these sort of single player games and will drive all Chinese publishers and developers to consider the global appeal of their upcoming games. Unexpected twists and turns There are things that are inherently hard to predict, such as Payday being deeply integrated into PUBG, which seems like an off-the-wall collaboration. I think the hunt for engagement and player attention, and the difficult market backdrop will mean more unexpected collaborations and partnerships, where companies are pushed to get more creative and ambitious to carve out a space in the market.

Title: Apple could hit a $4 trillion market cap by early 2025

Apple’s (AAPL-1.56%) artificial intelligence rollout could drive demand for the iPhone 16 this holiday season — and send the tech giant’s market value to a new record high. Analysts at Wedbush, led by Dan Ives, said in a recent note that the Cupertino, California-based company “is set to have a strong holiday season ahead as iPhone 16 upgrades across its installed base are trending well into Christmas.” In particular, Apple stands to sell upwards of 240 million iPhones in the 2025 fiscal year, fueled by AI-driven upgrades. The researchers said this could be “the highest iPhone unit sales year in Apple’s history.” Shares of Apple closed at $254.49 each Friday, up nearly 2%. So far this year, the company’s stock has surged 37%, lifting its market capitalization to $3.85 trillion. That makes it the most valuable company in the world, followed by Nvidia (NVDA-2.62%) and Microsoft (MSFT-2.00%). Wedbush maintained its $300 price target, and said Apple is on track to become the first company to hit a $4 trillion market cap by early 2025. Although iPhone sales jumped 6% year-over-year in the September quarter to $46.22 billion, the company’s annual revenue grew just 1% in the 2024 fiscal year. While the company has been banking on its new AI features, known as Apple Intelligence, to supercharge sales, some analysts have warned that more substantial innovations will be needed to drive interest. Wedbush said the “naysayers” are overlooking key opportunities within the company. With 2 billion iOS devices currently in use worldwide and 1.5 billion iPhones, Wedbush believes that there are approximately 300 million iPhones that haven’t been upgraded within the past four years. That, combined with a strong services business and the massive potential for Apple users to tap into AI through their iOS devices, could give Apple the boost it’s been gearing up for, the analysts said. “We believe the success of iPhone 16 with a strong holiday season ahead over the next week will be the launching pad for a renaissance of growth in Cupertino over the next 12 to 18 months,” they wrote. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

The words, donned in all-caps and gray font, were a play on the Latin phrase "Aut Caesar Aut Nihil," which translates to "Either Caesar or nothing" or rather "All or nothing." It was a fitting phrase for a company that in 2024 put the full weight of its resources behind its artificial intelligence strategy. Meta in April said it would raise its spending levels in 2024 by as much as $10 billion to support infrastructure investments for its AI efforts. Although the announcement sent shares plunging as much as 19% that evening, investors have come around to the company's costly AI ambitions. Meta's stock price hit a record on Dec. 11, and it's up nearly 70% year to date as of the market's close on Friday. "It's clear that there are a lot of new opportunities to use new AI advances to accelerate our core business that should have strong ROI over the next few years, so I think we should invest more there," Zuckerberg said on a call with analysts in October. He noted AI's "positive impact on nearly all aspects of our work," highlighting how the technology was key to rebuilding the company's online advertising business that took a lashing from Apple's iOS privacy update in 2021. Additionally, he said AI underpins Meta's more nascent projects, such as its Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses and experimental Orion augmented reality headset that Zuckerberg believes could represent "the next computing platform." Zuckerberg's comments about AI underscore how the technology has become Meta's top priority, directly impacting the company's business and potentially paving the way for future revenue opportunities. Unlike the company's more conventional services, like Instagram and Facebook, AI is an infrastructure technology that Zuckerberg wants hardwired into its various products, particularly as competitors like OpenAI continue to make inroads with consumers. While OpenAI's GPT family of AI models help power apps like ChatGPT, Meta's family of Llama AI models feeds the company's newer generative AI features like the Meta AI digital assistant. That chatbot represents Zuckerberg's primary way to introduce generative AI technologies to its billions of users. "Meta AI is on track to being the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of this year," Zuckerberg said at Connect. The company has been increasingly releasing new generative AI features for advertisers to continue improving the efficiency of its online advertising platform. And with the hiring last month of Clara Shih, who had been Salesforce's CEO of AI, to lead a new business AI group, Meta aims to build a more enterprise-focused unit in the new year. Meta's all-encompassing approach to AI has led analysts to predict that Meta is positioned for more success in 2025. Analysts at Jefferies chose Meta as one of generative AI's "winners" heading into 2025, writing in a Dec. 15 note that the company's massive user base represents "one of the richest surfaces to introduce Gen AI tools." Truist Securities analysts said in a note last week that the Meta AI digital assistant could challenge Google's search as "an answer engine for all kinds of queries" and that the social media company is likely to outperform in 2025, potentially benefiting from offering businesses more advanced customer service chatbots. "We believe META has a unique opportunity to introduce Gen AI tools to the almost 4B users & >200M businesses across its family of apps," the Jefferies analysts wrote. Meta declined to comment for this article, but pointed to previous statistics and executive comments about AI. Meta has been increasingly talking up the number of people who use Meta AI, with Zuckerberg saying in December that the digital assistant "now has nearly 600 million monthly actives." He launched the Meta AI chatbot in 2023 to rival the generative AI chatbots of competitors, most notably OpenAI's ChatGPT. In April, the company brought it to the forefront of each of the apps in its empire by putting Meta AI in the search bars of Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp and Messenger. But because the company doesn't offer a stand-alone Meta AI app, it's difficult to directly compare its usage to similar services like ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, said David Curry, the data editor for insights firm Business of Apps. When it comes to monthly active users, the most popular of these generative AI chatbot apps is ChatGPT by a wide margin, followed by Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, Claude and Perplexity, Curry said. The Meta AI "standalone website gets less than 10 million views per month, putting it far below the major services (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc) and even lower than some mid-range players like Anthropic," Curry said, based on data he accessed via the Similarweb web-tracking service. Meta's finance chief, Susan Li, told analysts in July that India has become the company's "largest market for Meta AI usage." That usage has coincided with promising signs of retention and engagement on WhatsApp, Li added. Among those users is Sonny Ravan, a music producer in Pune, India. Ravan said he finds Meta AI, which he uses through WhatsApp, helpful for learning about the history of songs that he enjoys. He also uses it as a tool to learn about people in the music industry who he plans to work with or meet, describing it as great for preparation. Sathish Thiyagarajan, 30, a technical support engineer for marketing tech firm GoX.AI, said he's increasingly using Meta AI as a search tool via WhatsApp, which he noted dominates the Indian market for mobile internet communications. "While I'm talking with my family or my friends, if they're saying something to me and I have to search something, I'm not going to go to Google," said Thiyagarajan, of Chennai, India. "I'm just going to put the phone in the speaker mode, and I'll immediately search through Meta AI." However, Thiyagarajan said he only uses Meta AI when he's on his phone. If he's at his computer, OpenAI's ChatGPT is his preferred AI chatbot. Not everyone is a fan of Meta AI's bundling into WhatsApp's search functions. Jawhar Sircar, 72, a retired government official in Kolkata, India, called the Meta AI search feature in WhatsApp "quite a nuisance." That's because whenever a user pauses while typing out a name in the search-find box, the Meta AI technology quickly "picks up whatever has been typed" and generates what he describes as unnecessary search prompt suggestions. As far as the popularity of Meta AI in India, Sircar said he thinks the feature is mostly used by companies, technologists and other professionals who "are getting hooked to AI" alongside the Indian government's continued investment in regional computing infrastructure. "Professionals and companies have started using AI, but the general user has no need, at least not on the Meta platforms," Sircar wrote in an email. Advertising is still the key to revenue. Meta said in December that over 1 million advertisers had used the company's GenAI tools to create more than 15 million ads in a single month. "We estimate that businesses using image generation are seeing a +7% increase in conversions," Meta said at the time, regarding its image generation features. While people may associate generative AI with the visually striking and sometimes surreal imagery derived from popular services like Dall-E or Midjourney, it's more likely that the average small business advertiser uses Meta's GenAI tools for more subtle tasks, said Stacy Reed, an online advertising and Facebook ads consultant. That includes using AI to create multiple versions of an ad's headline, auto-resizing the size of ads so they look appropriate within users' Instagram and Facebook apps, and repositioning certain images within the ads so that the promotions perform better, Reed said. Advertisers that already write strong, creative copy can ask Meta's GenAI tools for "a little bit more" help, Reed said. "That's where you win with their AI tools," she said. Reed said the many small advertisers she supports aren't associating the new features with AI. They "think that Meta is just enhancing the way you build ads," Reed said. Celina Guerrero, an independent corporate sales and training consultant, said she uses Meta's GenAI tools to help with writing headlines for her ads, but she said she finds Meta's advertising interface to be confusing and constantly changing. "It is visually overwhelming from a user experience," Guerrero said. Ahead of a Facebook ad campaign planned for January, Guerrero said she is debating how to use Meta's GenAI tools for more in-depth tasks, like modifying her ad's entire in-line copy. "I don't want my copy to sound like ChatGPT," Guerrero said, referring to the sterile, run-of-the-mill AI-generated text that's proliferating the web. "I have two options: One, I don't use the variations, or two, I spend an inordinate amount of hours editing it." Most big companies and advertising agencies are turning to more marketing-specific tools for their generative AI-based ad campaigns, said Jay Pattisall, principal analyst at Forrester. Those services are more robust than Meta's built-in AI ad tools, he said. Still, the mere introduction of simple GenAI tools is beneficial to Meta considering it dominates the digital ads market along with Google. Meta's generative AI tools just have "to be good enough to squeeze out more investment" from advertisers, said Maurice Rahmey, CEO of performance marketing firm Disruptive Digital and a former Facebook customer manager. "It's better for their business, even if it's just those small, incremental changes," Rahmey said "It's a business of scale." With Meta's hiring of Shih from Salesforce in November, some analysts say Meta could make an enterprise technology push with its Llama family of open-source AI models. Llama's advancements "represent a significant opportunity for businesses to drive more efficiencies and significantly improve the experiences they offer their customers," Meta monetization head John Hegeman said in a statement. Shih, who was one of CNBC's 2024 changemakers, rejoined Salesforce in 2020 after previously working at the company from 2006 through 2009. As part of her most recent role at Salesforce, Shih helped oversee Einstein GPT for Service and Sales, a GenAI product intended for sales and customer support staff. During her first stint at Salesforce, Shih created a business app that let users connect their Salesforce customer relationship software with their Facebook connections. In 2009, she wrote "The Facebook Era," a book intended for professionals to better understand how to use social networks for business. Multiple former Meta AI and product leaders told CNBC that Shih's vast experience will be helpful considering the company has failed in previous attempts at building enterprise software. Meta announced in May that it plans to shut down Workplace, its business communications product, by 2026. And after buying enterprise startup Kustomer for about $1 billion in 2020, Meta spun it out in 2023 in a deal that was reportedly valued at $250 million. The most logical step for Meta would be to create a larger business around WhatsApp, said Ralph Schackart, an internet equity analyst at investment bank William Blair. Specifically, WhatsApp could help businesses build customer-service chatbots using Meta's GenAI, Schackart said. "Longer term, this is going to evolve into customized sales agents, which is a $3 trillion-plus industry," Schackart said about Meta's WhatsApp business AI chatbot opportunity.

Saylor, who was 33 at the time, says it was the most exquisite hotel room he'd ever seen, paid for by lead underwriter Merrill Lynch. The next morning, Saylor went to the floor of the Nasdaq to watch his company's stock open. He recalled seeing a note scrolling across the ticker, warning traders: "Please do not confuse MSTR with MSFT." The latter belonged to Microsoft, the software giant that had gone public 12 years earlier. MicroStrategy shares popped 76% in their debut, joining the parade of tech companies benefiting from the dot-com boom. "It was a good day," Saylor told CNBC. More than 26 years later, MicroStrategy and Microsoft were again linked together, but for an entirely different reason. In December 2024, Saylor stood before Microsoft's shareholders to try and convince them that the company, now valued at more than $3 trillion, should put some of its $78.4 billion in cash, equivalents and short-term investment into bitcoin. "Microsoft can't afford to miss the next technology wave, and bitcoin is that wave," Saylor said in a video presentation that he released on X last week. The post has more than 3.6 million views. Saylor has gone all in on that strategy. MicroStrategy has purchased 439,000 bitcoins since mid-2020, a stockpile that's now worth about $42 billion and is the basis for the company's market cap explosion to $82 billion from roughly $1.1 billion when the plan was put in place. On Monday, MicroStrategy said in a filing that over about the past week it acquired another 5,262 bitcoins for roughly $561 million, at $106,662 per coin. That brings its total holdings to 444,262 bitcoins. MicroStrategy's software unit, which specializes in business intelligence, generates just more than $100 million in revenue a quarter. After zooming up in 1998 and 1999, the stock crumbled in the dot-com bust, losing almost all its value. In the decades that followed, it slowly bounced back before rocketing up due to bitcoin. Four years into its bitcoin buying spree, MicroStrategy is the world's fourth-largest holder, behind only creator Satoshi Nakamoto, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust and crypto exchange Binance. At Microsoft, the shareholder vote supported by Saylor failed by a wide margin — less than 1% of its investors voted for it. But the spectacle provided Saylor, now 59, with yet another opportunity to preach the gospel of bitcoin and tout the benefits of converting as much cash as possible into that single digital asset. It's a story that Wall Street has been gobbling up. MicroStrategy shares are up 477% this year as of Friday's close, second to only AppLovin among all U.S. tech companies valued at $5 billion or more, according to FactSet data. That follows a 346% gain in 2023. While the rally was in full force well before November of this year, Donald Trump's election victory, funded heavily by the crypto industry, propelled the stock even more. The shares have climbed 60% since the Nov. 5 election, and finally exceeded their dot-com era high from 2000 on Nov. 11. Saylor has long talked about bitcoin in an evangelical fashion and co-authored a book about it in 2022 titled "What is Money?" But his critics have gotten louder than ever of late, describing Saylor as a cult-like leader and his strategy as a "ponzi loop" that involves issuing debt and equity to buy bitcoin, watching MicroStrategy's stock price go up, and then doing more of the same. "Wash, rinse, repeat — what could possibly go wrong?" wrote Peter Schiff, chief economist and global strategist at Euro Pacific Asset Management, in a Nov. 12 post on X to his 1 million followers. Saylor, who has 3.8 million followers, addressed the growing chorus of skeptics last week in an interview with CNBC's "Money Movers." "Just like developers in Manhattan, every time Manhattan real estate goes up in value, they issue more debt to develop more real estate, that's why your buildings are so tall in New York City," Saylor said, in a clip that's been posted to X by his legion of fans. "It's been going for 350 years. I would call it an economy." Saylor is a frequent guest on CNBC, making appearances on various programs throughout the year. He also agreed to two interviews with CNBC.com, one in September and another soon after the election. The first of those chats came back at the Lotte, just a few elevator stops from the penthouse where he stayed the night before his stock hit the Nasdaq. Saylor was delivering a conference keynote at the hotel and taking meetings on the side. He wore a designer suit and an orange Hermes tie, matching bitcoin's designated color. The election was less than two months away, and crypto companies were pumping money into the Trump campaign after the Republican nominee and ex-president, who previously called bitcoin a "scam against the dollar," started guaranteeing a much more crypto-friendly administration. Two months earlier, in July, Trump delivered a keynote at the biggest bitcoin conference of the year in Nashville, Tennessee, where he promised to fire SEC Chair Gary Gensler, an industry critic, and said the U.S. would become the "crypto capital of the planet" if he won. "I think the election year has inspired the crypto community to find its voice, and I think it has catalyzed a lot of enthusiasm that was latent," Saylor said in the September interview. "When Trump came out tentatively positive, that was a big boost to the industry. When he came out fully positive, that was another boost." Until this year, MicroStrategy was one of the few ways many institutions could buy bitcoin. Because MicroStrategy was an equity, investment firms didn't need any special provisions to own it. The environment changed in January, when the SEC approved spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, allowing investors to buy ETFs that track the value of bitcoin. Since Trump's victory, it's all been up and to the right. Bitcoin is up about 41% and BlackRock's ETF has climbed 39%. Gensler is preparing to leave the SEC, and Trump has picked deregulation advocate and former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins to replace him. Venture capitalist David Sacks, an outspoken conservative who hosted a fundraiser for Trump in San Francisco, will be the "White House A.I. & Crypto Czar," Trump announced earlier this month in a post on his Truth Social platform. "With the red sweep, bitcoin is surging up with tail winds, and the rest of the digital assets will also begin to surge," Saylor told CNBC in a phone interview, soon after the election. He said bitcoin remains the "safe trade" in the crypto space, but as a "digital assets framework" is put into place for the broader crypto market, "there'll be a surge in the entire digital assets industry," he said. "Taxes are coming down. All the rhetoric about unrealized capital gains taxes and wealth taxes is off the table," Saylor said. "All of the hostility from the regulators to banks touching bitcoin" also goes away, he added. MicroStrategy has gotten even more aggressive with its bitcoin purchases. Saylor said in a post on Dec. 16, that over a six-day stretch starting Dec. 9, his company had acquired 15,350 bitcoins for $1.5 billion. So far this year, MicroStrategy has acquired over 255,000 bitcoins, with about two-thirds of those purchases occurring since Nov. 11. "We were going to do it regardless," Saylor said, referring to the election results. "But what was a headwind has become a tail wind." A week before the election, MicroStrategy announced in its quarterly earnings release a plan to raise $42 billion over three years. That included a stock sale of up to $21 billion through financial firms including TD Securities and Barclays, opening up that much more liquidity for bitcoin purchases. Saylor told CNBC it was "probably the single most important earnings call in the history of the company." No amount of ownership is too much for Saylor, who predicted in September that bitcoin could hit $13 million by 2045, which would equal 29% growth annually. "We'll just keep buying the top forever," he said in the same TV interview where he compared bitcoin to New York real estate. "Every day is a good day to buy bitcoin. We look at it as cyber-Manhattan." Saylor talks glowingly about bitcoin as the foundation of a new digital economy that will only get bigger. But even since his bitcoin strategy got underway in 2020, there have been pockets of severe pain for investors — the stock lost 74% of its value in 2022 before soaring the past two years. Still, he's advising companies to mimic his strategy. Microsoft didn't listen, but Saylor said there are plenty of "zombie companies," with core businesses that aren't going anywhere that could make better use of their cash. "The traditional advice would be, you do a transformational acquisition, you find that you need a merger partner. You're dead in the water. Go find somebody to merge with," Saylor said at the Lotte in September. "Bitcoin is the universal merger partner, right? The real appeal of digital capital is you can fix any company."

Change doesn’t always happen overnight… sometimes it takes an entire year. And you don’t have to be an expert reader of tea leaves to recognize that 2024 has been a pivot point for TV news. The steady accumulation of resignations, promotions, job changes, and corporate reorgs—as well as a few notable passings of celebrated journalists—over the past 12 months confirm that a very different landscape awaits the industry beyond that proverbial revolving door in 2025. To kick off the last full week of 2024, TVNewser looks back on some of the biggest departures, career relaunches, and shake-ups of this calendar year—and how they contributed to the larger climate of change around TV news.

Title: What's Happening With Visa Stock?

13 December 2024, Hesse, Wiesbaden: Boris Rhein (CDU), Minister President of Hesse, and Heike ... [+] Hofmann (SPD), Minister of Social Affairs of Hesse, jointly present the payment card for asylum seekers in the State Chancellery. Photo: Andreas Arnold/dpa (Photo by Andreas Arnold/picture alliance via Getty Images) Visa stock (NYSE: V) is up approximately 22% year-to-date compared to a 23% rise in the S&P500 index over the same period. Visa peer Mastercard (NYSE: MA) has returned about 23%. So what are some of the factors driving Visa stock’s performance of late? Also, see how another peer is doing in What’s New With American Express Stock? Visa outperformed the street estimates in the fourth quarter of FY 2024. It reported net revenues of $$9.6 billion, up 12% year-over-year. A couple of factors are driving growth for Visa. For one, cross-border volumes rose 13% year-over-year led by higher international travel as well as e-commerce growth. Total Processed Transactions, which refers to the transactions processed by Visa, were up by about 10%. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Earnings have also been trending higher with adjusted net income up by 13% year-over-year to $5.4 billion. Visa’s business model has high operating leverage, given the company’s expansive networks as well as high fixed costs and relatively lower variable costs compared to revenue. This means that profits can expand at a quicker pace compared to revenues. Visa’s Adjusted EPS rose by a stronger 14% due to a reduced share count, amid stock buybacks. Also, see what’s happening with the Capital One - Discover Merger. The decrease in V stock over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, although annual returns were considerably less volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 0% in 2021, -3% in 2022, and 26% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. So what’s the outlook like for Visa stock? Visa stock has seen some regulatory headwinds this year. The U.S. Justice Department accused Visa of illegally operating a monopoly in the debit market in the U.S. by unfairly suppressing competition. This was seen as a big setback for the company, which is the largest debit card player in the U.S. Moreover, the U.S. debit card business accounted for over 20% of the company’s global transactions. However, the stock has rebounded strongly since September as investors likely don’t see the issues as impacting Visa stock in the long run. For instance, the company could make some tweaks to operations in the U.S. debit market to promote more competitive behavior allowing it to continue business as usual. Moreover, the election of Donald Trump to the U.S. Presidency could signal an easier regulatory environment for financial players and there is a possibility that the antitrust climate could also ease. Separately, the Federal Reserve has also cut interest rates three times since September, and lower rates could likely drive consumer spending to an extent. This could reduce borrowing costs and in turn help drive up Visa’s transaction volumes. Visa has been doubling down on its shareholder returns. Share repurchases and dividends stood at $6.8 billion over the fourth quarter. Visa also recently raised its quarterly cash dividend by 13% to $0.59 per share We value Visa stock at about $309 per share, which is roughly in line with the current market price.

Title: The Lonely Skepticism of a Bull-Market Skeptic
URL: https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-financial-page/jeremy-grantham-is-still-waiting-for-the-bubble-to-pop
Time Published: 2024-12-23T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
As investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence, and lately for a Trump Presidency, has been driving the stock market to record highs this year, Jeremy Grantham has been having flashbacks. At the end of the nineteen-nineties, the veteran value investor—one that looks for undervalued stocks—shied away from soaring Internet and technology stocks, believing that their prices had departed from financial reality, and that the market was heading for a crash. Far from thanking him for sounding the alarm, many clients of G.M.O., a Boston-based investment-management firm that Grantham had co-founded, held it responsible for making them miss out on a vertiginous rise in the Nasdaq, which went up by about a hundred and sixty per cent between 1998 and 1999. Some withdrew their money from the company. “We started off in a good position, and in two years we lost almost half of our business,” Grantham recalled. “The clients treated us as if we’d done it deliberately. It was a near-catastrophe.” Fortunately for Grantham, his skepticism eventually proved well founded. In March, 2000, the dot-com bubble finally burst, and during the subsequent eighteen months the Nasdaq plunged about seventy per cent, inflicting huge losses on those who had got in near the market top. G.M.O.’s investments, which were positioned for the fall, actually made money during this torrid period, and the firm attracted a lot of new clients. “Suddenly, we were superheroes, and the whole thing turned out fine,” Grantham said. “But that was only possible because I was the boss, and I was putting a lot of pressure on people to double down.” A quarter of a century on, Grantham finds himself in a familiar position as a lonely bear in a market that he regards as a speculative bubble, but which so far has stubbornly defied his predictions of doom. In March of last year, he said that the S. & P. 500 could plunge by fifty per cent: since then, the index has risen by about that much. For this year, despite a tumble last week after the Federal Reserve indicated it will be cautious in cutting interest rates in 2025, the S. & P. 500 is up around twenty-four per cent, and the tech-laden Nasdaq is up nearly thirty-two per cent. Stock in Nvidia, which makes chips that are widely used in large-language A.I. models, has risen roughly a hundred and seventy per cent, and since October, 2022, the month before ChatGPT was released, it’s up tenfold. The firm now has a market capitalization of $3.2 trillion. Grantham is unchastened. These days, he has retired from day-to-day portfolio management. At G.M.O., he holds the title “long-term investment strategist,” and he is at pains to point out that he doesn’t speak for the firm. But when he called me the other morning from Mexico, where he had just arrived on a vacation, he expressed deep skepticism about an environment that has prompted many of his fellow-bears to recant. In an interview with Bloomberg earlier this month, Nouriel Roubini, an economist whose warnings before the financial crisis of 2008 earned him the nickname “Dr. Doom,” declared, “I would say I am not Dr. Doom: I am Dr. Realist.” Roubini, pointing to the impact of A.I. and other technological innovations, went on: “There are plenty of upsides in economic growth.” Another seasoned skeptic, David Rosenberg, of Rosenberg Research, posted an article on LinkedIn, “Lament of a Bear,” in which he wrote, “I have gained a greater appreciation that it is going to take a whole lot to upset this apple cart.” If there was a modest market correction in the near future, Rosenberg added, his inclination would be to “buy that dip.” Grantham said that he wasn’t surprised in the least to see some erstwhile bears now making optimistic noises. “The longer the bubble lasts, the more people have to throw in the towel for self-preservation reasons,” he said. “In general, in finance, opposing a bubble is not a survival strategy.” During the dot-com boom, many bearish voices on Wall Street fell silent, and some left their jobs, as their firms sought to profit from the boom by promoting or investing in Internet and tech stocks. In such situations, Grantham said, the competitive pressures and financial incentives to join the crowd can be overpowering. He also cited the real-estate bubble in the years leading up to 2007, when many big banks plunged into the business of cobbling together subprime-mortgage securities, only to get stuck with some of them on their balance sheets when the bubble burst and the securities became practically worthless. Initially, some of the banks had shied away from subprime, which involves lending to high-risk borrowers, but when they saw their competitors generating hefty profits, they felt obliged to join in. In a famous July, 2007, interview with the Financial Times, Chuck Prince, the chief executive of Citigroup, one of the firms that was subsequently bailed out by taxpayers, said, “As long as the music is playing, you’ve got to get up and dance. We’re still dancing.” After reminding me of this quote, Grantham commended Prince, kind of. “He got his timing wrong, but at least he was being honest,” Grantham said. That’s not to say, of course, that at least some of the analysts and investors who are still recommending (or buying) stock in such tech giants as Nvidia, Microsoft (up nearly a hundred per cent since October, 2022), Google (up more than a hundred and twenty-five per cent), and Meta (up more than five hundred per cent) don’t genuinely believe that A.I. will enable these firms, and others, to make much larger profits in the years ahead. Nvidia, for one, is already benefitting hugely from the boom. This past month, it reported net profits of $19.3 billion for its latest quarter, on revenues of thirty-five billion. On a year-over-year basis, its revenues and profits were both up by more than ninety per cent. Grantham can’t argue with these figures, obviously, and he doesn’t dispute the assessment that A.I. is a potentially transformative technology. Indeed, he agrees that it is. But he insisted that this doesn’t alter his view that the stock market is in a bubble, a judgment he said was based on his study of history as well as his own experiences. He pointed to elevated market-wide measures of valuation, such as the price-to-earnings ratio, that is the relationship of stock prices relative to corporate earnings. A rise in the P-E ratio indicates that stock prices are growing faster than earnings—a time-tested warning sign for bears like Grantham. Citing the work of his friend Edward Chancellor, a British financial historian, he also noted that the technology-based financial optimism prevalent on Wall Street has been characteristic of many speculative episodes, including the development of canals in England and railroads in the United States. “The more people believe that the technology is utterly transformative, and the more right they are, the more colossal the bubble becomes,” Grantham said. “Because the technology is so important, and is understood to be so important, it sucks in every last single dollar. And of course, A.I., in that sense, is the real McCoy.” Since November 6th, Trump’s election has only added to the euphoria on Wall Street, where many investors think that tax cuts and deregulation will prove to be another plus for the stock market. Grantham said that he hasn’t yet fully digested Trump’s election, but he regards it as a secondary factor in the market next to the A.I. frenzy, which he dated to the launch of ChatGPT, in November, 2022. During the preceding months, stocks had been falling, following the post-pandemic meme-stock phenomenon in 2021, but they were still highly valued relative to past experience. Grantham said that there is no historical precedent for a new bubble starting when stock prices were already so elevated. That sounded like yet another risk factor. But Grantham, despite his reputation as an überbear, isn’t predicting an immediate crash. Before he hung up and went to get his breakfast, I asked him about the takeaway from his analysis. “My attitude is ‘Watch your ass,’ ” he replied. “But can it go on for another year, to ruin any value investor who tries to oppose it? Absolutely it can.” ♦

Title: Retail Retreat: Shopify’s Checkout Woes Lead ‘Shop’ Pillar Drop in CE100 Index
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/connectedeconomy/2024/retail-retreat-shopifys-checkout-woes-lead-shop-pillar-drop-in-ce100-index/

Go figure. During the most intense shopping season of the year, the “Shop” pillar of the Connected Economy 100 went down 3.7% last week. It led the index down by 2.8%, as all the pillars dropped at about the same rate as the general markets. Within that Shop pillar, Shopify’s 5% stock price decrease stood out. A sweep of the week’s news finds that it might have taken a hit from some negative publicity surrounding its checkout policies. Shopify has barred merchants from automatically adding charges like insurance premiums to shoppers’ orders. According to a recent article in The Information an increasing number of merchants now offer delivery insurance, covering theft or damages to packages and often add the charges to orders. According to the article, “Such a trend threatens to upset Shopify’s shoppers, making them less likely to trust its Shop Pay checkout and to hurt its ability to sell its branded checkout to bigger merchants who don’t use its other services. That could hurt Shopify’s growth, which has surged this year — the company reported that revenue grew 23% in the first nine months of the year to $6 billion. That fueled a 41% increase in its stock price, lifting Shopify’s market capitalization to $142 billion. In the “Bank” pillar, a 3.4% drop was accelerated by a 7.5 drop at Ally Bank. According to Marketbeat, analysts have weighed in with mixed reviews on Ally Financial, with several adjusting their price targets amid shifting market conditions. Bank of America revised its price objective downward, from $46 to $37, while maintaining a “buy” rating in a Sept. 11 report. Royal Bank of Canada reaffirmed its “outperform” rating and set a $40 target price in an Oct. 21 note. TD Cowen followed suit on Sept. 23, lowering its price target from $45 to $37 and shifting to a “hold” stance. BTIG Research downgraded the stock from “buy” to “neutral” on Sept. 16. Wells Fargo took a more bearish view, cutting its target price from $37 to $32 and assigning an “underweight” rating on Sept. 26. Of the analysts covering Ally Financial, one rates the stock a “sell,” nine suggest “hold,” and eight recommend “buy,” according to MarketBeat.com. The consensus rating stands at “hold,” with an average price target of $42.14. The “Live” pillar was also down 3.4%, led by a big 15.1% plunge at iRobot. The company, manufacturer of the Roomba vacuum and other in-home robotics, is in turnaround mode featuring a series of executive changes, and said so during its recent Q3 earnings call. “We continue to make progress on our turnaround strategy,” said Gary Cohen, iRobot’s CEO. “In the third quarter, we expanded our non-GAAP gross margin by 590 basis points year over year and improved our use of operating cash. However, our overall results did not meet the expectations we set in August, as persistent market segment and competitive headwinds impacted our sell-through performance. “Although we now expect it will take more time to stabilize our revenue trend, we are on track to exceed our operating expense targets for the year, while at the same time continuing to invest in areas that are expected to drive growth.” The “Move” pillar dropped 3.4% as well. It was led downward by a 13% drop at freight transport provider XPO. Some analysts see a potential hit coming from the Trump administration’s threatened tariffs. But most analysts are bullish on the stock. Marketbeat said, “Freight transporters like XPO Inc. NYSE: XPO and Old Dominion Freight Line Inc. NASDAQ: ODFL provide less-than-truckload (LTL) service domestically and internationally, making them a critical part of the process of connecting manufacturers with end customers. Of these firms, XPO stands out for its strong performance in the last year (shares of XPO are up 57% for the year as of Dec. 20, while ODFL has declined by more than 9% over the same period).” Finally, the “Be Well” pillar took a 3.3% hit led by continued troubles at Aetna CVS, down 10%. Last week, it announced that it had expanded its health app’s functionality to include Spanish language support, aiming to enhance accessibility for its diverse member base. Spanish-speaking users can access features such as personalized health information, medication reminders, and telemedicine services in their preferred language. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Nine Dividend Growth Stocks Raising Dividends Last Week

I am a long term buy and hold investor who focuses on dividend growth stocks I review the list of dividend increases, as part of my monitoring process. This exercise helps me monitor existing holdings and identify companies for further research. This exercise is also a good handle of how I review companies quickly, before deciding if they are worth further research or not. In general, I look for companies that have raised dividends for at least a decade. This provides signaling value to me as to the type of company and types of cashflows. Next, I look at the trends in earnings per share over the past decade. This helps me see if the dividend increases are based on improvements in the business profitability. Without growth in earnings per share, future dividend growth will be limited. Next, I also look at the most recent dividend increase, and compare it to the 5 and/or 10 year average. I look at that in conjunction with the trends in earnings per share. It's also helpful to look at the payout ratio, and trends in it, in order to evaluate dividend safety. It all comes down together, into one picture, if yo look at all those factors together. Of course, even the best fundamental story is not worth overpaying for. One needs to look at valuation, and determine whether this business is a good value today, or would be a good value at a lower price somewhere down the road.

Title: The Top 10 Book Business News Stories of 2024 [Publishers Weekly]

1. The Distribution Sector Dealt with Disorder Shrinking distribution options created an ever-more challenging landscape, especially for independent publishers, throughout the year. The situation has become serious enough for indie publishers that the heads of various associations and smaller presses are working on various plans to offer indie presses more distribution options. The challenging distribution landscape took center stage in March, when Small Press Distribution abruptly shut down after struggling for years to remain a viable distributor for small, and mainly literary, presses. Earlier in the year, in an effort to modernize SPD’s nonprofit operations, its executive director, Kent Watson, moved to outsource the actual warehousing and distribution of clients’ books to Ingram Content Group and Publishers Storage and Shipping in hopes of upgrading the services it could provide. But facing a combination of a decline in grants, slow sales, and the cost of moving warehouses, SPD fell into too deep a financial hole. The company filed for dissolution shortly after. The bulk of SPD’s clients were small, and drew little interest from the more established distributors, many of which are now part of large trade publishers. A few smaller companies, such as Asterism, moved to fill the void, and while many presses found new homes, they incurred extra costs nonetheless. In November, National Book Network—which, with about 150 clients, was one of the few remaining larger independent distributors—announced that it too would close, offering its publishers the chance to move to Simon & Schuster Distribution Services before it ceased operations in 2025. In a letter to clients explaining the decision, NBN executives wrote that, with large publishers and Ingram Publisher Services now dominating distribution, “smaller players such as NBN find it difficult to match the economies of scale that the big boys enjoy just by virtue of their size.” 2. The Influence of AI Exploded, for Better and Worse The implications of the impact of generative artificial intelligence on numerous publishing practices—from administrative tasks to content creation—simmered throughout the year. At the annual meeting of the Association of American Publishers, CEO Maria Pallante called the current period “the most complex time in the history of publishing.” She said that the principal challenge facing the publishing community at present is to advocate for new laws and policies that can protect copyright industries as changes in technology move at a rapid pace. At the same time, publishing leaders acknowledged that, in the words of Authors Guild CEO Mary Rasenberger, the industry “can’t bury our heads in the sand. AI is here to stay.” Rasenberger made her comments following the November disclosure that HarperCollins had signed a three-year licensing agreement with a large tech company, reported to be Microsoft. Under the opt-in agreement, the company would pay HC $5,000 apiece for any nonfiction book that it used to train its large language models, to be split between HC and authors. While HC is the first trade publisher to sign such an AI agreement, academic and professional publishers including Taylor & Francis and Wiley had previously reached deals of their own, with Wiley signing two agreements worth a total of $44 million. Meanwhile, copyright lawsuits filed against various tech companies continued to work their way through the courts in 2024, and the Authors Guild filed a new lawsuit accusing AI startup Anthropic of copyright infringement for allegedly training its AI tools on books without authorization. In an effort to alleviate the need for lawsuits, a number of startups were launched this year, including Created By Humans, a company launched by Scribd cofounder Trip Adler. The company, which has since partnered with the Authors Guild, aims to serve as a bridge between creators and tech companies interested in licensing rights to use in training their large language models. 3. Book Publishing’s Freedom to Read Efforts In the teeth of a years-long political attack targeting libraries and the freedom to read, publishers have stepped up with several legal actions, and in 2024 those actions yielded some positive results. In Texas, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court decision to block key provisions of HB 900, Texas’s controversial book rating law, in January. The court agreed with plaintiff publishers and booksellers that the law—which would have required vendors to rate every book sold for sexual content or be banned from doing business with Texas schools—likely violated the First Amendment. In Iowa, the Eighth Circuit delivered a mixed decision in August, vacating an injunction in a publisher-led lawsuit over the state’s book banning law SF 496, but at the same time rejecting the state’s core argument: that decisions about library books are “government speech” and thus not subject to First Amendment scrutiny. In Florida, a federal judge allowed a lawsuit led by Penguin Random House over book bans in Escambia County to proceed, expressing skepticism over the county's government speech argument. At a pre-trial conference in December, judge T. Kent Wetherell, a Trump appointee, urged county officials to settle the case. Finally, in Arkansas on December 23, a federal judge permanently struck down two key provisions of Arkansas’s controversial “harmful to minors” law, known as Act 372, after issuing a preliminary injunction in July 2023, finding the law to be unconstitutional. Still, there is plenty more freedom to read drama on tap in 2025. As of this writing, the Fifth Circuit is once again considering the government speech argument via a closely-watched book banning case in rural Llano County, Tex., in which county officials have argued that the Fifth Circuit should reverse its own decades-old holding in Campbell v. St. Tammany Parish School Board, a 1995 decision that has long served as an anti-censorship bulwark for librarians. And in Florida, six major publishers have filed a major challenge to two provisions of the state’s “harmful to minors” law, HB 1069, arguing that the law’s unconstitutionally vague language has led to thousands of books—including many classics—being pulled from classroom and school libraries. Meanwhile, in a significant move, Penguin Random House—by far the publisher most active in taking up the freedom to read battle—hired a new senior level policy manager to help fight book bans, a sign that the publisher is interested in getting more upstream in the political and legislative battles over books, rather than having to sue later. 4. Protests over War in Palestine Roiled PEN America The deep political divisions in the country led to the cancellation of the PEN America Literary Awards this year, as well as the organization’s World Voices Festival. The cancellation of the awards ceremony followed months of steadily mounting criticism of PEN America over its response to Israel’s war in Gaza that culminated in 28 authors withdrawing books from consideration for the awards, including nine of the 10 authors nominated for the organization's top prize, the PEN/Jean Stein Book Award. The cancellation of what would have been the 20th edition of the World Voices Festival followed the same lines: criticism of PEN’s response to the crisis in Gaza led to widespread withdrawals by authors who were set to attend the event. As 2024 drew to a close, PEN announced that Suzanne Nossel, who had led the nonprofit for more than a decade and was the focus of much of the criticism of the organization, was stepping down as CEO, and would take the helm of the human rights nonprofit Freedom House on January 7. Chief program officers Summer Lopez and Clarissa Rosaz Shariyf are serving as interim co-CEOs as the free speech organization conducts a nationwide search for its next leader. 5. Hachette Book Group Changed Shape, with Some Growing Pains Penguin Random House and HarperCollins began extensive reorganization efforts in 2023, as did Hachette Book Group, which initiated its own wide-ranging restructuring program beginning with the move last November by parent company Hachette Livre to bring the Hachette Book Group and its U.K.-based counterpart, Hachette UK, under “a new English-language management structure,” with UK CEO David Shelley taking the helm for both companies. In 2024, HBG continued an extensive restructuring that lasted into late summer. A centerpiece of the restructuring was the further integration of Workman Publishing, which HBG had acquired in 2021 and agreed, as part of the deal, to keep all Workman employees for three years. As part of the reorganization, which involved layoffs in the Workman division, Algonquin Books was moved into Little, Brown, reporting to newly appointed president and publisher Sally Kim. Algonquin Young Readers was likewise moved into Little, Brown Books for Young Readers, where it was placed under president and publisher Megan Tingley. The Hachette Books and Hachette Go imprints were also dissolved as part of the restructuring. Workman Publishing Group EVP and publisher Susan Weinberg is set to retire at the end of 2024, and Kristin Kiser, SVP and publisher of the Running Press Group, will become president and publisher of a new division, called the Workman Running Press Group, effective January 1. Sources explained that the makeover of HBG was designed to promote “key team members” and add “extra roles” in “areas where the market is strong” while "cutting back in areas where the market has weakened.” Another big move at HBG, in September, was the return of Reagan Arthur, to lead an as-yet-unnamed boutique imprint at the Grand Central Publishing Group and edit major authors across HBG’s publishing divisions. The news, which broke in July, came just shy of two months after Arthur, along with former Pantheon and Schocken SVP and publisher Lisa Lucas, was dismissed from the Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group. HBG ended the year with a reaffirmation of its commitment to the American trade publishing business when it acquired Union Square Publishing from Barnes & Noble. Under the purchase, all staff, publishing assets, and trademarks of Union Square Publishing, formerly Sterling Publishing Co., were transferred to HBG. 6. Consolidation Continued, and Job Loss With It HBG’s purchase of Union Square was just one of the many acquisitions that have consolidated the publishing industry over the decades. A PW analysis of government statistics found that the number of people employed in book publishing in the U.S. fell to 54,822 in 2023, down from 91,100 in 1997. If accurate, that represents a loss of about 40% of traditional publishing jobs in less than 30 years. In addition to consolidation—and prior to the rise of AI—new technology has helped to make publishing more efficient than it was during its period of peak employment. These new technologies, along with the retooling the industry underwent following the Great Recession of 2007–2009, are among the major factors in the business’s shrinking workforce. Still, despite the significant decline in publishing jobs, industry sales are growing—although that growth is not keeping up with inflation. While publishing industry data is notoriously tricky to pin down, given shifting accounting methods and data sources, the trend lines are nevertheless clear: book publishing employment has dropped by about a third, and sales have, albeit modestly, continued to tick up. 7. Spotify Shook Up the Audiobook Market Spotify entered the U.S. audiobook market in November 2023, offering more than 200,000 audiobook titles at launch, and its presence had a big effect on sales of the format in 2024. Under Spotify’s model, premium paid subscribers are allotted 15 hours per month to access digital audiobooks, with users able to pay $10.99 to “top off" their time with 10-hour blocks if they wish to keep listening. In the spring, Spotify added a new audiobook subscription tier, dubbed the Audiobooks Access Tier, offering a slightly less expensive but more limited option for users interested in streaming audiobooks on the platform. Industry executives have credited Spotify’s entrance with helping to keep the long-running audiobook sales boom moving forward in 2024. According to the AAP’s StatShot program, sales of audiobooks were up 27% in the first nine months of 2024 over the comparable period a year ago, with digital audio sales at reporting publishers topping sales of e-books. Though it hasn’t released sales figures, in April, Spotify published data suggesting that audiobooks are proving successful in terms of attracting listeners: since launching its audiobooks program last fall, the company said, one quarter of Spotify Premium users had "engaged" with audiobooks. The company has 602 million monthly active users worldwide, 236 million of which are paying subscribers, but it does not offer specific data for the U.S. market. In addition to delivering new customers and new sales of its own, Spotify is also credited by industry insiders with forcing Audible to increase its marketing support for audiobooks. More than one attendee at the Frankfurt Book Fair commented on the size of the Audible stand at this year’s event, and an even more important sign as to how seriously Audible and its corporate parent, Amazon, are taking the Spotify challenge came in November, when Amazon Music Unlimited made it possible for users in the U.S., U.K., and Canada to listen to one audiobook per month from Audible's catalog for free. 8. Major Shifts Hit North American Bookstore Chains North America’s two largest bookstore chains headed in different directions in 2024. Under the direction of James Daunt and backed by its owner, private equity firm Elliott Advisors, Barnes & Noble embarked on its most aggressive store opening program in many years. The retailer opened about 30 outlets in 2023 and, after initially planning to open 50 stores in 2024, Daunt raised his target number to 60 in early November, noting that strong sales at B&N’s existing outlets encouraged him to be more aggressive in 2024. (B&N began 2024 with 609; it is not yet clear what its final number of stores will be at the end of 2024, once store closings are factored in.) In another sign of the health of the retailer, B&N acquired the Tattered Cover, the 53-year-old Denver bookstore chain known for its staunch defense of the freedom to read, for $1.83 million in June. Tattered Cover retained a majority of its 70 employees across its four Colorado locations along with its name and branding, in keeping with a strategy Daunt has followed when acquiring such venerable U.K. brands as Blackwell’s, Hatchards, Foyles, and Hodges Figgis. Despite its successes, B&N did suffer one major loss this year, when Len Riggio, who revolutionized the bookselling business—first by making B&N the dominant bookstore chain in the U.S. and then by opening hundreds of superstores—died on August 27 at age 83. While B&N grew in 2024, Indigo Books & Music, Canada’s largest bookseller, underwent a retrenching. In May, a group of investors led by Canadian billionaire Gerald Schwartz, an Indigo board member and the husband of Indigo founder and CEO Heather Reisman, acquired the company and returned it to private control. The acquisition followed an extraordinarily difficult few years for the retailer, beginning with declining sales through its physical bookstores during the pandemic and a cyberattack that crippled its e-book sales. Indigo's sales slump continued through the final quarter of 2023, when revenue dropped 12%, and its net income in the period fell to C$10 million, from C$34.3 million in the last quarter of 2022. 9. Religion Book Sales Have a Stellar Showing While trade sales in general have struggled to reach the highs of the early pandemic years, one category has done very well: religion books. According to the AAP, sales of religion books rose 7% in 2023, easily beating the 0.8% decline in overall sales. Sales stayed strong in 2024 and were up 18.5% through October, with Bibles as the main engine drivers, according to executives in the sector. Doug Lockhart, SVP of sales and marketing for HarperCollins Christian Publishing, told PW that he was not surprised by the Bible bump: "There's a lot of angst in the world today, and people are looking for answers." The sales momentum in the religion category was strong enough to convince PRH, in October, to launch the Penguin Random House Christian Publishing Group, a new standalone entity that will expand and build upon on the publisher’s existing evangelical Christian publishing programs. According to the announcement, the expansion involves several personnel moves and additional resources devoted to the company's Waterbrook & Multnomah, Image, and Forum imprints. The group is being led by Campbell Wharton, who has been promoted to SVP. 10. Traditional Publishing Heavyweights Went Hybrid The challenges facing traditional publishing in the post-pandemic years has led more and more industry insiders to try their hand at nontraditional methods of putting out books. While hybrid publishing has been around for years, it received a jolt of media attention in March, with the formation of Authors Equity. The company was cofounded by former PRH US CEO Madeline McIntosh, who serves as its CEO, with Nina von Moltke, the previous president and director of strategic development at PRH US, as its president, and Don Weisberg, the former CEO of Macmillan, as senior advisor. Among the company’s initial financial backers were five authors, including James Clear, Louise Penny, and Tim Ferriss. Like other hybrid publishers, Authors Equity offers no advances, but pays authors a higher percentage of a book’s profits than the percentages offered in traditional contracts used by the large publishers. In addition to giving authors the chance to earn more money—while relieving the publisher of paying upfront advances—another difference the company’s founders cited from traditional houses was a commitment to “long-term collaboration" with authors and plans to give books the time and attention to find an audience. Along those lines, the publisher pledged to offer its authors “flexibility” and “transparency” in the publishing process, making decisions jointly in the best interests of each book. “We’re in it from day one," the founders promised, "and for the long haul."

Title: Wells Fargo Says It’s Quitting Climate-Banking Group

Wells Fargo & Co. said it’s leaving the world’s biggest climate alliance for banks, in the latest sign that Wall Street is breaking away from such groups. The company said in a statement Friday that it ended its membership in the Net-Zero Banking Alliance. The bank, based in San Francisco, didn’t provide an explanation for its decision. Wells Fargo’s departure follows Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which announced earlier this month that it was quitting NZBA. Financial companies have been under increasing pressure from Republican lawmakers, which have launched investigations and filed lawsuits related to the industry’s efforts to address climate change. The House Judiciary Committee, led by Ohio Republican Jim Jordan, said last week that it’s found “substantial evidence of collusion and anticompetitive behavior” by financial companies. Separately, BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. have been sued by a group of states led by Texas for allegedly breaking antitrust laws by boosting electricity prices through their investments. In a report, Jordan’s committee specifically criticized financial environmental alliances, saying they have created what it calls “a climate cartel.” NZBA is part of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, which was launched ahead of a key climate summit in Scotland in 2021. Back then, the world’s biggest lenders, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc., joined the coalition. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a statement that Wells Fargo’s withdrawal from NZBA was linked to his office’s review of the bank’s “status as a potential boycotter of energy companies.” “I urge other financial institutions to follow their example and end ESG (environmental, social and governance) policies that are hostile to our critical oil and gas industries” Paxton said. Wells Fargo’s decision was based on the company’s internal analysis, said a person familiar with the matter who declined to be identified. A spokesman for NZBA said in a statement that Wells Fargo’s departure was “based on its own individual circumstances.” He added that five banks have left the group since it started in 2021, while more than 100 have joined. NZBA’s member banks have made “significant progress” in setting net zero targets, he said. Wells Fargo is one of the largest financiers for the fossil-fuel industry. It ranks as the second-leading arranger of bonds and loans for oil, gas and coal companies since the start of the decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. JPMorgan is first. Banks and money managers have been defecting from other climate groups in increasing numbers amid GOP-led pressure. This month, Franklin Templeton said it was leaving Climate Action 100+, which was created to press high-polluting companies to curb their emissions. The investment firm two years ago hired Anne Simpson, who was the first chair of CA100+, as its global head of sustainability. (The NZBA is part of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, which is co-chaired by Mark Carney, who is chair of Bloomberg Inc. and a former Bank of England governor, and Michael R.

Title: Compulsion No, Opportunity Yes in the Delaware Law of Externalities
URL: https://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu/2024/12/23/compulsion-no-opportunity-yes-in-the-delaware-law-of-externalities/

One distinctive feature of the U.S. economy over recent decades has been the rise of the entrepreneur-dominated public company. This development has derived largely from the growth of private funding available through venture capital, so that initial public offerings have commonly served as a “harvesting” moment for the venture capital investors rather than a fund-raising vehicle that would dilute the entrepreneur’s control position. Moreover, the success of the Google IPO in 2004 provided market validation for the entrepreneur’s use of dual class common stock as a way of retaining control while retaining considerably less than 50 percent of the cash flow rights of the public company. The entrepreneur’s “idiosyncratic vision” has also received its celebration in the academic world.[1] We commonly think of corporate law and governance as focused on managerial agency costs, given management’s self-interest and the monitoring challenges faced by diffuse public shareholders. These concerns feature most prominently in the fiduciary duty doctrines that address defensive measures against an unsolicited takeover offer or a control contest through the proxy system. Controlling entrepreneurs present a quite different set of challenges for corporate law and governance. Controllers may limit managerial agency costs, but their self-interest produces so-called controlling shareholder agency costs.[2] Alongside the rise of a new class of controllers has been a fundamental change in capital markets: the rise of portfolio investing, whether through asset managers or self-help portfolio construction, that captures the insight that investors can achieve higher risk-adjusted returns through a strategy of diversification that smooths out firm-specific risk.[3] A specialized financial intermediary, the asset manager, has exploded in significance.[4] These capital market developments came to the Delaware courts this year in a way that produced a series of unusually important cases: In re Match Group, Inc. Derivative. Litig.[5] arguably expanded the range of controller-driven transactions that require heightened procedural measures to achieve business judgment rule protection; Tornetta v. Musk[6] looked beyond a bright-line test of equity ownership percentage in deciding whether a CEO had “control;” and W. Palm Beach Fire Fighter’ Pension Fund v. Moelis & Co.[7] held that control-shifting shareholder agreements were inconsistent with board-centric provisions of Delaware law. Moelis was subsequently overruled by legislative amendment.[8] Finally there was McRitchie v. Zuckerberg,[9] holding that a company’s board and officers are not obligated as a matter of fiduciary duty to pursue a strategy that would accommodate the purported interests of the company’s shareholder majority of fully diversified investors (“portfolio investors”) in reducing externalities but rather should pursue a “single firm” or “firm-specific” strategy. This outcome is hardly a surprise, but the broad phrasing of the opinion casts some unwonted shade on the also axiomatic obverse proposition – that a board may, shielded by the business judgment rule, take account of the interests and desires of the dominant portfolio investors in pursuing a business strategy. It is directors’ discretion shielded by the business judgment rule but subject to the legitimating acquiescence of shareholders that is Delaware’s gift to the current debate over corporate behavior. As a bonus, although rejecting compulsion by judicial fiat, the court sketches explicit private-ordering routes under Delaware law to compel management of the firm, as a fiduciary duty matter, in light of the interests of fully diversified investors. The opinion includes a cautionary reflection on the limits of corporate law, at least the law of a single small state, as a lever for the pursuit of pro-social objectives. This is the recent case that I think offers the deepest dive into the possibilities and limits of Delaware corporate law. Compliments must be paid to the cleverness of the McRitchie complaint in two respects. First, it argues that the traditional framing of the directors’ duties in terms of “the corporation and its shareholders” means that at least in cases where the shareholder majority is fully diversified portfolio investors, the directors and officers need to manage by taking account of those shareholders’ portfolio interests. Second, because the directors and officers and controlling shareholder have concentrated investments in the specific firm – here Meta—their interests conflict with the interests of the portfolio investors, and thus they bear the burden of showing “entire fairness” in their chosen strategy. The court rejects plaintiff’s first move as a kind of a pun. “The corporation and its shareholders” necessarily refer to shareholders in the single firm model, and no one would think otherwise, much as a fish has no concept of an environment other than “water.”[10] The court handles plaintiff’s second move with a jujitsu sidestep, arguing that the equity interests held by Zuckerberg, the officers and the directors actually align their interests with their fiduciary duties as seen from the firm-specific perspective. But of course there is a conflict, as there is with virtually every situation of a controller, who directly or indirectly will extract some private benefits of control. A permissible level of private benefit extraction is explicitly and implicitly allowed in the cases. Explicit private benefit extraction is at the core of the seminal case of Sinclair Oil Corp. v. Levien,[11] in which the Sinclair parent used its control over its partially owned Venezuelan subsidiary Sinven to produce a dividend payout of virtually all Sinven’s profits, which had the effect of denying Sinven the freedom to pursue energy opportunities outside of Venezuela. Because the dividends were paid out pro rata – one share, one dollar – the Delaware Supreme Court held that the dividend payout decision was not “self-dealing” and was subject to permissive business judgment review. By contrast, the cancelling of a contractual obligation owed by Sinclair to Sinven – which would have resulted in disparate pecuniary treatment – was self-dealing and thus triggered “entire fairness” review. It is of course plain that in resolving the conflict of interest between the controller and the public minority shareholders, the court rejected the “firm specific” test. The dividend payout did not maximize Sinven’s value as a public company. Nor as a normative matter should this necessarily trouble us. As Gilson and Gordon (2003) argue, this deviation in favor of the controller reflects an allowable level of private benefits that would compensate the (undiversified) controller for extra risk-bearing while providing a benefit to the public (diversified) shareholders in the control of managerial agency costs.[12] Implicit private benefit extraction is at the core of Mendel v. Carroll.[13] The controlling Carroll family made a take-private proposal for Katy Industries at a price negotiated with the special committee of $25.75 per share, thus presumably triggering the board’s Revlon duty to obtain the highest value for shareholders. Overbidders arrived. The Pensler-Steinhardt group offered $27.80 per share for all shares and asked for an option exercisable at the deal price that would enable it to prevail over the expected opposition of the Carroll family. The Carroll family withdrew its proposal, and the court refused to order the board to grant the dilutive option. Chancellor Allen decided against granting the injunction on the ground that the Carroll family simply valued its control block at more than $25.75 a share. Perhaps the family had private information about the value of the firm, but this presumably would have been elicited in the special committee’s scrutiny of the initial take-private offer. Instead, the family valued the pecuniary and non-pecuniary private benefits of control by more than the offered price.[14] In short, we are far from assuming there is no conflict between controllers and public shareholders just because the controller owns shares. Moreover, validating the controller’s utility function would not necessarily produce the highest value from a firm-specific perspective. [15] Maybe we can put aside the controller cases on the ground that the conflicting shareholder interests in these cases are still about allocation of the pecuniary and non-pecuniary elements flowing from the specific firm and not about increasing the value of other investments of the controller. But this doesn’t do justice to the objection. Sinclair wanted the dividends from Sinven precisely because it wanted to make investments elsewhere in its portfolio of opportunities. Controllers commonly control dividend payouts (or stock repurchases) with the rest of their portfolio in mind. Thus the controller cases show us that the court is incorrect about the incentive alignment of the controller’s stock ownership and also about the demands of a single-firm approach. But those cases show that the plaintiff is wrong too. The corporate world is filled with cases in which controllers bring a multi-dimensional objective function to the operation of the firm, but those decisions are routinely thought of as presenting business-judgment-rule questions only, assuming no blatant skewing of pecuniary payouts.[16] The court cites many cases of different scenarios that employ specific-firm rhetoric, more obviously prioritizing the interests of shareholders over stakeholders (as in Revlon) but implicitly seeming to rule out consideration of the shareholders’ other investments. As a doctrinal matter, this may be mechanically accurate but functionally wrong. Let’s take the easiest case, the forms of corporate governance. Firms typically adopt governance attributes (e.g., single class board; annual say-on-pay; various board committees and leadership structure) because these are regarded as “best practices” by fully diversified shareholders looking to maximize performance across a portfolio of firms without the costly work that would be required for firm-specific tailoring.[17] Boards commonly acquiesce to such shareholder preferences even when they subjectively believe that alternative arrangements would be superior on a single-firm basis. More fundamentally, firms pick their business strategies to accommodate the interests of shareholders who they know are diversified portfolio investors. This is how I have developed the point previously: We have also accepted without question allowing the risk preferences of diversified investors to shape our theory of optimal firm structure in a way that has firm-specific consequences.[18] Diversification at the portfolio level means that such shareholders disfavor diversification at the firm level, biasing the firm against conglomeration and other diversification measures that may reduce the financial distress risk at the own-firm level and may thus increase costs for the undiversified shareholders. Diversified investors encourage risk taking at the firm level to maximize own-firm expected returns, despite the greater own-firm solvency risks, on the view that this strategy will increase expected returns across the portfolio. As part of this approach to risk, diversified investors push for cash distributions despite the increased own-firm risks. Portfolio investors are not mere kibitzers with talking points; their support is a crucial factor in the success of hedge fund activists who commonly push these strategies on target firms.[19] The say-on-pay mechanism is another vehicle by which portfolio investors promote the pursuit of a particular strategy of maximization. These theoretical understandings do not obligate the directors or officers as a matter of fiduciary duty to follow (or avoid) particular business strategies in their management of the firm, but the observed pattern of M&A activity (including divestitures) shows how directors and officers have chosen to accommodate the objectives of portfolio investors. Inevitably there will be a conflict between the interests of diversified and undiversified investors on this dimension. It turns out that a portfolio approach is embedded at the core of ‘shareholder wealth maximization,” as it is commonly understood, in light of how portfolio theory is critically involved in stock price formation.[20]Modern Portfolio Theory holds that investors are compensated for bearing risk, but only for risk that cannot be diversified away.[21] This is operationalized through specific pricing models like the well-known “Capital Asset Pricing Model” (“CAPM”). Thus market prices of specific securities are set on the assumption that investors are holding such shares in a well-diversified portfolio. Firms trying to “maximize shareholder value” will avoid unrelated diversification, the effect of which may be to reduce own-firm risk but at cost of local inefficiencies in managing a conglomerate enterprise, resulting in a stock price penalty. This follows from a price formation process that assumes idiosyncratic risk can be substantially eliminated through portfolio diversification. More generally, when managers are trying to “maximize shareholder value” for a widely held public company they cannot escape the portfolio structure of share ownership and will almost invariably be acting at the behest of portfolio investors. In short, what may serve the interests of portfolio investors will often disserve the interests of the undiversified. In this important respect, there is no such thing as a “single firm focus.”[22] Rather, at most it is what could be described as a “single firm focus constrained by awareness that the majoritarian shareholders are portfolio investors and their interests are best served by a firm strategy that in significant respects takes that fact into account. But perhaps there is less conflict than one might think between maximizing on a firm-specific basis and taking account of the objective function of portfolio investors. If pricing of the firm’s stock is embedded in Modern Portfolio Theory, then running the firm in accord with the preferences of portfolio investors may well produce the highest stock price. But note, while this might produce the best risk-adjusted returns for the portfolio investor, it will not for the undiversified investor, who may have a substantial investment in the specific firm. So this conclusion follows: The doctrinal framing of the board’s role in terms of a single-firm model casts a veil over how board decisions are commonly made, which takes account of the desires and interests of the firm’s dominant, sometimes controlling but sometimes fully diversified, shareholders. The McRitchie court is plainly correct that a board cannot be compelled, as a matter of Delaware fiduciary law, to take account of the interests of diversified investors in the management of the firm, particularly as regards externalities and even patently obvious systemic externalities such as climate change. But the court’s rhetoric goes too far in its insistence on an exclusively firm-specific focus. Surely the firm can seek to avoid externalities, including the systemic externalities that diversified investors will be keenest to avoid. Delaware fiduciary law does not require profit maximization at the cost of what the board determines are externalities that it wants to avoid. More generally the board has freedom under the umbrella of the business judgment rule, certainly if framed as in consideration of the long term as well as the short term, to take into account the pecuniary and non-pecuniary interests of the actual shareholders of the company. So if the board can consider the interests of the shareholders who are controllers, it ought to be able to consider the interests of the shareholders who are diversified portfolio investors. As noted above, this already occurs. The key question is preserving the legitimacy of directors in taking these actions. This is why the integrity of shareholder voting is critical and must be protected. This has been acknowledged in Delaware, most recently in the striking down of anti-activist pills[23] but also more broadly.[24] At the end of McRitchie v. Zuckerberg, Vice Chancellor Laster plays a trump card in turning down plaintiff’s request for an injunction that would impose affirmative duties on a board and management to reduce externalities. Such a mandatory approach is not sustainable, he says. Objecting corporations and shareholders would simply leave. Delaware corporate law does not provide the lever to force corporations to take what at least some shareholders regard as a more pro-social approach. For scholars of corporate law and governance VC Laster’s final paragraphs on the plaintiff’s claim are sobering: By explicitly rejecting the notion that a board of directors can act loyally when consciously deciding to violate positive law in pursuit of greater profits, Delaware ensures that positive laws and regulations have bite. Through those laws and regulations, governments can impose meaningful restrictions on externalities. Through its corporate law, Delaware supports those efforts. It is frankly difficult for Delaware to use corporate law to do more. Reformers who look to Delaware law to address externalities must acknowledge the larger political environment. Delaware is one of fifty states, each of which can offer entities embodying different corporate law packages. Delaware is not California. Among the fifty states, Delaware has one of the smaller human populations (only around one million souls), one of the smallest geographical areas (albeit conveniently located), and a relatively small economy (though mighty in spirit). Delaware does not have the market power to force anyone to use its corporations, its law, or its courts. Delaware must identify niches where it has a comparative advantage—like corporate law—so that entrepreneurs want to use its corporations, legal practitioners want to choose its law, and parties want to litigate in its courts. Delaware has traditionally filled the corporate law niche by taking a distinctively nonpartisan, technocratic approach. Delaware seeks to supply corporate practitioners with a flexible legal framework, broadly enabling in character but subject to some mandatory floors, that gives managers (framed broadly) expansive discretion to take risks and pursue profit, while at the same time protecting the legitimate rights and expectations of investors. Delaware has not used its corporate law to address hot-button social issues or to intervene in societal debates. Depending on an observer’s political leanings, there are any number of salient issues that Delaware might use its corporate law to address. But to the extent the General Assembly sought to intervene on any of them, entrepreneurs who did not like the answer could incorporate their firms elsewhere. Strong externality regulation is just one example. If the General Assembly sought to make Delaware the externality regulatory for the country (or the world), corporations who did not agree could readily opt out. The lesson is a broader one. State-based corporate law in general, and Delaware law in particular, is a poor vehicle for addressing externalities. Delaware law mandates that its entities and the fiduciaries who manage them comply with positive law. That legal requirement promotes legal compliance in its own right, while also providing a mechanism for holding fiduciaries accountable when they knowingly cause an entity to violate positive law. To ask more from state-based corporate law is to pick the wrong tool for the job.[25] So: “’Delaware law does not charter law breakers,”’[26] and officers and directors may incur liability in a derivative suit if they intentionally violate the law, and, it seems, if they egregiously fail in their oversight duty with respect to compliance. In this way Delaware corporate law sails parallel to the democratic process that enacted these laws. In In re Match Group, Inc. Derivative. Litig and in Tornetta v. Musk, we learned that Delaware facilitates shareholder democracy by relying on shareholders to determine the decision rule in a contested fiduciary duty case where, but only where, appropriate disclosure and process have been followed. In McRitchie v. Zuckerberg we learned that the court will honor shareholder decisions to redraw corporate purposes and the board’s duties in the corporation’s foundation documents but will not “blue pencil” those measures through law-like imposition. While Delaware corporate law is not a tool to compel what some might regard as pro-social behavior (other than compliance with law),Delaware would permit directors broad discretion in deciding which externalities to address and to what extent and would treat this permission as subject not to judicial review but to shareholder acquiescence. That leaves ample space for shareholders to petition, for directors to act, and for shareholders, through the processes of corporate democracy, to have the last word.

Assume the target has 100 shares outstanding. Controller owns 50, the public owns 50, the stock trades at $10 per share, based on the company’s expected future cash flows. The controller deems its private benefits are worth $1.50 per share. A prospective bidders believe it can improve the company’s operations by 10 percent and so is prepared to bid up to $11 a share for all shares. The controller refuses, even though the company would, on a cash flow basis, be more valuable after the transaction. [16] The complaint is oddly framed in terms of externalities without any obvious connection to a portfolio investor’s pecuniary interests. It maybe that Meta’s engagement algorithms produce socially harmful behaviors and may spread misinformation that affects elections or disrupts teenage sociability. The impact on the economy and thus the other stocks in the investor’s portfolio is far from clear. There is nothing about the fact of portfolio investing that would necessarily incline such an investor to be more concerned about such harms than an undiversified Meta investor; the reverse seems more likely since the undiversified investor may feel more responsibility for Meta’s conduct.

Title: Is President Biden Contemplating “A Preemptive Pardon” for Dr. Anthony Fauci? He Knew that Remdesivir Would Result in Mortality

“RFK Jr. is now in all important ways directly accusing Anthony Fauci of mass murder. Fauci, as the lead official in the federal government response to COVID, powerfully incentivized use of Remdesivir, at any stage for people of all ages, early in the “COVID Crisis” by allowing 20% to be added on to the entire Medicare hospital bill. The dangers of Remdesivir were already well-known.” (Prius) On April 29, 2020, six weeks after the declared national “state of emergency,” Fauci announced from the White House that Remdesivir “will be the standard of care” for COVID.” link to Video . . RFK Jr in his book entitled the Real Anthony Fauci documents Fauci’s “30 years of abuse of power, during both the HIV epidemic and the COVID-19 pandemic” According to RFK Jr. Tony Fauci knew from the very outset that remdesivir would kill . The Washington Post applauded Anthony Fauci’s announcement (April 29, 2020): “The preliminary results, disclosed at the White House by Anthony S. Fauci, … fall short of the magic bullet or cure… But with no approved treatments for Covid-19,[Lie] Fauci said, it will become the standard of care for hospitalized patients … The data shows that remdisivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery,” Fauci said. . The deaths resulting fro Remdesevir have been amply documented Remdesivir, which to this day is the primary COVID drug approved for use in U.S. hospitals, routinely causes severe organ damage and, often, death Despite that, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved remdesivir for in-hospital and outpatient use in children as young as 1 month old (Dr. Joseph Mercola, emphasis added) In a 2020 scientific study: (Clinical Microbiology and Infection May 1, 2021.), the researchers assessed the increased risk of bradycardia among COVID-19 patients who were exposed to remdesevir. The analysis included all reports of COVID-19 patients registered until September 23, 2020. The researchers found that among the 2,603 reports of COVID-19 patients prescribed with remdesevir, 302 developed cardiac adverse effects, 94 (or 31%) of which are bradycardia. Of the 94 cases of bradycardia, 80% were serious cases, and 16 were fatal. Compared with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), lopinavir/ritonavir, tocilizumab, or glucocorticoids, the use of remdesivir was associated with a higher risk of reporting bradycardia. Download Complete report “A Preemptive Pardon” is a new legal upside down concept put forth by Joe Biden. Its legitimacy has been accepted by the mainstream media. It consists in granting a pardon to individuals who risk at some future date of being accused of crimes they had previously committed. While several names in press reports (including Fauci) (ABC news, December 9, 2024), were mentioned, there is no evidence that Biden has granted a preemptive pardon to Tony Fauci. “Legal experts said Biden can protect people Trump considers his political enemies by issuing them preemptive pardons” No Preemptive Pardon for Fauci… Ooops: No “Preemptive Pardon” for the outgoing President of the United States. Michel Chossudovsky, Global Research, December. 22, 2024 Below is Prof. Michel Chossudovsky’s chapter on remdesivir from his eBook, The Worldwide Corona Crisis, Global Coup d’Etat Against Humanity. The text below was first published two months after Fauci’s 29 April 2020 announcement. It confirms that Fauci’s methodology is fraudulent and that Remdesevir is a dangerous drug which has resulted in mortality. *** By Prof. Michel Chossudovsky, Global Research, July 5, 2020 There is an ongoing battle to suppress Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a cheap and effective drug for the treatment of Covid-19. The campaign against HCQ is carried out through slanderous political statements, media smears, not to mention an authoritative peer reviewed “evaluation” published on May 22nd by The Lancet, which was based on fake figures and test trials. The study was allegedly based on data analysis of 96,032 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 between Dec 20, 2019, and April 14, 2020 from 671 hospitals Worldwide. The database had been fabricated. The objective was to kill the Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) cure on behalf of Big Pharma. While The Lancet article was retracted, the media casually blamed “a tiny US based company” named Surgisphere whose employees included “a sci-fi writer and adult content model” for spreading “flawed data” (Guardian). This Chicago based outfit was accused of having misled both the WHO and national governments, inciting them to ban HCQ. None of those trial tests actually took place. . . While the blame was placed on Surgisphere, the unspoken truth (which neither the scientific community nor the media have acknowledged) is that the study was coordinated by Harvard professor Mandeep Mehra under the auspices of Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) which is a partner of the Harvard Medical School. When the scam was revealed, Dr. Mandeep Mehra who holds the Harvey Distinguished Chair of Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital apologized: I have always performed my research in accordance with the highest ethical and professional guidelines. However, we can never forget the responsibility we have as researchers to scrupulously ensure that we rely on data sources that adhere to our high standards. It is now clear to me that in my hope to contribute this research during a time of great need, I did not do enough to ensure that the data source was appropriate for this use. For that, and for all the disruptions – both directly and indirectly – I am truly sorry. (emphasis added) Mandeep R. Mehra, MD, MSC (official statement on BWH website) But that “truly sorry” note was just the tip of the iceberg. Why? Studies on Gilead Science’s Remdesivir and Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) Were Conducted Simultaneously by Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) While The Lancet report (May 22, 2020) coordinated by Dr. Mandeep Mehra was intended “to kill” the legitimacy of HCQ as a cure of Covid-19, another important (related) study was being carried out (concurrently) at BWH pertaining to Remdesivir on behalf of Gilead Sciences Inc. Dr. Francisco Marty, a specialist in Infectious Disease and Associate Professor at Harvard Medical School was entrusted with coordination of the clinical trial tests of the antiviral medication Remdesivir under Brigham’s contract with Gilead Sciences Inc: Brigham and Women’s Hospital began enrolling patients in two clinical trials for Gilead’s antiviral medication remdesivir. The Brigham is one of multiple clinical trial sites for a Gilead-initiated study of the drug in 600 participants with moderate coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and a Gilead-initiated study of 400 participants with severe COVID-19. … If the results are promising, this could lead to FDA approval, and if they aren’t, it gives us critical information in the fight against COVID-19 and allows us to move on to other therapies.” While Dr. Mandeep Mehra was not directly involved in the Gilead Remdesevir BWH study under the supervision of his colleague Dr. Francisco Marty, he nonetheless had contacts with Gilead Sciences Inc: “He participated in a conference sponsored by Gilead in early April 2020 as part of the Covid-19 debate” (France Soir, May 23, 2020) What was the intent of his (failed) study? To undermine the legitimacy of Hydroxychloroquine? According to France Soir, in a report published after The Lancet Retraction: The often evasive answers produced by Dr Mandeep R. Mehra, … professor at Harvard Medical School, did not produce confidence, fueling doubt instead about the integrity of this retrospective study and its results. (France Soir, June 5, 2020) Was Dr. Mandeep Mehra in conflict of interest? (That is a matter for BWH and the Harvard Medical School to decide upon). Dr. Anthony Fauci, advisor to Donald Trump, portrayed as “America’s top infectious disease expert” has played a key role in smearing the HCQ cure which had been approved years earlier by the CDC as well as providing legitimacy to Gilead’s Remdesivir. Dr. Fauci has been the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) since the Reagan administration. He is known to act as a mouthpiece for Big Pharma. Dr. Fauci launched Remdesivir in late June (see details below). According to Fauci, Remdesevir is the “corona wonder drug” developed by Gilead Science Inc. It’s a $1.6 billion dollar bonanza. Gilead Sciences Inc is a Multibillion dollar bio-pharmaceutical company which is now involved in developing and marketing Remdesivir. Gilead has a long history. It has the backing of major investment conglomerates including the Vanguard Group and Capital Research & Management Co, among others. It has developed ties with the US Government. In 1999 Gilead Sciences Inc, developed Tamiflu (used as a treatment of seasonal influenza and bird flu). At the time, Gilead Sciences Inc was headed by Donald Rumsfeld (1997-2001), who later joined the George W. Bush administration as Secretary of Defense (2001-2006). Rumsfeld was responsible for coordinating the illegal and criminal wars on Afghanistan (2001) and Iraq (2003). Rumsfeld maintained his links to Gilead Sciences Inc throughout his tenure as Secretary of Defense (2001-2006). According to CNN Money (2005): “The prospect of a bird flu outbreak … was very good news for Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld [who still owned Gilead stocks] and other politically connected investors in Gilead Sciences”. Anthony Fauci has been in charge of the NIAID since 1984, using his position as “a go between” the US government and Big Pharma. During Rumsfeld’s tenure as Secretary of Defense, the budget allocated to bio-terrorism increased substantially, involving contracts with Big Pharma including Gilead Sciences Inc. Anthony Fauci considered that the money allocated to bio-terrorism in early 2002 would: “accelerate our understanding of the biology and pathogenesis of microbes that can be used in attacks, and the biology of the microbes’ hosts — human beings and their immune systems. One result should be more effective vaccines with less toxicity.” (WPo report) In 2008, Dr. Anthony Fauci was granted the Presidential Medal of Freedom by president George W. Bush “for his determined and aggressive efforts to help others live longer and healthier lives.” . . We will be focussing on key documents (and events) Chronology February 21: Initial Release pertaining to NIH-NIAID Remdesivir placebo test trial April 10: The Gilead Sciences Inc study published in the NEJM on the “Compassionate Use of Remdesivir” April 29: NIH Release: Study on Remdesivir (Report published on May 22 in NEJM) May 22: The BWH-Harvard Study on Hydroxychloroquine coordinated by Dr. Mandeep Mehra published in The Lancet May 22: Remdesivir for the Treatment of Covid-19 — Preliminary Report National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, New England Journal of Medicine, (NEJM) June 5: The (fake) Lancet Report (May 22) on HCQ is Retracted. June 29: Fauci announcement. The $1.6 Billion Remdevisir HHS Agreement with Gilead Sciences Inc April 10: The Gilead Sciences Inc. study published in the NEJM on the “Compassionate Use of Remdesivir” A Gilead sponsored report was published in New England Journal of Medicine in an article entitled “Compassionate Use of Remdesivir for Patients with Severe Covid-19”. It was co-authored by an impressive list of 56 distinguished medical doctors and scientists, many of whom were recipients of consulting fees from Gilead Sciences Inc. Gilead Sciences Inc. funded the study which included several staff members as co-authors. . . The testing included a total of 61 patients [who] received at least one dose of remdesivir on or before March 7, 2020; 8 of these patients were excluded because of missing postbaseline information (7 patients) and an erroneous remdesivir start date (1 patient) … Of the 53 remaining patients included in this analysis, 40 (75%) received the full 10-day course of remdesivir, 10 (19%) received 5 to 9 days of treatment, and 3 (6%) fewer than 5 days of treatment. The NEJM article states that “Gilead Sciences Inc began accepting requests from clinicians for compassionate use of remdesivir on January 25, 2020”. From whom, From Where? According to the WHO (January 30, 2020) there were 82 cases in 18 countries outside China of which 5 were in the US, 5 in France and 3 in Canada. Several prominent physicians and scientists have cast doubt on the Compassionate Use of Remdesivir study conducted by Gilead, focussing on the small size of the trial. Ironically, the number of patients in the test is less that the number of co-authors: “53 patients” versus “56 co-authors” Below we provide excerpts of scientific statements on the Gilead NEJM project (Science Media Centre emphasis added) published immediately following the release of the NEJM article: “‘Compassionate use’ is better described as using an unlicensed therapy to treat a patient because there are no other treatments available. Research based on this kind of use should be treated with extreme caution because there is no control group or randomisation, which are some of the hallmarks of good practice in clinical trials. Prof Duncan Richard, Clinical Therapeutics, University of Oxford. “It is critical not to over-interpret this study. Most importantly, it is impossible to know the outcome for this relatively small group of patients had they not received remdesivir. Dr Stephen Griffin, Associate Professor, School of Medicine, University of Leeds. “The research is interesting but doesn’t prove anything at this point: the data are from a small and uncontrolled study. Simon Maxwell, Professor of Clinical Pharmacology and Prescribing, University of Edinburgh. “The data from this paper are almost uninterpretable. It is very surprising, perhaps even unethical, that the New England Journal of Medicine has published it. It would be more appropriate to publish the data on the website of the pharmaceutical company that has sponsored and written up the study. At least Gilead have been clear that this has not been done in the way that a high quality scientific paper would be written. Prof Stephen Evans, Professor of Pharmacoepidemiology, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. “It’s very hard to draw useful conclusions from uncontrolled studies like this particularly with a new disease where we really don’t know what to expect and with wide variations in outcomes between places and over time. One really has to question the ethics of failing to do randomisation – this study really represents more than anything else, a missed opportunity.” Prof Adam Finn, Professor of Paediatrics, University of Bristol.

On April 29th following the publication of the Gilead Sciences Inc Study in the NEJM on April 10, a press release of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) on Remdevisir was released. The full document was published on May 22, by the NEJM under the title: Remdesivir for the Treatment of Covid-19 — Preliminary Report (NEJM) The study had been initiated on February 21, 2020. The title of the April 29 Press Release was: “Peer-reviewed data shows remdesivir for COVID-19 improves time to recovery” It’s a government sponsored report which includes preliminary data from a randomized trial involving 1063 hospitalized patients. The results of the trial labelled Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT) are preliminary, conducted under the helm of Dr. Fauci’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID): An independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) overseeing the trial met on April 27 to review data and shared their interim analysis with the study team. Based upon their review of the data, they noted that remdesivir was better than placebo from the perspective of the primary endpoint, time to recovery, a metric often used in influenza trials. Recovery in this study was defined as being well enough for hospital discharge or returning to normal activity level. Preliminary results indicate that patients who received remdesivir had a 31% faster time to recovery than those who received placebo (p<0.001). Specifically, the median time to recovery was 11 days for patients treated with remdesivir compared with 15 days for those who received placebo. Results also suggested a survival benefit, with a mortality rate of 8.0% for the group receiving remdesivir versus 11.6% for the placebo group (p=0.059). (emphasis added) In the NIH’s earlier February 21, 2020 report (released at the outset of the study), the methodology was described as follows: … A randomized, controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the investigational antiviral remdesivir in hospitalized adults diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) … The February 21 report confirmed that the first trial participant was “an American who was repatriated after being quarantined on the Diamond Princess cruise ship” that docked in Yokohama (Japanese Territorial Waters). “Thirteen people repatriated by the U.S. State Department from the Diamond Princess cruise ship” were selected as patients for the placebo trial test. Ironically, at the outset of the study, 58.7% of the “confirmed cases” Worldwide (542 cases out of 924) (outside China), were on the Diamond Cruise Princess from which the initial trial placebo patients were selected. Where and When: The trial test in the 68 selected sites? That came at a later date because on February 19th (WHO data), the US had recorded only 15 positive cases (see Table Below). “A total of 68 sites ultimately joined the study—47 in the United States and 21 in countries in Europe and Asia.” (emphasis added) In the final May 22 NEJM report entitled Remdesivir for the Treatment of Covid-19 — Preliminary Report: There were 60 trial sites and 13 subsites in the United States (45 sites), Denmark (8), the United Kingdom (5), Greece (4), Germany (3), Korea (2), Mexico (2), Spain (2), Japan (1), and Singapore (1). Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either remdesivir or placebo. Randomization was stratified by study site and disease severity at enrollment The Washington Post applauded Anthony Fauci’s announcement (April 29): “The preliminary results, disclosed at the White House by Anthony S. Fauci, … fall short of the magic bullet or cure… But with no approved treatments for Covid-19,[Lie] Fauci said, it will become the standard of care for hospitalized patients …The data shows that remdisivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery,” Fauci said. . . The government’s first rigorous clinical trial of the experimental drug remdesivir as a coronavirus treatment delivered mixed results to the medical community Wednesday — but rallied stock markets and raised hopes that an early weapon to help some patients was at hand. The preliminary results, disclosed at the White House by Anthony Fauci, chief of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which led the placebo-controlled trial found that the drug accelerated the recovery of hospitalized patients but had only a marginal benefit in the rate of death. … Fauci’s remarks boosted speculation that the Food and Drug Administration would seek emergency use authorization that would permit doctors to prescribe the drug. In addition to clinical trials, remdesivir has been given to more than 1,000 patients under compassionate use. [also refers to the Gilead study published on April 10 in the NEJM] The study, involving [more than] 1,000 patients at 68 sites in the United States and around the world (??), offers the first evidence (??) from a large (??), randomized (??) clinical study of remdesivir’s effectiveness against COVID-19. The NIH placebo test study provided “preliminary results”. While the placebo trial test was “randomized”, the overall selection of patients at the 68 sites was not fully randomized. See the full report. May 22: The Fake Lancet Report on Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) It is worth noting that the full report of the NIH-NIAID) entitled Remdesivir for the Treatment of Covid-19 — Preliminary Report was released on May 22, 2020 in the NEJM, on the same day as the controversial Lancet report on Hydroxychloroquine. Immediately folllowing its publication, the media went into high gear, smearing the HCQ cure, while applauding the NIH-NIASD report released on the same day. Remdesivir, the only drug cleared to treat Covid-19, sped the recovery time of patients with the disease, … “It’s a very safe and effective drug,” said Eric Topol, founder and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute. “We now have a definite first efficacious drug for Covid-19, which is a major step forward and will be built upon with other drugs, [and drug] combinations.” When the Lancet HCQ article by Bingham-Harvard was retracted on June 5, it was too late, it received minimal media coverage. Despite the Retraction, the HCQ cure “had been killed”. June 29: Fauci Greenlight. The $1.6 Billion Remdesivir Contract with Gilead Sciences Inc Dr. Anthony Fauci granted the “Greenlight” to Gilead Sciences Inc. on June 29, 2020. The semi-official US government NIH-NIAID sponsored report (May 22) entitled Remdesivir for the Treatment of Covid-19 — Preliminary Report (NEJM) was used to justify a major agreement with Gilead Sciences Inc. The Report was largely funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) headed by Dr. Anthony Fauci and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). On June 29, based on the findings of the NIH-NIAID Report published in the NEJM, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced on behalf of the Trump Adminstration an agreement to secure large supplies of the remdesivir drug from Gilead Sciences Inc. for the treatment of Covid-19 in America’s private hospitals and clinics. The earlier Gilead study based on scanty test results published in the NEJM (April 10), of 53 cases (and 56 co-authors) was not highlighted. The results of this study had been questioned by several prominent physicians and scientists. Who will be able to afford Remdisivir? 500,000 doses of Remdesivir are envisaged at $3,200 per patient, namely $1.6 billion (see the study by Elizabeth Woodworth) The Drug was also approved for marketing in the European Union. under the brandname Veklury. If this contract is implemented as planned, it represents for Gilead Science Inc. and the recipient US private hospitals and clinics a colossal amount of money. . . [Error in above title according to HHS: $3200] According to The Trump Administration’s HHS Secretary Alex Azar (June 29, 2020): “To the extent possible, we want to ensure that any American patient who needs remdesivir can get it. [at $3200] The Trump Administration is doing everything in our power to learn more about life-saving therapeutics for COVID-19 and secure access to these options for the American people.” Careful timing: The Lancet study (published on May 22) was intended to undermine the legitimacy of Hydroxychloroquine as an effective cure to Covid-19, with a view to sustaining the $1.6 billion agreement between the HHS and Gilead Sciences Inc. on June 29th. The legitmacy of this agreement rested on the May 22 NIH-NIAID study in the NEJM which was considered “preliminary”. What Dr. Fauci failed to acknowledge is that Chloroquine had been “studied” and tested fifteen years ago by the CDC as a drug to be used against coronavirus infections. And that Hydroxychloroquine has been used recently in the treatment of Covid-19 in several countries. According to the Virology Journal (2005) “Chloroquine is a potent inhibitor of SARS coronavirus infection and spread”. It was used in the SARS-1 outbreak in 2002. It had the endorsement of the CDC. . . HCQ is not only effective, it is “inexpensive” when compared to Remdesivir, at an estimated “$3120 for a US Patient with private insurance”. Below are excerpts of an interview of Harvard’s Professor Mehra (who undertook the May 22 Lancet study) with France Soir published immediately following the publication of the Lancet report (prior to its Retraction). Dr. Mandeep Mehra: In our study, it is fairly obvious that the lack of benefit and the risk of toxicity observed for hydroxychloroquine are fairly reliable. [referring to the May 22 Lancet study] France Soir: Do you have the data for Remdesivir? MM: Yes, we have the data, but the number of patients is too small for us to be able to conclude in one way or another. FS: As you know, in France, there is a pros and cons battle over hydroxychloroquine which has turned into a public health issue even involving the financial lobbying of pharmaceutical companies. Why not measure the effect of one against the other to put an end to all speculation? … MM: In fact, there is no rational basis for testing Remdesivir versus hydroxychloroquine. On the one hand, Remdesivir has shown that there is no risk of mortality and that there is a reduction in recovery time. On the other hand, for hydroxychloroquine it is the opposite: it has never been shown any advantage and most studies are small or inconclusive In addition, our study shows that there are harmful effects. It would therefore be difficult and probably unethical to compare a drug with demonstrated harmfulness to a drug with at least a glimmer of hope. FS: You said that there is no basis for testing or comparing Remdesivir with hydroxychloroquine, do you think you have done everything to conclude that hydroxychloroquine is dangerous? MM: Exactly. … All we are saying is that once you have been infected (5 to 7 days after) to the point of having to be hospitalized with a severe viral load, the use of hydroxychloroquine and its derivative is not effective. The damage from the virus is already there and the situation is beyond repair. With this treatment [HCQ] it can generate more complications FS Mandeep Mehra declared that he had no conflict of interest with the laboratories and that this study was financed from the endowment funds of the professor’s chair. He participated in a conference sponsored by Gilead in early April 2020 as part of the Covid-19 debate. (France Soir, translated by the author, emphasis added, May 23, 2020) In Annex, see the followup article by France Soir published after the scam surrounding the data base of Dr. Mehra’s Lancet report was revealed. Lies and Corruption to the nth Degree involving Dr. Anthony Fauci, “The Boston Connection” and Gilead Sciences Inc. The Gilead Sciences Inc. Remdesivir study (50+ authors) was published in the New England Journal of Medicine (April 10, 2020). It was followed by the NIH-NIAID Remdesivir for the Treatment of Covid-19 — Preliminary Report on May 22, 2020 in the NEJM. And on that same day, May 22, the “fake report” on Hydroxychloroquine by BWH-Harvard Dr. Mehra was published by The Lancet. Harvard Medical School and the BWH bear responsibility for having hosted and financed the fake Lancet report on HCQ coordinated by Dr. Mandeep Mehra. Is there conflict of interest? BWH was simultaneously involved in a study on Remdesivir in contract with Gilead Sciences, Inc. While the Lancet report coordinated by Harvard’s Dr. Mehra was retracted, it nonetheless served the interests of Gilead Sciences Inc. It is important that an independent scientific and medical assessment be undertaken, respectively of the Gilead Sciences Inc New England Journal of Medicine (NEMJ) peer reviewed study (April 10, 2020) as well as the NIH-NIAID study also published in the NEJM (May 22, 2020). The fraud concerning the Lancet Report was revealed in early June. France Soir in a subsequent article (June 5, 2020) points to the Boston Connection: La connexion de Boston, namely the insiduous relationship between Gilead Sciences Inc and Professor Mehra, Harvard Medical School as well as the two related Boston based hospitals involved. . . (Excerpts here, to access the complete text click here translation from French by France Soir, emphasis in the original article) The often evasive answers produced by Dr Mandeep R. Mehra, a physician specializing in cardiovascular surgery and professor at Harvard Medical School, did not produce confidence, fueling doubt instead about the integrity of this retrospective study and its results. … However, the reported information that Dr. Mehra had attended a conference sponsored by Gilead – producer of remdesivir, a drug in direct competition with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) – early in April called for further investigation It is important to keep in mind that Dr. Mandeep Mehra has a practice at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) in Boston. That study relied on the shared medical records of 8,910 patients in 169 hospitals around the world, also by Surgisphere. Funding for the study was “Supported by the William Harvey Chair in Cardiovascular Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. The development and maintenance of the collaborative surgical outcomes database was funded by Surgisphere.” The study published on May 22 sought to evaluate the efficacy or otherwise of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, alone or in combination with a macrolide antibiotic. … It is therefore noteworthy that within 3 weeks, 2 large observational retrospective studies on large populations – 96,032 and 8,910 patients – spread around the world were published in two different journals by Dr. Mehra, Dr. Desai and other co-authors using the database of Surgisphere, Dr. Desai’s company. These two practising physicians and surgeons seem to have an exceptional working capacity associated with the gift of ubiquity. The date of May 22 is also noteworthy because on the very same day, the date of the publication in The Lancet of the highly accusatory study against HCQ, another study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine concerning the results of a clinical trial of…remdesivir. In the conclusion of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, “remdesivir was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery in adults hospitalized with Covid-19 and evidence of lower respiratory tract infection.” Concretely: on the same day, May 22nd, one study demeaned HCQ in one journal while another claimed evidence of attenuation on some patients through remdesivir in another journal. It should be noted that one of the main co-authors, Elizabeth “Libby”* Hohmann, represents one of the participating hospitals, the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, also affiliated with Harvard Medical School, as is the Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, where Dr. Mandeep Mehra practices. Coincidence, probably. Upon further investigation, we discovered that the first 3 major clinical trials on Gilead’s remdesivir were conducted by these two hospitals: “While COVID-19 continues to circle the globe with scientists following on its trail, Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) are leading the search for effective treatment. “Both hospitals are conducting clinical trials of remdesivir.” MGH has joined what the National Institute of Health (NIH) describe as the first clinical trial in the United States of an experimental treatment for COVID-19, sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of NIH. MGH is currently the only hospital in New England to participate in this trial, according to a list of sites shared by the hospital. ” It’s a gigantic undertaking, with patients registered in some 50 sites across the country, getting better. “The NIH trial, which can be adapted to evaluate other treatments, aims to determine whether the drug relieves the respiratory problems and other symptoms of COVID-19, helping patients leave hospital earlier.** As a reminder, the NIAID/NIH is led by Antony Fauci, a staunch opponent of HCQ. Coincidence, probably. “At the Brigham, two additional trials initiated by Gilead, the drug developer, will determine whether it alleviates symptoms in patients with moderate to severe illness over five- and ten-days courses. These trials will also be randomized, but not placebo controlled, and will include 1,000 patients at sites worldwide. Those patients, noted Francisco Marty, MD, Brigham physician and study co-investigator, will likely be recruited at an unsettlingly rapid clip.” As a result, the first major clinical trials on remdesivir launched on March 20, whose results are highly important for Gilead, are being led by the MGH and BWH in Boston, precisely where Dr. Mehra, the main author of the May 22nd HCQ trial, is practising. Small world! Coincidence, again, probably. Dr. Marty at BWH expected to have results two months later. Indeed, in recent days, several US media outlets have reported Gilead’s announcements of positive results from the remdesivir clinical trials in Boston.: “Encouraging results from a new study published Wednesday on remdesivir for the treatment of patients with COVID-19.** Brigham and Dr. Francisco Marty worked on this study, and he says the results show that there is no major difference between treating a patient with a five-day versus a 10-day regimen. …”Gilead Announces Results of Phase 3 Remdesivir Trial in Patients with Moderate COVID-19 – One study shows that the 5-day treatment of remdesivir resulted in significantly greater clinical improvement compared to treatment with the standard of care alone – The data come on top of the body of evidence from previous studies demonstrating the benefits of remdesivir in hospitalized patients with IDVOC-19 “We now have three randomized controlled trials demonstrating that remdesivir improved clinical outcomes by several different measures,” Gilead plans to submit the complete data for publication in a peer-reviewed journal in the coming weeks. These results announced by Gilead a few days after the May 22 publication of the study in the Lancet demolishing HCQ, a study whose main author is Dr. Mehra, are probably again a coincidence.

Global Research’s Holiday Fundraiser by Michel Chossudovsky Michel Chossudovsky reviews in detail how this insidious project “destroys people’s lives”. He provides a comprehensive analysis of everything you need to know about the “pandemic” — from the medical dimensions to the economic and social repercussions, political underpinnings, and mental and psychological impacts. “My objective as an author is to inform people worldwide and refute the official narrative which has been used as a justification to destabilize the economic and social fabric of entire countries, followed by the imposition of the “deadly” COVID-19 “vaccine”. This crisis affects humanity in its entirety: almost 8 billion people. We stand in solidarity with our fellow human beings and our children worldwide. Truth is a powerful instrument.” Reviews This is an in-depth resource of great interest if it is the wider perspective you are motivated to understand a little better, the author is very knowledgeable about geopolitics and this comes out in the way Covid is contextualized. —Dr. Mike Yeadon In this war against humanity in which we find ourselves, in this singular, irregular and massive assault against liberty and the goodness of people, Chossudovsky’s book is a rock upon which to sustain our fight. –Dr. Emanuel Garcia In fifteen concise science-based chapters, Michel traces the false covid pandemic, explaining how a PCR test, producing up to 97% proven false positives, combined with a relentless 24/7 fear campaign, was able to create a worldwide panic-laden “plandemic”; that this plandemic would never have been possible without the infamous DNA-modifying Polymerase Chain Reaction test – which to this day is being pushed on a majority of innocent people who have no clue. His conclusions are evidenced by renown scientists. —Peter Koenig Professor Chossudovsky exposes the truth that “there is no causal relationship between the virus and economic variables.” In other words, it was not COVID-19 but, rather, the deliberate implementation of the illogical, scientifically baseless lockdowns that caused the shutdown of the global economy. –David Skripac A reading of Chossudovsky’s book provides a comprehensive lesson in how there is a global coup d’état under way called “The Great Reset” that if not resisted and defeated by freedom loving people everywhere will result in a dystopian future not yet imagined.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change From the Heart of Liberty Blog. Don Harrision Sign Up To Receive Regular Heart of Liberty Bulletins Here The wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the young goat . . . and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. Isaiah 11:6 The book of Isaiah, written between the 8th and 6th centuries BC, prophesies a utopia where all natural enmities disappear and predators and prey become as one and take the same sustenance. It is understandable that the Israelites of the time, oppressed by Assyrians and Babylonians, would long for a peaceable kingdom. Today, however, it is less understandable – in fact downright baffling — that investment managers who pride themselves on their rationality seem to believe that we live in a world in which physics and economics have gone with the wind, and the lions in their portfolios can prosper on a diet of straw. The conceit I am referring to concerns the voracious lions of artificial intelligence (AI) and the utopian dream of decarbonization. The AI revolution needs the red meat of reliable power – in science-fiction-like quantities – while the decarb dreamers’ windmills and solar panels can deliver only unsatisfying amounts of marginally nutritious straw. Many investment managers own shares of AI leaders[1] such as Nvidia while simultaneously professing a commitment to net zero CO2. This is portfolio management animated more by blind faith than by proven, analytical process. Investors would be wise to question whether they wish to invest with organizations which seem almost willfully ignorant of the performance-sapping implications of this conflicted approach. AI Power Needs — AI’s bottomless appetite for power is no secret. Google “AI need for power” and you will find that banks, corporations, NGO’s, think tanks and major publications are all on the case: These examples are just the tip of the AI power-requirement iceberg. Investment Companies Are Aware of AI’s Power Appetite — Investment management organizations that own AI leaders[8] are certainly cognizant of this coming tidal wave of energy demand: Unlike those whom Jesus’ castigated in the Gospel of Matthew[13]forhaving eyes but refusing to see, these firms understand AI’s growing hunger for electricity. Renewable Inconstancy — It is also no secret that the net-zero utopians’ favorite power sources – wind and solar – are unreliable. In fact, an understanding of the capricious nature of the wind and the effect of clouds on sunshine is so ingrained in our experience that generative AI, whose “intelligence” is fueled by millennia of human poetry and prose, can churn out an endless stream of cliches on the subject such as “love as fleeting as the fickle summer wind” and “troubles like a veil of clouds.” Academics, not satisfied with machine-made similes derived from common knowledge, have felt the need to conduct studies to prove that wind and solar “are inherently highly variable due to volatile weather conditions.”[14] And if age-old wisdom and academic elucidation of the obvious leave any doubt about renewable instability, the UK and Germany have been kind enough to erase it by inadvertently conducting nationwide demonstration projects. These two former economic powerhouses currently receive over 40% of their electricity from renewables.[15] In early November of this year, both countries experienced what the Germans call Dunkelflaute (dark doldrums), which arises when high-pressure systems diminish wind and thicken clouds.[16] In the UK, this meant its wind farms were able to meet just 3-4% of the countries’ electricity demand, and in Germany theirs operated at only 7% of capacity.[17] Of course, grid operators had to call on natural gas and coal to step into the breach.[18] Charles Rotter at Watts Up With That? has pointed out that a proposed solution from the UK’s National Energy System Operator to this regular winter issue is “system flexibility”[19] — bureaucratize for public rationing and adjustment of energy usage based on availability. Cooking your dinner early or reading that bedtime novel at 2 pm in anticipation of a calm evening may seem trivial sacrifices to make for the greater good of saving Gaia, but imagine a world in which Dunkelflaute starves a power-hungry AI tasked with the 24/7 running of cybersecurity, healthcare and energy transmission: millions of credit cards compromised by foreign actors, AI-enabled robotic surgeons unable to perform life-saving operations, and the ironic last straw — the meager amount of power being generated by these renewables dies on the vine because the grid is managed by AI. We can’t trust AI with vital, economy-wide duties if it has to rely on gentle breezes and occluded sunshine. Investment Companies Are Aware of Renewable Shortcomings— The research teams at AI-invested portfolio managers are just as aware of renewables’ innate limitations as they are of AI’s appetite for electricity: Inconsistency, variability, intermittency. These investment companies’ analyses of the dependability of wind and solar read like indictments drawn up by Roget’s Thesaurus. Batteries on White Horses — Of course, no investment organizations believe that we can achieve a net zero future that still enables AI with wind and solar alone; as Blackrock has pointed out, these are only a half solution.[24] Continuous dispatchability requires grid-level battery storage. Clearbridge thinks batteries will be an integral part of a renewable infrastructure industry that will achieve compound annual growth rates of 10-30% for the next 30 years.[25] JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Macquarie and Blackrock have all put their money where their mouths are, investing billions in battery storage companies such as Strata Clean Energy, Gridstor, Eku Energy and Waratah.[26] These investment firms are heeding the call of the International Energy Agency (IEA),[27] one of the high priests of net zero. For the IAE, grid-level battery storage will ride to renewables’ rescue like a green savior on Revelations’ white horse,[28] and alchemize the benign but capricious production of turbines and solar panels into ever-dispatchable abundance. Straw Batteries — But how likely is it that battery storage will be renewable’s salvation, and provide the inexpensive, always-on power needed to sustain the AI industry? Mark Mills is a distinguished senior fellow at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a contributing editor at City Journal, a faculty fellow at Northwestern University’s McCormick school of engineering, director of the National Center for Energy Analytics, a former senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, and the author of numerous books and articles on energy and digital technology.[29] I have corresponded with Mark and followed his work for almost 25 years and have found him to be insightful, perspicacious and refreshingly thorough on every subject he turns his mind to. In a rare moment of agreement between Bill Gates and myself, Gates has said that Mark’s book The Bottomless Well “is the only book I’ve ever seen that really explains energy.”[30] In testimony before the U.S. House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, Mark had this to say about grid-level battery storage:[31] Given the almost unfathomable cost and scale of material production required for sufficient grid-level batteries, in all likelihood they are not the magic that will transform wind and solar into the robust energy source AI demands. The Last Straw — This past April, a Wall St. Journal piece explored a seemingly redemptive paradox embedded in the nature of AI: at first glance it looks to explode power usage, but at the same time it holds out the promise that it can increase energy efficiency and thereby reduce consumption.[32] The article focuses on savings in real estate, but the alleged potential is economy-wide. Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser believes efficiency gains over the past 15 years – before the advent of AI – have reduced energy demand by the equivalent of 90 million barrels of oil a day.[33] If smart thermostats, electronic sensors in fuel injectors and other relatively crude enhancements have produced this remarkable accomplishment, imagine what the coming AI revolution can achieve through predictive consumption forecasting, renewable energy integration, intelligent grid management and other currently undreamed of wonders! But does Mr. Nasser’s observation about reduced energy demand mean that the world has reduced its energy consumption over the past 15 years? Not according to Our World in Data, which shows overall energy consumption growing by 20% during this period:[34] These last 15 years continue a consistent post-war phenomena: no matter how much we increase vehicle mpg and no matter how many Thermopane windows we install, humanity unfailingly and mysteriously gobbles ever more energy. Only recessions induce power dieting (gold arrows). So is the Saudi Aramco CEO a liar or an ignoramus, or perhaps nefariously spinning the facts to benefit the oil industry? The answer is probably not – on all 3 counts. Most likely, he is referring to efficiency gains in isolation, and neglecting the further consequences of those efficiencies. More energy saving devices and processes would reduce energy consumption if all things remained equal, but we live in a dynamic world where changing inputs leads to unexpected outputs. Imagine in a previous life that you were a blacksmith who specializes in iron plow shares. You’re a brilliant fellow, and you devise a method that burns less wood to generate the heat needed to forge and shape the iron. You subsequently reduce your prices, which means poorer peasants can now afford your plowshares. This leads to more land under cultivation, which creates a burgeoning population, which ignites an ever-greater consumption of the wood needed to meet this expanding market that you and thousands of other imitative smiths are now servicing. And which – depending on your perspective – makes God’s green earth a little more paradisiacal for you and your fellow man, or eventually transforms it into a Boschian hellhole pocked by the pustules of oil derricks, coal mines and fracking and uranium waste. But no matter which way you look at it, your fuel-efficient advancement in metal-working most surely does not reduce energy consumption. All of which leads us to the real paradox regarding AI and power: Jevon’s Paradox. William Stanley Jevons was a British economist who first described this phenomenon in a paper in 1865. It is now so widely known and so well documented that Google’s generative AI app has a synopsis, but I prefer the human insight of Mark Mills: AI will create fuel-usage efficiencies, but it will in turn undoubtedly lead to increased consumption. The Saudi Aramco exec was probably not trying to hoodwink us. As radio host Paul Harvey would have put it, he just didn’t consider “the rest of the story.” Perversely, one man’s energy diet plan begets mankind’s need for an energy feast. Let Them Eat Straw — In spite of their awareness of both AI power requirements and of the fickle nature of wind and solar, in spite of the well-publicized issues with grid-level battery storage, and in spite of the widespread knowledge of Jevon’s Paradox and its implications for the notion that AI-effectuated efficiencies will reduce energy consumption, many investment management organizations continue to demonstrate a deep commitment to a net-zero future and to its proponent organizations: In the investment management community, Clearbridge’s membership in a climate-change organization that promotes decarbonization through wind and solar is not an anomaly. PRI, Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, Ceres Investor Network and Climate Action 100+ are 5 of the most prominent of these initiatives. Of the 10 largest fund companies, 9 are signatories to at least one of them, and collectively they hold 31 memberships.[42] Blackrock is a member of four of these outfits, and Blackrock International belongs to the fifth.[43] Blackrock’s Chairman Larry Fink, in a Wall St. Journal op-ed,[44] has called for a capital spending boom to build an “AI transcontinental railroad” that will juice U.S. real economic growth to 3% and increase tax revenues, thereby helping to mitigate the national debt crisis. But nowhere in this article does Mr. Fink mention that his company funds outfits who long to starve the railroad’s engines of fuel. Investment managers’ devotion to decarbonization also manifests itself in their proxy voting records. Each year, Pension Politics analyzes the proxy voting record of investment management companies, based on their votes on the “Fiduciary Free 50.”[45] These are 50 of the most extreme ESG-oriented proposals, 27 of which in 2023 were climate related. These proposals not only require companies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5 degree target, but to report on how their lobbying, insuring and investing activities, and their involvement in trade associations and other alliances, promote decarbonization.[46] At first glance, these proposals appear to be the grassroots efforts of a diverse group of shareholders who are agnostic on the means of achieving net zero (“the strategy on how to achieve this target is entirely up to the Board”).[47] But in fact they are the handiwork of a small number of progressive non-profits such as Green America, As You Sow and the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, all of whom are crusaders for wind and solar.[48] Green America does not try to hide its absolutist advocacy of these so-called renewables: “it is critical to the future of the planet that society moves away from all carbon-producing sources of energy and invests heavily in renewables such as wind, solar, geothermal, and second-generation biofuels.”[49] The other organizations appear to be making a conscious effort to obscure their belief in the role that wind and solar will need to play in the descent to net zero. They use fuzzy, feel-good language, but there can be little doubt that they believe a “just transition to a green economy,” the “phase in of low-carbon energy resources,”[50] and an “equitable energy future” will require an abundance of wind and solar, as evidenced by the many pictures of solar panels and windmills that adorn their web sites.[51] Of the 820 investment outfits Pension Politics graded this year, 520 received a D or F for their proxy votes on the “Fiduciary Free 50.”[52] A major contributing factor to these firms’ poor grades was their collusion with these obscure, radical climate-change zealots to force corporate America to decarbonize. Supposedly the last French queen, Marie Antoinette, when told that her starving peasants had no bread, advised them to eat cake. Though there is no historical evidence that she said this, today there is ample evidence that many investment management organizations, through their support of decarbonization and its handmaidens, are effectively telling the AI lions in their portfolios to eat straw. A Schizophrenic Vision — All investing involves a vision of the future. That vision may originate from a top-down analysis of the economy in which a portfolio manager buys REITs because money supply growth has recently abated, creating the conditions for a snowballing beneficence: inflation will drop, the Fed will lower rates, REIT interest costs will decline, their earnings will increase and their stock prices will climb. Or it may start with a more humble, bottom-up approach: a second manager buys XYZ company because its new CEO will soon jettison the money-losing companies purchased by his profligate predecessor, and return XYZ to its profitable roots. In either case, each of them has envisioned a future friendly to particular stocks or industries, and positioned their portfolios accordingly. But imagine if the first manager buys REITs because of the scenario outlined above, and then pens an opinion piece in the Wall St. Journal urging the Federal Reserve not to lower rates because that will increase inflation. Or if number two buys XYZ and tries to talk the new CEO into maintaining his predecessor’s legacy. A Freudian would call this schizophrenia, while a Christian might invoke the Gospel of Mark to warn that portfolio management divided against itself cannot stand, but they would both probably agree that this is a bizarre, contrary, unworkable approach to making money. The promotion of renewables by AI-owning investment firms is similarly confused. Either AI thrives in a world powered by the proven, reliable bounty of fossil fuels and nuclear fission, or it starves on wind, solar and wishful thinking. In addition — though the full exploration of this is a topic for another day — a decarbonized economy will suffer from low productivity and anemic growth because of renewables’ inefficiency and lack of energy density. This means that nationwide economic growth — the wind at the backs of all companies – will experience its own Dunkelflaute, enfeebling the returns of every investor and every investment organization, not just those that own AI stocks. AI giants such as Microsoft and Google still publicly cling to the hope that they will be carbon-neutral by 2030, in spite of the recent AI-driven upwelling in their consumption of traditional energy. Analysts who see things in the harsh light of day, however, call this dream “ridiculous.”[53] It is high time that the investment management organizations that own these AI operating companies come to this same clear-eyed understanding, and clarify the conflicted vision that shapes their portfolios. They need to either divest themselves of AI or cease to worship at the altar of net-zero. And it is also high time that investors let them know that they will no longer entrust their capital to those who refuse to see that AI lions cannot live on peekaboo sunshine and the whimsy of the wind.

Type your email… Subscribe Unlike Mr Harrison, policymakers, investors and data center owners (including anyone with any education) are aware of the importance of eliminating CO2 emissions and transitioning away from fossil fuels to renewables and nuclear energy Oh, I see- only stupid people prefer fossil fuels and voted for Trump. I see that attitude all the time, especially here in elitist Wokeachusetts. No nukes here, though- they’ve all been shut down. I said anyone with an education knows about climate change and its solutions. If you know about nuclear, then you know about one important solution. You meant , “any person with an indoctrination”… blah, blah Come on, In what way have humans change global climate change that you can provide solid empirical evidence for? You also need to provide empirical scientific evidence that CO2 has any measurable warming effect. But you will fail again, as you always do. That means you are yapping an ideology you have no evidence for. Religions and cults work that way. There is NO CLIMATE PROBLEM, certainly not from fossil fuels. So no “solution” is required. Nuclear is possible future major energy supply.. Wind and solar are nothing but a parasitic fad. There is absolutely zero need to eliminate CO2 emissions. That is a fallacy which has been brain-washed into gullible twits. CO2 is ALL benefit, no downside. It feeds plant life hence feeds all creatures on the planet. Still waiting for someone to produce some empirical scientific evidence that CO2 causes any measurable warming. Fossil fuels have raised modern civilisations and will continue to be a very major source of energy for a long time to come, they cannot be dispensed with if civilisations want to continue to exist. Wind and solar are just a fake parasitic measure to combat a fake anti-CO2 agenda, and are actually one of the most polluting forms of energy over their short life-cycle. “Still waiting for someone to produce some empirical scientific evidence that CO2 causes any measurable warming.” _______________________________________________________________________ Oh they might do that, but then they have to say why ﻿warming is a problem which it isn’t. See #2 on the list: 1. More rain is not a problem. 2. Warmer weather is not a problem. 3. More arable land is not a problem. 4. Longer growing seasons is not a problem. 5. CO2 greening of the earth is not a problem. 6. There isn’t any Climate Crisis. I have searched. I have asked many people to help find that evidence.. … but still, nada, zip.. nothing !! Since you can’t read, think, or speak rationally, I like your posts because there is nothing of substance I have to bother with! As expected… still, nada, zip.. nothing !! … In what way have humans changed the global climate that you can provide solid empirical evidence for? Produce EVIDENCE !!…… or not 😉 That’s rather rich coming from a moron like you! Please specify which of the geologic epochs have lower temperatures and CO2 levels than the Holocene, and just how you propose to prevent the death of ALL LIFE ON EARTH from CO2 starvation during a glacial expansion sometime in the next 1,000,000 years! Your ability to regurgitate corporate propaganda is only exceeded by your ignorance! And you are contradicted by all scientific research worldwide when you claim ‘climate change isn’t a problem’. Read any of the scientific reports from the NAS, the Royal Society, or NASA here: https://climate.nasa.gov The Royal Society? Nullius in verba. Especially them. Sorry, anyone that posts fraudulent graphs as you just have and rejects mainstream science from the National Science Academies, has no credibility with me. Footnote: ‘Present’ on your graph is 1950 by scientific convention, so your graph omits modern era warming from 1950 onward — which is most of it. If you knew that, you are a fraud. Why should anyone care if you think someone else is credible? Self induce Dunning-Kruger effect. You are a nobody, a scientific non-entity. Oooh get you. What’s your title? The central scrutiniser? The supreme arbiter? anyone that posts the nonsense you post is up for the ridicule you so richly deserve. I caught you for knowingly posting a fraudulent graph. Why would we think you have any credibility? The oceans have ~1,000 X the heat content of the atmosphere, and contain ~60 X the CO2; yet you still believe that a small increase in atmospheric CO2 away from the death threshold for all plant life is of major concern!? Hunh!? You really should avoid the word ‘fraudulent;’ it’s very likely to stick! it’s a 50% increase in atm co2 since 1750. Atm co2 is now the highest in 15 million years And that CO2 has saved the planet from plant starvation. It is a totally and absolutely beneficial increase in CO2 from desperately low level. There is absolutely zero down-side from increasing CO2 to even double or triple what it is today. If you think there is then prove it. First step…. 1… provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. Or stumble and faceplant on your own BS. I have reviewed science journals from the 19th century. Over a dozen scientists measured atmospheric CO2 as part of medical studies. Funny how the atmospheric CO2 in 1820 is comparable to today. Funny too is how the CO2 concentration in the 1850 to 1880 timeframe was the lowest in the 19th century. “Funny how the atmospheric CO2 in 1820 is comparable to today” And you are grossly incompetent. Atm CO2 is well over 40% greater than in 1820. Show us your citation. Then go into hiding. Graph is a well know established graph, from well established sources. It is not fraudulent is any way whatsoever. ! YOU ARE AN IGNORANT LIAR. You have 100% negative credibility. ! I caught you for knowingly posting a fraudulent graph. You sound like the all-knowing Karnack of Johnny Carson fame. Sorry to tell you, that was a parody of what you are doing. Show another graph that isn’t fraudulent according to you. There should be plenty of them as you say “mainstream science from the National Science Academies” tells all. I didn’t post any fraudulent graphs. Cite the time stamp. You didn’t post any graphs, And most of what is in your links is provable FAKE by their own data. That graph comes from a peer reviewed science report. Planet is still only a tiny bump above the coldest period in 10,000 years. Be every thankful of that. And there is no evidence human CO2 caused that highly beneficial warming. You will prove that, by producing no evidence… Oh look, Beetroot agrees with me. There is no evidence that CO2 causes warming. In the NH the current temperature is probably about on par with 1930s’ Modern warming is nothing but a tiny dot at the end of the chart, level with the left hand end. WB – you obviously do not have a traditional earth science background. The following image may help you get the “modern warming” in perspective. The only questionable figures on this image are the 2050 and 2100 temperature estimates on the right, and even 2050 is not a problem for this planet as it has happened during the Eemian, which is like yesterday in earth history. I have a very traditional science education from a top northeastern US University, and I am very familiar with this graph you’ve posted. It shows a projection that by the end of this century, global temperatures could be higher than they were during the Eemian, 120,000 years ago. What the graph does not show is that the rate of global temperature rise is faster than at any time in millennia. Nor does it do anything to communicate the effects of such a rapid rise in global temperatures on humans or on our health, environment, migration patterns, droughts, storm disasters and infrastructure to name but a few of the areas affected. You might benefit from a scientific view of the risks that climate change presents to humanity, here: https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/effects/ The projections shown by the red dots are totally BOGUS and not based on anything but pure conjecture. I replied to your JUNK PROPAGANDA below. !! Showed it was a total load of bollocks backed by absolutely nothing that could be considered remotely scientific. Now.. Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. Or FAIL yet again. Your credibility is now at negative105% You should ask for a refund for your science education. You don’t seem to have learnt anything at all in those years. ! You are still an ill-informed or nil-informed scientific non-entity. ! There has NOT been a rapid rise in temperature, current level is barely a degree or so above the coldest period in 10,000 years. ! rate of global temperature rise is faster than at any time in millennia Bullshit. “While Earth’s climate has changed throughout its history, the current warming is happening at a rate not seen in the past 10,000 years.” https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/evidence/ and: https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-temperature Your evidence link is nothing but propaganda pap, It contains absolutely zero evidence of anything You climate.gov link is no better. 1… Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. 2… Please show the evidence of CO2 warming in the UAH atmospheric data. Or you could just keep posting links to nebulous zero-science propaganda sites, and lower your credibility to -200% Your first statement about rate of warming is totally unsupportable BS. !! There is no way past data is defined enough to show that. In fact, before manic data adjustments the period from 1900-1922 was about the same rate as from 1970 onwards And as YOU have shown many times, there is no empirical evidence at all that humans have caused any of the small amount of highly beneficial warming. You are one of the most MAL-INFORMED fools I have ever come across. !! Not only that, we know from the UAH data that the current warming is NOT because of human CO2,. It is from extra solar energy reaching the tropical oceans, expressing as El Nino spike/steps at semi-regular intervals. There is absolutely no evidence of any human causation. If you think there is, Use UAH data to show us where it is. Think for yourself, not petty regurgitations… if you can find a pair of operable brain cells. Why should I believe your climastrology sites? So you are a Denier. There is NO SCIENCE on those pages. Just nonsense projections from unvalidated computer games. Nothing to “DENY” because they are just fantasy. Warren, two things. Don’t engage.. so he can avoid posting any evidence… as always. ?? So he can post climate nonsense and get away with it ?? —– “I firmly believe CO2 is a GHG and warms the earth” Ahhh.. another anti-science AGW-cultist… you are not a skeptic. Perhaps you would like to try… and fail. 1… Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. 2… Please show the evidence of CO2 warming in the UAH atmospheric data. Oh look, “the hoff”, a silly AGW “believer” runs away presents zero empirical evidence WHY DOES THAT ALWAYS HAPPEN !! “No matter what facts you put in front of him” Beeton has not put forward any actual “facts”. Haven’t you been watching. Neither have you. ! I’m quite prepared to discuss actual scientific evidence. Beeton hasn’t produced any. You know the questions. ! thanks. Four things from me: 1) I did not know that wuwt had a “position” on co2. It’s hard to find any consistent position on anything among skeptics. 2) I rarely engage with Bnice for the reason you state 3) The research behind climate sensitivity estimates is extensive. I’ve seen analysis that shows Even with the lowest values found in the literature, climate change is a severe economic, health and safety risk to humanity, and only a full transition of the global economy to zero carbon emissions by 2050 can avoid very serious effects. 4) I use the word Denier with those who, like Bnice, refuse to accept facts or the conclusions of peer reviewed science. Unfortunately, exceptions like yourself are a rarity on wuwt. Warren, Skeptics are not a homogenous group, but we call ourselves skeptics for the specific reason that that our skepticism revolves around issues like the benefits of mitigation versus adaptation and the severity of alarm that is appropriate. Bnice is an outlier, a vocal minority if you will, but “Denier” remains an odious term which belongs in no civil discourse. Anthony Watts started this blog a long time ago, and his position is that CO2 is a GHG. That was oft stated in the early days of this forum, it has unfortunately not repeated recently. In the early days there were extensive articles with in depth scientific analysis by well known skeptics that showed conclusively that the GHE is real and that CO2 is a GHG. These articles tend to be few and far between these last few years, so we are left with more political articles than the early days which were hardcore science. Even just a basic understanding of Stephen-Boltzmann Law shows that if the GHE is not real and there are no GHG’s, the earth would be snowball earth except perhaps for a stripe around the equator. You are correct that the research behind climate sensitivity is extensive. In decades of research though, the range in sensitivity estimates hasn’t changed much, though more recent papers tend to the lower side, support for the upper range is diminishing rapidly. Estimates for direct effects (3.7w/m2 per doubling) have not changed at all, but the sum total with feedbacks continues to be in dispute, ranging from as low as 1.7 Deg per doubling to 3.0 with the lower end having far more support recently. That, however, isn’t what skeptics are most focused on. The endangerment findings that you find so troubling are predicated on output from models, which have been consistently wrong. They’ve run too hot for decades, all except one. They continue to produce a tropospheric hotspot which has for decades been the “fingerprint” of catastrophe, except it exists ONLY in models, not in real world observations. Second, having paid close attention to the IPCC reports since AR3, there is a disturbing difference between the science itself in the main report and the Summary for Policy Makers, with the latter political documents often unrelated to the actual science. We’ve even seen one lead author demand his name be taken off the SPM for its unjustified alarm. But as the IPCC reports have evolved, each one has been more political than the previous. Consider for example the 1.5 degree “limit”. Where did this number come from? What science underlies it? The answer is none. It was arrived at by “expert opinion” from a group of scientists who are clearly biased toward alarm. I cannot summarize for you the entirety of the skeptic side in a single post, its a very broad topic. But on the issue of alarm, I shall leave you with this: We’ve gone from 280ppm of CO2 to 430, not far off one doubling. During that time, on a global basis, the IPCC has found no discernable trend in hurricanes, floods, droughts or wildfires. The four horsemen of the apocalypse as Forbes put it. What conclusion can we draw from this? If we put the models aside and just focus on data, the lack of a trend over decades doesn’t mean 100% for certain that there is no cause for alarm. But it does raise an important question which I can tell you from 20 years of debating this topic, tends to draw insults and jeers from the alarmists rather than any sober discussion of the facts. The question is, if the earth’s climate is so sensitive, so prone to unleashing climate fury upon the planet, why is there no sign in the data, collected over decades, of the deleterious effects? How can he climate be hyper-sensitive to changes in CO2 while also showing no changes to increases in CO2? Further, as CO2’s effects are logarithmic (hence the practice of quoting sensitivity in Deg C per doubling) each additional ppm of CO2 has less effect than the one before it. So the best conclusion that we can draw based on the data is that catastrophic changes in weather are not only insensitive to CO2 increase, they get less sensitive to each additional ppm. I wrote this article for WUWT about 9 years ago. Its has since been moved to different servers a couple of times so the formatting is screwed up. The links are also broken for the most part as the IPCC has moved their stuff around a lot too. Yes it is AR5 and the most recent report is AR6, I did say it was a 9 year old article. But the conclusions are still clear and easily read. The reason that I share it with you here is that as of AR5, it was VERY CLEAR from the IPCC’s main report (in other words the actual science, not the SPM) that there is no cause for alarm. Climate Change comes in dead last in nearly every category in terms of what the major effects on the human condition are likely to be in the future. https://wattsupwiththat.com/2016/01/01/we-have-bigger-problems-than-climate-change-so-sayeth-ipcc-ar5/ In fact, Richard Tol, lead author on multiple iterations of the IPCC reports shows up in comments on this article. One of his comments pertains to his reason for withdrawing from the SPM of his own chapter. No need for you to take me at my word. You can read it for yourself. There is also no empirical evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2 in any IPCC creation. It is all just conjecture and supposition. Would you care to provide that empirical evidence. Or just ignore the fact that you can’t, and go on “believing” like a good little AGW-cultist A whole lot of regurg. but still no empirical scientific evidence. A big FAIL !! Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. Other than the most basic theory of climate science –the GHE– I find most of your implied call for no action or minimal action unsupported in the scientific literature. Eg: 1) The latest IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) estimates equilibrium climate sensitivity is likely between 2.5°C and 4.0°C and very likely between 2.0°C and 5.0°C. The best estimate for ECS remains at 3°C. In order to safeguard the atmosphere and climate, responsible risk management requires insuring against the more severe of possible outcomes, not the mean. That implies mitigation policy based on an ECS between 3 and 4, possibly 5. Using an ECS less than 3C would be irresponsible risk management, and gambling with earth’s life support system. 2) Some models have run ‘hot’, but of course the IPCC is fully aware of this, and considers the ensemble of models with and without the hot models included. At the end of the day, for AR6 the IPCC has decided not to increase the upper end of IPCC ECS estimates in AR5 — which after all are not based on models alone, but also on paleoclimate data, as well as current warming trends. 3) It is untrue to claim, as you do, that none of the impacts of climate change have shown up. Clearly they have, and they are so identified and documented by the IPCC as effects based on current data, not on modeling. 4) Also, it is flawed logic to claim, as you do that because some impacts of climate change are not yet showing statistical significance, that they should be dismissed from a threat assessment. Modeling is based on real data and the physical behavior of earths climate system, and many of the models do indeed accurately reproduce the current warming trend. Disregarding future impacts based on those models would be irresponsible. 5) In your last paragraph you say, “How can the climate be hyper-sensitive to changes in CO2 while also showing no changes to increases in CO2?” AR6 is replete with examples that make that an absurd claim. As I said earlier, each iteration of the IPCC reports had become more political than the previous. I spend little time these days on IPCC reports. If I delve into something I delve into the papers upon which the reports are supposedly based. I find little alarming in them. The IPCC is a UN construct, and like many UN constructs, corrupt to the core. Their purpose is to grow their organization, their funding, and their power. If they were to proclaim that there is no cause for alarm, they would instantly be out of jobs. An executive position at the UN pays on the order of $700K per year. The incentive for alarm is obvious. Hence my focus on the actual papers than their conclusions. Sensitivity in the range of 5.5 Deg C per doubling is pure garbage. If it was that high would would see it leaping out of the data. But we don’t, we can barely tease the warming signal out of natural variability. As for the impacts, I did not say none have shown up. Its getting warmer. It doesn’t matter which temperature series you want to look at, its getting warmer. UAH, RSS, HadCrut, etc it is warmer now that it was 100 years ago. No doubt about it. That doesn’t change the fact that there are no discernable trends in the exact things we should be most worried about. Tree lines moving north is real, and not at all alarming. More arable land, not alarming. Island atolls aren’t being swamped by sea level rise, they are getting larger. Agricultural output has sky rocketed, outpacing population increases without using more land. For every heat related excess death we are seeing 10+ lives saved from excess cold. If you look at nothing but negative effects, you have reason for alarm. If you look at ALL the effects, it turns out that there are a lot of positives. In fact, the heights of civilization all coincide with the Medieval, Roman and Minoan warming periods. In fact history books record them as climate optimums. You might be able to convince me that we’re as warm now as the Medieval warming period, but the Roman and Minoan warming periods were absolutely warmer than it is now. As for irresponsible risk management, allow me to point out two things: I’m going to have a little fun with bnice blow, you might want to follow along just to be amused. A little fun with your headless chook routine showing absolutely zero empirical evidence. RUN AWAY again.. post a load of irrelevant regurg… Hilarious. ! Making a compete joke of yourself ??? What a load of low-end kamal-speak. Absolute GIBBERISH !! Pertaining to absolutely nothing but the stupid opinions of a manic AGW -cultist. Andreas not Antonius. I should review more before hitting the post button. First, I want to thank you for your professionalism and polite dialogue That’s a rarity on WUWT, and some, like BNICE, are so deep into their silos of rage and fact denial that they are often, as you say, ‘hoist on their own petard’. Now to your most recent reply to me: 1) I am a bit disappointed in your first paragraph — instead of dealing with the science, you attack motives of the IPCC, which is tasked with summarizing the work of the thousands of scientists and hundreds of scientific institutions around the world that have conducted and published the original research. If the IPCC is as corrupt as you say, you should be able to show where its conclusions deviate from the published peer reviewed science it’s based on. Many Deniers and skeptics I encounter attack motives or claim corruption and make no effort (or no competent effort) to debunk the research they criticize. That tells me they can’t justify their position and are driven by emotion, not reasoning. 2) You call an ECS of 5 (which is characterized by the IPCC as ‘likely’, not ‘very likely’, ie, the tail of the probability distribution) as pure garbage. But you don’t demonstrate why it’s pure garbage. Unsupported assertions don’t make the case. 3) Re: impacts — see my earlier posting on this point — you cannot justify leaving out the modeled threats. I would add that your claim civilization is enhanced by the warming trend also cannot be justified. First, it’s not only the high level of future temperatures that will harm us — it is the high RATE of warming that is a major concern. E.g., most modern population centers are along seacoasts. The potential for a sea level rise of 25 feet or more in 150 years carries with it catastrophic consequences for those cities. And dont tell me you can calculate the rise to be less — because you cannot rigorously calculate future ice loss — one can only estimate tail risks. And we mitigate against tail risk, not for the mean of probability. 4) You say mitigation strategies are a waste of money. That is the biggest mistake in all of your postings. Solar wind and nuclear are all viable technologies, and the last two are being aggressively deployed across the world. And if you believe solar and wind are not viable, you should tell that to the world’s utilities who are using renewables for over 80% of new generating capacity as they expand their grid systems. And your point that energy required to manufacture these products will emit vast amounts of CO2 is just plain silly — those energy sources can ultimately be renewable as well — or be nuclear power, also zero emission technology. 5) Finally, I find your argument about risk to be flawed. Risk = probability times consequence. You insure your home when the risk of total destruction is well less than 5%. Yet we are dealing with humanity’s life support system — and a probability of harm that is estimated at 95% by the IPCC. So you cannot tell me we should use an ECS much less than the mean of 3C for designing mitigation policy. 6) Finally, if someone like yourself wants to put forth a credible case climate change is not a high risk for humanity, and/or that mitigation should not be attempted, they should submit their ideas in the form of scientific papers to a respected scientific journal. The fact that there are tens of thousands of peer reviewed papers that form the basis of the IPCC’s work products, but NOT ONE (to my knowledge) that makes the case ECS is as low as you say, or that an ECS less than 3 should be used for policy, convinces me that the Skeptics and Deniers have it wrong, and the body of scientific and economic literature has it right. I despise you AGW hoaxers for trying to deprive me of methane, gasoline and diesel, and for forcing me to pay your stupid battery cars. Stuff your corrupt journal papers where there is no sunshine. Your children and grandchildren will thank those concerned citizens who worked to preserve the world for them to enjoy, and they will forget those who closed their eyes to the unanimous, and overwhelming scientific consensus, that climate change was caused by the burning of fossil fuels and represented a serious threat to humanity. Consensus is agreement of opinions. Opinions of experts in the field. As in orthopedic surgeons consensus on the best method for hip replacement. Janitors and ditch diggers’ opinions don’t count. If you continue to use the word Denier to describe me or anyone, even the moronic outbursts of Thats-Not-A-Fact-Only-My-Facts-Are-Facts-Bnice, I will not respond to you, and neither should anyone else. It was coined by Naomi Oreskes in her book Merchants of Doubt for the specific purpose of associating skeptics with Holocaust deniers. It is an odious term and even Reuters has foregone its usage. I’m not going to deal with your entire rant, and this post will be my last on this thread. As I pointed out in reply to the not nice troll, I have in the past taken IPCC reports apart piece by piece. I wrote a series of articles on the leaked AR5 preprint and exposed multiple instances of fraudulent claims (as did others). By the time the formal AR5 came out, those claims had disappeared. Writing an in depth analysis like that takes hundreds of hours of research. I did it for AR5, I’m not going to put in that kind of time to satisfy your demands for proof of problems with AR6. I am trying to point you in the right direction. I started asking questions of AR4 and that’s where I had my epiphany. The wording is all exaggeration, lies by omission, misuse of statistics, and worse. But I can tell you from experience that you can only get there yourself. No one has that epiphany by being backed into a corner with facts. It just turns into an insult war at the end, I’m not interested. I do suggest you put some of your own time into wind and solar and their actual impacts to the grid. Google spent a $1 billion trying to build a cost effective solar power plant and at the end their own engineers said publicly that it could not be done. Try and find that with a google search, they buried it three days after it came out. Wind and solar are being built out all over the world based on the will of politicians forcing it down the throats of the grid operators. Then when it doesn’t work, they do what politicians do, they paper it over. In Ontario they went crazy on wind, subsidized it like mad to make sure lots got built, and the result was electricity prices so high that there was a rate payers revolt. Did the politicians admit their error? No. They subsidized the rate payers to bring their bills down to something reasonable, pacifying them with their own tax dollars. This same dynamic is being played out all over the world. The recent wind and sun drought in Germany drove the prices on interconnected grids so high that several countries are planning to disconnect so it doesn’t happen to them again. Where does that leave Germany in their next wind and sun drought? It leaves them with grid failure. People die during grid failures. But that’s not the worst part. The worst part is the amount of CO2 that goes into making these things. Steel for windmills and purified silicon for solar panels comes from coal fired blast furnaces. Like I said, you need to start asking the tough questions yourself, digging into the details yourself. That’s the only way you get to an epiphany. My last post on this thread, I’ve put too much time into it already. Again, just waffling irrelevant gibberish… and mal-information. …. with no empirical evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. Why is that? The models are a load of unphysical garbage filled with errors and unproven suppositions. They are little more than computer games. IPCC can make all the estimates of ESC they want, but they are all based on models that don’t remotely represent the atmosphere. There is no evidence ESC is anything but zero. It is massively irresponsible to waste billions of dollars based on erroneous garbage models while destroying electricity grids and the environment. AR6 is a political document voted on by representatives of some 129 countries. If the summary report disagrees with the science reports, it is mandated the science reports change. I’ve worked with scientists and laymen who worked on the IPCC. What you say is false. The Green House Effect is not a theory. It is a hypothesis. AR6 clearly documents that the impacts are low to zero except a mild warming. Models are approximations. Models do not indeed accurately represent that which they model. Models have numerous assumptions, many of which are not qualified through experimentation. Models do not include everything and are on a, now, 25 km grid, which does not represent the planet adequately. Hindcasting is curve fitting, nothing more. They tweak the “control knobs” until they get a decent fit. This hindcasting neither increases nor decreases uncertainties and errors in the outputs. The outputs are nothing more than hypothetical approximations. Models can predict, but such predictions are no better than guessing. Now, take your comment 5 and list all of the hypersensitivities to CO2 included in AR6. The GHE has been an established theory since 1896.. Your science is wacko out of date. And we’re still awaiting your Dick and Jane coloring book citation for “atm CO2 concentration was higher in 1820 than it is today.” Did you find it yet? You still haven’t present one bit of peer-reviewed science to back up anything you have said. You cannot even say what I “deny” that you can present actual empirical science to back You have zero credibility, because you are also totally clueless what journal peer-review even means or does. Here is some peer-reviewed science do you DENY the result? 8 Taiwanese Engineers Determine The Climate Sensitivity To A 300 ppm CO2 Increase Is ‘Negligibly Small’ found tripling atmospheric CO2 from 100 ppm to 400 ppm produces a “negligibly small” 0.3°C warming effect. This temperature change is only associated with the increase from 100 ppm to 350 ppm and includes no additional warming as CO2 rises from 350 ppm to 400 ppm. Seems YOU ARE A DENIER under your own description. Hi Bnice200, thanks for posting that. So, after insisting that there is NO empirical evidence to show that CO2 has ANY warming effect, you’ve now posted evidence that falsifies your own assertion. Hoisted on your own petard as they say. If we are to believe the 8 Taiwanese engineers you cite, take them completely at their word, assume their calculations are 100% accurate, then CO2 in fact DOES have a warming effect. Per your cite, going from 100ppm to 400ppm has a warming effect of 0.3 Deg C. Which means according to YOUR cite, all the rubbish you have cluttered up the threads with about there being no empirical evidence to show that CO2 has any warming effect at all are rubbish. Crap. Bull sh*t. You’ve just admitted that there IS an effect. Its not zero. They will not be the first to suggest a very low sensitivity, nor will they be the last. The point is that it is not zero as you claim. They start out though by “tripling” CO2 concentration from 100 to 400 ppm. They appear to have a math problem, that is quadrupling, not tripling. Then they make the astounding claim that there’s no additional warming from 350 ppm to 400 ppm. Well if there is measurable warming from 100 to 350, then NO warming from 350 to 400 is physically impossible. So what game did they play to arrive at that conclusion? Well, they limited the calculations to 5 years. So they got a number so small that they rounded it off to zero. The real world doesn’t end in 5 years. But bottom line is they showed that CO2 in fact does have an effect, and all your blathering is wrong. Want some more empirical evidence? Here is a real experiment. A 10 cm long tube with IR transparent windows at each end is filled with an artificial atmosphere with 2.6 % water vapour and 357 ppm of CO2. They shine a known IR source in one end, and measure exactly what comes out the other end. Then they double the CO2 concentration and do it again. Their conclusion? 0.054w/m2. Very small, but most definitely NOT zero, read it for yourself: http://www.john-daly.com/artifact.htm Now let me explain why that conclusion is WAY too low. To get an actual result that is accurate using this methodology, you’d have to build an apparatus the height of the troposphere. Not practical, but the point being that you’d need thousands of these 10 cm tubes end to end and the total effect would be cumulative. Secondly, there is no ocean in this experiment, or a whole lot of other things that exist in the real world. In the real world increased temps promote more evaporation into an atmosphere that can hold more water, which is also a GHG. Feedbacks are real. Thanks for playing along, your apology is accepted. David H. is partially right when he points to a warming effect due to CO2. It was shown in the referenced paper which is likely from the same cause as the 0.24 C per doubling reference by Wilpost in another paper. https://www.windtaskforce.org/profiles/blogs/german-researcher-doubling-of-atmospheric-co2-causes-only-0-24-c The cause is the widening of the 15 µm absorption window for CO2. This effect was also mentioned in the work by Wijngaarden and Happer. The problem is this is only part of the story. There is also an induced cooling effect by CO2 which appears to be of about the same strength. I’ve mentioned this in the past. It is caused by the increase in IR radiation at the surface leading to additional evaporation and enhanced convection (first mention by Dr. William Gray). As a result, Bnice turns out to be correct. There is no warming from increases in CO2 even going back to 100 ppm. (we could see some warming at less than 100) The additional evaporation results in an increase in water vapour, which is a GHG. Net positive feedback. If you want to pick nits, CO2 has an absorption band in the downwelling solar radiance. At surface this completely get swamped by water vapour, but at high altitude and high latitude it is cold, very little water vapour. So in theory CO2 in fact has a cooling effect too. Fun fact, there are winds that blow high in the atmosphere over Antarctica that are warmer than the surface below. So the net effect of CO2 there is to intercept downwelling photons from the warm winds and then xfer the energy either by collision or emission. So the “greenhouse effect” is actually reversed in Antarctica. Keep that in mind when you see some warming event in Antarctica being blamed on CO2. “Net positive feedback.” Again, a load of baseless supposition. Never proven. And if there is no CO2 signal , there is no feedback. So…. Still waiting for you to present some empirical scientific evidence of CO2 warming the atmosphere. All you have so far is empty waffle.. The additional evaporation results in an increase in water vapour, which is a GHG. Net positive feedback. Sorry, this is simply not true. You are missing the effects of saturation and convection. The increase in water vapor only occurs low in the atmosphere where all the energy available to H2O is already being absorbed, aka saturation. Can’t cause any warming there. The increase has the added effect of increasing buoyancy. This ends up driving convective currents higher into the colder troposphere which increases condensation. As a result you have less residual water vapor exactly where saturation is no longer in effect. This occurs primarily in the Tropics and then is carried by the Hadley circulation to the higher latitudes. The reduced water vapor ends up allowing more energy to radiate to space thus a cooling effect. The extra energy that was captured low in the atmosphere due to the widening of the absorption window is basically what is sent high in the troposphere as latent heat of the extra evaporation. This is the energy that now has an easier time getting to space. This is one of the non-obvious effects that have fooled most scientists, so don’t feel bad. There are more. You have a fundamental misconception. Or perhaps several. Heat transfer beyond earths system cannot occur by conduction or convection — only by radiative heat transfer. And the ghe is never saturated. That mistake was first made by Angstrom in the 19th century, but corrected by Arrhenius and all other researchers since then. Warren, such massive ignorance in one short comment. It’s no wonder you have zero credibility. Go read my more detailed description to David and learn. Detailed or not, the only heat transfer mechanism that can move energy out of earth’s system is radiative. Convection and conduction only cause heat exchange WITHIN earth’s system, and cannot cause global warming or cooling the only heat transfer mechanism that can move energy out of earth’s system is radiative Which is exactly what I said in my more detail description. However, the process which drove the increase in radiative energy loss started with increased evaporation. Once again it becomes obvious that you have almost no basic understanding of science. a) The body of scientific literature , as reflected in the IPCC summary, concludes an ECS mean of 3C. We await your publication of a contrary analysis in a peer reviewed scientific journal. “as the 0.24 C per doubling reference by Wilpost in another paper.” Which for a small increase in CO2 in the last 100 or so years would lead to a totally immeasurable amount, totally swamped by natural variability. There is no cooling effect from co2. Evaporation does not transfer heat to outer space so cannot affect earths heat content. Poor Hoff.. the rabid AGW-cultist. ! Doesn’t understand the words “ no additional warming as CO2 rises from 350 ppm to 400 ppm.” Then an experiment that cuts out convection, conduction and air movement so it no longer even remotely resembles the atmosphere. How much more stupid can you get !! And a call to the fallacy of WV feedback A complete FAIL !! It was not an experiment. It was a model. Its in the first effing paragraph of the description, FFS. You know what? Eff off. I’m putting you back on ignore. Calling ME a rabid AGW cultist is as ignorant and insult as one can get. I’ve authored well over a dozen articles for WUWT challenging the entire CAGW premise. I’ve dissected IPCC reports, I wrote damning articles calling out the hypocrisy in the leaked AR5 pre print which then disappeared from the final version. I’ve written for other skeptic forums, I have in fact risked my career by publicly refuting the CAGW thesis as I write under my own name. Do you have the guts to write under your own name? I am betting you do not. You’re just a troll whose only argument is to say anything that s shown to you is invalid. You clutter up threads with the same blather over and over. You are convincing no one except perhaps yourself. I actually feel rather sorry for you. Set/Bnice=Ignore The fact that you think an enclosed tube in any way represents the atmosphere, really does indicate the low level of your scientific understanding. Apparently you missed the entire part of the post where I explained exactly that? Do the words you disagree with just disappear while you are reading them? Or do you read them and then delete them from your brain? Ask me if I care about your stupid labels, shillboi. “So you are a Denier.” So you are a troll. I’m also a denier. Now you just have to figure out what I deny. Good luck! That is hate speach. What’s not accurate about this? “I use the word Denier with those who, like Bnice, refuse to accept facts or the conclusions of peer reviewed science” Which is a totally meaningless description when you are totally incapable of producing any peer-reviewed science. If you say I “deny” something you must be able to produce precise empirically based science to prove the thing you say I deny. So far you have failed absolutely and completely You have also shown that you are totally clueless what “peer-review” actually is. !! You are just a mouth, with no brain driving it. Denier is hate speech. Poor baby — buck up; when you finish 6th grade science, you’ll be able to understand your betters. More insults. Such a mature way to discuss science. No, it was adult advice for a child. It’s all he has (well insults and his IPCC scriptures). Denier is hate speech. That is not a peer reviewed published science paper. One of the issues that I have noticed with “traditional science education” is a lack of teaching of “traditional earth science”. In my day, there was a School of Applied Geology. That faculty no longer exists, and geology is a bit player in the school of Environmental Science. This lack of traditional earth science teaching and understanding leads to statements such as: What the graph does not show is that the rate of global temperature rise is faster than at any time in millennia. Are you certain that is the case? NASA only goes back to 1880. The only other long term record is that for Central England which goes back to the 1600’s, but the data integrity is often questioned. The next alternative are temperature estimates from ice cores, with data points +/- a thousand years. Having another look at the CET data, it seems that a similar warming rate may have happened during the 1700’s. “While Earth’s climate has changed throughout its history, the current warming is happening at a rate not seen in the past 10,000 years.” https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/evidence/ and: https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-temperature What do you find in the links that you disagree with? If so, why? Links aren’t working.. Both links work for me. While Earth’s climate has changed throughout its history, the current warming is happening at a rate not seen in the past 10,000 years. There is no data provided on any of your links to support this statement. You don’t look very deeply. In the first section , read this statement, and footnote 1 referencing AR6: ” The current warming trend is different because it is clearly the result of human activities since the mid-1800s, and is proceeding at a rate not seen over many recent millennia.1 “ go back to the link and read footnote 1. You love your propaganda pap, don’t you beetroot. Quite pathetic that you think it is actual science, though !!. Not surprised that you can’t tell the difference between a bald-faced LIE, and actual science though. Let’s watch your squirm away in avoidance.. yet again… 1… Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. 2… Please show the evidence of CO2 warming in the UAH atmospheric data. Pre data adjustment…. graph didn’t attach…. And according to GISP data there have been several periods in the Holocene where warming was just as steep over a much large increase than current. Note, according to Mann the bottom of the current warming starts in 1850, so the end of the graph would be around the 1930s, very similar temperatures to now. My issue is with the claim that current (global) warming rates (ie 1960 to present) of about 0.24 DegC/decade is happening at a rate not seen in the past 10,000 years. There is no forensic method available to estimate such rates for a ~60 year period prior to about 1880. It rings my sciency alarm bells. BTW, I’m with you on nuclear! There is plenty of scientific literature explaining how proxy data,with error bars, allow for this determination. The NASA footnote cites AR6 Except you didn’t produce it. We can assume you have never read it while thinking. Just swallowed the nonsense hook line and sinker. You don’t look very deeply. In the first section , read this statement, and footnote 1 referencing AR6: You do realize that AR6 conclusions are based solely upon correlations and not causation don’t you? Again, you say you are trained in science, yet you use correlation as your proof? That is not scientific! I don’t believe you have the qualifications or competence to claim you’ve found fundamental errors in the body of peer reviewed science. You are obviously totally lacking in any qualifications or scientific education. What you “believe” is totally irrelevant and has well below zero credibility. There is not data provided anywhere. it is all just mindless propaganda. This is what beetroot builds his case on.. NON-science nonsense. I have replied to this propaganda nonsense further down. That you seem to think it contains anything remotely scientific is a very sad indictment of the your education in science. While Earth’s climate has changed throughout its history, the current warming is happening at a rate not seen in the past 10,000 years. From your NASA link : Takeaways While Earth’s climate has changed throughout its history, the current warming is happening at a rate not seen in the past 10,000 years. While Earth’s climate has changed throughout its history, the current warming is happening at a rate not seen in the past 10,000 years. … … The current warming trend is different because it is clearly the result of human activities since the mid-1800s, and is proceeding at a rate not seen over many recent millennia.

[ Reference 1 ] … … References References 1. IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, WGI, Technical Summary 1. IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, WGI, Technical Summary OK, so it goes from a headline precise “in the past 10,000 years” to a more vague “over many recent millennia” in the main text, and just provides a reference to the (112 page PDF file) AR6 WG-I assessment report’s “Technical Summary” chapter. . In the “Introduction” to the TS there is a “Selected Updates and/or New Results since AR5” sub-section, in which we find (on page 41, bold in the original, underlining added by me) : Paleoclimate evidence: The AR5 assessed that many of the changes observed since the 1950s are unprecedented over decades to millennia. Updated paleoclimate evidence strengthens this assessment; over the past several decades, key indicators of the climate system are increasingly at levels unseen in centuries to millennia and are changing at rates unprecedented in at least the last 2000 years. (Box TS.2, Section TS.2) The IPCC AR6 WG-I TS document referenced by the NASA webpage says “the last 2000 years”, not 10,000. Attached at the end of this post is a screenshot of panel a of Cross-Section Box TS.1, Figure 1, which can be found on page 61. URL to IPCC original : https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/figures/technical-summary/ts-ccbox-1-figure-1/ You will note that it repeats the “in a rate unprecedented in at least the last 2000 years” number, neither “10,000” nor “many (recent) millennia”. You will also note that the “Resolution:” for data before 1000AD is in “Centuries” … which makes it completely useless when comparing paleoclimate datasets to the warming rate “Over the last 50 years“. . Your NASA “supporting evidence” link does not actually support your parroting of its “in the past 10,000 years” bald assertion. Datasets with resolutions of “centuries” cannot be used to calculate “rates of warming” for periods of decades (/ “50 years”). Please try again. I Said “millennia”. 2000 is two millennia. This is lame even for you, shillboi. Mark had the receipts and this is all you can manage. Mark has no idea what data NASA has. Until he discusses with NASA, or reads the original journal papers from which the conclusion was drawn, he hasn’t debunked anything. I trust NASA, not armchair deniers. … or reads the original journal papers from which the conclusion was drawn … My bad, it was “obvious” to me on looking through the “supporting evidence” list that only the “AR6 WG-I TS” reference could potentially be relevant, so I only showed how that one did not include a “in the past 10,000 years” qualifier.

Conclusion There is absolutely nothing whatsoever in the list of “References” supplied by NASA to support their headline “in the past 10,000 years” bald assertion. Prove me wrong. Provide a citation to the specific paragraph(s) in any of the “References” on that webpage that includes the character string “the past 10,000 years” (or “ten millennia” ?). Prove me wrong. Provide a citation to the specific paragraph(s) in any of the “References” on that webpage that includes the character string “the past 10,000 years” (or “ten millennia” ?). You’ll find that is why Beeton, nyolci, and other trolls never, ever show the EVIDENCE they refer to. Only that the evidence exists in papers from the experts. I’ve caught the them in inaccurate quotes by checking the papers they happen to refer to. What a joke. Good work! youve shown nothing. Your ‘scientific work’ is the equivalent of a janitor trying to debunk relativity. You could be right. You could be wrong if you’ve missed something. I don’t know. But I do know this, posted by NASA, is from the IPCC recent assessment: “Ice cores drawn from Greenland, Antarctica, and tropical mountain glaciers show that Earth’s climate responds to changes in greenhouse gas levels. Ancient evidence can also be found in tree rings, ocean sediments, coral reefs, and layers of sedimentary rocks. This ancient, or paleoclimate, evidence reveals that current warming is occurring roughly 10 times faster than the average rate of warming after an ice age. Carbon dioxide from human activities is increasing about 250 times faster than it did from natural sources after the last Ice Age: I also believe this statement, from NASA, is undeniable: “The current warming trend is different because it is clearly the result of human activities since the mid-1800s, and is proceeding at a rate not seen over many recent millennia. It is undeniable that human activities have produced the atmospheric gases that have trapped more of the Sun’s energy in the Earth system. This extra energy has warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land, and widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere have occurred.” So, then no peer review published science papers? Just IPCC. Roger that. the IPCC is a summary of the peer reviewed science. Wuwt ramblings don’t count But I do know this, posted by NASA … No, you do not “know” any such thing, you simply read it on the Internet a NASA website. It’s called the “appeal to authority” logical fallacy. Look it up. Check it for yourself. . … is from the IPCC recent assessment No it isn’t, ***I*** actually went to the bother of checking.

That paper doesn’t include the character string “ice age” at all, but does include Over the past 45 years (i.e. since 1970, when human influence on the climate has been most evident), the rate of the temperature rise is about 1.7°C/century (NOAA, 2016), 170 times the Holocene baseline rate. so it clearly is not the source of any “10 times faster than …” claims about the “recent” warming rate. . OK, so let’s check out the AR6 WG-I Chapter 2 contents … … nothing for “10 times faster than” … … how about looking for “interglacial” instead … Aha ! … In FAQ 2.1, “The Earth’s Temperature Has Varied Before. How Is the Current Warming Any Different?”, on page 378, we find the following “summary” of a sub-sub-element of the “climate science” domain : It’s warming rapidly. Over the past 2 million years, Earth’s climate has fluctuated between relatively warm interglacial periods and cooler glacial periods, when ice sheets grew over vast areas of the northern continents. Intervals of rapid warming coincided with the collapse of major ice sheets, heralding interglacial periods such as the present Holocene Epoch, which began about 12,000 years ago. During the shift from the last glacial period to the current interglacial, the total temperature increase was about 5°C. That change took about 5000 years, with a maximum warming rate of about 1.5°C per thousand years, although the transition was not smooth. In contrast, Earth’s surface has warmed approximately 1.1°C since 1850–1900. However, even the best reconstruction of global surface temperature during the last deglacial period is too coarsely resolved for direct comparison with a period as short as the past 150 years. But for the past 2000 years, we have higher-resolution records that show that the rate of global warming during the last 50 years has exceeded the rate of any other 50-year period. It mentions “the last glacial period” … singular (!) … which cannot be used to calculate “the average rate of warming after an ice age”, and explicitly rules out trying to make a “direct comparison” for time-resolutions below 150 years, let alone “the last 50”. Look at the very last sentence again. For 50-year resolution comparisons the IPCC explicitly states that it can only go back 2000 years, not 10,000. . For NASA’s “science.nasa.gov/climate-change/evidence/” webpage, the “current warming is happening at a rate not seen in the past 10,000 years” claim that I reacted to so strongly in my first post was clearly written by an intern who was either misinformed or deliberately lied. The data required to calculate “the warming rates for the last 10,000 years with a 50-year resolution” doesn’t exist, according to the IPCC. You even get the “Appeal to authority” fallacy wrong. It means that an appeal to an authority without expertise is a fallacy. But if you appeal to an orthopedic surgeon for advice on how you should proceed with a severe pain in your knee joint, that is not a fallacy. If you appeal to the local janitor, however, that is obviously unreliable. In this case, NASA has the expertise, and you are the janitor. You even get the “Appeal to authority” fallacy wrong. There are two versions of the “appeal to authority” sequence. URL : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority I happen to use the “deductive method” version : … it is logically invalid to prove a claim is true simply because an authority has said it. The explanation is: authorities can be wrong, and the only way of logically proving a claim is providing real evidence or a valid logical deduction of the claim from the evidence. You clearly prefer the “inductive method” version : Person A claims that X is true. Person A is an expert in the field concerning X. Person A is an expert in the field concerning X. Therefore, X should be believed. Therefore, X should be believed. Neither of us is “wrong”, we are simply “two people separated by a common language”, as Winston Churchill might have put it. . Humour me. Please provide some “real evidence” — i.e. an actual extract, along with a full citation / reference and page number(s) — to support NASA’s original “the current warming is happening at a rate not seen in the past 10,000 years” claim. I certainly don’t buy your claims since you are the equivalent of a janitor. I go to the real experts who dedicate their lives to researching the climate and publish in top scientific journals. ROTFLMAO! 🤡. You wouldn’t know an expert if they bit you on the butt. Especially when you don’t quote any. I have a pretty good idea who isn’t an expert I certainly don’t buy your claims since you are the equivalent of a janitor. Thanks for the compliment, I wasn’t expecting one from you. Check out the life of James Croll, for example the biography outline in this media outlet. He is the Perthshire-born scientist who made his living as a janitor by day and pioneered our modern-day understanding of climate science and glacial history by night. A more academic summary is given in this second link. … a janitor in Glasgow, his article ‘On the physical cause of the change of climate during geological epochs’ (Croll 1864) came to be recognised widely as a landmark contribution to an understanding of climate change. Just because someone is “the equivalent of a janitor” does not automatically mean that they have absolutely nothing to contribute to “The Science” in general, or “Climate Science” in particular. Just because an organisation is “an authority / expert in the domain” does not make them immune from making (honest) mistakes. . I go to the real experts who dedicate their lives to researching the climate and publish in top scientific journals. Check out what the “janitor” James Croll accomplished. That is precisely what he did during his lifetime. I was referring to you as the janitor in this analogy in my earlier post: ”You even get the “Appeal to authority” fallacy wrong. It means that an appeal to an authority without expertise is a fallacy. But if you appeal to an orthopedic surgeon for advice on how you should proceed with a severe pain in your knee joint, that is not a fallacy. If you appeal to the local janitor, however, that is obviously unreliable. In this case, NASA has the expertise, and you are the janitor” Note that doesn’t necessarily mean janitors are always wrong. In fact the janitor in your story earned accolades from numerous scientific societies and experts — the peer review of its time. So when you are able to pass peer review with your hypothesis that every scientist since 1896 has been wrong and the ghe ‘saturates’ , do less us know. We’ll be sure to attend your induction into the Royal Society 😂 ”You even get the “Appeal to authority” fallacy wrong. It means that an appeal to an authority without expertise is a fallacy. You are now saying that this assertion by a third party expert is incorrect. it is logically invalid to prove a claim is true simply because an authority has said it. You don’t even quote an expert supporting your assertion that the statement is wrong. Nor do you provide a logical argument that shows your conclusion is correct. Your only claim is that you know far more than anyone else because you know what the “experts” say and are able to pass judgement on anything and everything! Is it any wonder that no one believes your assertions? I hate to tell you this but there are experts that disagree with your assertions. Some of them are here making posts. You are not in a position, by your own admission, to judge which experts are correct and which are not. You’re prattling on aimlessly without reading the thread. I explained why the ghe doesn’t saturate,, I explained why Mark BLR’s explanation was incorrect, and I posted a detailed explanation by Professor Pierrehumbert of Oxford. And finally I ask the question: why haven’t you guys been honored by the Royal Society for overturning 125 years of climate science? I explained why the ghe doesn’t saturate There are articles by respected professors describing how CO2 can saturate and where it currently stands. Professor Happer and Professor van Wijngaarden have shown this. WUWT just posted a thread about this with more experts authoring them. Instead of telling folks THEY ARE WRONG, maybe, just maybe you could point out diplomatically that you have references that disagree and then show quotes and graphs explaining why. Oh, so now YOU commit the REAL Appeal to Authority fallacy — by citing a paper that couldn’t pass peer review — an appeal to NON-EXPERTS!! “You are now saying that this assertion by a third party expert is incorrect.” That’s an irresponsible distortion, I said “It means that an appeal to an authority without expertise is a fallacy. “ Which is what you guys are: “persons without expertise” That’s an irresponsible distortion, You can’t say that the person who wrote the statement Mark BLR referenced is wrong without admitting that the statement is incorrect. Mark BLR gave you a link to Wikipedia. Why don’t you go and tell the author of the page that it is incorrect and needs to be replaced with a paragraph authored by you? Then come here and show us the paragraph you wrote to have placed into Wikipedia that correctly describes the Argument from Authority description. Then take your children to a janitor when they need surgery. Im sure you’ll appreciate the reliability of the janitor’s expertise. So when you are able to pass peer review with your hypothesis that […] the ghe ‘saturates’ You are confusing me with someone else. I have never advanced that particular “hypothesis” ( / “conjecture” ?). What I did, in my OP on this comments thread at least, was simply ask for “citation(s) please”. . I explained why Mark BLR’s explanation was incorrect, You haven’t “explained” anything. You simply keep repeating variants of the bald assertion that “NASA has the expertise”. . I said “It means that an appeal to an authority without expertise is a fallacy.“ Oh dear … The “fallacy” part comes from asserting that the statement “X is true” is somehow “proven” because it was made by an “authority”. The “inductive, non-fallacious” version of an “argument from authority” ends with something along the lines of : “… and therefore it is (much) more likely than not that X is true.” My preferred “deductive / Popperian / Feynmanian” version can be inferred from this quote by Richard Feynman himself, on how “The Scientific Method” should be applied : It doesn’t make any difference how beautiful your guess is. It doesn’t make any difference how smart you are, who made the guess, or what his name is. If it disagrees with experiment, it’s wrong. That’s all there is to it. Your fallacious “reasoning” is limited to repeating variants of : “NASA (/ an “expert”) said it, and therefore it is 100% guaranteed certain that they must be right and that you must be wrong.” When presented with “counter-examples” your responses are along the lines of : “You are not NASA (/ an “expert”), and therefore I am not even going to bother looking at your ‘evidence’ …” You entire attitude / mindset is one of : “How dare you even think about asking a question about anything written in the name of NASA (/ an “expert”) you … you … you ignorant peasant | / janitor ] you ! ! !” You should not be surprised that people react badly when that is your reaction to simple, and polite, “citation(s) please” or “please show your working” requests. And: “As we climb higher in the atmosphere the air gets thinner. There is less of all gases, including the greenhouse gases. Eventually the air becomes thin enough that any heat radiated by the air can escape all the way to Space. How much heat escapes to space from this altitude then depends on how cold the air is at that height. The colder the air, the less heat it radiates. So if we add more greenhouse gases the air needs to be thinner before heat radiation is able to escape to space. So this can only happen higher in the atmosphere. Where it is colder. So the amount of heat escaping is reduced. By adding greenhouse gases, we force the radiation to space to come from higher, colder air, reducing the flow of radiation to space. And there is still a lot of scope for more greenhouse gases to push ‘the action’ higher and higher, into colder and colder air, restricting the rate of radiation to space even further. The Greenhouse Effect isn’t even remotely Saturated. Myth Busted!” Once again, Mark has the receipts, and the AGW shills are bankrupt. As we climb higher in the atmosphere the air gets thinner. There is less of all gases, including the greenhouse gases. Eventually the air becomes thin enough that any heat radiated by the air can escape all the way to Space. How much heat escapes to space from this altitude then depends on how cold the air is at that height. The colder the air, the less heat it radiates.

The Greenhouse Effect isn’t even remotely Saturated. Myth Busted! Please provide some “real evidence” — i.e. an actual extract, along with a full citation / reference and page number(s) Glad I’m not the only one getting massively tired of these folks making assertions like “Because science says so!”. I try to back up my assertions with evidence like quotes and graphs when needed to bolster them. I utilize textbooks on metrology, papers and Technical Notes from NIST, and numerous BIPM & ISO documents. When was the last time any of the trendologists ever posted any reference documenting how time series should be treated? Stationarity, differencing, changing means, variance. Just use excel to draw a linear regression and it has a fantastic r-squared. Guess what? From: https://www.statology.org/good-r-squared-value/ The value for R-squared can range from 0 to 1. A value of 0 indicates that the response variable cannot be explained by the predictor variable at all. Does anyway believe the response variable (CO2 or temperature) can be explained by the predictor variable (time)? These are time series, not linear relationships. You AGW hoaxers are beyond pathetic. It appears you’re so buried in your deniers silo that you can’t even understand that the NASA data you cite indicates a rapidly warming climate, that can only be explained by the increased ghe from the accumulation of co2 emitted by fossil fuel burning. Deniers never have a coherent explanation for this warming, and you don’t either. FUA /plonk/ You will also note that the “Resolution:” for data before 1000AD is in “Centuries” … which makes it completely useless when comparing paleoclimate datasets to the warming rate “Over the last 50 years“. Thanks for your forensic work Mark. It is a sad day when NASA allows unverified statements on their websites. ﻿ Nice write up Mark. One of the first things that triggered my BS meter was reading AR4 and coming across a value and wondering where it came from. The reference would be to a previous AR which would then reference a paper which would then reference another paper which would inevitably be behind a paywall. Accept their number or spend a fortune finding out where it came from. Why the obvious effort to shroud the source of a value used across multiple AR’s? I discovered that other people were asking the same questions and getting the run around. The second was the steadfast refusal to share data and methods. You’ll just try and find something wrong with it complained Hanson. Well isn’t that the whole point of science? Trying to find errors? The fate of humanity lies in the balance and these clowns are afraid we’ll find errors? If we did find errors, would that not be a cause for celebration, the world not ending after all? Or if we didn’t find errors it would prove them right, isn’t that what they want, for us to believe them? I got banned from multiple “science” sites for asking those questions. NASA global data back to 1850 is a manically distorted fabrication of homogenised urban heat effect surface data,. It is totally meaningless as a measure of global temperature change Central England is regional –not the world. “such a rapid rise in global temperatures on humans or on our health, environment, migration patterns, droughts, storm disasters and infrastructure to name but a few of the areas affected. “ NONE of which actually exist in real data, except the highly beneficial temperature rise since the LIA. Warmth enhances health. 10X more people die from cold as from heat, life expectancy has increased massively due to warming and the products and use of fossil fuels. Environment.. the whole planet is much greener.. is that a bad thing. Only thing destroying the environment is wind and solar factories. Migration patterns are never set in stone. No trend in droughts.. Cold causes more droughts than warmth does. No trend (maybe slightly downwards) in storms or cyclones/hurricanes except the silly naming thereof. No increase in disasters, except where people build on flood plains etc. Infrastructure .. nope… you have nothing. So.. just another load of fake mantra pap from you. ! Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. How many years does each dot on the graph cover? How do you determine the rate of change when a single point covers a century or a millennia. If you had a proper science education, you would know how to interpret time series graphs. Apparently you missed that day at school! That is not a peer reviewed published science paper. Don’t know what post you’re referring to. But we’re still awaiting your citation for “atm co2 concentration was higher in 1820 than it is today”. Got anything yet? Beetroot doesn’t seem to have any science background whatsoever !! And he has to resort to spamming to prop up his lies. That chart comes from a peer reviewed science report. Didyou locate that citation for “atm co2 ppm in1820 was roughly comparable to today”? We can’t wait to see it. But we’re beginning to believe you can’t find it. Could that be true? 🤣 Oh dear…the beetroot falls for on-line propaganda pap, yet again !! And there it is. As always the warmists ultimately rely on the “argument from authority” fallacious position rather than providing evidence that supports their claims. They rather believe that there are experts who can be relied on to tell them what the facts are because that’s what they are told by – you know -really smart people. For Mr. Beeton’s information, many of us have read these reports and papers, looked closely at the methods and data and researched other information and data and found them to be unconvincing, biased and sometimes fraudulent. You cannot claim to be well educated on a subject unless you’ve thoroughly researched and considered all sides. I’ve only ever seen what I believe to be truly objective research on the climate change issue from what are called skeptics. “many of us have read these reports and papers, looked closely at the methods and data and researched other information and data and found them to be unconvincing, biased and sometimes fraudulent.” So, since 99.9% of all peer reviewed research, every one of the 270 scientific institutions in the world, all University textbooks on Atmospheric Physics, and nearly every single researching climate scientist in the world contradict Deniers — who have no consistent theory to explain the warming of the planet — I consider your position to be untenable in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Another way of looking at this is to consider the hubris — and scientific incompetence–of someone who believes he’s found fundamental errors in the work of nearly every climate scientist on the planet. since 99.9% of all peer reviewed research Liar. You have a problematic relationship with facts, it seems: https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2021/10/more-999-studies-agree-humans-caused-climate-change Agree…. so what… because they get funding NOT ONE OF THEM provides scientific evidence that it does. If you think one does, then point to the exact one. That means you will have to read them all to find it exists… .. instead of posting links you are totally clueless about.. Modelled crap does not count. Noted, yet again you RUN AWAY. so funny to watch your headless chicken routine. 🙂 1… Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. 2… Please show the evidence of CO2 warming in the UAH atmospheric data. “problematic relationship with facts” And you have ZERO or negative relationship with facts. !! You run and hide from them. ! Noted that YET AGAIN you are totally incapable of supporting the very basis of your cult-religion Hilarious headless chicken routines to avoid the fact. You have NEVER read a book on Atmospheric Physics, you do not have a capability to understand it. The scientific incompetence is totally YOURS. Prove me correct , yet again.. !! 1… Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. 2… Please show the evidence of CO2 warming in the UAH atmospheric data. Your credibility is now at negative 220% Try again.. see if you can present something with any credibility.. or FAIL ! 1… Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. 2… Please show the evidence of CO2 warming in the UAH atmospheric data. So just an appeal to “more and bigger” authorities? Perhaps you are unaware that all those scientific institutions represent mostly academic researchers highly dependent on massive government grants for their livelihood and those grants only go to those who support the approved narrative. Are you, by chance, one of them? You don’t even seem to know how bogus the 99% [97%] consensus argument is. You need to read more widely. He’s just regurgitating the talking points he’s been handed. “in the face of overwhelming evidence” You haven’t produced any actual scientific evidence. !! 8 Taiwanese Engineers Determine The Climate Sensitivity To A 300 ppm CO2 Increase Is ‘Negligibly Small’ tripling atmospheric CO2 from 100 ppm to 400 ppm produces a “negligibly small” 0.3°C warming effect. This temperature change is only associated with the increase from 100 ppm to 350 ppm and includes no additional warming as CO2 rises from 350 ppm to 400 ppm. You can DENY or ignore.. We know who the real “deniers” are. Another way of looking at this is to consider the hubris — and scientific incompetence–of someone who believes he’s found fundamental errors in the work of nearly every climate scientist on the planet. There is part of your problem. You have obviously not done a deep dive into your science education. Have you never been taught something by a professor and found it in error. Yet it has been propagated to many students through booksand papers the professor has written. How many text books still contain the Micheal Mann debunked hockey stick? As a student if you are taught this and never research it depth, you’ll never know it is based on suspect statistics. How many textbooks can you find that show empirical data substantiating the effective warming potential of CO2 as a cold body compared to the surface? How many textbooks deal with the subject using calculus to integrate the variations in day, month, annual orbital equations? How many just use averages and time series correlation? How many have a functional relationship between CO2 and surface temperature rather than just graphical time series? Climate science has not progressed into science yet. That is what makes me skeptical. Like it or not climate science is still at the alchemy stage of development still trumpeting that “We have found the way to make CO2 the control knob”! Youve now convincingly demonstrated you have neither the qualifications nor competence to claim you’ve found fundamental errors in the peer reviewed scientific literature. You know absolutely NOTHING about peer-review, do you. ! Totally ignorant as to what it even means. You are LYING about having ever done any science. You have neither the temperament, nor the competence or qualifications to judge. 100 scientists can agree with me, but it only take 1 to prove I am wrong. Who said that, again? You mean like everything on the internet is true because it says so on the internet? Even if a ‘green’ future is necessary there are two fallacies in place. (1) Lack of due process (2) You can’t throw a switch, which, of course, you might learn with due process. No fallacies required. First, all climate policy are and must be carried out constitutionally by legislation or by constitutional executive orders. Second, no policymakers advocate ‘throwing a switch’. Rather, the common goal is to transition the economy to net zero carbon emissions by 2050 — and the transition is already underway. But fallacies are all you have.! There is no transition underway in any country that isn’t destroying it economy World fossil fuel use remains around 80% of world energy use, wind and solar are a tiny slice, barely visible on the graph below. There is absolutely zero need to move away from fossil fuels to unreliable, erratic, intermittent parasitic low-integrity energies like wind and solar. Yes there is a transition, well underway in the world, including the US, EU, Japan, and China. EVs are in production, and more in development, 80% of new power generation capacity being installed is solar wind or nuclear, and funding and incentives from legislation is already helping to build out infrastructure. In addition, 42 countries are considering, or already have in place, a carbon tax. Also, this year the EU has implemented a new border carbon adjustment mechanism that will incentivize trade with countries that have a carbon tax. Lots happening, so you need to pay attention if you want to have credibility in your comments. Data says otherwise. Fossil fuel growth continues to outstrip wind and solar That 80% is really less than 20% when considering capacity factors.. sorry if you are too dumb to realise that. The largest countries in the world continue to massively increase their fossil fuel energy use. Countries CANNOT survive or progress without fossil fuels.. period. ! You rely totally on them every day of your pitiful existence. Drive a battery car yet, beetman? If no, you’re a hypocrite. If yes, you’re a sucker. so that makes you….uneducated Noted , yet again, the total lack of anything remotely related to scientific evidence. You ran away from answering, just like all the other AGW shills. I wonder if he parks and charges his pretend EV in an attached garage. He is dumb enough to do that. ! BOOM! Goes the Chinese EV. Have you come to grips with the fact that indeed global temperatures are rising at the fastest rate in millennia? “While Earth’s climate has changed throughout its history, the current warming is happening at a rate not seen in the past 10,000 years.” https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/evidence/ and: https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-temperature Spamming is all you got in the tank, shillboi. Totally destroyed above. They are just regurgitated propaganda fakery with zero scientific content. I meant “below” Exactly — and he can’t even regurgitate the 97% propaganda correctly. You have a problematic relationship with facts, it seems: https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2021/10/more-999-studies-agree-humans-caused-climate-changeG The climatology literature is corrupt, why do you believe what is in there? You say, “The climatology literature is corrupt, why do you believe what is in there?” I say, “Your statement is pure Science Denial” Yes, fool. the climate peer-review nonsense is TOTALLY CORRUPT. Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. Cornell? That source is sufficient proof to ignore it. 2nd link.. is impure propaganda nonsense U.S. Sea Level Likely to Rise 1 to 6.6 Feet by 2100 Currently around 2-3mm/year, the 6.6ft value is pure fantasy.

How moronically stupid can you get !!! Please see my response timestamped “December 23, 2024 4:28 am” to one of your other copies of this post in this comments section. Nope. But given that we have recently (past couple hundred years or so) emerged from one of the coldest eras in modern history, I am grateful for every 0.1 C improvement. Besides, that 10000 year bogus claim was debunked in a prior post. It is not a fact. It is a speculative claim with minimal supporting data and note that the sources are all government websites that are obliged to tow the line of Presidential policy. If you bothered to read Biden’s 5 year climate report and compare it to AR6, you would recognize that glossy piece of propaganda for what it is. So you are endorsing either the US 5 Year Climate Report, or AR6, or both? No. I am pointing out that what was in the 5 years report did not match anything in AR6. That’s absurd. They are consistent. Unlike you Totally energy use 2023. Solar 2.5%, wind 3.5% fossil fuels 81.5 % Data makes you look like a brain-washed idiot. !. ! There is no “transition”.. period —– Coal Use Hits Record High in 2024 Thanks to India and China Get over it, beetroot. ! Each and every scheme a scam. https://www.youtube.com/@Bernie-is-Artemis Marxist. …. and a completely indoctrinated gormless twit. ! …the common goal is to transition the economy to net zero carbon emissions by 2050 — and the transition is already underway. This is pure fantasy. Don’t see any sign of either a common global goal or a transition. Look at the track record of China and India on coal use and emissions. Look at the various COPs and at progress (or lack of it) on the Paris agreements. The plain fact is, no-one outside of the English speaking countries and Germany has taken global warming seriously, and the countries that have tried to reduce their emissions from electricity generation are right now seeing themselves approaching the cliff of intermittency. And not liking it, getting very alarmed, and getting ready for U-turns. As will happen in February in the US. The other countries are just growing their economies as fast as possible, and letting emissions and coal use go where they may. “Don’t see any sign of either a common global goal or a transition. Look at the track record of China and India on coal use and emissions”. China’s goal is to achieve net-zero emissions by 2060. and they are well on their way,,ahead of most countries including the US. Coal Use Hits Record High in 2024 Thanks to India and China. wind and solar in China are barely visible in the energy chart They now have a working pebble bed nuclear, those will expand rapidly, and wind and solar will be left to rot. ! Not one nation has a chance of meeting their FAKE goals. Wind and solar make up a very small part of China’s energy usage, they have had hydro for a long time. EV’s in China make sense, crowded huge cities… anything is better than those old 2 cycle motor bikes., and the COAL fired power they will run is well out of the cities. Places like USA and America EVs are basically just a low-level second car or virtue-seeking of very little actual use. Plans, stated to fool twits like you and your mates.. works every time… … yet their use of coal grows year one year. The others are just gimmicks to fool the western world into sticking with the idiotic net-zero plan to destroy their manufacturing bases. It will fail in the USA now Trump is in, because he will aim fossil fuel self-dependency in a very short time 😆 “dropping by more than 80% by 2060.” By then, all their current coal fired power stations will be still running at high efficiency. Current wind and solar will have ceased to function and be in scrap heaps or left to rot. Why always portray new renewable energy sources with capacity rather than actual production of energy? World wide renewable energy production is about 20% of stated capacity. Combined renewable wind and solar with 100 Giga-watts of capacity over time have average output of about 20 Giga-watts of energy. Because it is the only way they can keep the hoax alive. shillboi — praising his marxist masters and earning his keep. There are only 195 nations of which 193 are part of the UN. If China is so great, why not move there? There is such thing as “constitutional executive orders.” https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46738 “Executive orders are written instruments through which a President can issue directives to shape policy. Although the U.S. Constitution does not address executive orders and no statute grants the President the general power to issue them, authority to issue such orders is accepted as an inherent aspect of presidential power, though their legal effect depends on various considerations.” Yes, presidential executive orders are constitutional when they are supported by the Constitution or authorized by Congress: Executive orders are a way for the president to set policy without waiting for Congress to pass legislation. They have the force of law unless they are voided or revoked by Congress, the president, or the judicial branch. Quite a spin. There are no “Constitutional Executive Orders” and your response matches mine that prove it. Article II of the constitution makes no mention of executive orders. What you describe is an interpretation. “take care that the Laws be faithfully executed” does not define executive orders. The second point is also not a definition of executive order. It is another interpretation. https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/article-2/ Of course it’s an interpretation. Supported by SCOTUS rulings. Which then become part of the body of Constitutional law. So Warren, why are you using FF every day? And I bet you have no solar panels on the roof. If you are going to talk the talk then you better walk the walk. Do not be a hypocrite. So Jim, do you need to read this in my post? “ Rather, the common goal is to transition the economy to net zero carbon emissions by 2050 — and the transition is already underway” I’m doing my share — including lobbying my Congressional representative and Senators to pass climate legislation. What are you doing, Jim? “I’m doing my share” Yep, you continue to use fossil fuels every second of every day. Trump is in now.. All this anti-CO2 nonsense will disappear. Drill baby, drill ! 🙂 ““ Rather, the common goal is to transition the economy to net zero carbon emissions by 2050 — and the transition is already underway”” 1… NOT underway, fossil fuels % is holding steady and is still BY FAR the main energy supply 2… Politically and idiotology based wishful thinking and propaganda. The Anti-CO2 nonsense will be dead and buried by 2050. Harold the Organic Chemist Says ATTN: Warren RE: CO2 Does Not Cause Warming Of Air. To refresh your memory, shown below in the graphic are plots of temperatures from the weather station at Furnace Creek in Death Valley from 1922 to 2001. In 1922, the concentration of CO2 was 303 ppmv (0.6 g of CO2/ cu. m. of air), and, by 2001 it had increased to 371 ppmv (0.7 g/cu. m. of air), but there was no corresponding increase in the air temperature. The reason for no temperature increase is quite simple: There is too little CO2 in the air. At the MLO in Hawaii, the current concentration of CO2 in dry air is 422 ppmv. One cubic meter of this air has 0.8 g of CO2 and a mass of 1.29 kg at STP. This small amount of CO2 can heat up such a large mass of air by a very small amount if at all. I remined you that the heavy industries and heavy transportation systems will always use enormous amounts of fossil fuels. It is now winter in the Northern Hemisphere and huge amounts of fossil fuels will be used for space heating. NB: The graphic was obtained from the late Joh Daly’s website: “Still Waiting For Greenhouse” available at: http://www.John-Daly.com. Totally energy use 2023. Solar 2.5%, wind 3.5% fossil fuels 81.5 % There is no “transition”. COAL consumption continues to grow GAS consumption continues to grow OIL consumption continues to grow “What historians will definitely wonder about in future centuries is how deeply flawed logic, obscured by shrewd and unrelenting propaganda, actually enabled a coalition of powerful special interests to convince nearly everyone in the world that CO2 from human industry was a dangerous, planet-destroying toxin. It will be remembered as the greatest mass delusion in the history of the world – that CO2, the life of plants, was considered for a time to be a deadly poison.” Richard Lindzen, Emeritus Professor of Meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Climate “Science” | Dr. Richard Lindzen | Jordan B Peterson: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVSrTZDopM If you are so busy lobbying, how do you manage to find the time to post so many times? If you are so busy lobbying, how do you manage to read all of those thousands of peer reviewed science papers? And, why do you not answer J Boles questions? Beetroot relies absolutely and completely on the many things that use fossil fuels. He could never exist without them. Even beetroots need CO2 to grow.. Don’t be too hard on the poor baby, bnice! He’s so delusional that he actually believes that a trace gas has more control over our climate than oceanic cycles and currents, or the Sun! Think how embarrassing it is going to be for him when the adults in his life finally have to explain reality to him! Some are made to be fools! No, Mr. Beeton, you are wrong. There is absolutely no need to bankrupt economies in fear of global warming. A warmer Earth would be an entirely beneficial thing. Historically, the Earth has been warmer than today for 99% of the last 240,000,000 years. We are currently in a Great Ice Age. The coldest point in geologic history was a mere 20,000 years ago, a blip in geologic time. Feigned ignorance of these facts is deliberate abuse of science. No preceding period or epoch with a warmer climate was detrimental to life. On the contrary, life was abundant in past warmth, more abundant, widespread, bio-diverse, and productive than today. All human endeavors also benefit from warmth, including agriculture. The warmest climes are the best for farming, ranching, forestry, and horticulture. That’s a known fact. And CO2 increases yields of all the above. Production of food, clothing, and shelter increase with increasing warmth. The basic needs for human survival correlate. AI, on the other hand, is not needed at all, provides no survival necessity, is a toy, a useless indulgence, and is in fact a hazard to human survival and the well-being of all life. Nope. The transition to cheaper cleaner energy is all good. But if not done, the harmful costs and effects of global warming will continue to worsen. Governments are moving ahead, including in the US. You may not like it, but the energy transition is underway “…, the harmful costs and effects of global warming will continue to worsen….” where are your “costs” and “bad effects” Put up or SHUT UP ! Read and be educated: https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/effects/ “Scientists predict ” you can’t show any of your imaginary effects are happening . But just Beet on . Still only find nebulous propaganda pap.. that is just sad. Nothing on that page has a single bit of scientific credibility whatsoever. U.S. Sea Level Likely to Rise 1 to 6.6 Feet by 2100 Currently around 2-3mm/year, the 6.6ft value is pure fantasy. Climate Changes Will Continue Through This Century and Beyond Based on fake unvalidated models.. ie scientific BS. btw, the climate has ALWAYS changed over time, so I’m assuming they mean the fallacy of human-based CO2 warming. Hurricanes Will Become Stronger and More Intense No evidence of that happening. Mantra BS. More Droughts and Heat Waves No evidence of that happening. Mantra BS. Longer Wildfire Season Wildfires in the USA consumed far larger areas in the 1930s Yet another piece of fakery based on unvalidated models. Changes in Precipitation Patterns Have happened throughout history, no evidence human causes them except local land use. Frost-Free Season (and Growing Season) will Lengthen GREAT NEWS for farmers and food supply, but still based on unvalidated models. Global Temperatures Will Continue to Rise Again, based on unvalidated models based on unproven erroneous assumptions. Arctic Is Very Likely to Become Ice-Free More model based BS, Arctic has been stable for last 15 years after recovering from an extreme peak in 1979. Is still far above the extent for most of the last 10,000 years All just propaganda pap for the low-IQ ignorant AGW-cultist. And you still put it forward as “evidence” !!! Really You have well below zero credibility !! Lets see if you can provide some precise evidence rather than this sort of nonsense and mantra pap. Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. That is not a peer reviewed paper and a lot of what is posted contradicts ARg. Totally energy use 2023. Solar 2.5%, wind 3.5% fossil fuels 81.5 % There is no “transition”. COAL consumption continues to grow GAS consumption continues to grow OIL consumption continues to grow. You are DELUDED and brain-hosed, until all that is left in your skull is a sickly green ooze. President Donald Trump will put an end to this energy transition nonsense by ending the billion dollars of subsidies for wind an solar. Legislation is required to change US energy policy. At the moment, the Republican margin in the House is razor thin, and they are so fractured, they can’t get anything done. in two years, the other party will likely be back in power in the House and the energy transition will continue . You think Trump can’t find away around the green mess that stops progress. Great to see you so against democracy….. you must be a marxist or a moron. ! And you are even more deluded than I thought. ! Only transition in the USA has been from coal to GAS. DRILL BABY DRILL. Trump flipped 4 Senate seats at the last election. He could easily flip a few more in two years time. Probably had 3 more if the marxo-democrats didn’t count “ballots” for week on end. A number of Democrats in Congress have defected from the pack. It will not take but a few more getting back to sensible legislation to make your speculation prove false. “Governments are moving ahead, including in the US.” Drill Baby DRILL !! cheaper cleaner energy Liar. “The wind and sun are free!” — Nitpick Nick Stokes Over their short life time from mining to disposal, wind and solar are one of the most polluting forms of electricity there is. The amount of mining and highly toxic chemicals used in their production is horrendous. They then decimate whole environments, farmland and avian critters in their installation and use. Then at end of their short life have to be disposed of in dump sites, leave huge lumps of concrete in the ground And they are not clean! Oh dear still falling for that furphy. So MAL-EDUCATED and gullible. SOLAR DOES NOT WORK AT NIGHT Are you so dumb that you don’t realise that? It is almost totally absent at peak electricity usage. All it is is a parasitic supply available only when the sun shines. Everywhere that wind and solar infect the grid.. …. electricity prices SKYROCKET. ! And you STILL haven’t answered the question… 1… Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. OK, shillboi, see if you can answer this: What material is vital for the production of steel, glass, silicon, etc. from raw ores? And the IEA is a much bigger liar than you. N.B. shillboi ran away from answering. The answer is coal and petroleum. Energy is vital for their production. Did you sleep through the science class that explained the different forms of energy? Are you claiming it is possible to manufacture steel with wind turbines? Fool. As usual, Karlomonte seems to be the fool: “Yes, steel can be made with electricity: You’re the fool if you think you can source electricity for these processes from wind turbines and turn a profit. But because you’re a marxist, you are trying to eliminate capitalism. “Yes, steel can be made with electricity: At a very high cost. Everything you put up as evidence NEVER, analyzes the cost to the end user. Show a study that steel from electricity (and no FF allowed for backup) and purchased by end users will be cheaper than steel made from fossil fuels. If you can’t show this, all RE will be doing is causing more inflation and hurting people at the low end of the income scale. You must enjoy that! It’s likely that some uses of electricity instead of direct fossil fuel combustion will raise costs. But that will be a far smaller cost to society than the increasing environmental damages due to climate change, already underway. You quote the International Energy Agency? Try finding a credible source. You are deep into your Denial Silo — denial of peer reviewed science, now denial of reliable sources, and embrace of junk science. Another moronic comment from the beetroot. Your insults further erode what minimal credibility you once had. Read that. First it is IEA, which is a propaganda arm of the UN. Second, their analysis is terribly flawed. Third, LCOE has many unqualified assumptions, one of which is how long an energy producing system functions at 100% and excludes MTBF. https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Solar-Is-Cheapest-Energy-Source-Says-IEA.html It is also BY FAR the most polluting of all electricity supply options. It’s truly one of the most filthy industrial processes ever invented. The mining, acid leaching, high tonnage coal use for heat treatment and smelting with associated fumes and silicosis disease from dusts and much more makes solar manufacturing one of the filthiest processes ever. It costs 3x more to recycle than landfill, so recycling is nearly non-existent. The toxic heavy metals leach out over time. The first step in cleaning silica to produce metallurgical grade silicon is to rinse it with a mixture of one part acid to one part water This process is called acid leaching and is used to remove impurities such as iron, aluminium, and calcium from the silica. The purified silica is then heated with carbon in the form of coal or charcoal in an electrode arc furnace at a temperature of 1500-2000°C to produce metallurgical grade silicon that is 98% pure.. Some of the solvents used are hydrochloric acid, hydrofluoric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid possibly in combination with each other as a solvent for purification of MG-Si. You are POLLUTION WORSHIPPER….. disgusting !! You are absolutely correct, silicon wafer production is not an easy task. Bullshit, from a bullshitter. So now you are quoting a source that quotes IEA. Peer reviewed? Not. In fact, you did not even read it. LOL. I read it. It is contrary to your stubborn position. Some key points in that oilprice article: “Substantial cost related to renewables that gets overlooked on a regular basis is the need for storage capacity to offset the intermittency problem.” “But what the LCOE formula does not account for is the fact that wind and solar do not generate electricity around the clock. That’s one major cost that is getting overlooked.” “Another substantial cost related to renewables that gets overlooked on a regular basis is the need for storage capacity to offset the intermittency problem.” “First, there is no such storage capacity available that could solve the problem in its entirety, and this already means solar is not as cheap as suggested by its LCOE. Second, available storage technology is rather expensive, piling on more additional costs, also overlooked by the LCOE formula.” BOTTOM LINE: “The reason that the IEA has reached that conclusion is a simple one: cost assumptions. It is based on cost assumptions for solar power generation costs versus fossil fuel costs by the International Energy Agency, an enthusiastic cheerleader for a complete energy transition to a wind, solar, and hydrogen dominated grid, who has concluded that solar is the cheapest form of energy available.” “But what the LCOE formula does not account for is the fact that wind and solar do not generate electricity around the clock. That’s one major cost that is getting overlooked.” And the expert (read “fool”) thinks it is possible to operate electric blast furnaces from these sources, and make a profit. “The transition to cheaper cleaner energy is all good“ Which is why electricity prices SKYROCKET everywhere the infection of wind and solar gets too big. 😉 New AI in the USA will mean a HUGE increase in GAS, and nuclear… … and coal is also likely to make a big resurgence. Wind and solar are totally useless for this purpose. It is neither cheaper nor is it cleaner. So Beeton is gaslighting? Who could have ever guessed? That is a categorically false statement. You are ignoring reality. Its is totally TRUE. You are just too dumb to realise you are doing it. Cite with a link the peer reviewed science paper that refutes my statement. I double dog dare you! Still awaiting a scientific citation from you for your claim that atmospheric CO2 ppmv in 1820 was comparable to today. Still searching? Or were you just blowing smoke? Cheaper? Cleaner? Not when one includes the lifecycle costs and the total cost of ownership, which includes disposal of use, non-recyclable materials. Yes renewables are indeed both cleaner and cheaper. Liar. Yes renewables are indeed both cleaner and cheaper. Show us ONE large location, like a state or country, where the installation of wind and solar has reduced the price of electricity to the average end user. Because utilities allocate the investment costs of any new power plants to all ratepayers, your bill always go up when utilities add generating capacity. But with nuclear, those rate increases will be greater than if the utility added natural gas or coal plants. With solar or onshore wind, those rate increases are usually less. From the electronic bible… The iron shall lie down with the lamp Climate change is not a problem, they have a crisis of faith Running an industrial society on wind and solar will require science fiction level storage, something with the performance of Robert Heinlein’s Shipstones. A major plot element in “Friday” was that the trade secret was so valuable the various factions of the Shipstone Trust run that fictional society. A note to various investment companies:it is fiction. Thanks for the Heinlein reference. I was not aware of that when I mentioned that AI would require dependable energy “in science-fiction-like quantities.” “These two former economic powerhouses currently receive over 40% of their electricity from renewables.” Really? I kinda doubt it- other than some rare moments. I don’t know- somebody here can nail it down. It is actually about correct. Go to https://ourworldindata.org/energy Scroll down to the selection boxes about half way down, and click “Electricity Mix” Find the graph which has a tab saying “edit countries and regions”, deselect ‘World’ and select the country you want to look at. You should get a chart where you can read of the values for each type of electricity supply, and be able to do some quick calculation. Bear in mind though… both the UK and Germany are teetering on the edge of collapse energy-wise and are destroying all their manufacturing base because of very high electricity prices. They are on their way to third world status. Anglo-Saxons are practically there … Practically, but.., ‘Strained’ Keir Starmer badly needs holiday, his friends say as they reveal PM is suffering from the ‘relentless strain’ of the job https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14217547/Strained-Keir-Starmer-badly-needs-holiday.html Snowflake PM For the UK, number is actually 43% https://www.cladcodecking.co.uk/blog/post/renewable-energy-percentage-uk and for Germany 52% https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/renewables-cover-more-half-germanys-electricity-demand-first-time-year#:~:text=Clean%20Energy%20Wire,-, according to these two sources. Even if these numbers are too high, the wind and solar contribution is large enough to have put both countries in jeopardy from Dunkelflaute in November and again in the past 10 days, after I wrote the piece. There is a very simple solution to our energy conundrum, we know big tech, AI and related industries need outrageous amounts of power. If we want a reliable and plentiful source of energy we put them last in line for the power. In other words if there is a danger of a brown out or black out they are the first to have to cut back. The health and wellbeing of the citizen comes before anything else. If we demanded this new fossil fuel and nuclear generators would start popping up everywhere and the big tech/AI guys would be standing in line to help finance them. As for the government and outfits like Blackrock they can go to hell. We don’t much care what they think. Also, maybe, those with the larger demand should pay more per unit because they’re putting a strain on the system. Yes, they should pay more. In Virginia, the legislature is considering changing the cost allocation formula to put more of the burden on data centers instead of spreading the costs across all rate payers. Is that the Virginia that plans to import lots of coal, gas and nuclear powered electricity from out of state ?? Virginia is basically surrounded by Republican states. I hope they say.. “If you want the data centre, the you provide the electricity for it.” That will force Virginia to build new COAL, GAS or NUCLEAR power stations. That would be fun to watch 🙂 Or, require the data centers to build their own power plant. If the data centers pay more for energy, then data center users pay more. Those users then pass their higher costs on and on and on. Either way, the common folk foot the bill. This is econ 101. Under most Public Utility Commission regs, as set by the state, that is correct. However, because there will be so many power generation facilities added in n VA for data centers, the state legislature is considering legislation that would allocate more of the new power plant and transmission line costs to data centers. Stay tuned. Joseph, I don’t want them treated different in any way so long as they see to it that new fossil fuel and nuclear generators are built. I would hope that since they are so dependent on reliable and available energy that they would build plenty for all of us. Germany and UK are moving steadily toward economic oblivion. BMW, Mercedes and Volkswagen are all facing losses with massive slump in profitability. It is not possible to combine 2,500kg of exotic materials in a way that makes any motor vehicle suitable for the masses. They are creating engineering monstrosities unfit for purpose. A motor vehicle weighing 2,500kg capable of carry 4 people and luggage – say 500kg payload. The Ford Model T weighed 750kg and could transport 750kg if needed. It was a useful vehicle. . Great for woke virtue-seeking though !! “AMD’s new series scales from eight cores up to the $14,813 192-core / 384-thread EPYC 9965, a 500W behemoth that leverages TSMC’s 3nm node for the ultimate in compute density with dense Zen 5c cores.” A building full of these for a super-computer will require several nuclear generators Quick…. build the solar farm to drive it. 😉 Conventional data centers consume about 300-400 watts per sq ft. AI will increase that number 3x or 4x, or more. And that will require solid reliable electricity supply Are you ADVOCATING GAS or Nuclear ? Even a nil-educated monkey like you must know that wind and solar can never provide. He is the co-founder of the Prince William Virginia Chapter of Citizens Climate Lobby and teaches the science of energy and climate change to continuing education students in Northern Virginia. Is this you ? That’s a collection of uneducated brain-washed students in the making !! No hope for their future , thanks to this low level indoctrination. Really sad. The IEA estimates that data centres total electricity consumption could reach the equivalent of the electricity consumption of Japan by 2026. IEA ‘Electricity 2024 Analysis and forecast to 2026’ (Jan 2024) Ok. Cite with a link the peer reviewed science report that backs up your claim. Those Data center power consumption estimates were presented by the Data Center Trade Association in a public forum. I took notes, but I have no written report from the association. And it is also high time that investors let them know that they will no longer entrust their capital to those who refuse to see that AI lions cannot live on peekaboo sunshine and the whimsy of the wind. Or, investors should recognize that an AI stock market bubble is growing and will eventually burst. I want to put my money into self-driving cars! Then sell them to gullible Democrats and AGW-cultists. 🙂 What could possibly go wrong !! 😉 The future of AI investments was outside the scope of my piece. See this Goldman Sachs report, in particular the comments by Acemoglu and Covello https://www.goldmansachs.com/images/migrated/insights/pages/gs-research/gen-ai–too-much-spend%2C-too-little-benefit-/TOM_AI%202.0_ForRedaction.pdf?ref=wheresyoured.at?ref=wheresyoured.at Thanks for this. It’s a lot to read, but it’s interesting commentary. Half of what most people think about AI is true and the other half not. The true part is that it is artificial. As for renewable, green, net zero, climate protecting, sustainable, energy systems, the only true part is that they are tenuously connected somehow to the idea of energy. Well, my friends and opponents, I bid you adieu and wish you a Merry Christmas (or the equivalent based on your beliefs) and peace and good will to all.

Title: Retire On $460,000 In 2025 With This Simple 7-Fund Portfolio

Happy senior couple relaxing on deck chairs at beach The suits on Wall Street will say that $460K isn’t enough to retire on. Well, that “modest” nest egg will earn $64,860 in dividends alone when invested in this simple 7-CEF portfolio. CEFs are the code name for closed-end funds. They are a lesser-known cousin to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds. CEFs tend to have modest assets under management. Which is their superpower. Fewer assets mean greater yields! Consider the 7-CEF portfolio we are about to discuss versus the standard high-yield stock benchmark ETF: CEF High Yields There is no comparison! But before we buy blindly, let’s do our homework and make sure these CEFs are not paper payout tigers. After all, a double-digit yield isn’t much good if it is soon chopped to single digits. Liberty All-Star Equity Fund (USA, 10.2% distribution rate) is as much of a straight shooter as we could want. This equity CEF, launched in 1987, provides a 60/40 blend of value/growth through roughly 145 stock picks selected by five teams of managers—three value-oriented and two growth-oriented. The top of the portfolio will look S&P 500-esque; names such as Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Amazon (AMZN) get top billing, ensuring we’re still getting exposure to tech megatrends like artificial intelligence. But other firms—such as Fresenius Medical Care (FMS), S&P Global (SPGI), and Capital One (COF)—enjoy much more weight than they do in the index. Despite a value lean, USA is surprisingly competitive. Importantly, USA isn’t leaning on leverage or options to generate that 10%-plus yield—that’s a combination of income, capital gains, and occasionally, return of capital. USA’s distribution policy is to pay out four quarterly installments of 2.5% of the fund’s net asset value, so payouts will float around a little bit. This does mean that from a pure price-performance perspective, Liberty All-Star doesn’t look nearly as good—but distributions cover that gap. A small 1.5% discount to NAV doesn’t seem like much compared to other closed-end funds, but that’s common for USA. In fact, its five-year average discount is a mere 0.5%. I won’t spend much time on Nuveen Floating Rate Income Fund (JFR, 11.4% distribution rate), which I highlighted in a recent review of double-digit bond ideas, but its massive monthly yield warrants a mention here. Nuveen Floating Rate Income Fund is a well-diversified portfolio of 430 corporate floating-rate bonds that leans heavily into junk (90% of assets are invested in below-investment-grade debt). Unlike USA, it puts the pedal to the debt metal, using a high 38% leverage to boost its picks—and that has worked in its favor with a wild 25% return over the past year. Just beware: This Nuveen CEF’s discount has all but evaporated. Western Asset Diversified Income (WDI, 12.1% distribution rate), a Franklin Templeton CEF, holds a wide array of debt investments. Commercial junk is the anchor of this fund, at about 40% of the portfolio, but WDI also provides exposure to collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), bank loans, commercial mortgage-backed securities (MBSs), investment-grade credit, emerging-market sovereigns, asset-backed securities (ABSs) and more. And this CEF also boasts access to private debt “not typically available through traditional mutual funds.” Credit quality is low, and leverage is high, resulting in a spectacular 12%-plus annual rate on its monthly distribution—and an interesting history for this relatively young fund (inception June 2021). There’s not much history here, valuation-wise, but its current 4% discount is slimmer than its three-year average (9%). Also note that WDI is a term trust that will liquidate on or about June 24, 2033. Another term-limited CEF with a wild yield is the BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust (BIGZ, 13.4% distribution rate). This fund buys predominantly mid- and small-cap companies that are, well, “innovative” and that management believes have better-than-average earnings growth potential. Holdings include the likes of Taser maker Axon Enterprise (AXON) and tech electrical infrastructure firm Vertiv (VRT), but also private investments (which it folds under cryptic names like “Project Picasso”). Obviously, these innovative companies aren’t paying out dividends. Instead, BIGZ generates income by selling covered calls within the portfolio. Distributions have historically been entirely return of capital. And these big distributions are effectively mandated—BIGZ has a managed distribution plan that requires it to pay out 12% of its 12-month average NAV through at least September 2025. BIGZ is also subject to a discount management program. If this CEF trades at a discount greater than 7.5% during any of four three-month measurement periods, the fund will offer a repurchase of 2.5% of its outstanding common shares at a valuation of 98% of NAV. This program will run through March 31, 2025, and could be extended by the fund’s board. From publicly available info, it looks like BIGZ could hit that mark for the Oct. 1-Dec. 31 measurement period, and it currently trades at a nearly 11% discount to NAV. Just remember: “Discount” does not mean “value.” BIGZ’s strategy has been a disaster so far. While the fund is at least on an upswing now, it’s still undershooting a basic tech index. We can get our dividends from around the globe, too. And few international funds offer a yield as scintillating as The India Fund (IFN, 13.7% distribution rate). No options, and no leverage here. IFN is a straightforward Abrdn equity fund with a singular focus on the world’s second-largest country. It’s a tight portfolio, with just 45 components. Financials, such as ICICI Bank (IBN) and HDFC Bank (HDB), have long been prominent and currently make up a quarter of the portfolio. They’re followed by roughly 10% allocations in industrials and information technology. Again, distributions here are rarely made of dividend income—here, they’re almost always capital gains. But investors should have no complaints. One last note on IFN: It’s trading at a roughly 11% discount to NAV. While this is in line with its historical norms, it’s a welcome departure from the past couple of years, which saw IFN trade at slimmer discounts and even premiums at times. Abrdn Income Credit Strategies Fund (ACP, 15.7% distribution rate) is a global corporate junk fund. Roughly 30% of assets are invested in U.S. high-yield, with the remaining 70% scattered across the U.K., Luxembourg, Germany and more. Maturities are in line with comparable index funds—85% in 0-5 years, and most of the rest in 5-10 years. Credit quality is junkier, though, with 60% of assets in B-rated bonds and 23% in CCC-rated debt. (It shows, too—the monthly dole has dropped twice since 2020.) Leverage is moderate at close to 15%, but this is still an aggressive fund that rides like a roller coaster. That leads to mixed productivity, but ACP can be useful over shorter time periods. Currently, this CEF might be nearing one of those useful inflection points, as its discount to NAV has widened to about 9%—well above its five-year average discount of just 1%. Investors seeking out a more complete portfolio will find that in the BlackRock Capital Allocation Term Trust (BCAT, 22.1% distribution rate), another term trust that will dissolve on or about Sept. 27, 2032. They’ll also find one of the highest yields on Wall Street—a fat 20%-plus distribution that has already improved twice since the fund launched in 2020. BCAT is an allocation fund that provides a roughly 55/45 split of stocks and bonds. It uses little leverage (5%), but it does sell covered calls—generating a boatload of income, though the end result is that the lion’s share of distributions end up being return of capital. This CEF struggled mightily in its first two-plus years of trading, but it has fared much better during the second post-COVID bull market. The turnaround is a welcome one for shareholders, though most might be second-guessing just how much stability this balanced portfolio can really provide. BCAT belongs to the same discount management plan as BIGZ, and has a managed distribution plan that requires it to pay out 20% of its 12-month average NAV through at least September 2025. How long BCAT will continue to enjoy these support programs is unknown. And would-be investors get to wonder what’s next from this Jekyll-and-Hyde fund, whose meteoric run has also narrowed the discount from nearly 20% in 2023 to just 6% today.

USA’s distribution policy is to pay out four quarterly installments of 2.5% of the fund’s net asset value, so payouts will float around a little bit. This does mean that from a pure price-performance perspective, Liberty All-Star doesn’t look nearly as good—but distributions cover that gap. A small 1.5% discount to NAV doesn’t seem like much compared to other closed-end funds, but that’s common for USA. In fact, its five-year average discount is a mere 0.5%. I won’t spend much time on Nuveen Floating Rate Income Fund (JFR, 11.4% distribution rate), which I highlighted in a recent review of double-digit bond ideas, but its massive monthly yield warrants a mention here. Nuveen Floating Rate Income Fund is a well-diversified portfolio of 430 corporate floating-rate bonds that leans heavily into junk (90% of assets are invested in below-investment-grade debt). Unlike USA, it puts the pedal to the debt metal, using a high 38% leverage to boost its picks—and that has worked in its favor with a wild 25% return over the past year. Just beware: This Nuveen CEF’s discount has all but evaporated. Western Asset Diversified Income (WDI, 12.1% distribution rate), a Franklin Templeton CEF, holds a wide array of debt investments. Commercial junk is the anchor of this fund, at about 40% of the portfolio, but WDI also provides exposure to collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), bank loans, commercial mortgage-backed securities (MBSs), investment-grade credit, emerging-market sovereigns, asset-backed securities (ABSs) and more. And this CEF also boasts access to private debt “not typically available through traditional mutual funds.” Credit quality is low, and leverage is high, resulting in a spectacular 12%-plus annual rate on its monthly distribution—and an interesting history for this relatively young fund (inception June 2021). There’s not much history here, valuation-wise, but its current 4% discount is slimmer than its three-year average (9%). Also note that WDI is a term trust that will liquidate on or about June 24, 2033. Another term-limited CEF with a wild yield is the BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust (BIGZ, 13.4% distribution rate). This fund buys predominantly mid- and small-cap companies that are, well, “innovative” and that management believes have better-than-average earnings growth potential. Holdings include the likes of Taser maker Axon Enterprise (AXON) and tech electrical infrastructure firm Vertiv (VRT), but also private investments (which it folds under cryptic names like “Project Picasso”). Obviously, these innovative companies aren’t paying out dividends. Instead, BIGZ generates income by selling covered calls within the portfolio. Distributions have historically been entirely return of capital. And these big distributions are effectively mandated—BIGZ has a managed distribution plan that requires it to pay out 12% of its 12-month average NAV through at least September 2025. BIGZ is also subject to a discount management program. If this CEF trades at a discount greater than 7.5% during any of four three-month measurement periods, the fund will offer a repurchase of 2.5% of its outstanding common shares at a valuation of 98% of NAV. This program will run through March 31, 2025, and could be extended by the fund’s board. From publicly available info, it looks like BIGZ could hit that mark for the Oct. 1-Dec. 31 measurement period, and it currently trades at a nearly 11% discount to NAV. Just remember: “Discount” does not mean “value.” BIGZ’s strategy has been a disaster so far. While the fund is at least on an upswing now, it’s still undershooting a basic tech index. We can get our dividends from around the globe, too. And few international funds offer a yield as scintillating as The India Fund (IFN, 13.7% distribution rate). No options, and no leverage here. IFN is a straightforward Abrdn equity fund with a singular focus on the world’s second-largest country. It’s a tight portfolio, with just 45 components. Financials, such as ICICI Bank (IBN) and HDFC Bank (HDB), have long been prominent and currently make up a quarter of the portfolio. They’re followed by roughly 10% allocations in industrials and information technology. Again, distributions here are rarely made of dividend income—here, they’re almost always capital gains. But investors should have no complaints. One last note on IFN: It’s trading at a roughly 11% discount to NAV. While this is in line with its historical norms, it’s a welcome departure from the past couple of years, which saw IFN trade at slimmer discounts and even premiums at times. Abrdn Income Credit Strategies Fund (ACP, 15.7% distribution rate) is a global corporate junk fund. Roughly 30% of assets are invested in U.S. high-yield, with the remaining 70% scattered across the U.K., Luxembourg, Germany and more. Maturities are in line with comparable index funds—85% in 0-5 years, and most of the rest in 5-10 years. Credit quality is junkier, though, with 60% of assets in B-rated bonds and 23% in CCC-rated debt. (It shows, too—the monthly dole has dropped twice since 2020.) Leverage is moderate at close to 15%, but this is still an aggressive fund that rides like a roller coaster. That leads to mixed productivity, but ACP can be useful over shorter time periods. Currently, this CEF might be nearing one of those useful inflection points, as its discount to NAV has widened to about 9%—well above its five-year average discount of just 1%. Investors seeking out a more complete portfolio will find that in the BlackRock Capital Allocation Term Trust (BCAT, 22.1% distribution rate), another term trust that will dissolve on or about Sept. 27, 2032. They’ll also find one of the highest yields on Wall Street—a fat 20%-plus distribution that has already improved twice since the fund launched in 2020. BCAT is an allocation fund that provides a roughly 55/45 split of stocks and bonds. It uses little leverage (5%), but it does sell covered calls—generating a boatload of income, though the end result is that the lion’s share of distributions end up being return of capital. This CEF struggled mightily in its first two-plus years of trading, but it has fared much better during the second post-COVID bull market. The turnaround is a welcome one for shareholders, though most might be second-guessing just how much stability this balanced portfolio can really provide. BCAT belongs to the same discount management plan as BIGZ, and has a managed distribution plan that requires it to pay out 20% of its 12-month average NAV through at least September 2025. How long BCAT will continue to enjoy these support programs is unknown. And would-be investors get to wonder what’s next from this Jekyll-and-Hyde fund, whose meteoric run has also narrowed the discount from nearly 20% in 2023 to just 6% today.

Title: Retire On $460,000 In 2025 With This Simple 7-Fund Portfolio

Happy senior couple relaxing on deck chairs at beach The suits on Wall Street will say that $460K isn’t enough to retire on. Well, that “modest” nest egg will earn $64,860 in dividends alone when invested in this simple 7-CEF portfolio. CEFs are the code name for closed-end funds. They are a lesser-known cousin to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds. CEFs tend to have modest assets under management. Which is their superpower. Fewer assets mean greater yields! Consider the 7-CEF portfolio we are about to discuss versus the standard high-yield stock benchmark ETF: CEF High Yields There is no comparison! But before we buy blindly, let’s do our homework and make sure these CEFs are not paper payout tigers. After all, a double-digit yield isn’t much good if it is soon chopped to single digits. Liberty All-Star Equity Fund (USA, 10.2% distribution rate) is as much of a straight shooter as we could want. This equity CEF, launched in 1987, provides a 60/40 blend of value/growth through roughly 145 stock picks selected by five teams of managers—three value-oriented and two growth-oriented. The top of the portfolio will look S&P 500-esque; names such as Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Amazon (AMZN) get top billing, ensuring we’re still getting exposure to tech megatrends like artificial intelligence. But other firms—such as Fresenius Medical Care (FMS), S&P Global (SPGI), and Capital One (COF)—enjoy much more weight than they do in the index. Despite a value lean, USA is surprisingly competitive. Importantly, USA isn’t leaning on leverage or options to generate that 10%-plus yield—that’s a combination of income, capital gains, and occasionally, return of capital. USA’s distribution policy is to pay out four quarterly installments of 2.5% of the fund’s net asset value, so payouts will float around a little bit.

Title: Spotify stock is trading at all-time highs just 2 years after a record low. Here's how it got there.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. At the end of 2022, Spotify (SPOT) stock was trading below $80 a share after a disastrous year for investors that erased over $35 billion from the company's market cap. Today, shares are trading at just under $500. The audio giant is on track to hit full-year profitability for the first time ever. And its market cap? About $100 billion, up from just $15 billion two years ago. The company's colossal run-up in stock price follows an intense business overhaul that's included everything from mass layoffs and C-suite shakeups to a major strategic shift away from podcasts, an area it had aggressively pursued. At the company's 2022 Investor Day, Spotify set seemingly lofty objectives that included long-term gross margin targets between 30% and 35%. At the time, the company had been struggling to turn a profit, with its gross margin stuck at around 25%. In the most recent quarter, Spotify said its gross margin increased to 31.1% from the prior year's 26.4%. "We've never been in a stronger position, thanks to what's really been an outstanding execution by the Spotify team," CEO Daniel Ek said during the company's fiscal third quarter earnings call in November. He added, "We are where we set out to be, if not a little bit further, and on a steady path toward achieving our long-term goals." Wall Street analysts who cover Spotify have a median price target of just around $486 a share with 29 Buy ratings, eight Holds, and just three Sells, according to the latest Bloomberg consensus estimates. Spotify, one of the stock market's big pandemic-era trades, saw shares balloon in early 2021 as the company sought to broaden its business from music streaming to other areas of the audio market. At the time, the company's endeavors echoed moves from other tech giants in pursuit of that goal. Think heavy spending on hiring and deep-pocketed investments in growth initiatives. For Spotify, that was podcasts. Between 2019 and 2021, Spotify spent $1 billion pushing into the podcast market, signing on celebrities like the Obamas, Prince Harry, and Kim Kardashian. The company paid $230 million to acquire podcast studio Gimlet in 2019. Spotify then paid a reported $200 million to bring Joe Rogan exclusively to the platform, and another $200 million for the Ringer in 2020. But the spending era was short-lived as investors and analysts began to focus on the company's lack of profitability and cash flow issues, questioning the staying power of the business model and the credibility of CEO Daniel Ek. It's hard to make money in the audio streaming business, largely due to the sky-high price of content. And compared to its main competitors — deep-pocketed tech behemoths like Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet's YouTube (GOOG, GOOGL), and Apple (AAPL) — Spotify has had an even tougher time absorbing those costs. At the same time, companies in the space have to invest to expand their offerings to win market share. At Spotify, not only was spending aggressive, but a soft advertising market further crimped profit margins. Management attempted to assuage fears with promises that 2022 was a peak investment year and that profitability metrics would begin to improve in 2023. Skepticism still rang high. "Heading into 2023, investors looked at their targets and thought they were very overly ambitious," Morgan Stanley analyst Ben Swinburne told Yahoo Finance in an interview. "It really wasn't until they started to see the company make some proactive moves to drive both top-line growth, but also improve the profits of the company, that investors started to come back to the stock." Turnaround efforts first began in early 2023 as the company reorganized and consolidated business units. It adjusted its podcast strategy to focus more on reaching bigger audiences as opposed to maintaining exclusive content. It also changed up its royalty structure to combat streaming fraud and curb the massive volume of music on the platform, which has escalated as a result of generative AI. But the changes picked up steam over the course of last year, culminating in the fourth quarter when "two really important things happened as it relates to the stock performance," Swinburne said. No. 1, in Swinburne's view, was price increases. Spotify implemented a broad set of price hikes across roughly 70% of its footprint by revenue in mid-2023. The hikes were "much larger and broader than they'd ever done before as a company," the analyst said. Second: massive cost-cutting. The company laid off 17% of its workforce, or about 1,500 employees, in December 2023. This followed a combined 800 employees who were laid off earlier in the year as a result of several restructurings. At the time, the significant reduction in headcount was estimated to lead to approximately 300 million euros ($315 million) in annualized cost savings for fiscal year 2024. "I don't know if I've ever seen a company take that aggressive of cost action while their revenue growth was accelerating, but it was happening at the same time the price increases were being put into place," Swinburne said. "So you had this dual effect of faster revenue growth combined with reduced expenses, which really set the company up into 2024 with a rapidly improving profit profile." Soon after the December layoffs, Spotify also announced that its CFO Paul Vogel would step down from his position after eight years. Vogel, who joined Spotify in 2016 as head of investor relations before taking over the CFO role in 2020, exited his position on March 31. Christian Luiga has since stepped into the role. The efforts didn't stop there. This year, Spotify has doubled down on another growth area with massive potential: audiobooks. "The audiobooks launch is much bigger than audiobooks," Swinburne explained. "It's really about transitioning Spotify from a music-only service to a bundle." The company introduced a higher-priced audio "bundle" that includes music, podcasts, and audiobooks. It also rolled out an audiobooks-only plan and a music-only streaming tier in an effort to cater to a variety of consumers. The changes allowed the company to increase prices for the second time in less than a year. "Spotify was able to show the value of the product to consumers because it had no noticeable churn increase from all of the pricing changes," Swinburne said. "And then, because they transitioned to a bundle, the margins of the business got meaningfully better." To that point, the long-term gross margin goal of 30% to 35% Ek set out for has already been achieved, with the metric once again expected to climb in the fourth quarter to 31.8%. "I think this demonstrates what we've been saying over the past year," Ek said last month. "Spotify is not just a great product but well on its way to become a great business." The proof is in the numbers: Spotify has continued to attract (and not lose) users despite higher prices. Its engagement remains the strongest among competitors, and the value-add of new bundles and premium offerings only strengthens its position. But perhaps most importantly, it's finally making money. And that's always music to investors' ears. Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance. Follow her on X @allie_canal, LinkedIn, and email her at alexandra.canal@yahoofinance.com.

"I think this demonstrates what we've been saying over the past year," Ek said last month. "Spotify is not just a great product but well on its way to become a great business." The proof is in the numbers: Spotify has continued to attract (and not lose) users despite higher prices. Its engagement remains the strongest among competitors, and the value-add of new bundles and premium offerings only strengthens its position. But perhaps most importantly, it's finally making money. And that's always music to investors' ears. Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance. Follow her on X @allie_canal, LinkedIn, and email her at alexandra.canal@yahoofinance.com.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings On big down days for the stock market or prolonged stretches of sell-offs, it's good to have a trusted playbook. Think of it as a guide to keeping your sanity amidst the chaos and, hopefully, your portfolio flush with long-term gains. For me, the sell-off playbook is a twofold exercise honed over years of reporting on business news. First, chat up the smartest people I know in markets and business. What are they doing and saying, and why? Do they sound or look fearful? And two, think deeply on whether something truly has changed in the market or if investors are in a tizzy over splashy headlines. Suffice it to say, I had to dust off this sell-off playbook this week. The end assessment: Relax, folks, this isn't the start of a bear market even though the tape feels punishing. Why, you ask? A lot of the smartest people in the room, so to speak, have valid reasons to stay long on stocks AND the economy isn't falling off a cliff AND we are likely to still get rate cuts in 2025 AND we have a pro-business president in Trump taking office in less than a month. "Big picture, with record earnings, record profit margins, strong productivity, and overall improving consumer and small business sentiment, it is hard to think that this bull market is over," Carson Group chief market strategist Ryan Detrick told me. Says Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner, "The bull market is still intact, but we are seeing a short-term gut check." A gut check, indeed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average promptly finished Wednesday's session down more than 1,100 points. It rallied slightly on Thursday, but the selling pressure renewed on Friday. The index of 30 well-known stocks such as Salesforce (CRM) and Disney (DIS) is off by almost 4% in December as losing stretches have begun to pile on one another amid renewed uncertainty on rate cuts. The S&P 500 is down 3% this month. Market leader Nvidia (NVDA) is down 6% in December. What has spooked the markets is the Fed not committing to aggressive rate cutting in 2025. The consensus among Fed officials is now for two rate cuts next year, down from four previously forecast in September, as the monetary policy body remains concerned about the inflationary outlook. The outlook for inflation is further clouded by potential moves by the incoming Trump administration, such as possibly inflationary tariffs on China. "I don't see many [economic] red flags. People are cautiously optimistic if they own businesses, whether they're small, medium, or large," San Francisco Fed president Mary Daly said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast. But again, nothing I heard from Daly suggested she is concerned about the demand outlook in the US despite inflation being stickier than she and other voting Fed members would like. "The Fed was hawkish but I think people are jumping the gun on assuming rate cuts are over — that’s not what Powell said (plus he just gave markets 100 bps of easing in 2024)," Sevens Report Research founder Tom Essaye told me. "I do think 2025 could start a bit bumpy as Washington may be a bit dysfunctional (as we’re seeing now) and the Fed isn’t as dovish anymore, but I don’t think either are fatal to the bull market unless we see growth start to roll over." Then on the topic of demand, all signs point to an economy continuing to do quite well and supportive of strong earnings growth in 2025. Nike (NKE) called out double-digit percentage e-commerce growth this week for Black Friday on its earnings call. The latest retail sales report was strong. Salesforce co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff tells me he is securing new AI deals at a rapid clip, just weeks after announcing earnings. The AI thesis remains intact and will likely be a key driver of profits and valuation multiples in 2025. "There are strong indicators that this could be a tough year — and, potentially, decade — for the stock market. I’m going to be bold and say we will see the opposite. I have no doubt that AI will drive the stock market in both the short and long term. Countries that lead in AI will see the fastest GDP growth, as well as a significant improvement in standard of living and defense capabilities. And, whoever leads with AI as a company will lead in their industry, regardless of their sector," former Cisco (CSCO) CEO John Chambers flagged this week as one of his 2025 predictions. So, while things feel as if they have changed in the market this week, drill down and it looks similar to what has powered the gains in 2024. Nothing lasts forever, and stocks don't go up in a straight line — two phrases to live by in life and in investing. Three times each week, I drive insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

Title: Elon Musk could soon be as rich as the Netherlands
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/2024/12/22/elon-musk-could-soon-be-as-rich-as-the-netherlands/

In 2027 or soon after we’ll have a new type of fat cat on the planet: the trillionaire (in dollar terms at least). We’ve had billionaires for over a century. US oil tycoon John D Rockefeller was the first to reach that milestone in 1916. According to wealth tracking group Informa Connect Academy (ICA), several current industry titans will achieve trillionaire status before the end of this decade. Elon Musk leads the race but it depends on whose share price performs best over the intervening period. As the head of the electric carmaker Tesla, private rocket company SpaceX and social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Musk is currently the world’s richest man with a current net worth on paper of roughly $450 billion (€431.5bn), according to the Bloomberg Billionaires index. His wealth is estimated to have jumped by more than $170 billion since the US election and his alliance with president-elect Donald Trump, largely on the back of Tesla’s share price. Since the November 5th election Tesla’s stock has surged 70 per cent. On the basis of his current trajectory the ICA predicts he will hit the trillion mark in 2027. But Telsa’s share price has been volatile and Musk appears to be driving X into the ground so things may change. India’s business mogul Gautam Adani is predicted to hit the trillion mark in 2028 followed by Jensen Huang, the chief executive of the AI giant Nvidia, and Prajogo Pangestu, the Indonesian energy and mining mogul, provided their current financial trajectories hold. $1 trillion is a hard quantum to hold in your head. Put it this way it would comfortably buy every home in Ireland. It was only six years ago that companies reached the trillion dollar milestone in terms of valuations (Apple became the first to cross the $1 trillion mark in August 2018) and we marvelled, or thought absurd, that a single company could be financially bigger than a developed economy. There are currently nine companies with trillion dollar valuations: Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Saudi Aramco, Meta, Berkshire Hathway and Taiwanese semiconductor giant TSMC. Now we’re about to confront the notion that an individual could be as valuable as a developed nation and the millions of workers and their labour that comprise it. The Netherlands, one of Europe’s richest countries, has an annual GDP (gross domestic product) of roughly $1 trillion (€960bn). So if the ICA is right Musk will be richer than the Netherlands is now by 2027. What this acceleration in individual wealth says about the state of the world or modern capitalism is disturbing. On one level it suggests that the current period of rapid technological transformation has outgunned the antitrust legislation designed to police it, creating behemoth monopolies and uber elites wielding too much economic power. According to UK economist Duncan Weldon, the wealth of these aspiring trillionaires is also tied into three more conventional but no less consequential economic trends: decades of low interest rates (which have boosted asset values); accelerated corporate profits; and a shift towards less progressive tax systems. Combined these trends have accelerated global inequality. And this appears to be feeding into a breakdown in consensus politics, a throwback to the Rockefeller days when democracy in many countries fractured. According to Oxfam, this inequality trend has been supercharged by the pandemic. In a report earlier this year the charity noted that almost five billion people had been made poorer by the pandemic while the wealth of the five richest people had more than doubled, from $405 billion in 2020 to $869 billion in late 2023. That’s an increase of $14 million an hour. Oxfam says the world’s richest 1 per cent now own 43 per cent of all global financial assets and emit as much carbon pollution as the poorest two-thirds of humanity. Let’s not be naive, market capitalism depends on inequality and is, in part, driven by it (some people will work harder or take financial risks to get ahead), but when the gap between top and bottom gets too large, when a critical mass of citizens feel the system is rigged against them, we tend to get radical politics. That was surely the lesson of the 20th century. In the 1960s the gap was modest by today’s standards. Expressed as the ratio of the boss’s salary to those on the factory floor, it was just 15-to-1 in the US. According to the Washington-based Economic Policy Institute it is now 221-to-1. Other estimates suggest it is higher. Of course salary is just one metric. In Ireland and other countries an intergenerational divide on housing has become a major and ongoing source of grievance. Musk said once that he believed the effects of technology and artificial intelligence (AI) on employment would soon make it necessary for countries to provide citizens with a basic income as a guardrail against inequality. This was before he bought his way into the second Trump presidency (spending a reported $250 million on the campaign) and supercharged his wealth in the process.

Title: Insider Today: Blackstone's holiday cheer

Welcome back to our Sunday edition, a roundup of some of our top stories. You've likely heard the term "supercommuter," but you might have wondered… why? Someone who does it from Washington, DC, to NYC admits she's not sure the job is worth the commute. Still, she's not regretting doing it. On the agenda today: But first: Blackstone's feeling festive. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Insider's app here. Blackstone released its annual holiday video for the seventh consecutive year, which might elicit the reaction: Why is a firm managing $1 trillion worried about holiday videos? The videos — full of self-deprecating jokes and Blackstone-backed product placement (of course) — have become a bit of an annual tradition on Wall Street. Last year's notched 8 million views across platforms, a spokesman told BI. We've got a full rundown and ranking of all seven videos here. Some people are laughing at Blackstone as opposed to with Blackstone, but that's kind of the point. In an industry full of super serious people doing super serious business for super serious clients, Blackstone's willing to make itself the butt of the joke. Ok, yes, there is a business case for the videos. Jay Gillespie, the head of Blackstone's video team and one of the brains behind the holiday extravaganza, spoke to BI's Alex Nicoll about the evolution of his role at the firm. Blackstone's not alone in its outside-the-box approach to marketing on the Street. More firms are getting a bit — to borrow a phrase from my British colleagues — cheeky in pitching themselves to the general public. Take BlackRock, which a few years ago took to social media to make clear it's not Blackstone. (The firms have a long history together and have sometimes lean into the confusion between the two. BlackRock CEO and cofounder Larry Fink made a cameo in Blackstone's holiday video this year: "Can you believe people confuse US for THEM?") Wall Street's marketing frenzy isn't foolproof. For an industry that prides itself on what kind of business you are bringing to a firm, marketing's impact isn't as direct as landing a massive deal or hitting the perfect trade. Wealthy musicians received millions of dollars from the Shuttered Venue Operators Grant, a pandemic relief program intended for struggling independent venues and arts groups. However, stars like Lil Wayne and Chris Brown used the program as a piggy bank to keep the party going, exclusive reporting from BI shows. Thousands of pages of accounting documents reveal how artists directed millions in taxpayer funds toward their own bank accounts, luxury purchases, and entertainment expenses — often outweighing what they spent on touring crew members. How musicians spent the grant money. Luisa Isabel Álvarez de Toledo, a Spanish duchess, devoted much of her life to cataloging the Archive of Medina-Sidonia, a priceless collection that had been in her family for generations. Comprising of 6 million documents, the archive details the secrets of the kings, dukes, and explorers of medieval Spain. After Luisa Isabel died, she left her three children just 743,000 euros. However, the bulk of her estate — and control of the archives — went to the woman she'd married on her deathbed. What ensued after was a bitter legal battle that would shatter the family, captivate Spain, and throw the fate of the archives into doubt. Inside the palace showdown. There is perhaps no real-estate metric more loved — and loathed — than Zillow's automated home valuation tool. The Zestimate draws casual clickers to the site, whether it's to lurk on previous residences, friends' or colleagues' homes, or the value of your neighbor's property against yours. The problem is that the Zestimate is often misguided, and Americans' obsession with it can create crushing reality checks when homes actually hit the market. But that's not a problem for Zillow. Earlier this month, Citigroup welcomed 34 managing directors, marking its biggest class in years. Behind the scenes, however, the bank's promotion process can be political and pit employees against each other, four current and former managing directors told BI. The bank rates its employees on a forced curve, assessing them from best to worst. These rankings influence whether an employee might receive a promotion or lose their bonus. Managing directors break down how it works. This week's quote: "What we're having to speak of already sounds like we're lying — it already sounds like a movie because it's so horrible." — Adria English worked as a dancer at Sean "Diddy" Combs' famous white parties and filed a lawsuit in July accusing him of sex trafficking. Combs has vehemently denied all accusations of sexual assault and sex trafficking.

Title: Dick’s Sporting Goods’ Chairman Decided To ‘Kill’ His Own Stores. It’s Made Him Billions.

Ed Stack stands with his arms crossed, surveying the wall of colorful basketball shoes near the entrance of Dick’s Sporting Goods’ House of Sport in Pittsburgh’s Ross Park Mall. The vast selection of around 2,400 pairs of Nike Air Jordans, Under Armour Currys and more — known as the “Footwear Deck” — is a key part of Dick’s’ strategy to stand out in the digital age. A separate soccer-skewed section, House of Cleats, downstairs has at least 300 other pairs. “People really want to feel it, touch it, try it on,” and experience it, explains Stack, 69, Dick’s’ executive chairman. That’s why there’s also a 31.5-foot indoor climbing wall visible directly over Stack’s shoulder, nearby batting cages, golf bays, and even a 18,000 square foot outdoor sports field for customers to use. Plus there are technicians on hand to restring racquets, lace baseball gloves and sharpen ice skates. Aaron Kotowski for Forbes These bells and whistles are features of a new jumbo store format that Dick’s is opening across the country. The House of Sport is double to triple the size of a regular 50,000 square foot location. The Pittsburgh mega-store, the closest one to Dick’s’ corporate headquarters–where Forbes interviewed Stack in November–opened in April in a long abandoned Sears; it’s the third largest Dick’s location to date at 140,000 square feet. The biggest, at nearly 150,000 square feet, is in Salem, New Hampshire, plus there are 15 more of these behemoth complexes already open with plans to retrofit up to 100 of its 725 U.S. locations by 2027. (Dick’s has another 136 “specialty stores,” including Golf Galaxy and outdoor chain Public Lands.) Forbes estimates the retailer will spend nearly $2 billion on this expansion. Dick’s is doubling down on brick-and-mortar at a time when many retailers are downsizing or shuttering locations - more than 6,480 stores in the U.S. closed this year, the highest number since 2020, according to data from Coresight research. It’s just the latest gamble from Stack, who has spent four decades obsessing about ways to beat competitors; he bought the company from his father, the original founder, in 1984. “I was always an athlete, a mediocre athlete but I loved the competition,” he says, sipping a glass bottle of Coca-Cola. (The only sport he plays these days is golf.) “Ed is always pushing himself to be better, his company to be better, his team to be better and his partners to be better,” says Nike’s CEO Elliott Hill, describing him as “courageous and competitive.” He’s known Stack for 20 years; Nike is a key partner of Dick’s, accounting for about 24% of its $13 billion in 2023 sales. Stack instilled this mindset in his management team, too. “We’re constantly looking around corners. And we joke, we say it's not a joke, but we have what we call productive paranoia,” says Lauren Hobart, Dick’s CEO since 2021. “But that's actually the root of a lot of our success. We don't take a lot of time looking backward or resting on our laurels.” “Ed Stack is a genius who inherited a mom and pop sporting goods store and turned it into a national retail powerhouse,” says Phil Knight, founder of Nike, which sold about $3 billion of its branded product at Dick’s last year. It’s been a winning formula. Dick’s, which has already outlived a number of now-defunct rivals like Sports Authority, Herman’s and Modell’s, is one of just a handful of retailers to record consistent same-store sales growth since the Covid-19 pandemic, according to Morgan Stanley equity analyst Simeon Gutman. (Others include Walmart, Costco and O’Reilly Auto Parts.) Revenue is expected to hit a record of up to $13.3 billion this year, up from $8.8 billion in 2019, a more than 50% jump. And the stock is up nearly 800% in that same time, including 60% in the past year. Stack, who has not sold a single share of his voting stock since taking the company public in 2002 and remains the biggest individual shareholder, is now worth $5.4 billion. Business didn’t look so good back in 2018. Sales were stagnating as it fought for relevance against online retailers like Amazon and Walmart and began phasing guns out of their stores. It also took a hit as some of its brands began selling directly to consumers or, in Under Armour’s case, distributing to lower-priced stores like Kohl’s. Stack quickly took action. “The brief I gave everybody was we need to sit down and we need to design the concept that will kill Dick’s Sporting Goods,” Stack, dressed in a plaid navy suit, explains from a conference room hidden behind a set of large, wooden doors in the back of the Pittsburgh store. “If someone opened the store that we’re going to design across the street from us, we’d be out of business, we wouldn't survive.” Covid was a boon for Dick’s as outdoor sports like golf, running and kayaking exploded in popularity; at one point in 2020, Dick’s sold out of kayaks in nearly 500 of its locations. But it wasn’t just luck. After closing all its stores in March that year, it took just two days for Dick’s to open for curbside pickup, a feat that was only possible due to an earlier overhaul of its ecommerce site that brought the technology in-house. This hybrid model of buying online and picking up in-person has proven deeply popular with customers. “It’s the convenience,” explains Hobart. “If you’re running to your kid’s game and realize you don’t have a cleat, you know the size is in stock and that you can quickly get to the field.” Shoppers also like knowing ahead of time that what they want is in stock. The company has five distribution centers but today more than 90% of sales are fulfilled by the stores, yet another factor fueling the House of Sport push: more square footage can house more inventory for better delivery times. “There’s no other retailer that I cover that’s had a turnaround like Dick’s has,” says Morningstar analyst David Swartz. Says Stack, about the recent changes: “We do virtually nothing the same.” This isn’t the first time Ed Stack has reinvented his family business. He was 13 when he started working for his father at the original Dick’s, then called Dick’s Bait and Tackle. The elder Stack had started the business as a teen in 1948 as a modest bait-and-tackle supplier in Binghamton, New York. Ed spent his summers, vacations and Christmases in the about 600-square-foot store, unloading merchandise from trucks and attaching price tags. The eldest of five children, Ed was expected to work at the store full-time after graduating high school. But there was one problem: “I hated every minute,” he recalls. Richard "Dick" Stack (left) and Ed Stack (right). The pair didn't always see eye to eye, which is what led dad to sell out to son. Ed and Dick had a strained relationship. Stack has attributed this to his father’s short temper. (Even so, there is a framed picture of Dick Stack in every Dick’s location.) In 1973, Ed, an admittedly subpar student, left home for St. John Fisher University in Rochester, New York, with the dream of becoming a lawyer. He dropped those plans when his father’s heart temporarily stopped following a double bypass surgery from which he never fully recovered. Ed returned home to join the business after graduation in 1977. His dad’s tackle shop was not the Stack family’s first entrepreneurial venture. His grandfather was a bootlegger during prohibition before dying in a car crash in 1935. This time was different: Ed fell in love with retail, though he continued to clash with his father, who lived for two more decades. The younger Stack wanted to expand, while his dad, who nearly went bankrupt after opening a second location in 1953, didn’t want to take any risks. Seven years in, things reached a breaking point. “My dad was a pretty colorful guy and he looked at me and said, ‘You think you’re such a smart S.O.B., go down to the bank, get your own line of credit and buy me out. So that’s what I did,” recalls Stack, who along with his four siblings bought their father’s two stores in Binghamton. They agreed in 1984 to pay the older Stack $1.25 million over 20 years at a 12% annual interest rate plus the price of leasing his two stores for 25 years–Dick’s terms. They paid the rest of the sum out to their stepmother following Dick’s death in 1998 after a battle with dementia caused by his cardio vascular problems. (Ed’s siblings have not been involved with the business in decades, and none own over 5%.) Finally in charge, Ed got to work expanding Dick’s’ inventory beyond hunting and fishing gear. He forged relationships with brands like Nike (around 1978) and Adidas (1980). When it came to Dick’s’ brick-and-mortar growth, Stack studied Walmart founder Sam Walton and mimicked his idea of opening stores in “concentric circles” around the company’s launch point (in Dick’s’ case: Binghamton). Stack drove around small or medium-sized cities counting the number of swing sets in people’s yards; he also looked at the popularity of youth sports leagues, the number of colleges nearby, and the weather–after discovering that his offerings sold better in colder climates. Soon there were stores in Syracuse, New York; Hartford, Connecticut and Erie, Pennsylvania. Around this time, he brought in the company’s first outside investors: venture capitalists Michael Barach of Bessemer Venture Partners, Jerry Gallagher of Oak Investment Partners and Janet Hickey of Scout Group, as well as Denis Defforey, a cofounder of French supermarket chain Carrefour and an early advisor of Dick’s, who together infused more than $16 million. In 2014, Stack sued Mitch Modell, the CEO of now-defunct rival Modell’s Sporting Goods who he accused of using a disguise to spy on Dick’s. They settled for $1 on the condition that Modell would never do it again. The rapid expansion soon backfired. “I joined in March [of 1995] and realized by August we were going to run out of cash,” recalls Mike Hines, Dick’s’ chief financial officer for 12 years until 2007. “I was pissed.” A key problem: the new stores were too big. “We did the calculations and the size of the store that was most effective was 50,000 square feet,” says Hines. The stores they were building were up to 70,000 square feet. Dick’s dug itself out of the hole by securing a $140 million loan from GE Capital, contingent on the existing investors putting up more capital. They did – to the tune of $35 million – resulting in Stack losing majority control of his family business. Dick’s halted new store openings for 18 months, and focused on monitoring inventory and margins. By 1997, the company had largely bounced back from the crisis. Three years later, Stack borrowed another $60 million from GE Capital, this time to buy out his investors. Over the next two years, Dick’s hit $1 billion sales and then Stack took the company public, vowing to maintain majority voting control over the company always. Another crucial moment for Dick’s came in after a 19-year-old former high school student shot and killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida on Valentine’s Day 2018. Two weeks later, Stack announced he was banning the sale of all assault rifles and guns to anyone under the age of 21. “What happened in Parkland had a really profound impact on me,” says the billionaire, who later flew to Florida to meet with the families of victims. “I’m not much of a crier… I hadn’t cried that much since my mother passed away,” he says, “It got to a point where I said, ‘I don't want to be a part of this story any longer.’” "What we’ve always been concerned about is that we wake up one day and have a tired old chain." Dick’s destroyed the $5 million worth of semi-automatic rifles left in its inventory. The guns were sawed into pieces and turned into scrap metal, prompting outrage from the trade association National Shooting Sports Foundation and the National Rifle Association. “What a waste, and what a strange business model,” the NRA tweeted at the time. Dick’s predicted dropping these guns would cost the company at least a quarter of a billion in revenue, or 3.5% of its overall sales at the time. The business did take a hit but it turned out to be a “great move,” says Stack. Soon after the shooting, Dick’s experimented with removing entire gun displays in 10 of its stores and replacing them with growing categories like footwear and apparel, and products popular in that specific region: fishing gear in Florida and outerwear in Boston, for example. Because the profit margin on hunting equipment was 17% lower on average than the rest of the store, these locations had to recapture just 60% of lost sales to break even. “We captured a little more than 100%,” says Stack. Nowadays no guns are sold at any Dick’s stores. (In January 2024, the company sold the retail naming rights of its hunting subsidiary, Field & Stream, to country singers Morgan Wallen and Eric Church.) The retailer’s gross profit margins have increased to 35% in 2023 from 29% in 2017, in part because of its increased emphasis on higher margin categories like clothing and shoes, which now make up 59% of Dick’s’ business, versus 54% in 2017. Stack didn’t advertise it at the time, but there was another big change in the aftermath of the Parkland shooting. The self-described “political junkie” decided in 2019 to quietly test the waters as an independent presidential candidate ahead of the 2020 race; it was at this point that Stack began “the succession planning process,” stepping down as CEO the next year. The longtime GOP donor cited extremism in both political parties as a key reason. “It’s really difficult to govern the country from as far right as we are [and] as far left as we are,” he explains. Stack, who believes the nation’s issues of education inequality and income inequality are deeply intertwined, spent less than $50,000 on the political run and said he dropped the plan after around 18 months, following an “intervention” by his friends and family. Says Stack, who hasn’t donated to any presidential candidates in the last two elections. “I have no political aspirations any longer.” Building bigger boxes nearly killed Dick’s 30 years ago. But Stack is convinced times are different now. Plus he’s taking a different tack. Instead of opening a flurry of new, larger stores, House of Sport focuses on redeveloping Dick’s’ existing fleet of stores. (This is helped by the fact that around of the company’s existing leases are up for renegotiation in the next three years). He also learned to take his time. Stack and his team spent years experimenting with different concepts in the 25,000 square foot “Lab Store” in Dick’s’ Pittsburgh HQ. It took until 2021 for the company to settle on a design it felt was different enough from Dick’s’ existing model. Since then they’ve opened an average of around four new stores every year. It’s also upgrading dozens more of its traditional 50,000 square foot stores with House of Sport fixtures like the Footwear Deck and House of Cleats. Though early, the results are encouraging. Each House of Sport was generating five to six times the amount of traffic of a traditional Dick’s, according to a March analysis from the retail data tracking platform Placer.ai. The company predicts it will take less than three years to recoup the roughly $18.5 million net investment it takes to build and stock each House of Sport. Landlords and vendors are also on board. “They’re creating a theater for their customers and an environment in which more of these vendors want the proper placement,” says Morgan Stanley analyst Gutman. "They went from Dick's needing the vendors more ... and now the entire relationship is flipped." While most House of Sport features are free for customers to use, the rock wall costs $15 per climb. Parts of the new stores can be rented out for birthday parties. Moving forward, Dick’s could have a rocky road ahead with Donald Trump in the White House. The president-elect has said he will move to impose unprecedented tariffs on his first day in office. He’s floated various figures including a 25% tariff penalty on all goods imported from Canada and Mexico and an additional 10% on Chinese imports. Experts have predicted this will take a heavy toll on retailers who rely on imported materials. Dick’s’ challenge stems from the fact that around 87% of its revenue comes from selling other brands, whose supply chains it does not control. Hobart says Dick’s has been talking with its brand partners and “running scenarios” about what tariffs could mean for the company and its customers. She says her “hope” is that shoppers won’t be too affected if tariffs are indeed implemented. A big reason is that many of Dick’s’ suppliers were already forced to move away from Chinese imports during the pandemic. “I do think one of the important things is that the entire industry has been working on diversifying supply. It’s a requirement,” says Hobart. “So that’s a good thing. We’ve got supply coming in from multiple countries at this point.” Still, Dick’s’ future plans involve growing the parts of the business that it more directly controls. This includes its in-house brands like DSG and Calia (made in South East Asia); the latter was a partnership with country singer Carrie Underwood launched in 2015 that is now Dick’s’ top selling women’s brand after Nike (Underwood is no longer involved). These private label brands, which also boast higher margins, accounted for around 13% of revenue, or $1.6 billion, last year. It also now has a place where it can unload unsold inventory. Going, Going, Gone! is its three-year-old off-price store concept where customers can shop for bargains at one of its 20 permanent stores and 30 temporary locations so far. Yet another way the company is looking to add revenue is by creating a “retail media network” in which it uses consumer data collected from its loyalty program (accounting for 70% of revenue) and its Gamechanger app to do paid advertising for its partners. For example, if one of their partners wanted to better advertise to people beginning to train for a marathon, Dick’s will target those specific shoppers with ads. For Stack, who has now spent nearly 60 years working on Dick’s, these ongoing changes are par for the course. “One thing that always amazed me about Ed was that he’s a sponge for information. He is never married to an idea or a philosophy,” says Bill Colombo, the vice chair of Dick’s’ board who met Stack when they were put in the same dorm at St. John Fisher. “What we’ve always been concerned about is that we wake up one day and have a tired old chain,” says Stack. “We’ve seen so many retailers that … never really evolved and innovated their business. And a number of those retailers are gone today. We want to make sure that doesn’t happen to us.”

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News Dominating Wall Street Today. In this article, we are going to take a look at where CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against the other AI stocks that are dominating Wall Street. The Generative AI market, a crucial branch of artificial intelligence, is revolutionizing entire industries today. According to ResearchAndMarkets.com, the Gen-AI market was valued at USD 20.21 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach USD 440 billion by 2032. This signifies an impressive CAGR of 41.31% over the forecast period from 2024 to 2032. READ NOW: 10 AI News Investors Shouldn’t Miss and 12 AI Stock News and Ratings Dominating Wall Street According to the report, the North American region leads the Generative AI market with a 34% share in 2023. Its robust technology ecosystem, skilled workforce, and increasing demand for AI-powered content are responsible for the leading market share. The European region has also been experiencing growth, driven by government funding, startup innovation, and region-specific applications. Back in 2022, the generative AI market was dominated by established players only. These established players accounted for 88% of the market share, whereas start-ups grasped only 12%. This is now changing, with more players entering the market with each passing year. Highlighting advancements in artificial intelligence, Sam Altman, CEO of AI Company OpenAI states how the next innovations in AI are going to be more disruptive than people can imagine. Speaking at the New York Times’ DealBook Summit in New York City, he stated that the industry may begin to see examples of artificial general intelligence (AGI), which refers to the hypothetical intelligence of a machine similar to that of a human, as soon as 2025. “I think it’s possible… in 2025 we will have systems that we look at… and people will say, ‘Wow, that changes what I expected” Altman noted that at first, the introduction of AGI, and the level of intelligence beyond it, is going to have minimal effect. However, it will later “be more intense than people think”. In its latest advancements in AI, OpenAI has now begun testing new reasoning AI models, o3 and o3 mini. This demonstrates a sign of growing competition with rivals such as Google to create smarter models proficient at solving complex problems. According to Altman, OpenAI plans to launch the o3 mini by the end of January, and the full o3 after that. The enhanced models aim to outperform existing ones, driving new investments and user growth. The new o3 and o3 mini models are currently undergoing internal safety testing, and are anticipated to be more powerful than the o1 models. OpenAI has ignited a competitive AI arms race, pushing tech companies worldwide to accelerate the development of cutting-edge AI technologies. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Security personnel at their consoles, monitoring a global network of threats in real-time. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74 CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a leader in AI-driven endpoint and cloud workload protection. On December 19, Jefferies raised the firm’s price target on CrowdStrike to $450 from $415 and kept a “Buy” rating on the shares. According to the firm, software stocks are going to have a “slower start out of the gate” in 2025. This is because investors will be recalibrating and adjusting to changes under the new administration. For most of these stocks, benefits from artificial intelligence will likely start to materialize in late 2025. Furthermore, the firm also states that cybersecurity “should prove more resilient” in the first half of 2025 based on strong fundamentals. However, it will fall behind the wider recovery of AI-driven software markets. Overall CRWD ranks 2nd on our list of the AI stocks dominating Wall Street today. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CRWD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week. InvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today! Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) reaffirmed Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) as a top stock pick for 2025, maintaining its Overweight rating and a price target of $166. Despite some near-term headwinds, including a slowdown in Hopper builds and staggered Blackwell product readiness, Morgan Stanley views these challenges as temporary. By the second half of 2025, the strength of Blackwell will be “the only topic,” the firm’s analysts stressed. Addressing competitive pressures from ASIC solutions, particularly from Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Morgan Stanley believes purchasing trends will favor GPUs over time. “While our forecasts for both AVGO/MRVL ASIC revenue are largely conservative, as are our forecasts for GPU, we believe that GPU will meaningfully outperform ASIC this year,” analysts noted. The report also highlights Nvidia’s $12 billion annual R&D investments as critical for maintaining its leadership in AI hardware and system-level innovations. Analysts also addressed the concerns over industry challenges, including scaling Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) clusters. While technologists advocate for larger AGI systems, financial backers remain cautious about return on investment (ROI). Nvidia’s innovations, such as Mellanox (NASDAQ:MLNX) and NV-Link, are positioned to improve efficiency in this area. Nvidia’s growth drivers—including inference, sovereign AI training, and enterprise applications—account for 70% of its data center revenue. Analysts believe these segments will continue driving growth even amid potential industry consolidation by 2026. “Even with some consolidation in the arms race, we should still see enduring growth potential,” they commented. The upcoming Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in January 2025 is expected to boost sentiment for Nvidia. Analysts anticipate the messaging will emphasize strong Blackwell demand, albeit with supply constraints. “But by mid year we remain comfortable that the focus will remain on Blackwell which will be the driving force behind revenue in 2h, potentially unlocking more significant upside,” the note concluded. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has experienced an extraordinary rally since the U.S. election, solidifying its status as the market's "narrative king," according to analysts at Barclays (LON:BARC). The electric vehicle (EV) maker's shares have surged approximately 90%, adding about $730 billion to its market capitalization - a feat matched only by a few tech giants like Nvidia and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Barclays notes that this performance is particularly remarkable given the stock's apparent disconnect from underlying fundamentals. Tesla's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has soared from 80x before the election to an elevated 145x based on 2025 consensus EPS estimates. “The decoupling from fundamentals in many ways mirrors the rally we saw from Tesla in 2020-21," analysts led by Dan Levy said in a note. They attribute this rally to the "magnification of Tesla's narrative command," which centers around themes like autonomous vehicles (AV) and AI. Another factor contributing to the surge is the "Tesla-financial complex," where options activity amplifies stock movements. Moreover, retail investor interest remains robust, with 30% of Tesla's outstanding shares held by individual investors, according to Barclays. “Tesla remains the 'OG meme stock,'” the analysts emphasized. Barclays also pointed out the growth of the "Elon premium" in Tesla's valuation. The increased prominence of CEO Elon Musk has elevated interest in the company, translating to heightened enthusiasm for Tesla's stock. Bank of America (BofA) downgraded Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) to Neutral from Buy, citing a weaker-than-anticipated gross margin (GM) outlook for the second and third fiscal quarters. Shares of the chipmaker fell sharply Thursday after delivering disappointing Q2 guidance. Micron projects second-quarter revenue of approximately $7.9 billion, missing both BofA's $8.3 billion estimate and the consensus forecast of $9 billion. The company also expects a Q2 GM of 38.5%, below BofA's 40% estimate and the consensus of 41%. “Data center and HBM trends remain strong but weakness in PC and phone markets are putting downward pressure on memory pricing, especially in NAND,” BofA analysts led by Vivek Arya noted. Persistent pricing challenges in NAND are expected to extend into the third quarter. Although BofA remains optimistic about Micron's position in high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and AI markets, it lowered its fiscal 2025 and 2026 pro forma earnings per share estimates by 5% and 11%, respectively, to $6.80 and $8.78. The stock's price target was also cut to $110 from $125. “Historically the stock has struggled to outperform when GM expansion has remained muted, leading to our stock downgrade to Neutral from Buy, even though we still feel positive about MU’s position in the HBM/AI market where TAM was taken up +20% for CY25 to $30bn.” While data center and HBM trends are highlighted as strong, the weakness in PC and phone markets continues to weigh on memory pricing, particularly NAND. BofA does, however, see potential for recovery in these markets in the latter half of 2025. Monness, Crespi, and Hardt downgraded Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) stock to Sell from Neutral, setting a 12-month price target of $130, implying over 22% upside from the current levels. The firm raised concerns about Oracle's valuation, rising competition, and aggressive capital expenditure (capex) plans. Oracle shares have climbed 60% year-to-date, largely driven by generative AI enthusiasm, marking their best performance since 1999. However, Monness analysts warned that "valuation is stretched, competition fierce, software in transition, and the macro environment fragile." Oracle's recent Q2 earnings highlighted growth challenges, the firm noted. Its FY25 EPS estimate of $6.17 remains unchanged, while its FY25 Cloud Services revenue projection has been revised to $24.9 billion, down from last year’s $25.4 billion forecast. Monness expressed particular concern over Oracle’s “bold capex plans,” with spending expected to double in FY25. "Our current FY:25 capex projection of $14.2 billion represents 24.6% of revenue, up from 13% in FY:24, and well above the 27-year average of 4%," the analysts wrote. They argue this level of expenditure is unsustainable, dragging Oracle’s free cash flow (FCF) margin to an estimated 8% for FY25, far below its historical average of 28%. The firm also pointed to Oracle’s heavily leveraged balance sheet, with $88.6 billion in debt and a debt-to-capital ratio of 86%. This restricts the company’s ability to boost shareholder returns through dividends or buybacks and limits its capacity for acquisitions or broader organic growth investments. While Oracle has seen early success in generative AI, Monness cautioned that "an inevitable shakeout in the LLM industry" and intensifying competition from major cloud providers could pose significant risks. Bank of America outlined its 2025 semiconductor outlook on Monday, spotlighting six chip stocks it recommends for investors in the coming year. The bank forecasts a 15% increase in semiconductor industry sales to $725 billion in 2025. This growth, although robust, is projected to be slower compared to the 20% growth seen in the current year. BofA anticipates memory sales to rise by 20% in 2025, following a 79% year-over-year increase in 2024, with core semiconductors, excluding memory, expected to grow by 13%. “We see 2025 as a year of two different trends. In the first half, AI investments and NVDA Blackwell deployments driven by US cloud customers sustain momentum in AI semis,” analysts led by Vivek Arya said in a note. “However, in the 2H (second half), interest could shift to less-crowded auto/industrial chipmakers on inventory replenishment and pick-up in auto production assuming a global economic recovery.” BofA’s top picks include leaders in AI such as Nvidia, Broadcom, and Marvell Technology. “In AI we continue to trust.. at least till 2H25,” analysts said. Furthermore, the firm identified Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) as a flash-memory tool leader poised for capital expenditure recovery and impact resolution in China. Auto and EV leader ON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON) is highlighted for its potential cyclical recovery in the second half of 2025, and Cadence Design (NASDAQ:CDNS) Systems noted for its resilient double-digit growth, especially as the AI hardware cycle decelerates in the latter half of the year.
