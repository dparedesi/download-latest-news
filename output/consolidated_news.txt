CrowdStrike’s senior vice-president for counter adversary operations, Adam Meyers, reiterated his company’s apology today during a House subcommittee hearing and went on to say that the company has launched a configuration update for its Falcon Sensor software system. Meyers was grilled Tuesday afternoon by lawmakers from the House’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection subcommittee over the company’s failure to properly address its faulty software update that led to a global IT outage in mid-July. Following the global outage, companies across the airlines, banking, telecommunications, and healthcare industries were deeply affected for weeks. The outage disrupted internet services, affecting about 8.5 million Microsoft (MSFT) Windows devices, per Reuters. “We are deeply sorry this happened, and we are determined to prevent this from happening again,” Meyers said at the hearing. “We have undertaken a full review of our systems and begun implementing plans to bolster our content update procedures so that we emerge from this experience as a stronger company.” During the grilling session, which was led by Republican Rep. Mark Green from Tennessee, Meyers said CrowdStrike (CRWD) takes “full responsibility” for the international system crashes. He also deemed that the issues were not the result of a cyberattack, nor was it induced by artificial intelligence. “The July 19 incident stemmed from a confluence of factors that ultimately resulted in the Falcon sensor attempting to follow a threat detection configuration for which there was no corresponding definition of what to do,” Meyers said. After the IT incident, CrowdStrike lost about $60 million in contract sales. The cybersecurity firm said that the incident scared off customers who were looking to close deals during the final weeks of the second quarter. Meyers announced during the hearing that the company had taken several steps to sharpen its system and would prevent another outage from happening at this level again. He stated that CrowdStrike will no longer unveil its software updates internationally to all customers in a single session. The company will also allow customers to select when they receive their updates. They have the option of waiting to be the second or third group of clients who will receive the update after it goes public. “Mistakes can happen,” Green said. “However, we cannot allow a mistake of this magnitude to happen again. A global IT outage that impacts every sector of the economy is a catastrophe that we would expect to see in a movie. It is something that we would expect to be carefully executed by a malicious and sophisticated nation-state actor.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: SEC delays decision on options trading for BlackRock and Bitwise spot Ethereum ETFs

Despite approving options trading for IBIT on Sept. 20, the regulator claimed it needs more time to consider the decision on Ethereum ETFs. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has delayed its decision to allow options trading for BlackRock and Bitwise’s spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) until mid-November, according to Sept. 24 filings. The new deadlines for BlackRock and Bitwise are Nov. 10 and Nov. 11, respectively. The SEC stated it needed more time to consider the proposal and extended the initial 45-day review period that would have ended on Sept. 26 for BlackRock since Nasdaq filed for the rule change for the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF on July 22. The same reasoning was applied to Bitwise’s ETHW, which had its decision date delayed to Nov. 11 since the proposed rule change was filed one day after BlackRock’s. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) received clearance for options trading from the SEC on Sept. 20. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said this was a “huge win” for Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs, as it will attract more liquidity and, consequently, more “big fish.” Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, also shared a report by K33 Research on Sept. 24, which highlighted that Bitcoin’s derivatives market is 279x smaller than its equity and commodity counterparts. Notably, the Bitcoin options volume traded on the top five centralized crypto exchanges was equivalent to roughly $33.3 billion between Sept. 1 and Sept. 22. Meanwhile, Ethereum options’ volume in the same period amounted to just $9.2 billion, over three times smaller than Bitcoin’s. Thus, Ethereum ETFs have even more room for growth with the addition of options trading by the SEC.

Title: TradFi giant BNY Mellon secures regulatory exemption for crypto ETF custody services

The development positions BNY Mellon to challenge Coinbase's current dominance in crypto asset management. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BNY Mellon is taking significant steps toward entering the crypto custody market, particularly for Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), after securing an exemption from the SEC, Bloomberg News reported on Sept. 24. According to the report, BNY Mellon received an exemption from the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121) during a review by the Office of the Chief Accountant. This exemption allows the bank to classify customer crypto holdings differently, meaning they do not need to treat these assets as corporate liabilities. This operational shift could empower more traditional banks to offer crypto custody services, a practice that has largely remained inaccessible to them until now. The development also positions BNY Mellon to challenge Coinbase’s current dominance in crypto asset management and builds on the firm’s crypto custody ambitions. The move to provide custodial services for spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs could significantly disrupt the current market landscape, where Coinbase oversees most of Wall Street’s crypto ETFs, including those for major asset managers like BlackRock, which manages around $10 trillion in assets. Currently, Coinbase’s role has positioned it as a leader in the custody of digital assets for these funds, but BNY Mellon’s entry could increase competition and provide clients with more options. BNY Mellon has expressed a strong interest in the crypto custody sector since early 2023. In January of that year, CEO Robin Vince highlighted digital assets as part of the firm’s long-term strategic vision during an earnings call, noting the growing demand for digital asset services among institutional clients. Analysts estimate the crypto custody market is expanding at approximately 30% annually and is currently valued at $300 million. If this growth trajectory continues, the market could surpass $1 billion by 2032, with an annual increase of around $90 million. Despite the promising outlook, regulatory challenges remain a significant concern for BNY Mellon as it seeks to establish itself in the crypto custody space. Lawmakers, including Congressman Patrick McHenry and Senator Cynthia Lummis, have expressed concerns about the transparency of interactions between SEC staff and private companies. In a bicameral letter addressed to the SEC and other regulators, they cited private meetings that allegedly discussed SAB 121 exemptions. It is unclear whether BNY Mellon’s exemption was part of these discussions, raising questions about the regulatory landscape that will govern the bank’s activities in the crypto market. BNY Mellon’s success will largely depend on its ability to navigate the complex regulatory environment while capitalizing on the growing demand for digital asset services among institutional investors.

Full Content:
Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) director John L. Hennessy has sold shares of the company's Class A common stock, according to a recent SEC filing. The transaction, dated September 23, involved the sale of 700 shares at a price of $165 each, totaling $115,500. Following the sale, Hennessy's direct and indirect holdings include 27,824 shares of Class A common stock and 6,416 shares of Class C capital stock, some of which are held by trusts. The transaction was executed under a pre-arranged trading plan known as Rule 10b5-1, which allows company insiders to sell shares over a predetermined period of time. This plan was adopted by the John L. Hennessy and Andrea J. Hennessy Revocable Trust on November 1, 2023. Hennessy's remaining Class C capital stock holdings reflect both direct and indirect ownership through trusts. His indirect holdings in Class C capital stock amount to 6,093 shares, while direct holdings are at 323 shares. Additionally, Hennessy has interests in several tranches of Class C Google Stock Units (GSUs), which are set to vest over time subject to continued service on Alphabet's Board. Investors often monitor insider transactions for insights into executive confidence in the company's prospects. Sales and purchases of company stock by insiders can be routine, but they are disclosed to the public to ensure transparency. Hennessy's recent transaction is part of regular financial planning and does not necessarily indicate a change in the company's outlook or management's view of its potential. In other recent news, Alphabet Inc.'s Google has been making significant strides in various sectors. In a collaborative effort with the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), Google is addressing competition concerns related to the management of third-party cookies in its Chrome browser. This partnership aims to develop a solution that addresses the CMA's competition concerns while considering the broader implications for user privacy and online services that rely on advertising revenue. In an innovative move, Google has teamed up with Volkswagen (ETR:VOWG_p) to introduce an artificial intelligence assistant within a smartphone app for drivers. This assistant utilizes Google's Gemini large language models and cloud computing resources. The AI assistant is currently available to approximately 120,000 owners of Volkswagen’s Atlas (NYSE:ATCO) and Atlas Cross Sport models, with plans to expand its availability to other vehicles in the near future. Google has also engaged with the European Union to influence the upcoming enforcement of the AI Act, aiming to shape the rigor of this legislation that could impose significant fines for non-compliance. Google, along with other tech giants, has applied to join the working groups for the AI Act, seeking to contribute their perspective to the regulations. In a significant move into the carbon offset market, Google purchased 50,000 metric tons of nature-based carbon removal credits from a Brazilian startup named Mombak. This marks Google's first foray into carbon projects within Brazil and represents a commitment to achieve these credits by the year 2030. All these recent developments highlight Google's proactive approach towards addressing competition concerns, integrating advanced AI capabilities into consumer applications, influencing global AI regulations, and making significant commitments to environmental sustainability. As Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) continues to make headlines with insider stock transactions, investors are keen to understand the company's financial standing. According to InvestingPro data, Alphabet boasts a robust market capitalization of approximately $2 trillion USD. This places the tech giant among the most valuable companies globally, reflecting its significant impact on the industry. Analyzing Alphabet's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is currently at 23.29, can provide investors with a clearer picture of the company's valuation. This metric is particularly interesting when considering the company's near-term earnings growth, as Alphabet is trading at a low P/E ratio relative to this growth. This suggests that the company's stock might be undervalued based on its earnings potential, an InvestingPro Tip that could indicate a favorable buying opportunity for investors. Furthermore, Alphabet's revenue growth over the last twelve months as of Q2 2024 stands at 13.38%, demonstrating the company's ability to increase its earnings over time. This sustained growth is a testament to Alphabet's strong position in the Interactive Media & Services industry, another InvestingPro Tip that underscores the company's prominence in its sector. For those interested in exploring more about Alphabet's financial health and future prospects, additional InvestingPro Tips are available. In fact, there are 11 more tips listed on InvestingPro that could provide valuable insights for investors contemplating their next move with Alphabet's stock. It's also worth noting that Alphabet is maintaining a strong balance sheet, holding more cash than debt. This financial stability is crucial for investors looking for a secure investment, especially in a market that values liquidity and the ability to weather economic downturns. Alphabet's liquid assets also exceed its short-term obligations, further emphasizing the company's financial resilience.

Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang concluded a planned sale of more than $700 million worth of company stock, regulatory filings Tuesday showed. Huang had previously announced his intention to sell as many as 6 million shares of Nvidia by the first quarter of 2025 under the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC's) 10b5-1 rule, which allows insiders to set up a trading plan for selling stocks. He reached that limit months ahead of the plan's expiration, with the sale of 120,000 shares worth nearly $14.3 million, according to an SEC filing. The CEO still holds 75.4 million Nvidia shares directly and another 786 million through various trusts and a partnership, according to another filing. Shares of Nvidia closed nearly 4% higher at $120.87 Tuesday. They've more than doubled in value since the start of the year amid booming demand for the company's chips to support artificial intelligence (AI).

Title: Orta the Broken Mountain is the Azj-Kahet World Boss in The War Within

NEXT | Race to World First Day 7: On to Queen Ansurek! The War Within Season 1 begins the week of September 10, and with the opening of Nerub-ar Palace also arrives the opportunity to kill a World Boss. As in Dragonflight and Shadowlands the first tier of TWW has four World Bosses on rotation, one in each of the leveling zones, and for Azj-Kahet it will be Orta the Broken Mountain — up this week. Fortunately there remain no mechanic drops similar to the older expansion’s Legendary Memories so players won’t have to worry about missing out on something important (besides the chance of loot) if they skip a week. As usual the World Bosses drop items that are ilevel-equivalent to the Normal difficulty of the concurrent raid, although with the more staggered ilevels in Palace it should be noted that World Boss drops are i603, or equivalent to the middle bosses of the raid. They can also be upgraded, starting at Champion 3/8. Orta the Broken Mountain resembles previous fights we’ve had such as Kormrok in Hellfire Citadel or Kromog in Blackrock Foundry, with runes and plenty of slamming action. One thing that is important to be aware of is the fact that Orta’s location in the Old Sacrificial Pit of the City of Threads is above an insta-death area, so falling or being thrown into the gaps surrounding the platform will kill you. Runes should be avoided as they will stun when triggered — if this wasn’t a world boss I’d suggest controlled detonation like in similar encounters, but it’s likely best just to avoid them entirely. Tectonic Roars is a raidwide AOE that will knock you back so positioning while it’s being cast is likely important. Finally Orta will grasp and squeeze nearby players at interval and then throw them away once they’re considered a “weakling”; it’s not known whether this means at below a specific health percentage or after a certain amount of time.The Old Sacrificial Pit is well-namedOrta the Broken Mountain is located in the western end of the City of Threads in the Old Sacrificial Pit, and is an easy flight over from the Weaver’s Lair. Because where he’s located is absent of other NPCs you don’t need to worry about your current progress in the zone or whether you are buffed with pheromones. As already mentioned the area beneath the combat zone is instantly fatal, so don’t fall off the platform waiting for the fight to begin.The gear that Orta drops matches the normal Palace appearance, so those looking to farm transmog as well as gear upgrades will want to take the time to down the boss. In addition to unlocking the normal look, upgrading from Champion 3/8 to 5/8 will unlock the heroic appearance as well. Unlike the Dragonflight first tier bosses, Orta drops two possible armor pieces for every class in addition to a ring that can drop for all characters:Ring is Critical Strike/Haste, with Critical Strike providing most of the secondary statsCloth classes can get a Chest that matches the Priest appearance or a Belt that matches the Warlock setLeather classes have a chance at Legs that match the Demon Hunter set or Boots that match the Monk appearanceMail classes can receive a Chest that matches the Hunter appearance or Boots that match the Shaman setPlate classes have a chance at Legs that match the Death Knight set or a Belt that matches the Paladin appearanceAs always defeating Orta the Broken Mountain counts as a World Quest with possible rewards of gold, Coffer Key shards (used for Delves), and Resonance Crystals.Blizzard Watch is made possible by people like you.Please consider supporting our Patreon!Filed Under: Azj-Kahet, World Boss, World QuestAdvertisement Orta the Broken Mountain is located in the western end of the City of Threads in the Old Sacrificial Pit, and is an easy flight over from the Weaver’s Lair.

Title: Nvidia stock's 20% drop is actually a good sign for the market, strategist says. Here's why
URL: https://qz.com/2025-market-nvidia-tony-roth-wilmington-trust-1851656473
Time Published: 2024-09-24T20:32:08Z
Full Content:
Tony Roth, chief investment officer for Wilmington Trust Investment Advisors (MTB), spoke with Quartz for the latest installment of our “Smart Investing” video series. Watch the interview above and check out the transcript, which has been lightly edited for length and clarity, below. ANDY MILLS (AM): Big tech names such as Nvidia and Microsoft have led the market higher over the last couple of years. Do you see that continuing in 2025? TONY ROTH (TR): Right now, we see a rotation trade into other areas of the market, but I think, longer term, we certainly expect to see those big names continue to grow earnings at a pretty rapid pace. One thing that’s important to keep in mind, though, is that it’s not a monolithic group. So there are some companies that are gonna do a lot better than others. Even within the Magnificent Seven, you’re probably going to see a rotation of some names out of that group and some names into that group. One of the aspects of what’s happening in the market today that I think is really quite notable is that we’re at new, all-time highs as we sit here. And Nvidia (NVDA) is probably about 20% off of its all-time high. Given what we experienced in the first half of the year — where it seemed to be a market driven by a single stock — to be able to say that at this point is pretty remarkable. I think most participants might have felt that it would be hard to get to these levels on the S&P without leadership from Nvidia. And not only have we not had leadership, but it’s actually been going in another direction. AM: Yeah. So AI is, I think, for most investors, a pretty obvious place where people have been investing. What other sectors are you guys looking at that people should try to get into this year? TR: Financials have worked pretty well this year — not all equally, again, but if you look, for example, at the big money center banks, they’ve done pretty well. Some of them have done extraordinarily well, like JP Morgan, which is priced at pretty lofty levels now. But overall, right now with rates coming down, if we don’t have a recession, which is our base-case view, that should certainly favor regional banks. And we think that, for example, also in the financial sector, we like insurance companies, which continue to benefit from these expanded premiums. And I think a lot of the costs are probably going to abate, but the premiums won’t come down as fast. So [insurance companies will] take advantage of that leverage. It’s almost like when oil prices come down but you don’t see the price at the pump come down quite as fast. So I think you’ll see that phenomenon with insurance companies. And then other areas that we like are discretionary companies within this economy, because we do think the consumer, particularly the higher-end consumer, is in good shape. And beyond that, we’re really focused across all sectors on quality companies — so companies that have attractive debt-to-equity ratios that are not too levered, that have low variability of earnings, that have good management teams, intellectual property, intellectual capital, et cetera. Those kinds of companies should do well in this type of environment. AM: Now, you mentioned that your firm doesn’t see a recession as a likely scenario going forward. What makes you guys believe that? TR: I would probably start with the labor market. The labor market is really the foundation for the consumer. So when you look at the labor market, what you see is that jobless claims are at an all-time low actually relative to the overall size of the labor market. And when you look at wages, real wages are not only positive, which we haven’t seen for a long time, but if you look at what we think of as (to get a little wonky) the second derivative, which is where a real wage is going, they’re actually increasing. They’re gaining ground. So when you look at that and you consider that the top three quartiles of the consumer still have excess savings and checking accounts, et cetera, that bodes really well for the economy. So the labor market is in pretty good shape. It’s not in great shape. It’s not in perfect shape. There are some concerning signals, as well, but that’s part of the normalization process. So the labor market’s in good shape, the consumer’s in good shape, CapEx continues to do well. And typically when you see a recession, there’s usually a catalyst. There’s usually excess investment, or there’s a bubble, a financial bubble, or there may even be an external, if you will, geopolitical or exogenous event. And so we don’t see any of those happening, necessarily. Sure, that could happen as a result of the election outcome, but there are so many levels of uncertainty with the election right now that we’re not investing for that. We’ll keep a very close eye on that, but right now we’re not tying the election to a recession. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Saba Capital Management, L.P. has made a notable purchase of shares in BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Health Sciences Term Trust (NYSE:BMEZ), signaling confidence in the investment firm's future prospects. The transaction, which occurred on September 23, involved the acquisition of 2,006 shares at a price of $15.98 each, totaling over $32,055. This transaction adds to Saba Capital's already substantial holding in BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust, bringing its total ownership to 20,603,574 shares. The investment reflects Saba Capital's ongoing commitment to the trust, which focuses on health sciences-related investments. The purchase was made public through a recent SEC filing, which disclosed the details of the transaction. The filing did not indicate any sales of shares by Saba Capital, suggesting a bullish stance on BMEZ by the investment firm. Investors often monitor such transactions closely as they may provide insights into an insider's view of the company's value and future performance. The actions of Saba Capital, a significant shareholder, could be seen as a vote of confidence in the trust's management and investment strategy. BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust is known for its focus on equity securities of health sciences and related companies, which are expected to benefit from advances in technology, research, and development in the sector. The disclosed transaction was signed by both Saba Capital Management, represented by Zachary Gindes, and Boaz Weinstein, indicating the involvement of high-level executives in the decision-making process. Investors and market analysts will continue to watch the movements of Saba Capital and other major shareholders in BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust for further indications of market sentiment and strategic positioning within the health sciences investment space. As Saba Capital Management increases its stake in BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust (NYSE:BMEZ), investors are keen to understand the financial metrics that may influence this decision. With a market capitalization of $1.69 billion, BMEZ stands as a significant player in the health sciences investment space. One of the notable InvestingPro Tips for BMEZ is its substantial dividend yield, which currently stands at 13.18%. This high yield could be a factor in Saba Capital's strategy, providing a steady income stream from their investment. While the dividend is attractive, another InvestingPro Tip highlights that BMEZ suffers from weak gross profit margins, which could be a concern for investors looking for long-term growth in addition to income. Moreover, the valuation of BMEZ implies a poor free cash flow yield, suggesting that the company's current price may not be supported by the cash it generates. These factors combined could indicate that the investment firm sees the high dividend yield as a sufficient counterbalance to these potential weaknesses. In terms of performance, BMEZ's price is close to its 52-week high, at 95.66% of the peak, and the previous close was at $16.02. The trust has also shown positive short-term returns, with a 1-week price total return of 0.95% and a 1-month price total return of 1.81%. Over the longer term, the 1-year price total return of 24.48% reflects a strong performance in the market. For readers interested in a deeper dive into BMEZ's financials and further InvestingPro Tips, additional insights are available at InvestingPro, which currently lists more tips that could help investors make informed decisions.

In the early hours of July 19, cybersecurity company CrowdStrike (CRWD) published a faulty software update that temporarily disabled more than 8.5 million PCs that use its services. The outage caused chaos across banking, airlines, health care and several other industries, and it sent CrowdStrike shares plummeting more than 20% over the following two trading days. It also drew attention to the importance of reliable cybersecurity companies — and to the potential volatility of cybersecurity stocks. Cybersecurity stocks are shares of publicly-traded companies that protect computer systems from digital threats. Some, such as CrowdStrike, Fortinet and Palo Alto Networks, are completely focused on cybersecurity, while others, such as Datadog, Cisco, Broadcom and Dell, are diversified technology companies that provide cybersecurity services along with other offerings. According to Roosevelt Bowman, an investment strategist with Bernstein Private Wealth Management, the effect of major technical outages on cybersecurity companies is hard to predict. “It’s not often that you see a single event ‘doom’ a company,” Bowman says. However, he described two ways in which a bad-news event such as an outage can push down a stock’s price in the long term. The first is if the event in question pushes down a company’s expected future earnings to a point where it looks too expensive at its current price. The second way in which a scandal such as a technical outage can hurt the long-term trajectory of a stock, according to Bowman, is if there are “subsequent failures.” CrowdStrike’s software has been linked with minor computer outages before, although it has never experienced an outage on the scale of the July 19 incident. Only time will tell if it can rebuild its reputation from here.

Title: Destruction of Agriculture, Rights of Indian Farmers: “Waltzing with Bayer” Makes The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) Blind: India Ditches Mandate to Farmers and Uses Mutagenesis (Genetic Mutations) to Drive Toxic Herbicide HT Crops Into India
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/bayer-icar-ditches-mandate-farmers-uses-mutagenesis-ht-crops/5868482
Time Published: 2024-09-24T19:30:06Z
Full Content:
A GMO PIL was filed in early 2005 (ArunaRodrigues & Ors. vs. Union of India, Writ Petition (Civil) No. 260 of 2005) in the Supreme Court (SC) to protect our natural environment, farmlands and foods from being made toxic via agrichemicals and irreversible GMO contamination. Contamination is the outstanding concern with GMOs because these self-replicating organisms, insect/wind mediated, cannot be recalled. India is a treasure trove, a listed ‘hot spot’ of 17 worldwide centres of genetic diversity and/or centres of origin. In India, this includes mustard, rice and brinjal. India’s foundational seed stock will be contaminated and would, as a scientific certainty, change the structure of our food at the molecular level, irremediably and irreversibly. “Any toxicity that there is will remain without remedy”, said the late Prof Schubert of the Salk Institute. With a commercialised GM crop, contamination is certain. GMO and non-GMO agriculture cannot co-exist. This is the hard evidence. The application of the precautionary principle (PP) to this technology is therefore a sine qua non. In 2007, we secured an order in this PIL from the SC that there should be “no contamination”, (even) during field trials. However, given the nature of GMO genetic contamination, the only way this order can be implemented is to bar all field trials. And this is precisely the action that the GEAC took at its 75th meeting of March 2007. Keeping in mind that India is THE centre of origin of rice, the GEAC, at the insistence of basmati rice exporters and the Ministry of Commerce, employing the PP, decided not to allow field trials of GM rice in the basmati growing areas of the country, recognising the potential threat of contamination. The APEDA (Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority) required a certificate stating that no GM rice, groundnut and sesame seeds have been permitted in India due to a ban imposed by Russia on these crops because of a fear of GMO contamination. In the 20 years since the PIL was filed, it is by now pretty well conclusive that the evidence from GMO-producing countries (which are just a handful), demonstrates that GMOs are not safe for the environment and for human and animal health. In the US, for example, the impact of toxic food on children’s health has been devastating. During a 40-year timeframe, childhood disease has risen from 6% to 60 %, with a commensurate rise in national health expenditure from zero, 40 years ago, to trillions of dollars today. It is essential that our regulators take on board the evidence and institute a biosafety regimen that is strictly independent, up-to-date and rigorous, which currently does not exist. So, two questions come to mind: Why has the ICAR developed and released mutagenic HT rice varieties? Why did the apex regulator with India’s regulatory regime take no notice of this and stop it? The ICAR (Indian Council of Agricultural Research) has developed and released two HT (herbicide-tolerant) basmati rice varieties (Pusa Basmati Rice 1979 and Pusa Basmati Rice 1985) and two HT non-basmati varieties tolerant to the herbicide IMAZETHAPYR. HT Wheat is also in the wings. We are informed that these HT crops have been produced through induced chemical mutagenesis. Therefore, these HT crops represent genetic modification of organisms/micro-organisms by induced chemical mutagenesis and are, in fact, GMOs because they create changes in the genome of plants. But and however, these mutagenic HT crops are not synonymous with modern biotechnology or genetically engineered GMOs (recombinant). This is EU law. The development of these HT crops has taken several years in planning, development and production. It goes without saying that the GEAC and our collective regulatory bodies have clearly been aware of this. And it is pertinent to add that the ICAR is nominated to the GEAC Committee as an Expert Member with others, including the DG Health Services. HT crops have very serious deleterious effects, based on empirical evidence. It is a failed farm technology and causes harm to animals and humans. So, it is curious and indeed unconscionable that these mutagenic HT rice varieties were not stopped at the first instance. The GEAC (apex regulator), should absolutely have done so. An HT crop is an HT crop whether produced by GE techniques or GMOs using chemical mutagenesis techniques. The Supreme Court-appointed TEC (Technical Expert Committee), in 2012-13, recommended a double bar on HT crops: (a) for being an HT crop per se because of their empirically proven, serious egregious impacts, (evidence after more than 40 years of growing these crops in the US/Argentina/Brazil) and (b) if in a centre of diversity or origin. This double bar applies straightforwardly to rice as a priority, as recognised by the GEAC itself, and also to mustard. Beyond this, the Indian ‘Rules of 1989’ are outdated and quite inadequate, as has become clear over the years, and suffer from the malaise that there is “NO statutory regulatory framework in place in the form of a Parliamentary law and is in fact subordinate legislation” (Justice Nagarathna in July 2024 in the recent judgement in this PIL, WP (Civil) No. 260 of 2005). The ‘Rules of 1989’, nevertheless, do pertain to genetic modification of an organism. A conscionable regulator would have and should have viewed this with new vision in 2024 and applied it to GMOs created through mutagenesis, and if necessary, through a timely notification on their applicability to these GMOs arising from induced chemical mutagenesis. The hard reason behind such complete blindness is undoubtedly the long-standing and unlawful conflict of interest that exists in the entire regulatory framework — our regulatory bodies have been captured by the biotech and agrichemical Industries. Usually, every effort is employed by regulators, through subterranean regulation and secrecy, to obfuscate a conflict of interest because it, ethically and legally, invalidates their position as regulators. Not this time though. Moreover, the brazenness and caution-thrown-to-the-wind action by the ICAR in inking in an MOU with Bayer (Sept 2023), which also owns Monsanto (2018), defies belief. It is breathtaking; all pretence is gone. We have a cancer that is metastasising vertically and horizontally throughout the entire regulatory body. (This is clear from the appointment of the ICAR to the GEAC Committee as Expert Member.) It is symptomatic of a cancer of corruption that plagues the entire global food system. Dr Casey Means says: “The largest merger ever done in Germany was Bayer Monsanto, where Bayer, which is a pharmaceutical company merged with Monsanto, which is an agrochemical company in the United States. If you look at what Bayer makes, they make cancer drugs for things like non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. If you look at what Monsanto makes, which is Roundup, which is the most widely used pesticide in America, the cancer that it causes is non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. (There are over 100,000 court cases winding their way through US courts — added by A R). They paid out USD 11 billion in the past couple years for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma cases. So, the companies are merging that are directly known to cause the disease, with a medical company that has a treatment for the disease. This is very dark.” (Source/Tweet has been removed) It should be noted that the Bayer-Monsanto Roundup herbicide is also an endocrine disruptor and is linked to birth defects. Monsanto and the US Environmental Protection Agency have both known for over 40 years that glyphosate and its formulations cause cancer. However, penetrating the huge Indian market represents a massive cash cow for foreign corporations, especially if their HT crops (by either technology of genetic engineering or chemical mutagenesis) get market approval. This would certainly make up for declining demand elsewhere. For instance, in July 2023, it was reported by the BBC that German-based Bayer expects to take a USD 2.5bn (USD 2.8bn) hit due to slower demand for its glyphosate-based products. The ICAR has recently also concluded MoUs with Amazon and Syngenta. Researcher and writer Colin Todhunter says: “We are currently seeing an acceleration of the corporate consolidation of the entire global agri-food chain. The big data conglomerates, including Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook and Google, have joined traditional agribusiness giants, such as Corteva, Bayer, Cargill and Syngenta, in a quest to impose their model of food and agriculture on the world. “The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and big financial institutions, like BlackRock and Vanguard, are also involved, whether through buying up huge tracts of farmland, pushing biosynthetic (fake) food and genetic engineering technologies or more generally facilitating and financing the aims of the mega agri-food corporations”. From Agrarianism to Transhumanism: The Long March to Dystopia The ICAR is certainly facilitating this process in India. It is important to understand that the regulatory agencies of both the US and India are run by the big food processing companies, big agribusiness concerns, the chemicals/pesticide conglomerates and the Gates Foundation. India’s food is becoming increasingly toxic and unsafe. This will lead to chronic disease in India just as it has in the US, children in particular. The genesis of the dominance of private interests in our food and agriculture lies in an MOU signed over 20 years ago (see below). That poison has spread and is rapidly being cemented now, through the MOUs with Bayer, Syngenta and Amazon. The Knowledge Initiative in Agricultural Research and Education (KIA) was signed in 2006 and, astonishingly, the Indian Government assigned Monsanto to the closest scrutiny of India’s genetic resources as a result of its position on the Board of the Indo-US KIA. Monsanto effectively represented the US government in order to facilitate GM food crops into Indian agriculture. The ICAR was inducted as the signing institution for the Union of India for an alliance with the US for GM crops. The ICAR was required to provide “free access” to its entire network of 47 agricultural laboratories and universities so that US companies and research institutes could carry out joint research with ICAR in biotech areas “that have the potential for rapid commercialisation.” This ‘agreement’ is no longer ‘active’. But its spores and workings continue to influence public institutions of agriculture, including public-private-partnerships with the industry that the Department of Biotechnology partners in GM crop development or the SAUs (State Agricultural Universities) to ensure that ‘policy and regulation’ is speedily tailored to facilitate the introduction of a full range of GM food crops. The State Agricultural Universities of TAU (Tamilnadu Agriculture University) and Dharwad, for example, were involved in the development of Bt brinjal, funded by US AID, Monsanto and Cornell University. The ongoing capture of public policy space by foreign interests is not lost on the Peoples’ Commission on Public Sector and Services (PCPSS), which includes eminent academics, jurists, erstwhile administrators, trade unionists and social activists. In a recently released statement, it expressed concern that Bayer will exploit the ICAR’s vast infrastructure to pursue its own commercial plans within India to boost sales of toxic proprietary products. The PCPSS notes that there are several ICAR-sponsored research institutions and state-level agricultural universities, which are engaged in outstanding research relevant to Indian agriculture. A number of states have launched their own natural farming missions to free debt trapped farmers from the use of costly chemicals and other unsustainable practices. The PCPSS says it is therefore not clear as to why the ICAR should choose to promote Bayer in multiple areas of agricultural research. Mutagenic HT crops have somehow, willy-nilly been introduced into India and in basmati varieties, by-passing the Apex Regulator the GEAC. The ICAR and India’s collective regulatory agencies have aimed for India’s jugular for maximum harm to her agriculture and food. It is difficult to quite comprehend just how wrong policies that promote HT crops are. A wholesale sell-out of India’s agriculture and her food is being relentlessly pursued. Evidence of the utter disaster that HT crops are, is clear and is based on empirical research findings of 35+ years of growing these crops in the US, Argentina and Brazil. These findings provide insight into the harm that all HT crops, in this specific case by mutagenesis, will have on our farming. This seriously egregious policy decision must therefore be urgently reversed and stopped. In July 2024, I wrote to the ICAR highlighting what is set out below. The ICAR’s introduction of HT crops highlights the consequences for India: the ICAR (India’s regulatory body for farming) has effectively ditched its mandate to Indian farmers and farming, whose competitive advantage is organic farming based on soil health, sustainability and regenerative agriculture. By avoiding synthetic pesticides and fertilisers, organic farms provide a habitat for a wide range of organisms, from soil microbes and insects to birds and mammals. The biodiversity provided by organic farms is crucial for ecosystem resilience and the provision of ecosystem services such as water purification, pollination and nutrient cycling, which benefit all species. This step is a potential threat to India’s export markets, which are based on organic standards, along with the necessary co-surety that India’s foods and farms are not contaminated by herbicides, a consequence of using HT crops. In the matter of rice, HT crops are of the greatest concern because India is the ‘centre of origin’ of rice, which means that India has an immensely rich diversity in rice. The ICAR has, furthermore, rather perversely selected basmati, historically, the queen of rice varieties, in which to introduce an HT trait. The ICAR’s action directly impacts the vital issue of contaminating our germ plasm in rice and contravenes a Supreme Court Order of “no contamination”. Our export markets for basmati are in excess of USD 5 billion in 2023-24. The ICAR’s action will directly impact India’s exports and, thereby, impact farmer export potential, incomes and income opportunities that premium prices provide. In my letter to the ICAR, I also pointed out that HT crops are pesticidal crops and are not meant for human consumption. Therefore, HT crops must be tested as pesticidal crops but are not. The sprays used include chemicals and surfactants, the latter force both weeds and the HT crop to absorb significant quantities of the herbicide that is sprayed on them. The resistant crop stands. Everything else dies including non-target organisms. The use of these surfactants encourages indiscriminate use. The ICAR was made aware that, based on empirical evidence, HT crops are a failed technology, which spawn super weeds, higher herbicide use and no added performance yield. I provided the ICAR with empirical data to support my claims. Overall herbicide use (US Geological Survey) has increased more than tenfold, from 20 million pounds/year (prior to HT Crops in 1992) to 280 million pounds/year by 2012. In other words, 527million pounds more total herbicide was used in the US during this period (1992-2012) due to commercialised HT crops. As of 2013, HT crops had caused the emergence of some 60 million acres or about 25% of US cropland (ref. TEC report) of ‘super’ weeds resistant to herbicides, doubling since 2010 or about 50% of crop area sown to herbicides. The costs to farmers of weed control have increased by up to 100%, seed prices have increased threefold (from 1996). The combined onslaught is putting US farmers out of business as they struggle with losses on a substantial scale. The ICAR was made aware that for India HT crops are a particularly perverse use of technology, irrespective of whether GE or through mutagenesis. The technology risks small and marginal farmers’ crops and ‘jari-booti’ herbs and plants, used in many Ayurvedic medicines, because of herbicide drift among other things. Moreover, HT crops are designed for monoculture. It bears repeating that HT crops are completely unsuited to Indian smallholder farming. They also uniquely impact the employment of women in weeding (MS Swaminathan Task force 2004). As stated above, HT Crops will deny Indian farmers their niche export markets, which are not contaminated and will be endangered by herbicide. Furthermore, the market for organics is growing by a robust minimum 20% pa. Both requirements attract premium prices. Like Bayer’s other toxic herbicides, glyphosate and glufosinate, imazethapyr is also a systemic broad-spectrum herbicide and is banned in some countries and not approved for use in the EU. This is an additional red flag with regard to the use of this herbicide. Prof. Jack Heinemann notes that antibiotic resistance is also a cause for concern. Herbicides (including imazethapyr) must be tested for their ability to cause bacterial antibiotic resistance. Common adjuvants (e.g. emulsifiers/surfactants) used in association with herbicide active ingredients alter the response of bacteria to antibiotics. Combined with antibiotic use in medicine, veterinary medicine, and crop protection, co-exposures to herbicide (and agrochemicals in general) and antibiotics are common. Co-exposures alter the response of bacteria, notably those that can cause diseases in people, companion animals, or livestock, to antibiotics. In time, the co-exposure increases resistance to antibiotics. Heinemann recommends: “it is necessary to test any herbicide, including of imazethapyr, to be able to exclude the possibility that it can cause antibiotic resistance. We have not identified any chemical or biological similarities between the herbicides that would allow one to predict in advance that a particular chemical or formulation would not have this effect on bacteria” And “that effects on bacteria that can cause disease be considered whenever considering adopting a cropping practice that combines herbicide use and herbicide tolerant crops. The enormous burden of antibiotic resistance should not be unnecessarily exacerbated by use of herbicides”. India’s population has some of the highest levels of antibiotic resistance in the world. Any spread of HT crops would put us at severe risk of resistance and disease. Despite these environmental and health concerns, the herbicide market in India is projected to grow by around 54% in the next five years, from USD 361.85 million in 2024 to USD 558.17 million by 2029. In view of the above evidence of serious irreversible harm to health, food and agriculture across several dimensions, it is a required scientific response for the ICAR and our regulators to immediately withdraw HT crops, including HT rice varieties and desist from introducing any HT crop whether through mutagenesis or genetic engineering. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article to your friends and colleagues.

All may not be going well for Bernard Arnault, who owns luxury brands Louis Vuitton and Dior, after a whopping $54 billion wipeout. LVMH’s Arnault was once considered to be the world’s richest man, but has now fallen to 5th place. With an aim to stay in his role longer, the founder of the Paris-based behemoth pushed to raise the retirement age from 75 to 80 in 2022. “I have five members of the family working in the group, he told Bloomberg in an interview this year. “Let’s see if one of them has the capacity to take over.” The 75-year-old boss had an estimated net worth of $231 billion in March, falling to $200 billion by June, before eventually plummeting to $177 billion on Monday. While he still remains wealthier than former Microsoft (MSFT) CEOs Bill Gates ($163 billion) and Steve Ballmer ($150 billion), he now ranks lower than Elon Musk ($265 billion), Jeff Bezos ($216 billion), Mark Zuckerberg ($200 billion) and Larry Ellison ($178 billion), according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The drop in Arnault’s rank comes after the company’s stock price dipped 20%, wiping out $54 billion from his net worth. LVMH reported a fall in revenues, with its wine and spirits section being hit the hardest. According to its earnings report, Champagne sales declined 15% in the first half of the year compared to the same period a year ago. But LVMH is not alone. Analysts at Bank of America Securities (BAC) recently downgraded European luxury stocks, citing sectorial slowdown into the second half of 2024 and next year. While LVMH was downgraded from “buy” to “neutral, Germany’s Hugo Boss (BOSSY) was moved from “buy” to “underperform.” The bank analysts warn of falling demand for luxury brands among high-spending Chinese consumers. Across European luxury firms, the Bank of America analysts expect a 1% revenue decline in 2024, addressing challenges across the luxury sector. France remains a key exporter of luxury bags in China. According to a study by consultancy Asterès, LVMH’s fashion exports accounted for 4% of total French exports in 2023. But LVMH may face some headwinds. The ongoing tensions between China and Europe could also put LVMH in a tough spot. The challenge also comes at a time when there have been some leadership shifts in the organization, with all five of Arnault’s children in operational roles and four having board seats.

On July 24, 2024, after the market closed, Ford reported its second-quarter financial results for 2024, indicating that the Company’s “[p]rofitability was affected by an increase in warranty reserves” and “higher warranty costs.” Consequently, Ford revised its full-year earnings outlook for its electric vehicle segment to account for “higher warranty costs than originally planned.” Reports from analysts and major news outlets, including The Associated Press and The Washington Post, noted that warranty and recall expenses reached $2.3 billion in the second quarter—$800 million more than in the first quarter and $700 million higher than the same period last year. As a result of this news, Ford’s stock price dropped by $2.51, or 18.36%, closing at $11.16 per share on July 25, 2024, with unusually high trading volume. The class action complaint alleges that, during the Class Period, the Defendants made materially false and misleading statements and failed to disclose significant adverse information regarding the Company’s business and prospects. Specifically, it claims that the Defendants did not inform investors that: (1) there were deficiencies in the quality assurance of certain vehicle models; (2) these deficiencies were leading to increased warranty costs; (3) the Company’s warranty reserves did not accurately reflect the quality issues of the sold vehicles; (4) as a consequence, the Company’s profitability was likely to be negatively impacted; and (5) due to these issues, the Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business and future lacked a reasonable basis and were materially misleading.

Title: Is the US Abandoning Europe Because of High Cost and Low Yield? Peter Koenig
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/us-abandoning-europe-high-cost-low-yield/5868562
Time Published: 2024-09-24T18:23:28Z
Full Content:
The interview with NTV was based in response to a Bloomberg article of 9 September 2024 where Andreas Kuhn, geopolitical analyst, writes that America will abandon Europe next, and this, regardless of who wins the election. . . . . . . It has ceased to be profitable for the United States to support Europe, and it is much more profitable to focus resources on Southeast Asia. See the full article here. The newscast of NTV. includes only small segments picked out from a long interview with Peter Koenig (which was not featured by the NTV channel), see minutes 26:10 and 28:15. Below, we provide the complete transcript with Peter Koenig which NTV decided not to publish. (censorship?) See video (Russian) below (after transcript) . . NTV: What are your views on this? Peter Koenig (PK): The US abandoning Europe may be a good thing. It would finally bring back autonomy to Europe – a type of sovereignty it has not known since the end of WWII, because Europe – the European Union (EU) has gradually and ever faster become a vassal state, or union of states, of the United States, doing the bidding for Washington, including supporting a US proxy-war on her territory – Ukraine against Russia. It seems regardless who wins the Presidency, Europe has ceased to be of primary interest for the US. It was never profitable in the sense of money. It was a strategic dominance. Controlling Europe is moving closer to Russia, and at the same time moving NATO troops ever closer to the borders of Russia – and this despite the promise by then Secretary of State James Baker, who in 1991 replied to Mr. Gorbachev’s worries about NATO expansion, “not one inch further”. That promise was broken multiple times. With the right EU leaders in place, the unelected EU Commissioner, as well as the heads of Germany, France, Holland and so on; and with the indoctrinated climate hoax, the EU could be manipulated to economically destroy itself, committing economic suicide, so to speak. Germany is a prime example, as the economic leader of Europe. Under no circumstances could Germany prosper, and establishing friendly relations with Russia, something many Germans and German businesses saw as a logical development – was a no-no. To top it off, in September 2022, US-led secret services blew up the Nordstream Pipeline, supplying crucial and inexpensive gas from Russia to mainly Germany but also other European countries. Germany did not protest, instead supported ludicrous claims that it may have been Russia, and lately, it could have been Ukraine. In the meantime, while “sanctioning” anyone not following strict orders from the EC, to not buying petrol or gas from Russia, Europe in 2023 / 2024 has imported more oil and gas from Russia than before February 2014 – the year of US-instigated Maidan Coup. No longer through a direct pipeline but via India, Turkey, and Ukraine – knowing that energy from Russia was a lifeline for the faltering European economy. One could call it hypocrisy – or lie-propaganda. A new alliance between Germany – and by extension Europe – may bring back the Eurasian market; Eurasia being the largest contiguous landmass (36% of the earths total landmass) on earth (55 million sq.km), housing 5 billion people (about 2/3 of the world population) and controlling about half of the world’s GDP. Pulling Europe away from Eurasia was one of the goals of the two hot world wars. Russia, the Soviet Union, was and still is the stumbling block. Thanks God. In brief, Europe must be economically and financially wiped out, so to speak, for the US to remain the world’s hegemon. Now, Europe is so far ahead in her auto-destruction, that the US may, indeed, direct her attention to other parts of the world, like to Asia and the rapidly emerging Global South, with the BRICS at the center. NTV: How will Trump throw Europe if he wins? PK: This is a good question. Trump is like a roller-coaster, difficult to assess. He probably must follow the script imposed from above, leaving Europe to the wolves. However, Europe is still very much bound to the US through NATO. Of the 32 NATO members, 30 are in Europe. Will Trump do away with NATO, as he often hinted at? I doubt it. His action vis-à-vis Europe is difficult to predict. How about his relation with Russia? Sometimes he says he is friends with President Putin, other times he said Mr. Putin disappointed him. He will go after Iran and China – in one way or another, if his talks are to be believed. But even that is not sure. Iran is not the same Iran he knew. Today, Iran is a close ally of China and Russia, and is part of the BRICS, aspiring to become a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). Iran has strong backing. Trump and Europe: wait and see. NTV: How will Kamala Harris do it? Bloomberg writes that it is as hypocritical as possible: talking about the unshakable support of Europe, but at the same time cutting costs for the military presence. What do you think? PK: Kamala is a puppet. Sorry for the term. She has no agenda. All her agenda items are following a script given from “above”, pretty much the same as with President Joe Biden. The recent debate with Trump indicated that very clearly. She talked the line of the common narrative, no mater whether this narrative if full of lies. Plus, as has emerged in the meantime, she was told what to say through special earpieces. And it was clear to a child, the ABC moderators were biased towards her. Trump, instead of taking her up on these untruths matter of factly, his emotions run through with him, making his answers often ridiculous. That is just a sideline. Kamala will follow instructions from the Globalists. NTV: Why has Europe ceased to be a beneficial ally for the United States? PK: Europe has not ceased to be beneficial for the US. As mentioned before, Europe is an important Globalist ally through NATO – with 30 of the 32 member states being European. These 30 members finance a lot if not most of the NATO budget, they bear de facto a heavier burden than the US and Canada, no matter on the monetary budget, despite what former President Trump said. But the hegemon feels that Europe no longer needs its immediate attention because it has been driven so far ahead in its effort of self-destruct, that an alliance with Russia – and with Eurasia – for example through the Chinese Belt and Road is no longer a significant risk. But that is Washington’s assessment. And often their assessments have not much to do with reality. It needs little change in European politics – a sense of returning to sovereignty – to become a game-changer. Many, if not most of Europeans feel that Russia and by extension Eurasia are natural partners of Europe, and that potential – for which Mr. Putin was always open – should be explored. Image: Mario Draghi NTV: What do you think about Mario Draghi’s [former President of the European Central Bank] recent report that the EU is turning into an economic outsider? PK: Mr. Draghi is right. The EU is not only a European outsider, but is an economic disaster – and so is the Euro, the little brother of the fiat dollar. Mr. Draghi is right for precisely the reasons mentioned before. Europe has let itself become a vassal of Washington, following all instructions, orders of “sanctioning” Russia and China, and has totally lost her independence. Is it too late to bring Europe back as an economic power? It is never too late. European leaders must take back their countries – and even at the detriment of the EU, become sovereign nations again with their own sovereign currencies – and being able to deal with whomever they want, east and west – not being captive to Washington’s wishes and whims. The US’s hegemony is gone so or so. It’s just a matter of time for the final straw to break. So, the sooner Europe realizes that their survival, economically and socially, is autonomy and sovereignty, plus cooperation with Russia and the East, the better. NTV: AN IMPORTANT QUESTION: How much does the United States spend annually to protect Europe? A) Considering Ukraine? B) Excluding Ukraine? PK: Who really knows. On Europe per se – the US spends nothing in my opinion. There are no American subsidies to the EU or any European country. It’s rather the other way around, Europe largely helps fund NATO – and, as we all know, NATO has long become obsolete, and become an aggressive war machine of the US. So, whatever Europe funds for NATO, is a direct contribution to the wars fought by or on behalf of the US. Those who believe NATO exists to defend Europe should start thinking again. As to the funding of Ukraine – it is also not well-known. Recent figures that were advanced by the US State Department were about 200 billion dollars. Is this really all? Does that include weaponry? Or does it include reimbursable loans? All that is kept on purpose pretty wishy-washy. In any case, the US is not planning to lose any money on Ukraine, as Ukraine is rapidly being privatized by BlackRock and Co. That means, sizeable returns from investments in agriculture (one of the most fertile soils in the world – Ukraine was formerly called Europe’s breadbasket) – and huge reserves in natural resources, rare earths, gold, silver — other minerals. NTV: And why did Europe suddenly decide at one time to shift the care of ensuring its security onto the shoulder of the United States? PK: Is this statement correct? It is rather the US telling Europe you do not need your own defense, because we – you and the US – have NATO, a common defense force. Europe, or most of Europe fell for it. Except French President De Gaulle, who exited NATO in 1966. He was a visionary, against NATO from the bottom of his heart, saying France and by extension Europe MUST be able to defend herself. President Sarkozy, a WEF implant, rejoined NATO in 2009. General Charles de Gaulle on the Chemin du Roy, Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade, 1967 (Licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0) Europe would be and is totally capable of building up her own defense forces, and I mean DEFENSE – not offense. And this outside of NATO. Europe has no natural enemies. Europe’s “enemies”, like Russia and the East, China and so on, have been invented by the US. There is hope for Europe to become independent again – and to link up with her natural neighbors, and partners, like Russia and the rest of Eurasia. But it needs perhaps a shock to bring western leaders out of their vassalic slumber. Video in Russian * * Click the share button below to email/forward this article to your friends and colleagues.

Title: Novo Nordisk's CEO took the Washington hot seat over Ozempic prices. 3 takeaways from his testimony
URL: https://qz.com/ozempic-novo-nordisk-wegovy-ceo-senate-testimony-1851656166
Time Published: 2024-09-24T17:50:00Z

Novo Nordisk (NVO) CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen agreed today, during a Senate committee hearing, to sit down with lawmakers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) to look into the possibility of cutting list prices for the company’s popular diabetes and weight-loss drugs. Jørgensen was grilled Tuesday morning by the the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), chaired by Sen. Bernie Sanders, regarding what the company charges for its blockbuster drugs Ozempic and Wegovy in the U.S. compared with other countries. Ozempic and Wegovy belong to a class of weight-loss and diabetes drugs known as GLP-1 medications. Recent trials have found these drugs have additional health benefits such as cutting heart risks and alleviating symptoms of sleep apnea. Morgan Stanley analysts anticipate the global market for this drug class will reach $105 billion by 2030. Soaring demand for these treatments have turned Novo Nordisk and its rival Eli Lilly (LLY), the maker of Zepbound, into the most valuable pharma companies in the world. However, due to high prices, insurers have been hesitant to cover these game-changing drugs, limiting patient access. This year, several politicians, including President Joe Biden, have called on pharma companies to slash the prices of GLP-1 drugs. In April, the HELP committee launched an investigation into Novo Nordisk’s high prices. Jørgensen agreed in June to testify in front of the committee, after Sen. Sanders called for a vote to subpoena the pharma executive. Here are the three main takeaways from today’s Senate committee hearing. In the U.S., the list price — a drug’s price without health insurance — for Ozempic is $968.52, while it’s just $59 in Germany. The list price of Wegovy in the U.S. is $1,349.02, despite being only $92 in the U.K. Novo Nordisk has made $50 billion in sales from Ozempic and Wegovy since 2018 — with 72% of that revenue coming from U.S. sales, Sen. Sanders said at today’s hearing. “In other words, the United States is Novo Nordisk’s cash cow for Ozempic and Wegovy,” Sen. Sanders said. Jørgensen pointed out that, at the pharmacy counter, the majority of patients with insurance pay $25 or less a month out-of-pocket for those medications. “Yes, millions of Americans with decent health insurance pay minimal amounts for their prescription drugs. That’s the good news,” Sen. Sanders responded. “The bad news is that they are paying a fortune in premiums, deductibles, and c0-payments for the insurance that covers those drugs.” Both sides agreed that PBMs, third-party administrators of prescription drug plans for health insurers, play a major role in keeping drug prices high. Jørgensen claimed Ozempic’s net price — the amount Novo Nordisk is actually paid by insurance companies after rebates and discounts are applied — has dropped about 40 percent in the U.S. since it launched in 2017. Wegovy, which launched in 2021, has seen its net price fall similarly. But those declines, which keep the price of these drugs hundreds of dollars more expensive in the U.S. than in other countries, have not been seen by patients. In the chief executive’s written testimony, Jørgensen claimed that “while PBMs negotiate low net prices for their corporate parents, those insurers design their plans such that nearly half of all patients’ out-of-pocket spending for brand medication is based on the full list price, with the insurer collecting the difference.” He also warned that lowering the drugs’ list prices could have unintended consequences, such as health insurers dropping them from their formularies. Sen. Sanders claimed he has received written agreements from major PBMs — including Express Scripts (CI), United Health Group (UNH), and CVS Caremark (CVS) — to not drop coverage of Ozempic and Wegovy if their list prices are drastically cut. Jørgensen agreed to work with PBMs and the committee to look into the possibility of price cuts, as long as they don’t affect patient access. “Anything that can help patients get access, I’m supportive of, and that also includes collaborating and negotiating with anyone who can help,” Jørgensen said. A Novo Nordisk spokesperson added, in a statement emailed to Quartz, “While no single company can fix the American healthcare system alone, we look forward to continuing to work with policymakers and other stakeholders toward meaningful solutions for the people who rely on our medicines.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Toyota Ventures’s Jim Adler says climate tech startups need to secure future buyers | TechCrunch

Comment Jim Adler, founder and general partner at Toyota Ventures, is concerned that climate technology gains could fall into the “valley of death” if companies fail to drum up enough demand to survive. And he’s not wrong to be worried. Climate tech investments in the first half of 2024 dipped for the second consecutive year, both in terms of overall funds invested and deal count as investors shy away from funding what can be capital-intensive, high-risk businesses without a clear path to market. Speaking at a Climate Week NYC event Tuesday, Adler said one way for climate tech to secure that demand is through forward offtake agreements. This is when a customer promises to buy an agreed-upon amount of a product at a specified price by a specified date. “I like that a lot because that encourages investors to invest to hit that date,” Adler told TechCrunch. “We do early-stage investment, which is a telescope into the future … If we know there’s a customer then we and other investors will invest at the early stage because we know we’re investing for something.” During a presentation to a room of about 75 people in midtown Manhattan, Adler laid out how historically, disruptive technologies — from railways to oil pipelines to electric power — have only been able to scale once they hit the tipping point of 10% to 20% adoption rates. Even if sectors have enough supply and innovation, if they don’t hit those rates, “the dynamics of capitalism don’t kick in,” Adler said. “If the demand doesn’t show up, the tech dies,” he continued. “Capitalism is a way to scale these technologies, but not if the customers don’t show up. So how do we help customers show up?” This is an especially prescient question when we consider that growth-stage deals in climate tech declined 33% in the first half of the year compared to the same period last year, per a CTVC report. That hinders the growth of companies that have proven their tech on a smaller scale and need additional funds to expand. Adler says growth-stage investors won’t invest without clear demand signals from customers, like forward offtake agreements. So how do startups get customers to make such agreements? Pushing the levers of government mandates is one way. Take Revel, for example, the startup that started as an e-moped sharing company and now is pursuing EV charging infrastructure. While organic demand for Revel’s charging services today is likely low — it’s mainly buffeted by ride-hail and taxi drivers, both from Revel’s own small service and Uber, Lyft, yellow cab and livery drivers — mandates from states like California and New York that require all new car sales to be electric by 2035 provide investors with a much-needed demand signal. Revel has raised around $270 million, per PitchBook data, with heavy hitters like BlackRock leading the startup’s rounds. Adler said he’s hoping low-carbon fuels, like hydrogen, will have their own moment in securing future demand. “If hydrogen shows up at $2 per kilogram in bulk, that could really push adoption to the right and up the curve,” he said. “Investors can then invest knowing that there’s a customer at the end of this in some volume,” Adler said. “It’s super important. If this doesn’t happen, I think we all need to be a little worried.” Correction: A previous version of this article neglected to include that Revel’s EV charging customer base today includes ride-hail and taxi drivers from other apps and services.

BlackRock has announced that the $10 trillion asset manager was selected as the outsourced fiduciary manager of Stichting Shell Pensioenfonds, the defined benefit pension fund of Shell plc. Shell will outsource asset management of its 27-billion-euro ($30 billion) fund entirely to BlackRock. As of August 31, SSPF had a funded status of 134.5%, well above the fund’s minimum required funding ratio of 105%. As of December 31, 2023, the fund had 5,206 participants, 6,468 former participants and 18,160 beneficiaries who joined the company before July 1, 2013, and are based in the Netherlands. The transfer of Shell’s pension assets to BlackRock is expected to be completed by mid-2025. Asset management for Shell’s Shell Nederland Pensioenfonds Stichting pension fund in the Netherlands, for employees who joined the company on or after July 1, 2013, will remain unchanged under Achmea Investment Management, according to Shell. For more stories like this, sign up for the CIO Alert daily newsletter.  Globally, more than $300 billion of assets have been transferred to BlackRock’s OCIO business to date. BlackRock was named a winner in the asset management and servicing OCIO category at the 2023 CIO Industry Innovation Awards. As a part of the outsourcing, Shell’s pension will move to a defined contribution model, as required by the Netherlands Future Pensions Act. BlackRock will assist in the transition to the new pension system. A spokesperson for Shell could not be immediately reached for comment. Future Pensions Act Shell’s appointment of BlackRock as its fiduciary manager comes as the Netherlands plans a complete overhaul of the country’s pension system by the end of the decade. As part of the Dutch Future Pensions Act, which came into effect in July 2023, all defined benefit plans are required to switch to a defined contribution system. Pension funds based in the country have until January 1, 2028, to make the switch. “In light of the developments regarding the Future Pensions Act and the request from our social partners to transition, the Board has decided, after a careful selection process, to appoint BlackRock as fiduciary manager for SSPF,” said Kenan Yildirim, director of Stichting Shell Pensioenfonds, in a statement. The law requires defined benefit plan sponsors to submit a transition plan by January 1, 2025. “In anticipation of the upcoming changes, the appointment of BlackRock will safeguard the execution of the investment process and ensure that the costs and risks of the transition are carefully managed,” Yildirim continued in the statement. “In addition, our participants will benefit from BlackRock’s expertise, global scale and experience in risk management and sustainability.” Related Stories: UPS Hires Goldman Sachs Asset Management as OCIO for $43.4 Billion Pension Plans Cerity Partners Merges with Agility in OCIO Push BlackRock to Acquire Alternatives Data Provider Preqin Tags: BlackRock, Defined Benefit, Defined Contribution, OCIO, outsourced CIO, Shell, Stichting Shell Pensioenfonds « CalSTRS Promotes 2 to Investment Director

Title: Mark Zuckerberg’s 2024 Election Plan: Make Facebook, Instagram Less Political

Sports and celebrity news are now prioritized over election coverage on Meta’s social media platforms You may have noticed less political content on your Instagram and Facebook feeds this year — and that’s by design. Specifically, it’s the design of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who, according to The New York Times on Tuesday, wants his platforms to be less politically charged heading into the 2024 election. “On Facebook, Instagram and Threads, political content is less heavily featured,” the Times reported. “App settings have been automatically set to de-emphasize the posts that users see about campaigns and candidates.” Rather than political coverage, Meta’s apps are now more likely to recommend sports, cooking and celebrity news. That’s a stark change from four years ago, when Meta — then still under its original Facebook name — hit users with political news more frequently. The company, at the same time, actively policed content tied to the Trump-Biden election, as well as COVID-19. In mid-2020, Facebook started putting warning labels on posts from politicians and public figures that it deemed misinformation; the company also expanded its “hate speech” policy at the time. Zuckerberg, in the year leading up to the 2020 election, said he was “very focused on election security“; the company changed its rules around political ads, making it so American political advertisers had to have a U.S. address, for example. Facebook also had 40 teams, including an “election security” team, that partnered with Homeland Security, law enforcement and state and local election officials to oversee how the election was presented on Facebook and Instagram. That’s become less of a concern for Zuckerberg this time around. For instance, Zuckerberg no longer meets with his heads of election security on a weekly basis, the NYT reported, adding: “He has reduced the number of full-time employees working on the issue and disbanded the election integrity team … though the company says the election integrity workers were integrated into other teams.” Facebook was also active on the political front in the months after the 2020 election. Most notably, the company “indefinitely” banned Trump, saying the risk of having him on the platform was “simply too great” after the January 2021 Capitol Riot (Facebook and Instagram lifted all restrictions on Trump in July). One reason to expect Meta’s shift away from politics to continue: it hasn’t hurt business. The company’s stock price has nearly doubled since Election Day 2020, and is up 63% on the year to $564 per share. Your email address will not be published.

Title: Morgan Stanley: NVIDIA To Earn $10 Billion In Revenue From Blackwell Chips Alone In Q4 2024

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Wall Street is rapidly pivoting away from gnashing its proverbial teeth over NVIDIA's peaking margins just a few weeks back to now rushing to incorporate the Blackwell production ramp-up in its collective bullish thesis, replete with expectations of a phenomenal surge in revenue from the GPU manufacturer's latest flagship product. For the benefit of those who might not be aware, the rumors of a Blackwell architecture design flaw had dominated the narrative around NVIDIA throughout the summer, with analysts contending that the flaw's rectification would relegate the Blackwell production ramp-up to a predominantly calendar year 2025 phenomenon. Then, while announcing its earnings for the June-ending quarter, NVIDIA confirmed the rumors of a minor design flaw but noted that the shortcomings were rectified by making a few minor changes to the photomask - a specific template that is used to create bespoke patterns on semiconductor wafers. Critically, the company announced at the time that it expected to start shipping Blackwell products in the December-ending quarter, with Hopper shipments also expected to increase. $NVDA Morgan Stanley says Hopper/Blackwell demand is strong - Nvidia’s Blackwell chips are now entering volume production, with demand from major customers driving significant growth potential for the company - The Hopper H200 chips are seeing increased demand from smaller… — Kaushik (@BigBullCap) September 24, 2024 Now, Wall Street appears to be front-running NVIDIA's relatively cautious guidance by going a giant step forward. To wit, Morgan Stanley has now disclosed that it expects NVIDIA to ship 450,000 Blackwell chips in the December-ending quarter, earning ~$10 billion in revenue from this architecture alone: "Blackwell chips are expected to see 450,000 units produced in the fourth quarter of 2024, translating into a potential revenue opportunity exceeding $10 billion for NVIDIA." While Morgan Stanley concedes that NVIDIA is still in the process of resolving a few "technical challenges" with its GB200 server racks, the Wall Street titan posits a qualifier that such issues are a part of a "normal debugging process for new product launches." What's more, Morgan Stanley still sees a very healthy demand profile for NVIDIA's H200 chips, courtesy of sovereign AI projects and smaller cloud service providers continuing to expand their capacity.

Super League Gaming Inc. (NASDAQ:SLE) shares tumbled to a 52-week low this week, touching down at $0.52. The esports community and content platform has faced a challenging market environment, reflecting a broader downturn in tech and entertainment stocks. Over the past year, Super League Gaming has seen its stock price plummet, with a staggering 1-year change of -71.12%. This significant decline has brought the company's shares to their lowest point in the last year, underscoring the hurdles the company faces as it strives to pivot its strategy and regain investor confidence amidst a rapidly evolving digital landscape. In other recent news, Super League Gaming has released its Q2 2024 financial results, highlighting a strategic push toward profitability by Q4 2024. The company's operational progress is marked by a decrease in operating expenses and losses, and an expansion of partnerships and offerings. One significant collaboration is with Meta-Stadiums in the metaverse, aiming to create virtual stadiums. Despite flat revenues in Q2 2024 and delays in advertising campaigns due to inflation's impact on consumer spending, Super League Gaming has seen a decrease in operating expenses and losses. This indicates improved efficiency and a promising outlook for the company. The company has also launched immersive experiences with major brands such as the International Olympic Committee, Visa (NYSE:V), Maybelline, Claire's, Skechers, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Universal Pictures. These collaborations have led to high engagement and conversion rates. In further developments, Super League Gaming is focusing on transitioning repeat customers into long-term campaigns and setting annual booking records. The company's CEO, Ann Hand, expressed confidence in the company's strategy and its role in the future of immersive worlds as a media channel. Super League Gaming Inc. (SLE) has been navigating a turbulent period, as reflected in the company's recent market performance. According to InvestingPro data, the company's market capitalization stands at a modest 5.63 million USD, illustrating the scale of its financial footprint in the esports and entertainment industry. Despite the challenges, one of the InvestingPro Tips highlights that SLE holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, which could provide some financial flexibility in its strategic pivot. Additionally, the stock's recent movements suggest it is in oversold territory, based on the Relative Strength Index (RSI), hinting at a potential undervaluation by the market. However, with a negative price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of -0.08 and an adjusted P/E ratio for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024 at -0.23, investors are shown a company that is not currently generating profits relative to its share price. The revenue growth of 25.12% over the last twelve months as of Q2 2024 does provide a silver lining, indicating some level of business expansion despite the stock price's decline. It is also worth noting that the stock has been quite volatile, with a 1-week price total return of -22.3% and a 1-year price total return of -69.49%, which may deter risk-averse investors. For readers interested in a deeper analysis, there are additional InvestingPro Tips available on the platform, which could offer further insights into Super League Gaming's financial health and stock performance.

In a challenging market environment, TCP Capital Corp (TCPC) stock has reached a 52-week low, trading at $8.25. This price level reflects a significant downturn for the investment firm, which has experienced a -29.11% change over the past year. Investors are closely monitoring the company's performance as it navigates through the prevailing economic headwinds that have impacted its valuation. The 52-week low serves as a critical indicator for the market participants who track the stock's resilience and potential for recovery in the coming months. In other recent news, BlackRock TCP Capital (NASDAQ:TCPC) Corp has undergone a significant leadership reshuffle, with Rajneesh Vig stepping down as Chairman and CEO. Philip Tseng has been appointed to fill these roles, while Jason Mehring will assume the position of President. Other key appointments include Patrick Wolfe as COO and Dan Worrell joining Tseng as Co-Chief Investment Officer. These changes come alongside the company's strong financial performance, with Q2 2024 earnings reporting an adjusted net investment income of $0.38 per share and an annualized return on average equity of approximately 14%. The company also declared a third-quarter dividend of $0.34 per share. In a major financial move, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) TCP Capital Corp repaid $250 million of the 2024 Notes, leading to an increase in the company's asset coverage ratio to 180.2%. These recent developments reflect the company's strategic plan for a seamless transition and its commitment to maintaining a diversified investment portfolio. Analysts have noted the firm's disciplined underwriting standards and active restructuring efforts for several companies. The company's financial strategy, executive changes, and performance are based on recent press releases and earnings reports. In light of TCP Capital Corp's (TCPC) recent performance, InvestingPro data provides a comprehensive view of the company's financial health. As of the last twelve months leading up to Q2 2024, TCPC's revenue has grown by 16.64%, indicating a positive trajectory in its earning capacity. Despite the stock trading near its 52-week low, the company has maintained a robust dividend yield of 23.44%, which is a testament to its commitment to returning value to shareholders, as evidenced by 13 consecutive years of dividend payments. InvestingPro Tips suggest caution due to the stock being in oversold territory, which could signal a potential rebound or further declines depending on market conditions. Moreover, the fact that four analysts have revised their earnings downwards for the upcoming period could imply future challenges. However, TCPC's liquid assets surpassing short-term obligations is a reassuring sign of financial stability. For investors seeking a deeper dive into TCP Capital Corp's performance and future outlook, there are additional InvestingPro Tips available, providing a more nuanced understanding of the company's investment profile.

Title: 3 reasons why investors should remain bullish on Apple stock – Needham
URL: https://macdailynews.com/2024/09/24/3-reasons-why-investors-should-remain-bullish-on-apple-stock-needham/

Update font size. Reset Needham & Company analysts have outlined three compelling reasons for investors to maintain a bullish outlook on Apple stock, even amidst concerns about the company’s reliance on the iPhone. These analysts believe that Apple’s strong “stable and liquid” fundamentals, huge share repurchase program, and the company’s strong cash position provide a solid foundation for continued growth and success. Sam Boughedda for Investing.com: ‎ The analysts note that while competitors like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta are heavily investing in generative AI (GenAI) infrastructure with no immediate revenue boost, Apple stands out as a stable and liquid stock. Needham says Apple is actively reducing its equity base through share buybacks, which is expected to drive earnings per share (EPS) growth. The company’s $110 billion share repurchase authorization from May 2024 is projected to lead to 11% EPS growth in fiscal year 2025 and 12% in 2026, according to Needham estimates. Needham believes Apple’s commitment to achieving “net cash zero” from its current net cash position of about $50 billion, along with $91 billion in cash from operations reported in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, suggests accelerated share repurchases in the near future. ‎ MacDailyNews Note: Needham maintains a Buy rating on Apple with a target price of $260 per share, an upside of some 16% over the current price.

Title: The Quest 3 may undergo a significant pricing change

Time Published: 2024-09-24T15:46:40Z

Meta Connect 2024 is tomorrow, which means the much-leaked Meta Quest 3S is about to be revealed (we hope). Despite the event being only hours away, however, there are still more leaks to be had. The latest information, spotted by TechRadar, suggests that with the launch of the 3S, Meta will discount both Meta Quest 3 models and stop production of the 128GB model sometime in November. These leaks come from X (formerly Twitter) users CezaryXR, the editor-in-chief at XR Daily News, and Lunayian, who has posted multiple Quest 3S leaks before, including images of what appears to be marketing material for the 3S. Finally, later in March 2023 u/LuffySanKira on Reddit claims they were shown these &quot;Meta Quest 3s&quot; mockups in what was likely a User Research Zoom call. They were deleted shortly after. The account has an age of 3 years with little activity in VR, and is still active. 13/x 🧵 pic.twitter.com/kq0wTdDodz &mdash; Luna (@Lunayian) March 26, 2024 According to CezaryXR, there will be two models of the Quest 3S — a 128GB model priced at around $300 and a 256GB version for about $400. These prices are very similar to the Quest 2 and much lower than the Quest 3’s current $499 and $649 price tags. If the leak is accurate, Meta will also stop producing the 128GB Quest 3 model sometime in November, meaning it won’t be available to buy after stock runs out. At the same time, both Quest 3 models will get a discount — but we don’t know how low the prices will go. Exclusive Leak before Meta Connect: Meta will stop production of the 128GB Quest 3 by mid-November, leaving only the 512GB variant. Both versions will be discounted until the 128GB stock runs out, after which only the 512GB model will be available. &mdash; Cezary Sobociński (@CezaryXR) September 23, 2024 Although a discount sounds like a good thing, in the long run, it could raise the price overall. Once 128GB stock runs out, people will have no choice but to buy the 512GB model — and with that much storage, it seems very unlikely that even its discounted price will be close to the cheaper model’s $499. Assuming the Quest 3S pricing estimates are accurate, that will leave buyers with three options: Our first thoughts in looking at these prices are that people would love the super affordable Quest 3S models, but sales for the Quest 3 would surely go down. It’s hard to believe that’s what Meta wants, so there’s definitely room for these leaks to be a little off. It’s all unofficial speculation anyway, so it’s always best to take it with skepticism The best part about this leak is that we only need to wait 24 hours to have the record set straight. Make sure to check our coverage of Meta Connect tomorrow for all the latest news on the Quest 3S and the fate of the Quest 3. An enhanced version of a Quest 3S leaked image reveals a possible design. LuffySanKira via Luna / Reddit via X Meta is expected to launch a new low-cost VR headset this year to replace the Meta Quest 2, the world's most popular VR headset. In what’s becoming a tradition for many electronic devices, we already have a good idea of what this new mixed reality headset will look like, its specifications, and more ahead of Meta's official announcement. Logitech has announced its first piece of hardware in the VR space, a stylus that lets you draw and paint in 3D on the Meta Quest 3. The MX Ink Stylus is a familiar-looking sketching tool that works hand in hand with the Quest controller to drastically expand the capabilities of the popular Quest 3 VR headset. The MX Ink also works with the Quest Pro and Quest 2 and supports several painting and sculpting Quest apps, including Gravity Sketch, PaintingVR, OpenBrush, ShapesXR, GestureVR, Arkio, and Engage XR. If you connect your Quest to a VR-ready PC, you can use the MX Ink Stylus with Adobe’s Substance Modeler and Elucis by Realize Medical. The Meta Quest 3 was already one of the best VR headsets for mixed reality, while keeping costs affordable. Soon Quest 3 owners will see a big upgrade that removes the distortion that sometimes broke the immersive feeling, simply by updating their headsets. Meta has announced the v66 software update that, among many things, comes with improvements to the Quest 3's passthrough cameras. Since the Quest 3’s passthrough cameras are located a couple of inches in front of your eyes, the headset must adjust the image to match your true perspective. Otherwise, everything would seem slightly zoomed in. Distant objects are easy, but nearby hands hide a portion of the background, presenting a challenge.

Title: Mark Zuckerberg is now in an exclusive club with only two other members: Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/09/24/mark-zuckerberg-200-billion-club-elon-musk-jeff-bezos/

It’s one thing to be a billionaire. Only 2,781 members of the world’s population, which is nearing 8 billion people, have reached that status. And even fewer people have a multibillion-dollar net worth, with a select few reaching the coveted $100 billion position. But now there’s an even more illustrious camp: the $200 billion club. And only three of tech’s biggest leaders have reached that summit: Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and now, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg, however, not only just broke into the $200 billion club—he’s also the biggest winner on the list having accumulated dozens of billions in wealth this year. Zuckerberg’s wealth has ballooned by an incredible $72.2 billion this year, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, bringing his total net worth to $200 billion. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has had the second-biggest jump in net worth this year, gaining $58 billion in wealth. Growth aside, Musk has the highest net worth with $265 billion to his name, with Bezos tracking behind him at $216 billion. This places Zuckerberg ahead of other major tech executives including Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison and former Microsoft CEOs Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer. “I define our strategy as if we can learn faster than every other company, we’re going to win,” Zuckerberg said during a taping of the Acquired podcast last week. “We’re going to build a better product than everyone else because we’re going to get it out first or early. You learn faster.” Read more from Fortune –Mark Zuckerberg says Europe needs more consistent AI regulation—and even his privacy nemesis agrees –In comments reigniting Tim Cook feud, Mark Zuckerberg declares Meta ‘the opposite’ of Apple –LinkedIn, Facebook, and Instagram are hoovering up your data to train their AI. Here’s how to stop it –Instagram unveils Teen Accounts with mandatory parental controls –Silicon Valley billionaire Vinod Khosla says AI will handle 80% of work in 80% of jobs While Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook 20 years ago, only takes a $1 salary, he makes up for it in “other compensation” and his massive stake in Meta. He’s the largest shareholder of Facebook’s parent company, owning about 345.5 million shares, according to Meta’s April proxy statement. Plus, he took home $24.4 million in “other compensation” this year. Much of that other compensation goes toward protecting Zuckerberg, much as with other high-profile CEOs. “We believe that Mr. Zuckerberg’s role puts him in a unique position: He is synonymous with Meta and, as a result, negative sentiment regarding our company is directly associated with, and often transferred to, Mr. Zuckerberg,” Meta wrote in the SEC filing. Meta did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment regarding Zuckerberg’s net worth. Meta, which owns and operates Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, has performed well this year. Since the start of 2024, Meta’s stock is up a jarring 60%, and an even more impressive 85% year over year. It opened trade at more than $557 per share on Tuesday. Zuckerberg credits the company’s focus on AI for Meta’s strong performance this year. “Meta AI is on track to be the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year,” Zuckerberg said in an earnings statement in July. Indeed, revenue rose 22% to $39.07 billion from $32 billion in Q2. While AI has been a boon for the company, Zuckerberg’s “Year of Efficiency” at Meta has been a challenge for many of its other workers and for some of its biggest projects, including augmented reality. This cost-cutting initiative started in February 2023 and has resulted in mass layoffs from the tech giant. “This decision is part of our larger efforts to prioritize the products we believe will best serve the future needs of our consumers and business customers alike,” Meta said in a statement. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: MicroStrategy Outpaces BlackRock's IBIT by Over 3x Year-to-Date
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2024/09/24/microstrategy-outpaces-blackrocks-ibit-by-over-3x-year-to-date/
Time Published: 2024-09-24T15:37:26Z
Full Content:
Election 2024 coverage presented by Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates. Disclosure: The writer owns shares in MicroStrategy. The launch of U.S. bitcoin exchange-traded funds on Jan. 11, 2024, has become one of the year's most significant financial events. These ETFs, including the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), have collectively attracted $17.7 billion in net inflows since their debut, according to Farside data. IBIT, to some, has emerged as a competitor to MicroStrategy (MSTR), a company renowned for its substantial bitcoin holdings and dual business model. Led by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy currently holds 252,220 bitcoins, valued at approximately $16 billion. Year-to-date, MicroStrategy's stock has risen 119% compared to IBIT's 35%, reflecting a more than threefold outperformance. From the opening of the ETFs until around Feb. 23, IBIT outperformed MicroStrategy as investors either shifted capital to the new funds or took profits on what had been a large run higher in MSTR's stock in the weeks prior to Jan. 11. This trend of profit-taking spread to bitcoin as well, as long-term holders (those holding bitcoin for 155 days or more) sold approximately one million bitcoin from December 2023 through the first quarter of 2024, according to Glassnode data. There are several key reasons for MicroStrategy's impressive returns and its ability to outperform IBIT. One of the first factors is fees. ETFs come with an expense ratio—currently 0.25% for IBIT—which acts as a drag on returns. In contrast, MicroStrategy does not charge such a fee to shareholders, making it more attractive over time in terms of cost efficiency. Furthermore, MicroStrategy operates as a business that generates revenue beyond its bitcoin thesis, primarily through its analytics operations. This diversification allows the company to produce free cash flow and could provide some cushioning during bitcoin's drawdowns even as the stock outperforms during the token's rallies. Since bitcoin's all-time high in March, bitcoin has decreased by 13% and IBIT is down 14%, while MicroStrategy has declined by 15%. Additionally, MicroStrategy has the flexibility to increase its bitcoin per share through debt or equity offerings. For example, it recently upsized a convertible note offering from $700 million to $1.01 billion, using the proceeds to acquire more bitcoin—something IBIT cannot do directly, unless it sees more inflows from investors. Mark Palmer, Senior Research Analyst at Benchmark, said MicroStrategy's recent financial strategies, such as issuing convertible bonds and retiring high-interest debt, have improved its financial flexibility and made the stock more efficient access to capital markets compared to other bitcoin-buying stocks. "A strong case could be made that MSTR following the convert issuance and senior notes retirement had more flexibility to access the capital markets than it had prior to it given its lighter interest burden and increased holdings of unencumbered bitcoins," said Palmer, who has a buy rating on the stock and price target of $215. In terms of marketing and visibility, MicroStrategy has also maintained a higher ranking in Google search trend than IBIT, signaling better recognition and interest. This gap has, however narrowed of late, as options trading on IBIT have now been approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC).

Skip to comments. Posted on 09/24/2024 7:32:06 AM PDT by marcusmaximus VLADIMIR Putin's cursed naval flagship is unlikely to ever sail again after he sent its crew to fight in the war in Ukraine. The Admiral Kuznetsov is the tyrant's only aircraft carrier and has not been in service for eight years. Desperate Vlad has now designated some of the rustbucket's 1,500 crew members as cannon fodder for his brutal invasion. The seamen have formed a land-based "frigate" battalion within Russia's 1st Guards Tank Army, according to OSINT investigator Moklasen. Some of them have already gone missing or died, Forbes reported. Putin had wanted the 305-metre-long Soviet-era warship to play a role in the war but the accident-prone vessel with up to 2,000 crew will sink if it sails again.

Title: Who is Shorting Trump Media & Technology Group Corp
(NASDAQ: DJT) stock

Skip to comments. Posted on 09/24/2024 7:12:39 AM PDT by Eleutheria5 I bought my first ETFs of DJT (the flag ship corporation of Truth Social) months ago at over $30.00. Despite Trump's rise in the polls, two assassination attempts, and loads of revelations about his new opponent's shortcomings, the stock price has slid from that high to $11.75, and each time it slid more, I doubled down and bought more at the cheaper price, which is bogging down my limited portfolio. Now it's finally going up, and at the start of business today rose by about 75 cents and is still rising. One possible explanation is that some rich, powerful person is deliberately shorting the security. And there's a regular rogue's gallery of rich Trump haters who might do so. Fortunately, we have some history to teach us a course of action. About a year or so ago, fat cats had decided to short a popular sporting goods store out of existence, and small-time investors on the Robin Hood platform put a stop to it, by consistently buying en masse the stock, forcing the price up. Their rebellion was duly punished, and Robin Hood put a stop to their uppitiness. But the lesson remains learned, and I propose we do so for our fearless leader's flagship stock as well. It's still at 12.53 a share or thereabouts, climbing up from a low of 11.75 this morning. So those of you who have money to invest, buy some DJT stock now, while it's still cheap. If enough people do so, it will drive the price up even further. Full disclosure. You'll also be bailing my stagnating margin out of the doldrums in a big way, giving me liquidity to venture on more investments, and grow my wealth, such as it is.

And there's a regular rogue's gallery of rich Trump haters who might do so. Fortunately, we have some history to teach us a course of action. About a year or so ago, fat cats had decided to short a popular sporting goods store out of existence, and small-time investors on the Robin Hood platform put a stop to it, by consistently buying en masse the stock, forcing the price up. Their rebellion was duly punished, and Robin Hood put a stop to their uppitiness. But the lesson remains learned, and I propose we do so for our fearless leader's flagship stock as well. It's still at 12.53 a share or thereabouts, climbing up from a low of 11.75 this morning. So those of you who have money to invest, buy some DJT stock now, while it's still cheap. If enough people do so, it will drive the price up even further. Full disclosure. You'll also be bailing my stagnating margin out of the doldrums in a big way, giving me liquidity to venture on more investments, and grow my wealth, such as it is.

Visa (V) shares fell Tuesday as the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) sued the payment processing giant over allegedly monopolistic behavior to protect its dominant position in the debit card market. "Visa has been the largest, most powerful debit network for over a decade," the DOJ wrote in the lawsuit, which was filed in Manhattan federal court. It alleged that the company's contracts with merchants "unlawfully inhibit competition and stifle innovation." An antitrust lawsuit led Visa and competing payment processor Plaid to abandon merger talks in January 2021. The DOJ said at the time that the planned $5.3 billion merger was an example of Visa's monopolistic behavior, as it looked to acquire a potential rival before it was large enough to effectively challenge it. "We are proud of the payments network we have built, the innovation we advance, and the economic opportunity we enable," said Visa General Counsel Julie Rottenberg in an email. "This lawsuit is meritless, and we will defend ourselves vigorously.” Bloomberg and The New York Times earlier reported a DOJ filing was imminent, causing Visa stock to trade lower throughout the session Tuesday. The shares closed down more than 5%. The lawsuit is the latest move from the DOJ and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in recent years to use antitrust laws to block mergers and challenge dominant companies like Ticketmaster parent Live Nation (LYV), Meta Platforms (META), Apple (AAPL), and Alphabet's Google (GOOGL). Visa shares fell more than 5% to $273.76 soon before the closing bell Tuesday. They are up 5% this year. UPDATE: This story has been updated to note the filing of the lawsuit, add a statement from Visa, and update the share price.

Title: About 40% Of Jobs In U.S. Book Publishing Have Disappeared Since 1997
URL: https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/95996-over-30-years-40-of-publishing-jobs-disappeared-what-happened.html
Time Published: 2024-09-24T13:36:00Z
Full Content:
After a year when publishing industry layoffs have frequently been in the headlines, it will surprise no one that the total number of jobs in the industry is in decline. But in an era marked by corporate consolidation, increased competition for consumer attention, and the emergence of alternative publishing models, the most recent government data suggests the loss of publishing jobs over the past three decades has been dramatic. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of people employed in book publishing in the United States fell to 54,822 in 2023, down from 91,100 in 1997. If accurate, that represents a loss of about 40% of traditional publishing jobs in less than 30 years. The BLS stats are drawn from detailed employment data for book publishers, which, according to the agency, includes businesses that “carry out design, editing, and marketing activities necessary for producing and distributing books,” whether “in print, electronic, or audio form.” In 1990, the BLS recorded total book publishing employment at 85,800. Employment then peaked at 91,100 in June 1997, and was at 84,600 as late as December 2008. But the number of industry jobs appears not to have rebounded from the retooling that followed the Great Recession of 2007–2009. In 2012, employment had dropped to roughly 70,000, and in 2016 to approximately 60,000. The annual average bottomed out in 2021 at 51,161, down an eye-opening 44% from the BLS’s peak. In 2023—the most recent stats, released last month—employment has rebounded slightly, to 54,822. Notably, about 20% of publishing industry employment in 2016—10,269 jobs—was in New York City. In 2023, that number had slipped to 9,540, or about 17.4% of the publishing workforce. While government figures show that full-time employment in book publishing has been in decline since the 1990s, context is key. There have been significant shifts, including new technology and consolidation, that make it difficult to compare today’s publishing industry to the industry that existed three decades ago. For example, a 1992 report produced by Simba Information listed 20 companies across all publishing segments with sales of at least $200 million. Of those 20 publishers, 10 exist today, having swallowed up the other 10. And with every acquisition comes integration and a consequent net loss of jobs as companies improve their operating efficiencies. Indeed, publishing has become more efficient in the digital age. After all, despite the significant decline in publishing jobs, industry sales are still growing—although that growth is not keeping up with inflation, and even in absolute terms it appears to be slowing. During the 1990s, for example, sales growth in publishing exceeded 5% annually. By the early 2000s, it had slowed to about 1.5% per year and hit $25 billion in 2007, according to data from the Association of American Publishers. Meanwhile, the most recent AAP numbers show sales in 2023 were $29.9 billion. While publishing industry data is notoriously tricky to pin down given shifting accounting methods and data sources, the trend lines are nevertheless clear: book publishing employment has dropped by about a third, and sales have ticked up modestly. Certainly, profitability has improved. At the 2022 U.S. Book Show, Morgan Entrekin, longtime head of Grove Atlantic, pointed to the growing pressure on publishers—especially publicly traded ones—to deliver higher margins. “In 46 years, [trade book publishers have] never seen these levels of profitability,” he said, noting that historically, profit margins in the 5% range were seen as a healthy return. Today, the four of the Big Five trade publishers that report their financial results (next year it will be three with S&S now private) typically have margins above 10%. Traditional publishing has also ceded territory to new models. For example, digital self-publishing began to make its presence felt around 2007 with the launch of Amazon’s Kindle Direct Publishing. According to Bowker, in 2021 the number of self-published books—including e-books, print books, and digital audio—jumped to nearly three million, from just over 500,000 in 2011. Of course, self-publishing sales data is scarcer and more unreliable than data for the traditional publishing industry. Amazon recently revealed that in the 10 years Kindle Unlimited has been active, KDP authors have earned more than $3.5 billion in royalties, with more than $650 million of that coming in just the past 12 months. When you add in à la carte sales of self-published print and e-books by KDP authors as well as sales from other players in the self-publishing field, total self-publishing sales could be well north of $3 billion annually. But how many people would say they are employed in self-publishing? More to the point, where do they factor into publishing industry statistics? Few self-published authors are in the game full-time. And it is unlikely in any case that Amazon and the myriad other self-publishing companies (BookBaby, Draft2Digital, IngramSpark, and Lulu among them), which all run lean, have absorbed a significant number of the job losses reported by the BLS. Then there is the anecdotal evidence, which suggests that some of the “efficiency” realized by book publishers today has been achieved on the backs of staff: fewer full-time editors, designers, and production personnel, with more work shifted to the assistant level or outsourced to freelancers foreign and domestic—labor that would not be counted in the government’s statistics on publishing industry employment. With all the shifts of the past few decades, are the BLS stats an accurate portrait of the publishing industry job market? It’s hard to say. Surely no one in the industry would dispute that their ranks are shrinking, however. And what is certain is that the structure of employment in publishing has changed dramatically—a trend that is likely to continue. Loading...

Title: Novo Nordisk CEO blames drug 'middlemen' for high price of weight loss meds

Novo Nordisk (NVO) CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen will shift the blame for the high prices of the company’s popular weight loss treatments to drug middlemen and the ‘complex’ U.S. health care system today during a committee hearing in Congress. Jørgensen is set to be grilled Tuesday morning by the the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee (HELP), chaired by Sen. Bernie Sanders, over what the company charges for its blockbuster drugs Ozempic and Wegovy in the U.S compared to other countries. “You have said that our amazing medicines can’t help patients if they can’t afford them. That is true,” Jørgensen plans to say during prepared opening remarks shared with Quartz. He adds, “it is clear that patients too often struggle to navigate the complex U.S. healthcare system. It is also clear that no single company can solve such vast and complicated policy changes.” In the chief executive’s written testimony, he goes on to specifically point the finger toward pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), third-party administrators of prescription drug plans for health insurers. Jørgensen wrote that the net price — the amount that Novo Nordisk is actually paid after manufacturer rebates and discounts are applied — of Ozepmic has dropped about 40 percent in the U.S., since it launched in 2017. Wegovy, which launched in 2021, has also seen its net price fall simlarily. However, “while PBMs negotiate low net prices for their corporate parents, those insurers design their plans such that nearly half of all patients’ out-of-pocket spending for brand medication is based on the full list price, with the insurer collecting the difference,” Jørgensen wrote. He warned that lowering the drugs’ list prices could have unintended consequences like health insurers dropping them from their formularies. The U.S. list price for Ozempic is $968.52 a month and $1,349.02 for Wegovy. In April, the HELP committee launched an investigation into the high prices the company charges for its blockbuster diabetes and weight loss drugs. The committee’s investigation found that the net cost of Ozempic in the U.S. is about $600 a month, well above the drug’s price in other countries. In Germany, for example, Ozempic costs just $59 for a month’s supply. Wegovy’s U.S. net price is $809, while it costs just $92 in the United Kingdom. Jørgensen agreed to testify in front of the committee in June, after Sen. Sanders called for a vote to subpoena the pharma executive. Last week, Sen. Sanders said that CEOs at major generic pharma companies have told him that they are willing to sell a generic version of Ozempic for less than $100.

Title: It's the 'year of the mandate' at offices, but hybrid and remote work aren't dying

Related Stories Amazon isn't the only major company cracking down on remote work — the tech giant joins other companies, including Citigroup, Walmart and UPS, in requiring workers to spend more time in offices in recent months. Even so, the share of people working remotely and hybrid has ticked up in the last year, while those working from an office full-time declined, according to a new report. Some 27% of workers say they work in a hybrid arrangement, up from 26% in 2023, according to a survey of 2,000 knowledge workers from Owl Labs, the video-conferencing technology maker. Another 11% say they work fully remotely, up from 7% in the last year, according to the report. The remaining 62% say they work from a physical office five days a week, down from 66% this time last year. It's "a surprise" to see remote and hybrid work increase slightly in what's shaping up to be "the year of the mandate," says Frank Weishaupt, CEO of Owl Labs. But hybrid workers continue to face challenges in what they want versus what their employers require. Most say they prefer to be in-office three days a week (33%) followed by two (20%), but the most common in-office schedules actually require three (41%) or four (32%) days a week. Companies are also increasing their efforts to track employees' attendance during the week. Nearly half of employees say their employer has added or increased the use of employee tracking software to gather activity data in the past year. And workers say their employers are stricter about enforcing attendance policies (like being fired for noncompliance) now, compared with 2022, according to data from WFH Research. However, "the issue with strict attendance policies is that they can become unenforceable," says Jose Maria Barrero, co-founder of WFH Research and assistant professor at the Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México Business School. "If employees work from home effectively, and there is no real reason for them to come into the office other than 'it is just the policy,' will managers really punish them?" he says. "Are you willing to piss off a good employee and potentially push them to find a different job if their work is otherwise up to standard?" Some business leaders may create strict office policies to get people to quit and avoid layoffs, he says, "but I'm skeptical that they would take a hard line if things are working well." On the employee side, there's been "a severe backlash" to many attendance and tracking efforts, says Deepali Vyas, the global head of fintech, payments and crypto practice at Korn Ferry. "Employees want autonomy and feeling like they're not being micromanaged." When set up effectively, tracking policies and tools can "enhance transparency and performance," Vyas says. "But I feel like it's a bit invasive. It can actually erode trust, which is something really crucial in any workplace." In fact, 73% of professionals say employee-tracking initiatives like monitoring badge swipes and computer activity are not necessary or helpful, according to a recent Glassdoor poll of 1,400 users. However, Weishaupt expects 2025 will see a continuation of more RTO mandates, tracking software and badging enforcement, despite Owl Labs' and other data indicating that "employees want flexibility," he says. "And I think that will create a trust barrier between employers and employees." Want to master your money this fall? Sign up for CNBC's new online course.

LOS ANGELES - BlackLine, Inc. (NASDAQ:BL), a provider of financial automation software solutions, announced Monday the appointment of David Henshall to its Board of Directors. Henshall's extensive background in enterprise software and financial management is expected to strengthen the company's strategic direction and governance. Henshall has a notable history in executive roles at Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:CTXS), where he spent nearly two decades, including time as President and CEO. His tenure at Citrix was marked by a significant push towards cloud computing, which positively impacted the company's operational performance. Before his time at Citrix, he held executive positions, including Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, contributing to his deep understanding of financial operations in the technology sector. BlackLine's leadership expressed strong support for Henshall's appointment. Co-CEO and Chairman Owen Ryan highlighted Henshall's unique executive experience and alignment with BlackLine's vision and operating model. Co-CEO and Founder Therese Tucker anticipates that Henshall's insights will bolster the company's strategic initiatives and help deliver value to customers and investors. In response to his appointment, Henshall expressed honor in joining BlackLine's Board and commended the company's market position and platform capabilities that serve the office of the CFO. He looks forward to contributing to BlackLine's ongoing growth and success. David Henshall's board experience extends beyond BlackLine, with active roles on the boards of HashiCorp (NASDAQ:HCP), Inc., Aspen Technology (NASDAQ:AZPN), Inc., and Feedzai, Inc. His past board chairmanship at Everbridge (NASDAQ:EVBG), Inc., and directorship roles at New Relic (NYSE:NEWR), Inc., and LogMeIn (NASDAQ:LOGM), Inc., reflect his extensive governance experience. BlackLine's platform aims to transform digital finance by providing organizations with accurate, efficient, and intelligent financial operations, a mission that Henshall's expertise is set to enhance. The company's commitment to innovation, security practices, and customer partnership is underscored by its global customer base of over 4,400 enterprises. This move comes as part of BlackLine's strategy to continuously evolve its governance and operational strategies, with an eye on long-term growth. The information in this article is based on a press release statement from BlackLine, Inc. In other recent news, BlackLine, Inc. reported a significant growth in its Q2 2024 earnings with a revenue of $161 million and a non-GAAP net income of $43 million. The company's strategic product portfolio, particularly in consolidation and financial analytics, had a strong quarter. On the other hand, Soros Capital Management made a notable move by completely selling off its stakes in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). The Saudi Public Investment Fund showed a bullish stance by adding call positions in PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), Microsoft, and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), increasing the value of its U.S. stock holdings to roughly $20.7 billion. Jana Partners also established a new position in BlackLine Systems, owning nearly a 2% stake in the company. In more recent developments, BlackLine expects a total GAAP revenue for Q3 to be between $162 million and $164 million, indicating an 8% to 9% growth. Meanwhile, Soros Capital Management reduced its investments in major tech firms like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, and Meta Platforms. These are the recent highlights from the world of investments and finance. BlackLine, Inc. (NASDAQ:BL) shows a promising outlook with a market capitalization of $3.19 billion, reflecting its significance in the financial automation software solutions sector. This valuation is supported by a robust gross profit margin of 75.39% over the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, indicating the company's efficiency in managing its cost of goods sold relative to its sales. Investors looking at the company's earnings potential will find that BlackLine is trading at a high Price/Earnings (P/E) ratio of 26.19, which has adjusted to a higher forward P/E ratio of 46.21 for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024.

Title: Oppenheimer analysts initiate coverage of Pinterest with "Outperform" rating

Investing.com -- Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) has the smallest daily active user base among social media companies, but there is "upside" to the company stemming from engagement and advertising on the platform, according to analysts at Oppenheimer. In a note to clients on Tuesday, the analysts noted that Pinterest, which is known for its pinboards designed to spark ideas on everything from recipes to weddings, has the fastest-growing digital advertising offering outside of Instagram-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). "Pinterest operates a global discovery platform with high-intent users in search of products and inspiration, lending itself well to direct response advertising. Relevant ads improve the core user experience, like magazines, driving strong advertiser [return on investment]," the Oppenheimer analysts wrote. They initiated their coverage of the firm with an "Outperform" rating and a share price target of $45. "Ads drive increased engagement, which brings more advertisers, better data, more users, and higher ad pricing. More than half of users think of Pinterest as a place to shop, and 96% of searches are unbranded (e.g., “red dress”) further indicating access to unique inventory," the Oppenheimer analysts said. In July, Pinterest's stock price tumbled by around 15% after the company's third-quarter revenue guidance missed Wall Street expectations. The business said it now expects to post sales of $885 million to $900 million during the period, below estimates of roughly $907 million. However, Pinterest said it had 522 million global monthly active users in the second quarter, above analysts' forecasts, while quarterly average revenue per person of $1.64 met estimates. Speaking in a post-earnings call, Chief Financial Officer Julia Donnelly noted that Pinterest's "more sophisticated advertisers continue to lean into the platform," although she flagged "broader headwinds" are weighing on ad spending by food and beverage groups. In general, however, Pinterest executives said the market for advertising was "relatively stable" in the second quarter.

Title: Meta might soon cut the Meta Quest 3 price and discontinue the 128GB model

The Meta Quest 3S could shake things up more than we thought When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Update: It's confirmed, Meta has officially discontinued three of its VR headsets including the 128GB Meta Quest 3, though it is getting a price cut while it's still available. Original story continues below. As I’m writing this, Meta Connect 2024 is just a day away, which means we’re also just a day away from (hopefully) finally seeing the Meta Quest 3S in action – Connect is where many expect the much-leaked headset will make its debut. But its arrival could also be the end of one of the two Meta Quest 3 models, because leaks suggest the 128GB Quest 3 could be discontinued after the 3S launch. This comes from two sources, @CezaryXR – Editor-In-Chief at XRDailyNews – and @Lunayian – the source of most Quest 3S leaks, just ahead of Meta itself. CezaryXR claims that the Quest 3S will have two models: a 128GB variant at around $300 and a 256GB model at around $400; this matches the price in that supposed leaked Amazon ad, and aligns roughly with the Quest 2’s prices of $299 / £299 / AU$479 and $399 / £399 / AU$599 for its two models respectively. What’s more, Meta will also reportedly stop production of the 128GB Quest 3 by mid-November – so when it sells out it won’t come back. Both current Quest 3 models (128GB and 512GB) will be discounted too. Exclusive Leak before Meta Connect:Meta will stop production of the 128GB Quest 3 by mid-November, leaving only the 512GB variant.Both versions will be discounted until the 128GB stock runs out, after which only the 512GB model will be available.September 23, 2024 Lunayian shared the post adding they “heard similar whispers” – however neither source can confirm what prices the Meta Quest 3 headsets will fall to. In either case, it’s worth remembering to take these leaks with a pinch of salt, however they do support my one big piece of advice for anyone keen to buy a VR headset right now: wait. While I think a Quest 3 price drop makes sense (more on that below) whether it happens or not the Quest 3S looks set to be a headset at least worth considering – something you can’t do until it’s official. One question I’ve had about the Quest 3S is how its value proposition will stack up against the regular Quest 3. Yes the rumors say it’ll be bulkier, and have slightly worse specs in areas like its display and RAM – but still boast an identical processor – though as long as these downgrades don’t affect its performance too massively, the main deciding factor will be price. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. And here there’s a lot of room for error. Make the Quest 3S too pricey and the Quest 3 will remain a no-brainer upgrade killing the new model, make it too cheap and the regular Quest 3’s sales could tank – yes older models get replaced eventually, but VR headsets are not yet at the yearly refresh cycle of smartphones (and they shouldn’t be). This is why I was starting to convince myself the Quest 3S would start at around $350, or even $400 rather than being as cheap as the Quest 2 like many hoped. The strategy outlined in the leak above however is an alternative way to walk this pricing tightrope. Eliminating the cheaper Quest 3 helps to create more of a distinction between the Quest 3S models and the top of the line Quest 3, meaning we can have our super-affordable Quest 3S without as much risk of it cannibalizing its predecessor. Unfortunately, while the Meta Quest 3 will get a price drop according to the leaks, I suspect the 512GB model will land a little above the 128GB version’s current price of $499 / £479 / AU$799. If that’s the case, then when the 128GB model sells out the Quest 3 would get an effective price increase, which wouldn’t be ideal. We’ll have to wait and see what’s announced at Meta Connect 2024 and beyond, but if the leaks hold true I’d recommend trying to snatch up a 128GB Meta Quest 3 while you can as that’s looking like my pick for the best of the four Quest 3/3S models, and it might not be around for much longer.

China issued a series of stimulus measures to boost its hard-hit economy and housing market; U.S. stock futures are little changed after the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed Monday at record highs; Boeing's (BA) "best and final" offer is rejected by its striking union workers; Novo Nordisk (NVO) Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen faces a Senate hearing over the high cost of its weight-loss drugs; and Tesla (TSLA) shares are continuing to rise on Wall Street's optimism around its China and robotaxi operations. Here's what investors need to know today. China issued a broad stimulus package of monetary measures to boost a sluggish economy weighed down by a housing market slump and weak consumer sentiment. Beijing cut a key short-term interest rate, reduced rates on existing mortgages, lowered the amount banks need to set aside as reserves, and announced plans for at least 800 billion yuan ($114 billion) of liquidity to shore up the struggling stock market. Crude oil futures—under pressure from weak demand in the Asian nation—rose, while American depositary receipts (ADRs) of Chinese conglomerate Alibaba Group Holding (BABA) are gaining 5% in premarket trading. U.S. stock futures are little changed after major indexes closed up Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 both finishing at fresh record highs. U.S. shares have been boosted in recent days by the Federal Reserve's first interest-rate cut in more than four years, and investors are now on watch for more Fed comments as officials say that upcoming economic data will determine the size of future rate cuts. Boeing (BA) offered what it called its "best and final" offer to workers who have been striking since mid-September, crippling the plane maker's operations. Boeing offered the striking members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union base wage increases of 30% over four years, up from its previous offer of a 25% increase. The union dismissed the offer in an X post, saying the contract "was thrown at us without any discussion." Novo Nordisk (NVO) ADRs are rising 1% in premarket trading ahead of a Senate hearing on the high costs of the Danish company's popular weight-loss drugs Wegovy and Ozempic. CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen is scheduled to testify today before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), which has accused the company of charging "outrageously high prices" for its treatments. Telsa (TSLA) shares are trading 1% higher in premarket trading after leading S&P 500 gainers Monday with an almost 5% jump, as analysts highlighted several potential catalysts that could provide a boost for the electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer. Barclays analysts said that based on data points from China, Tesla could exceed expectations with its third-quarter vehicle deliveries, while analysts at Goldman Sachs and Bank of America also suggested Tesla could impress investors with its robotaxi event next month.

Title: Nvidia stock: Morgan Stanley says Hopper/Blackwell demand is strong

NVIDIA (NVDA) is experiencing strong demand for its Hopper and Blackwell GPUs, according to Morgan Stanley analysts. The investment bank said in a note Tuesday that Nvidia’s Blackwell chips are now entering volume production, with demand from major customers driving significant growth potential for the company. Morgan Stanley reports that Oracle recently announced plans to build a Zettascale AI supercluster powered by 131,000 Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Blackwell GPUs, delivering 2.4 ZettaFLOPS of AI performance. Oracle’s request for more GPU supply has provided a boost to Nvidia’s outlook, as well as to its suppliers in the semiconductor industry. "At a recent event, Oracle reportedly requested more GPU supply, which was upbeat news for the Asia AI semi/system supply chain," wrote the bank. Morgan Stanley now expects TSMC’s CoWoS (Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate) capacity to increase to 80,000-90,000 wafers per month by 2025, up from a previous estimate of 70,000. In the near term, Nvidia’s Hopper GPU demand is said to remain strong, alleviating concerns about potential inventory risks. According to Morgan Stanley, the Hopper H200 chips are seeing increased demand from smaller cloud service providers and sovereign AI projects. Meanwhile, Blackwell chips are expected to see 450,000 units produced in the fourth quarter of 2024, translating into a potential revenue opportunity exceeding $10 billion for Nvidia. Morgan Stanley also notes that while Nvidia is still resolving some technical challenges with its GB200 server racks, these issues are part of the normal debugging process for new product launches. Hon Hai, Nvidia’s assembly partner, is reportedly on track to begin shipments of the GB200 server rack by late Q4 2024. Morgan Stanley maintains a bullish outlook on Nvidia’s AI supply chain, favoring it over memory, PC, and cloud segments as Nvidia continues to capitalize on the growing demand for AI semiconductors.

"Bitcoin's lack of response to this news, juxtaposed against rallying Chinese indices, highlights that its current beta appears more tightly linked to Fed policy and U.S. markets, as evidenced by near two-year high correlations with U.S. stocks, particularly following last week's FOMC [Federal Open Market Committee] meeting," Rick Maeda, a Singapore-based research analyst at Presto Research, told Coindesk. Last week, the Fed's historical 0.5% interest rate cut pushed the bitcoin price sharply higher as traders braced for the beginning of a new liquidity cycle. The Federal Reserve interest rate cut and stimulus from China are predicted to trigger a bitcoin price surge over the next few years by some bullish investors.

"I still have a $1 million [bitcoin] price target," Arthur Hayes, a cofounder of bitcoin and crypto derivatives pioneer BitMex who went on to set up the Maelstrom investment fund, told Coindesk last week. "I'm more of a 2026, 2027 sort of person. Next year, we really get a ramp up in fiscal spending regardless of who wins the U.S. election. And if the U.S. dollar declines a lot, then China has room to enact stimulus as well and keep the yuan stable. And then you have the rest of the major central banks following in the footsteps of the Fed. They look at the Fed; they're easing so we can ease too." Hayes has previously said he expects a China "bazooka" combined with the Fed easing to create a "glorious" crypto bull market. One Community. Many Voices.

September 24, 2024 06:30 ET | Source: Radisson Mining Resources Inc. Radisson Mining Resources Inc. ROUYN-NORANDA, Quebec, Sept. 24, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Radisson Mining Resources Inc. (TSX-V: RDS, OTCQB: RMRDF) (“Radisson” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce results from three deep diamond drill holes completed at its 100%-owned O’Brien Gold Project (“O’Brien” or the “Project”) located in the Abitibi region of Québec. These results are part of Radisson’s ongoing and fully-funded 35,000 metre drill program, and represent the first deep drill holes of the current campaign. The three drill holes reported today represent an approximately 200 metre wide fence to the west, centre and east of the down-plunge extension of a high grade mineralization trend at the Project labeled “Trend 1.” The fence was located at a vertical depth of approximately 1,100 metres, 170 metres below the base of the existing Mineral Resource and below the level of the historic workings at the adjacent O’Brien mine. Of note, DDH OB-24-324, the central hole of the fence located directly below “Trend 1”, returned a wide intersection of high-grade mineralization with extensive visible gold (Figures 1, 2 & 3 and Tables 1 & 2). Results Highlights: Matt Manson, President & CEO, commented: “The results reported today represent a significant extension of high-grade mineralization at the O’Brien Project at depth. We have successfully intersected the down plunge extension of one of the principal high-grade gold trends at O’Brien. The 6-metre core interval of almost an ounce per tonne gold in OB-24-324, well mineralized throughout and with extensive visible gold, was achieved in the location predicted by our deposit model at a vertical depth of approximately 1,100 metres, a full 170 metres below previous drilling. For context, approximately 75% of our existing Mineral Resource is defined at depths above 600 metres. The two other deep holes reported today also intersected vein mineralization within alteration zones at the same depth, confirming the lateral continuity of the O’Brien mineralizing system generally and with noteworthy high-grade intercepts in OB-24-322 in particular. Taken together, this deep drilling is demonstrating the significant upside potential of the Project below the existing Mineral Resource. Two rigs are currently active, one targeting shallower targets within the existing Mineral Resource model, and one continuing to target deeper, down-plunge step-outs. We will be reporting additional drill results as they become available.” Figure 1: Long Section and Plan View of Gold Vein Mineralization and Mineral Resources at the O’Brien Gold Project, with DDH OB-24-321, 322 and 324 illustrated. Gold Mineralization at O’Brien Gold mineralizing quartz-sulphide veins at O’Brien occur within a thin band of interlayered mafic volcanic rocks, conglomerates, and porphyric andesitic sills of the Piché Group occurring adjacent to the east-west oriented Larder Lake-Cadillac Break (“LLCB”). Gold, along with pyrite and arsenopyrite, is typically associated with shearing and a pervasive biotite alteration, and developed within multiple Piché Group lithologies and, occasionally, the hanging-wall Pontiac meta-sedimentary rocks. As mapped at the Historic O’Brien mine, and now replicated in the modern drilling, individual veins are generally narrow, ranging from several centimetres up to several metres in thickness. Multiple veins occur sub-parallel to each other, as well as sub-parallel to the Piché lithologies and the LLCB. Individual veins have well-established lateral continuity, with near-vertical, high-grade shoots developed over significant lengths. The historic O’Brien mine produced over half a million ounces of gold from such veins and shoots at an average grade exceeding 15 g/t and over a vertical extent of at least 1,000 metres. Based on the modern drilling, the Project has estimated Indicated Mineral Resources of 0.50 million ounces (1.52 million tonnes at 10.26 g/t Au), with additional Inferred Mineral Resources of 0.45 million ounces (1.62 million tonnes at 8.64 g/t Au). Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Current exploration is focussed on delineating well developed vein mineralization to the east of the historic mine, with additional high-grade shoots becoming evident in the exploration data over what has been described as a series of repeating trends (“Trends 0 to 5”, Table 1 and Figures 1 and 2). Table 1: Summary Assay Results from DDH OB-24-321, 322 and 324 Notes on Calculation of Drill InterceptsThe O’Brien Gold Project March 2023 Mineral Resource Estimate (“MRE”) utilizes a 4.50 g/t Au bottom cutoff, a US$1600 gold price, a minimum mining width of 1.2 metres, and a 40 g/t Au upper cap on composites. Intercepts presented in Table 1 are calculated with a 3.00 g/t Au bottom cut-off, representing the lower limit of cut-off sensitivity presented in the March 2023 MRE. This methodology differs from previous Radisson disclosure, and intercepts reported in this release may not be directly comparable to historical published intercepts. Sample grades are uncapped. True widths, based on depth of intercept and drill hole inclination, are estimated to be 40-80% of core length. Table 2 presents additional drill intercepts calculated with a 1.00 g/t bottom cut-off over a minimum 1.0 metre core length so as to illustrate the frequency and continuity of mineralized intervals within which high-grade gold veins at O’Brien are developed. Drill Hole OB-24-321 did not return any intercepts averaging above 3.00 g/t Au based on unofficial assays received to date (official assay certificates for three samples in OB-24-321, covering the interval italicised in Table 2, are pending). Lithology Codes: PON-S3: Pontiac Sediments; V3-S, V3-N, V3-CEN: Basalt-South, North, Central; S1P: Piché conglomerate; S3P: Piché sediments; POR-S, POR-N: Porphyry South, North. Today’s Drill Results Today’s results are from three drill holes over 3,660 metres in Trend 1. Visible gold was observed in each hole. Holes were drilled on northerly declinations at initial inclinations of between -77 and -85 degrees, providing a high angle of incidence with the southerly dip of the Piché Group rocks and the vein mineralization. Estimated true widths of drill intercepts at the point of contact with mineralization is estimated to be between 40 and 80% of core length.

On Tuesday, Truist Securities adjusted its stance on Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), moving from a Buy rating to Hold. The firm has set a price target for Costco at $873.00. The downgrade reflects a cautious view on the stock's current valuation despite the company's strong market position and its success in gaining market share across various retail segments. According to Truist Securities, Costco has established significant barriers to entry in the retail sector and continues to exhibit robust business performance. "However, some changes like the shift towards scanning IDs on entry and packaging changes to their chickens could add some sls headwinds, key catalysts are in the rearview mirror and the stock's valuation leaves little room for error," said Truist analysts in a note to cients. Additionally, Truist Securities notes that while Costco's stock has seen substantial growth, increasing by approximately 60% over the past 12 months compared to the S&P 500's 30% gain, the stock is now trading at around 54 times forward twelve-month earnings per share (EPS), which is considered a multi-decade high. The analysts from Truist Securities stated, "The business remains strong, it is gaining share vs. virtually all classes of trade and likely has the highest barriers to entry in all of retail, in our view." Despite this, the firm suggests that the major catalysts for Costco's stock performance have already occurred. In other recent news, Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST) has made significant updates to its bylaws, introducing a cure process for shareholder director nominations. This move is part of a larger effort to refine the company's corporate governance practices and enhance communication with shareholders. Costco has seen considerable analyst activity and strong sales growth. Redburn-Atlantic revised its rating from "Buy" to "Neutral," citing concerns over the stock's valuation, despite raising the price target to $890. Oppenheimer, Stifel, and Baird maintained positive ratings, with Oppenheimer and Stifel raising their price targets to $955 and $915 respectively, due to robust sales growth and positive earnings estimates. Costco reported a 6.7% rise in U.S. comparable sales and a significant 23.3% growth in consolidated e-commerce sales. The company's non-foods category experienced a low double-digit increase, contributing to the robust performance. Baird maintained an Outperform rating with a consistent price target of $975, emphasizing Costco's steady global core comparable sales and a slight increase in its fourth-quarter earnings per share forecast. As investors digest the cautious stance from Truist Securities on Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), a glance at the real-time data from InvestingPro provides additional context for the stock's current valuation. Costco holds a significant market capitalization of $406.57 billion, with a high Price/Earnings (P/E) ratio of 56.7, which aligns with Truist's concerns about the stock trading at a multi-decade high earnings multiple. Despite the high valuation, Costco's revenue growth remains robust, with a 7.75% increase over the last twelve months as of Q3 2024. From an operational standpoint, Costco's gross profit margin stands at 12.5%, a figure that may raise some eyebrows considering the InvestingPro Tip that highlights the company's weak gross profit margins. However, investors might find solace in the company's ability to maintain dividend payments for 21 consecutive years, coupled with a strong return over the last year, which could signal a continued commitment to shareholder returns despite the high valuation metrics. For those seeking more detailed analysis, InvestingPro offers additional tips, including insights on Costco's cash flow capabilities and its position within the Consumer Staples Distribution & Retail industry.

Title: 3 reasons why investors should remain bullish on Apple stock: Needham
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/3-reasons-why-investors-should-remain-bullish-on-apple-stock-needham-3629316

Investing.com -- Needham & Company analysts provided three key reasons why investors should remain bullish on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock despite concerns about its dependence on the iPhone. The firm maintained a Buy rating on the stock in a note Tuesday, with a target price of $260 per share, representing a 16% upside. A Liquid Stock During Uncertainty: The analysts note that while competitors like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta (NASDAQ:META) are heavily investing in generative AI (GenAI) infrastructure with no immediate revenue boost, Apple stands out as a stable and liquid stock. In a volatile market, they argue that investors need a reliable stock to "hide in" during 2025, making Apple an attractive option. Share Repurchases Driving EPS Growth: Needham says Apple is actively reducing its equity base through share buybacks, which is expected to drive earnings per share (EPS) growth. The company's $110 billion share repurchase authorization from May 2024 is projected to lead to 11% EPS growth in fiscal year 2025 and 12% in 2026, according to Needham estimates. This continued buyback strategy is expected to support the bullish outlook for Apple. Strong Cash Position Enables Further Buybacks: Needham believes Apple's commitment to achieving "net cash zero" from its current net cash position of about $50 billion, along with $91 billion in cash from operations reported in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, suggests accelerated share repurchases in the near future. This financial strategy is expected to further enhance shareholder returns. Despite concerns about Apple's reliance on the iPhone and its slower pace of GenAI adoption compared to peers, Needham & Company believes Apple's financial discipline and stock buyback strategy make it a strong investment opportunity.

Title: A Rebound To $200 For Roku Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/09/24/a-rebound-to-200-for-roku-stock/
Time Published: 2024-09-24T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA - NOVEMBER 18: Roku's company logo is seen in front of Roku headquarters on ... [+] November 18, 2022 in San Jose, California. Roku announced plans to lay off 200 employees in the United States, or nearly 7 percent of its workforce. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Roku stock (NASDAQ: ROKU), a company that sells streaming media players, digital content, and advertising, has seen its stock decline by close to 17% this year, trading at levels of about $76 per share. This compares to Netflix stock, (NASDAQ: NFLX), which has gained about 44% over the same period. Roku has been weighed down by a mixed advertising market and slowing growth of its platform business. Roku stock currently trades at just about 2.8x forward revenues and 3.2x trailing revenues. Roku remains in the red, with profits likely to remain elusive this year. Does this make the stock expensive? Probably not. In fact, we think Roku stock has the potential to rise close to 3x in the next few years. Now the decrease in ROKU stock over the last 3-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were -31% in 2021, -82% in 2022, and 125% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. But how could Roku possibly regain its footing and rise again? Let’s delve into the company’s revenue prospects to begin with. Roku’s revenue growth is expected to remain modest this year, rising by about 14%, from $3.5 billion in 2023 to $4 billion in 2024. This reflects challenges in the digital advertising market and a shift toward more affordable streaming plans, which has impacted Roku’s platform revenue. However, growth could accelerate to around 25% between 2024 and 2027, touching $7 billion levels. So why the potential rebound in revenue growth? Roku’s platform monetization could improve significantly. Engagement on Roku devices has remained strong, with total streaming hours up 20% in the latest quarter. The Roku Channel, its proprietary streaming service, has also seen a 75% year-over-year jump in streaming hours, becoming one of the leading free, ad-supported platforms in the U.S. This channel is poised to boost higher-margin advertising revenue. Additionally, Roku has been enhancing its ad capabilities by partnering with major ad-tech players like The Trade Desk, enabling more precise targeting and optimization. Additionally, with the recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, U.S. consumer spending could pick up and this could drive a revival in their advertising expenditure in the coming quarters, thus helping Roku’s top line. Roku Could Turn Profitable Roku has been continuously loss-making in recent years, and the company is looking to cut costs aggressively. Over the first six months of this year, the company’s operating costs fell by about 10% driven by workforce and office space reductions in 2023. Roku is also generating more cash. Free cash flow stood at over $300 million for the trailing 12 months. As the company’s past investments in R&D and product development start paying off and as Roku’s business gains scale, it can boost margins meaningfully. For perspective, other companies in the advertising and media space such as the Trade Desk and Netflix had net margins of approximately 10% to 18% respectively, in recent quarters. If we assume that Roku can boost margins to about 10%, and factor in our revenue projections of roughly $7 billion by 2027, a net income of $700 million is possible by 2027. Roku’s Multiple Could Expand Now if Roku’s revenues grow 2x by 2027, the P/S multiple will shrink to half of its current level, assuming the stock price stays the same, correct? But that’s exactly what Roku investors are betting will not happen! If revenues expand 2x over the next few years, instead of the P/S shrinking from around 3x presently to less than 1.5x, a scenario where the P/S actually rises is possible. Why? Netflix trades at a P/S of about 8x, while The Trade Desk trades at about 20x. Moreover, Roku stock itself traded at levels of over 30x revenue during the Covid-19 pandemic. Now if we assume that Roku’s P/S multiple expands to about 5x, considering higher revenue growth and profitability, this would mean that revenue would grow about 2x, while the P/S multiple would rise by about 1.66x. This in turn could 3x the stock from levels of about $76 presently to over $220. What about the time horizon for this positive-return scenario? While our example illustrates this for a 2027 timeline, in practice, it won’t make much difference whether it takes two years or four. If the turnaround takes hold, we could see meaningful gains in the stock. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession?

Title: Bernard Arnault plummets down the list of world’s richest men after a $54 billion collapse

“As long as I’m not the richest man in the world, I won’t really be happy,” Bernard Arnault once said. The day has come. Arnault, the founder and CEO of luxury goods conglomerate LVMH, went from being the richest person in the world to the fifth-most after a 20% drop in his company’s stock price, resulting in a $54 billion cut of his net worth. Arnault, who oversees dozens of prestigious brands including Moët Hennessy, Louis Vuitton, Dior, Givenchy, and Fendi, was worth an estimated $231 billion in late March, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That placed him ahead of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. As of Monday, Arnault was worth an estimated $177 billion. Now, Arnault ranks lower than each of those executives, plus Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison. In the past year, LVMH stock has dropped over 16%, and is currently trading at about $132 per share; Arnault owns about 48% of the luxury conglomerate. Since the start of 2024, Arnault’s net worth is down $30 billion, making him the biggest loser on the list year-to-date. LVMH did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment. During the first half of 2024, LVMH reported a modest dip in revenues, but its wine and spirits divisions fared even worse. “Maybe the current global situation, be it geopolitical or macroeconomic, doesn’t lead people to cheer up and open bottles of champagne,” Jean-Jacques Guiony, LVMH’s chief financial officer, said during the company’s earnings call in late July. “I don’t really know. The matter of fact is, is that our volumes are down double digits.” But it’s not just LVMH that’s had a tough time in today’s market. Other major luxury brands and holding houses have reported losses this year. In fact, luxury revenues were flat during Q2 2024, the slowest growth in 15 quarters, according to a Bank of America note about luxury goods released Monday. Demand deteriorated during July, and August and September have also slowed. Michael Kors, housed under Capri Holdings, saw its first quarter revenue drop more than 14% year-over-year, according to Capri’s first quarter fiscal 2025 results posted Aug. 8. “Sometimes you’ll be the hottest thing on the block,” Michael Kors said in his testimony during an $8.5 billion antitrust trial involving Capri Holdings and Tapestry. “Sometimes you’ll be lukewarm. Sometimes you’ll be cold.” While Arnault has lost a tremendous amount of wealth this year as the result of the struggling luxury market, with a net worth of $177 billion, he’s still wealthier than former Microsoft CEOs Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer, as well as Warren Buffett, Michael Dell, and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. Plus, Arnault has stayed active in investing this year. His family office has invested in five AI-focused startups this year amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars. Plus, in July, he joined the chase to acquire Venice’s iconic Hotel Bauer for $305 million—but got outbid. Arnault, 75, isn’t ready to leave his post: He forced his board to extend the retirement age for its chairman and CEO from 75 to 80 so he could stay longer. But he received a letter from 93-year-old Warren Buffett saying he should’ve made the age limit higher, according to Bloomberg. Still, Arnault says he’s working 12-hour days. “Every morning I have fun when I arrive,” Arnault told Bloomberg. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Fidelity's FBTC leads $4.5 million Bitcoin ETF inflow amidst mixed fund movements. On Sep. 23, Bitcoin ETFs saw mixed flows, totaling $4.5 million. Fidelity’s FBTC ETF led inflows with $24.9 million, followed by BlackRock’s IBIT with $11.5 million. Grayscale’s smaller BTC fund also added $8.4 million. However, this was offset by significant outflows of $40.3 million from Grayscale’s GBTC, which remains one of the largest Bitcoin ETFs in the market. Other major funds, including Bitwise’s BITB, Ark’s ARKB, Invesco’s BTCO, and others, showed no activity, with flows remaining flat. Ethereum ETFs experienced substantial net outflows, totaling a negative $79.3 million. Grayscale’s ETHE fund drove the bulk of the movement with significant outflows of $80.6 million, marking a sharp shift in investor sentiment. Bitwise’s ETHW was the only fund with inflows, recording $1.3 million, while all other Ethereum ETFs, including those from BlackRock, Fidelity, 21Shares, VanEck, Invesco, and Franklin, reported no inflows or outflows. The contrasting flows spotlight ongoing volatility and selective investor participation. Bitcoin ETFs saw pockets of demand, while Ethereum ETFs, particularly Grayscale’s, faced pronounced withdrawals. Also known as "Akiba," Liam is a reporter, editor and podcast producer at CryptoSlate.

Title: Kazakhstan Says Second-Largest Lender Is Compliant With Sanctions Despite Critical Report
URL: https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/kazakh/2024/kazakh-240923-rferl01.htm
Time Published: 2024-09-24T07:10:40Z

By Chris Rickleton September 23, 2024 ALMATY -- Kazakhstan has defended the country's second-largest lender as being "fully" compliant with sanctions against Russia after a scathing report saw around 20 percent wiped off the Nasdaq-listed Kaspi.kz's stock price. A September 19 report published by Culper Research poured doubt on the claim by fintech giant Kaspi that it lacks exposure to sanctions-struck Russia and raised concerns about the group's past affiliations to a relative of former President Nursultan Nazarbaev who was convicted by a Kazakh court of major embezzlement in 2022. In a September 19 statement, Kaspi.kz called Culper's report "misleading" and "inaccurate." The report, Kaspi.kz (KSPI): The NASDAQ-Listed Fintech Moving Money For Criminals And Kleptocrats, focused on Kaspi.kz's issuance of bank cards to Russians, tens of thousands of whom arrived in Kazakhstan in the wake of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. "As the U.S. and other nations continue to broaden sanctions against those found to be aiding Russia's wartime economy, we believe Kaspi now risks secondary sanctions," the report warned, justifying its "short" position on the company. Kaspi.kz is widely viewed as a success story in Kazakhstan, going from a relatively obscure bank to the country's leader in mobile payments and online marketplace services in some 20 years. In a September 23 statement, Kazakhstan's Agency for Regulation and Development of Financial Markets called Kaspi "one of the country's systemically important and steadily developing banks, demonstrating sustainable growth and a high level of transparency." "The bank fully complies with the sanctions regime of the U.S., the European Union, and other foreign countries," the agency said, referring to the sanctions imposed on Russia over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The main shareholders in Kaspi.kz are Kazakh billionaire Vyacheslav Kim, Georgia-born Mikhail Lomtadze, and Baring Funds, part of a Commonwealth of Independent States-focused private equity investor. Kaspi.kz listed in 2020 on the London Stock Exchange to become the its largest international tech public offering that year. In January it joined the Nasdaq in an initial public offering that saw the business valued at $17.5 billion. "Being the first company from Kazakhstan to successfully list on Nasdaq has obviously raised our profile amongst short sellers," Kaspi.kz said in its statement. Nazarbaev's nephew, Kairat Satybaldy, who once held a stake of around 30 percent in Kaspi, exited the company prior to the successful listings. In August, Lomtadze, who is CEO of Kaspi.kz, declared the company's intention to compete in the forthcoming privatization of Humo, neighboring Uzbekistan's state-backed payment system. In May, Lomtadze was revealed as the new owner of Wycombe Wanderers, a third-tier English soccer club.

Title: Amazon, ExxonMobil, Meta, Tesla, Others Labeled ‘Underminers of Democracy’

Time Published: 2024-09-24T03:47:04Z
Full Content:
A report by the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) is calling out some of the world’s biggest companies, saying they undermine democracy worldwide. The ITUC says its mission is “the promotion and defence of workers’ rights and interests, through international cooperation between trade unions, global campaigning and advocacy within the major global institutions.” Tune in: How Major U.S. Firms Got Branded as Undermining Democracy! The ITUC has published a list calling out the top seven “emblematic companies that benefit financially by continuing to violate trade union and human rights, monopolise media and technology, exacerbate climate catastrophe, and privatise public services. They represent a wider corporate world that protects and expands its own profits by undermining democracy.” The list includes: The organization then goes on to describe why each company made it on to the list. ITUC calls out Amazon for its repeated privacy violations, worker endangerment, and opposition to labor laws. The world’s largest online retailer and cloud computing service, and its fifth-largest employer, there is no industry or community Amazon and its subsidiaries have not adversely impacted. The company has become notorious for its union busting and low wages on multiple continents, monopoly in e-commerce, egregious carbon emissions through its AWS data centres, corporate tax evasion, and lobbying at national and international level. In the United States alone, where Amazon’s worker injury rate is twice as high as similar companies, the company has racked up more than US$250 million in fines for privacy, occupational health and safety, wage, and environmental violation cases filed by workers across sectors. Attempts to hold Amazon accountable to labour rights have led the company to challenge the constitutionality of the National Labor Relations Board in the U.S. In Canada, the company is trying to overturn provincial labour law. In Europe, Amazon was barred this year from lobbying within the European Parliament for its refusal to attend hearings on violations of worker rights in its warehouses, becoming only the second company in history to face such a sanction. Its refusal to negotiate with unions in Germany has resulted in a decade of strikes. In India, the company has admitted to breaching workplace safety standards in its warehouses. Blackstone Group makes the list for opposition to violations of consumer protection laws, violating employment laws, employing child labor, and harming the environment, including deforestation of the Amazon. Blackstone is well-known by climate justice advocates for its role in the rapid deforestation of the Amazon rainforest and huge investments in fossil fuel projects. In the UK, Blackstone reaped huge profits while saddling one of the country’s largest long-term care providers with insurmountable debt. Blackstone infamously profited from housing market speculation after the 2008 financial crisis and aggressively evicted workers after the Covid-19 pandemic. Blackstone and its subsidiaries have been penalised for competition, contracting, employment, financial and consumer protection violations to the tune of nearly US$300 million in one country alone. It was also the face of child labour in meatpacking, is known for its exorbitant fees to manage worker pensions, and has so far failed to sign up to a coalition-designed Private Equity Labor Rights Platform. In Brazil, it has been criticised for helping to privatise public infrastructure and corporatise agricultural land. Blackstone seems to believe that it – not voters – should determine public policy. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on housing has accused Blackstone of, “using its significant resources and political leverage to undermine domestic laws and policies that would in fact improve access to adequate housing.” ExxonMobil’s inclusion on the list should come as a surprise to no one, given the company’s long history of hiding its finding about the impact of fossil fuels on the environment. Perhaps the greatest example of Exxon’s disinterest in democratic deliberation was its corporate commitment of nearly four decades to conceal from the public its own internal evidence that climate change was real, accelerating, and driven by fossil fuel use while simultaneously financing far-right think tanks in the US and Europe to inject climate scepticism and denialism into the public discourse. While it altered its public position on climate change years ago, Exxon continues to lobby against meaningful climate policy and still promotes fossil fuel and plastics use to the detriment of communities around the world. It benefits from another entry on our list, Meta, by spreading right-wing propaganda in favour of fossil fuels. It finances the Republican Attorneys General Association, which has led efforts to pressure the US Supreme Court to throw out climate change lawsuits seeking damages from Exxon and its competitors. Glencore has a track record of flaunting the law, pleading guilty to various charges in a number of countries. The largest trader of commodities and the largest mining company in the world by revenue, Glencore controls or produces huge portions of the global supply of coal, zinc, cobalt, and other minerals, metals, fuels and foods. The company’s undermining of democracy is not in dispute, as it has in recent years pled guilty to committing bribery, corruption, and market manipulation in countries as varied as Venezuela, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Cote d’Ivoire, Nigeria, and South Sudan. The scale of Glencore’s global lobbying lays bare the organisational conviction that it, rather than the voting public, should determine policy. While it publicly shows itself to support measures such as the Paris Agreement and the UN Sustainable Development Goals, for years it has made use of right-wing consultants to spend “millions bankrolling a secret, globally coordinated campaign to prop up coal demand by undermining environmental activists, influencing politicians and spreading sophisticated pro-coal messaging on social media.” This self-serving posture is also exhibited in its efforts to undermine popular climate policy in the European Union, the United States, and South Africa. Meta’s role in politics and its ability to influence people, including its users falling victim to misinformation, has long made the company the target of critics and led to its inclusion on the list. The world’s largest social media company, Meta is the parent of Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Threads, and Messenger. Combined, these products have nearly four billion users – the same number of people estimated to be voting worldwide in 2024. The company’s scale, and its corporate behaviour, have led some to call it “a foreign state, populated by people without sovereignty, ruled by a leader with absolute power.” Meta’s algorithms can quite literally alter humanity’s perceptions of reality. Its revenue model exploits trillions of personalised data points to deliver highly effective advertising to its users. That has made it a perfect target for data breaches seized on by authoritarians and an ideal vessel for right-wing political parties to spread propaganda around the world. Violent, far-right militias in the US use Facebook to recruit new members. In Germany, the far-right AfD used Facebook to stoke anti-immigrant hatred and position itself for unprecedented success in June’s European parliamentary elections. While Tesla may be the world’s leading EV maker, that standing has come at the expense of workers rights, with the company engaging in a long history of combating unionization efforts. In Germany, Sweden, and the US, Tesla has aggressively violated the right to organise, refused to engage in collective bargaining, and provoked unprecedented strike action for its subversion of social dialogue, a pillar of industrial democracy in many European economies. Tesla’s hostility toward unions earned it a place on a list of Worst Union-Busters of 2023. Tesla’s factories have “reported ten times more safety violations than Nissan … despite the fact that Nissan built almost ten times as many cars over the same period.” But Tesla does not limit its efforts to weaken democratic norms in highly industrialised economies. Its supply chain relies on nickel mining companies that undermine consultation standards with local Indonesian communities and are deforesting so rapidly that flooding and water pollution threaten neighbourhoods. The company’s supply chain relies on another corporation on our list, Glencore, to mine copper and cobalt in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where child labour has allegedly been employed. The Vanguard Group makes the list for concentrating its power to such a degree that even its founder was worried about where the company was headed. One of the “Big Four” institutional investors in the world alongside BlackRock, Fidelity, and State Street, Vanguard’s holdings put it “into an extreme position of power” at many of the companies it funds and makes it “the voice that matters most among investors.” This concentration of power troubled even Vanguard’s late founder, John Bogle, who wrote in 2018 that “If historical trends continue, a handful of giant institutional investors will one day hold voting control of virtually every large US corporation.” Despite holding billions of dollars in worker money, Vanguard recently abandoned one of its most public commitments to environmental and social governance. After signing on to the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative in 2021, it left in 2022, bowing to pressure from its far-right friends and provoking a backlash from more than 1,000 of its more climate-friendly clients. The ITUC’s list, and the cases it makes, is a damning indictment of the included companies. The ITUC minces no words in calling out the seven companies for their actions. These companies deploy complex lobbying operations to undermine popular will and disrupt existing or nascent global policy that could hold them accountable. They are invariably led by ultra-wealthy individuals that support and finance far-right politicians and parties to further their own interests. When the far-right wins power, it discredits and defunds democratic global institutions; reduces taxes on the wealthy and on corporations; undercuts living wages; favours bilateral aid financing over multilateralism; and cracks down on human, trade union, and democratic rights, as evidenced by the ITUC’s Global Rights Index. If more organizations continue to shine a spotlight on the actions of the companies on the list, public perception could eventually force them to change how they do business.

They represent a wider corporate world that protects and expands its own profits by undermining democracy.” The list includes: The organization then goes on to describe why each company made it on to the list. ITUC calls out Amazon for its repeated privacy violations, worker endangerment, and opposition to labor laws. The world’s largest online retailer and cloud computing service, and its fifth-largest employer, there is no industry or community Amazon and its subsidiaries have not adversely impacted. The company has become notorious for its union busting and low wages on multiple continents, monopoly in e-commerce, egregious carbon emissions through its AWS data centres, corporate tax evasion, and lobbying at national and international level. In the United States alone, where Amazon’s worker injury rate is twice as high as similar companies, the company has racked up more than US$250 million in fines for privacy, occupational health and safety, wage, and environmental violation cases filed by workers across sectors. Attempts to hold Amazon accountable to labour rights have led the company to challenge the constitutionality of the National Labor Relations Board in the U.S. In Canada, the company is trying to overturn provincial labour law. In Europe, Amazon was barred this year from lobbying within the European Parliament for its refusal to attend hearings on violations of worker rights in its warehouses, becoming only the second company in history to face such a sanction. Its refusal to negotiate with unions in Germany has resulted in a decade of strikes. In India, the company has admitted to breaching workplace safety standards in its warehouses. Blackstone Group makes the list for opposition to violations of consumer protection laws, violating employment laws, employing child labor, and harming the environment, including deforestation of the Amazon. Blackstone is well-known by climate justice advocates for its role in the rapid deforestation of the Amazon rainforest and huge investments in fossil fuel projects. In the UK, Blackstone reaped huge profits while saddling one of the country’s largest long-term care providers with insurmountable debt. Blackstone infamously profited from housing market speculation after the 2008 financial crisis and aggressively evicted workers after the Covid-19 pandemic. Blackstone and its subsidiaries have been penalised for competition, contracting, employment, financial and consumer protection violations to the tune of nearly US$300 million in one country alone. It was also the face of child labour in meatpacking, is known for its exorbitant fees to manage worker pensions, and has so far failed to sign up to a coalition-designed Private Equity Labor Rights Platform. In Brazil, it has been criticised for helping to privatise public infrastructure and corporatise agricultural land. Blackstone seems to believe that it – not voters – should determine public policy. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on housing has accused Blackstone of, “using its significant resources and political leverage to undermine domestic laws and policies that would in fact improve access to adequate housing.” ExxonMobil’s inclusion on the list should come as a surprise to no one, given the company’s long history of hiding its finding about the impact of fossil fuels on the environment. Perhaps the greatest example of Exxon’s disinterest in democratic deliberation was its corporate commitment of nearly four decades to conceal from the public its own internal evidence that climate change was real, accelerating, and driven by fossil fuel use while simultaneously financing far-right think tanks in the US and Europe to inject climate scepticism and denialism into the public discourse. While it altered its public position on climate change years ago, Exxon continues to lobby against meaningful climate policy and still promotes fossil fuel and plastics use to the detriment of communities around the world. It benefits from another entry on our list, Meta, by spreading right-wing propaganda in favour of fossil fuels. It finances the Republican Attorneys General Association, which has led efforts to pressure the US Supreme Court to throw out climate change lawsuits seeking damages from Exxon and its competitors. Glencore has a track record of flaunting the law, pleading guilty to various charges in a number of countries. The largest trader of commodities and the largest mining company in the world by revenue, Glencore controls or produces huge portions of the global supply of coal, zinc, cobalt, and other minerals, metals, fuels and foods. The company’s undermining of democracy is not in dispute, as it has in recent years pled guilty to committing bribery, corruption, and market manipulation in countries as varied as Venezuela, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Cote d’Ivoire, Nigeria, and South Sudan. The scale of Glencore’s global lobbying lays bare the organisational conviction that it, rather than the voting public, should determine policy. While it publicly shows itself to support measures such as the Paris Agreement and the UN Sustainable Development Goals, for years it has made use of right-wing consultants to spend “millions bankrolling a secret, globally coordinated campaign to prop up coal demand by undermining environmental activists, influencing politicians and spreading sophisticated pro-coal messaging on social media.” This self-serving posture is also exhibited in its efforts to undermine popular climate policy in the European Union, the United States, and South Africa. Meta’s role in politics and its ability to influence people, including its users falling victim to misinformation, has long made the company the target of critics and led to its inclusion on the list. The world’s largest social media company, Meta is the parent of Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Threads, and Messenger. Combined, these products have nearly four billion users – the same number of people estimated to be voting worldwide in 2024. The company’s scale, and its corporate behaviour, have led some to call it “a foreign state, populated by people without sovereignty, ruled by a leader with absolute power.” Meta’s algorithms can quite literally alter humanity’s perceptions of reality. Its revenue model exploits trillions of personalised data points to deliver highly effective advertising to its users. That has made it a perfect target for data breaches seized on by authoritarians and an ideal vessel for right-wing political parties to spread propaganda around the world. Violent, far-right militias in the US use Facebook to recruit new members. In Germany, the far-right AfD used Facebook to stoke anti-immigrant hatred and position itself for unprecedented success in June’s European parliamentary elections. While Tesla may be the world’s leading EV maker, that standing has come at the expense of workers rights, with the company engaging in a long history of combating unionization efforts. In Germany, Sweden, and the US, Tesla has aggressively violated the right to organise, refused to engage in collective bargaining, and provoked unprecedented strike action for its subversion of social dialogue, a pillar of industrial democracy in many European economies. Tesla’s hostility toward unions earned it a place on a list of Worst Union-Busters of 2023. Tesla’s factories have “reported ten times more safety violations than Nissan … despite the fact that Nissan built almost ten times as many cars over the same period.” But Tesla does not limit its efforts to weaken democratic norms in highly industrialised economies. Its supply chain relies on nickel mining companies that undermine consultation standards with local Indonesian communities and are deforesting so rapidly that flooding and water pollution threaten neighbourhoods. The company’s supply chain relies on another corporation on our list, Glencore, to mine copper and cobalt in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where child labour has allegedly been employed. The Vanguard Group makes the list for concentrating its power to such a degree that even its founder was worried about where the company was headed. One of the “Big Four” institutional investors in the world alongside BlackRock, Fidelity, and State Street, Vanguard’s holdings put it “into an extreme position of power” at many of the companies it funds and makes it “the voice that matters most among investors.” This concentration of power troubled even Vanguard’s late founder, John Bogle, who wrote in 2018 that “If historical trends continue, a handful of giant institutional investors will one day hold voting control of virtually every large US corporation.” Despite holding billions of dollars in worker money, Vanguard recently abandoned one of its most public commitments to environmental and social governance. After signing on to the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative in 2021, it left in 2022, bowing to pressure from its far-right friends and provoking a backlash from more than 1,000 of its more climate-friendly clients. The ITUC’s list, and the cases it makes, is a damning indictment of the included companies. The ITUC minces no words in calling out the seven companies for their actions. These companies deploy complex lobbying operations to undermine popular will and disrupt existing or nascent global policy that could hold them accountable. They are invariably led by ultra-wealthy individuals that support and finance far-right politicians and parties to further their own interests. When the far-right wins power, it discredits and defunds democratic global institutions; reduces taxes on the wealthy and on corporations; undercuts living wages; favours bilateral aid financing over multilateralism; and cracks down on human, trade union, and democratic rights, as evidenced by the ITUC’s Global Rights Index. If more organizations continue to shine a spotlight on the actions of the companies on the list, public perception could eventually force them to change how they do business.

A report by the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) is calling out some of the world’s biggest companies, saying they undermine democracy worldwide. The ITUC says its mission is “the promotion and defence of workers’ rights and interests, through international cooperation between trade unions, global campaigning and advocacy within the major global institutions.” Tune in: How Major U.S. Firms Got Branded as Undermining Democracy! The ITUC has published a list calling out the top seven “emblematic companies that benefit financially by continuing to violate trade union and human rights, monopolise media and technology, exacerbate climate catastrophe, and privatise public services. They represent a wider corporate world that protects and expands its own profits by undermining democracy.” The list includes: The organization then goes on to describe why each company made it on to the list. ITUC calls out Amazon for its repeated privacy violations, worker endangerment, and opposition to labor laws. The world’s largest online retailer and cloud computing service, and its fifth-largest employer, there is no industry or community Amazon and its subsidiaries have not adversely impacted. The company has become notorious for its union busting and low wages on multiple continents, monopoly in e-commerce, egregious carbon emissions through its AWS data centres, corporate tax evasion, and lobbying at national and international level. In the United States alone, where Amazon’s worker injury rate is twice as high as similar companies, the company has racked up more than US$250 million in fines for privacy, occupational health and safety, wage, and environmental violation cases filed by workers across sectors. Attempts to hold Amazon accountable to labour rights have led the company to challenge the constitutionality of the National Labor Relations Board in the U.S. In Canada, the company is trying to overturn provincial labour law. In Europe, Amazon was barred this year from lobbying within the European Parliament for its refusal to attend hearings on violations of worker rights in its warehouses, becoming only the second company in history to face such a sanction.

Lifestyle by Blaze Media The only 'opportunity economy' the veep represents is the one letting Big Finance keep gutting the middle class. Kamala Harris is not a comedian, but you could be forgiven for thinking otherwise. During the recent presidential debate, the tireless TikToker somehow managed to maintain a straight face while pledging to create an "opportunity economy" for the middle class. Yet, this promise rings hollow when both she and President Biden are deeply entangled with BlackRock, a firm notorious for crushing the very group she claims to uplift. BlackRock’s CEO, Larry Fink, openly praises the efficiency of totalitarian regimes; what does this say about where the firm’s loyalties lie? In short, BlackRock has used its vast financial influence to sway political decisions, control market outcomes, and prioritize profits over the interests of everyday people. It's the puppet master behind the scenes, shaping policies that favor the elite while leaving the middle class to foot the bill. Harris' cozy relationship with BlackRock exposes her "opportunity economy" as nothing more than a smokescreen for serving the powerful. The facts speak for themselves. Harris' two top economic advisers, Michael Pyle and Brian Deese, were key players at BlackRock. Both weredrafted last month, likely to help her craft policies in anticipation of a potential presidency. As for Joe Biden, since taking office, he has surrounded himself with former BlackRock executives, embedding the financial giant's influence at the highest levels of government. Take Michael Pyle, once BlackRock’s global chief investment strategist, who recently served as U.S. deputy national security adviser for international economics. In this critical role, Pyle directed the administration's international economic policy and acted as Biden’s key representative, or “sherpa,” at the G7 and G20 summits. His sway over global economic strategy was significant. Before this, Pyle helped shape domestic policy as Harris’ chief economic adviser during the administration's disastrous first year. His deep ties to BlackRock underscore the firm’s growing grip on the Biden administration's decision-making, further aligning government policy with Wall Street’s interests. Last week BlackRock announced that it was rehiring Pyle as deputy head of it's $3.2 trillion portfolio management group. And let’s not forget Adewale "Wally" Adeyemo, another key player in the Biden administration. Currently serving as deputy secretary of the treasury, the 43-year-old was once Larry Fink'sright-hand man at BlackRock. During his time at the investment giant, Adeyemo acted as a senior adviser and led the firm's public policy team, directly shaping BlackRock’s strategy in navigating government relations and regulatory frameworks. His current role places him in a powerful position to influence U.S. financial policy. Then there's Eric Van Nostrand, a former BlackRock executive now serving as a senior adviser under Biden on economic issues related to Russia and Ukraine,as reported by Bloomberg. Since Van Nostrand’s appointment, BlackRock’s interest and involvement in Ukraine have suspiciously intensified, with the firm advising on reconstruction efforts and channeling investment into critical sectors. BlackRock's history suggests this support is far from altruistic. The firm has a notorious track record of capitalizing on geopolitical crises for financial gain, rather than genuinely aiding nations in need. Much like itsexploitative role during the 2008 financial crisis, when BlackRock profited from the collapse it helped precipitate, the firm now stands to benefit from Ukraine’s instability. Its influence over Kyiv’s policies, including the deregulation of urban planning, paves the way for corporate interests to exploit a rather dire situation. It doesn’t stop at Ukraine. BlackRock isn’t just funding the destabilization of democracies abroad — it’s actively helping China, a regime that poses an existential threat to American interests. The Coalition for a Prosperous America has revealed how BlackRock funnels billions into Chinese companies, many linked to the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army. This raises alarming questions about national security and America’s economic sovereignty. BlackRock’s CEO, Larry Fink, openly praises the efficiency of totalitarian regimes; what does this say about where the firm’s loyalties lie? Certainly not with the average American family struggling to make ends meet. As if that weren't enough, BlackRock’s involvement in the U.S. military-industrial complex adds another layer to its nefarious influence. As highlighted by researchers at Corporate Accountability, an organization committed to exposing corporations that undermine democracy, BlackRock holds tens of billions in investments in major defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and Boeing. By profiting directly from never-ending wars, BlackRock reaps enormous financial rewards while American taxpayers are left to foot the bill. Which brings us back to Kamala Harris. For all her posturing, the flip-flopper-in-chief is not here to challenge this system. She’s here to safeguard it. If elected, Harris' economic policies will be molded by the same firm responsible for widening income inequality and eroding democracy. The Wall Street Journal has shed light on how BlackRock has amassed entire residential neighborhoods, turning these homes into rental properties. This aggressive acquisition strategy fuels bidding wars and drives up home prices, directly disadvantaging the middle class. As Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a Yale professor, has pointed out, Kamala Harris’ ties to Wall Street are even more intimate than Biden’s. And when Wall Street speaks, it’s really BlackRock’s voice you’re hearing. Harris’ campaign promises to support the middle class appear to be nothing more than a boldfaced lie. But this is what she excels at: bending the truth. Make no mistake about it: BlackRock’s interests are diametrically opposed to those of the American people. A Harris presidency would mean more policies that enrich the few at the expense of the many. Kamala Harris isn’t the answer; on the contrary, she’s part of the problem. John Mac Ghlionn

“He can't [negotiate] because he's owned by the West, by Washington, by London, by BlackRock, by the military industrial complex, so they're not gonna let him do that,” he continued. “They are making money out of this war and getting everything they can out of Ukraine and out of the resources that Ukraine has. So he has no other possibility. He could have stopped it as soon as he became the president in 2019.” “I fled this war because I was against this war and my government – the regime, the Kiev Nazi regime – tried to kill me for fighting for peace,” he continued. “A lot of Ukrainians who fled this war, they fled it because… they just don't want to fight, but they want to continue this war so they have the pride of Ukraine winning, and that is it. They don't understand the consequences. The consequences are a World War III situation. Ukraine cannot win this, and Ukraine already has lost when the war started, day one.”

Title: Wall Street ends slightly higher after Fed policymakers back rate cuts

NEW YORK – US stocks closed modestly higher on Sept 23 as investors assessed whether a trend will develop in the week following the Federal Reserve’s rate cut. The gains came amid comments from Fed policymakers and steady factory activity data, building on last week’s sharp market rally after the central bank’s decision to lower interest rates. The Fed’s pivotal move last week pushed major indexes to monthly gains, defying the historical trend of September as a weak month for equities. Comments on Sept 23 from three reserve bank presidents were the main focus as investors searched for clues on why the central bank kicked off its easing cycle with an outsized 50 basis-point cut. Fed officials including Mr Raphael Bostic, Mr Neel Kashkari and Mr Austan Goolsbee supported the central bank’s last rate cut and voiced support for more cuts in the rest of the year. Trader bets, as per the CME Group’s FedWatch tool, initially favoured a larger Fed move at its upcoming November meeting, after Governor Christopher Waller on Sept 20 flagged that upcoming inflation data could undershoot the Fed’s 2 per cent target. However, the bets have swayed since then and now appear to be a coin-toss, with markets expecting a total reduction of 74 basis points by the year end, according to LSEG data. On the data front, US business activity remained steady in September, while average prices for goods and services increased at the fastest pace in six months, potentially signalling a rise in inflation in the months ahead. “I think investors are still just sort of taking a wait-and-see attitude, if indeed a soft landing is the most likely outcome.” said Mr Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 61.29 points, or 0.15 per cent, to 42,124.65, the S&P 500 gained 16.02 points, or 0.28 per cent, to 5,718.57 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 25.95 points, or 0.14 per cent, to 17,974.27. Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors were higher. Energy stocks led gains with a 1.31 per cent rise, while healthcare stocks declined 0.25 per cent. Among rate-sensitive growth stocks, Tesla jumped 4.65 per cent, while Meta Platforms rose 0.6 per cent after Citigroup lifted its price target on the stock. The Russell 2000 index, tracking small caps, was off 0.25 per cent. All eyes are on Sept 27’s personal consumption expenditures figure for August – the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge. Analysts say this release will be the week’s most significant catalyst. Among top movers, Intel rose 3.05 per cent after a media report said Apollo offered to make an investment of as much as US$5 billion (S$6.46 billion) in the chipmaker. General Motors slipped 1.72 per cent after Bernstein downgraded the carmaker’s stock to “market perform” from “outperform”. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.48-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. There were 505 new highs and 36 new lows on the NYSE. The S&P 500 posted 62 new 52-week highs and one new low while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 80 new highs and 123 new lows.

Title: Goldman Sachs maintains buy on Arista Networks, price target $430
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/goldman-sachs-maintains-buy-on-arista-networks-price-target-430-93CH-3628796

Full Content:
On Monday, Goldman Sachs reiterated a Buy rating on Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) with a steady price target of $430.00. The firm is projecting Arista Networks to achieve approximately 20% revenue growth in 2024 and 2025, citing increased confidence in their earnings per share (EPS) estimates for these years. The revised EPS estimate for 2024 is now $8.39, up from the previous $8.35 and higher than the FactSet consensus of $8.27. For 2025, the EPS estimate has been set at $9.91, compared to the prior $9.86 and above the consensus of $9.39. The optimism from Goldman Sachs is based on several key factors, including anticipated capital expenditure from Arista's major cloud customers, such as Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). The firm also highlighted the transition from pilot to production in three significant AI cluster projects expected in the next year and the momentum in Ethernet deployments across Arista's target five major AI cluster projects. Additionally, the firm noted Arista's expectations of increased front end networking investment relative to back end spending. Arista Networks' competitive edge is attributed to its top-tier switching platform, which offers scale up and scale out capabilities. This positions the company favorably in a market that is increasingly adopting integrated compute systems. Goldman Sachs anticipates that Arista will not only meet its $750 million AI revenue target in 2025 but will also continue to grow beyond that year. Goldman Sachs expects Arista Networks to outperform in the third quarter of 2024, surpassing revenue and margin expectations. This forecast aligns with the company's history of exceeding the midpoint of its EBIT margin guidance by an average of approximately 260 basis points over the last 26 quarters. In other recent news, Arista Networks has been in the spotlight with significant developments. The company reported a robust Q2 performance, with revenues reaching $1.69 billion, indicating a 15.9% increase year-over-year, primarily driven by services and software support renewals. Evercore ISI maintained its Outperform rating for Arista, based on the potential revenue opportunity from Meta's development of a massive new AI model training cluster. This could result in a possible $250 million in revenue for Arista if they secure the contract. Goldman Sachs reaffirmed its Buy rating on Arista, projecting a revenue growth target of at least 14% in 2024, while Deutsche Bank maintained its Hold rating, suggesting a positive outlook for the company's growth potential through 2025. Arista also repurchased $172 million of its common stock and generated $989 million in operating cash. These recent developments underscore the company's strong market position and potential for continued growth. However, it's important to note that operating expenses increased to $319.8 million due to higher headcount and new product introduction costs. With these developments, Arista Networks continues to make strides in its industry. As Goldman Sachs maintains a bullish stance on Arista Networks, citing robust revenue growth and competitive advantages, InvestingPro data and tips provide additional insights for investors considering ANET stock. The company's strong financial health is reflected in a market capitalization of $121.21 billion and significant revenue growth, with the last twelve months as of Q2 2024 showing a 19.93% increase. This aligns with Goldman Sachs' revenue growth projections for 2024 and 2025. InvestingPro Tips highlight Arista Networks as a prominent player in the Communications Equipment industry with a high return over the last year, suggesting investor confidence in the company's performance and strategy. Additionally, the company's liquid assets exceed short-term obligations, indicating a solid position to meet its financial commitments. However, investors should be aware of the stock trading at a high earnings multiple, with a P/E ratio of 48.95, and near its 52-week high, which could imply a premium valuation. For those seeking a deeper dive into Arista Networks' financial health and stock performance, InvestingPro offers 17 additional tips to help investors make informed decisions.

Title: Trump Media’s Stock Price Sinks to New Low After Insider Lockup Period Expires

Former president has said he has 'absolutely no intention' of selling his shares in company that operates Truth Social By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Shares of Donald Trump’s social media company, which operates the unprofitable Truth Social platform, dropped 10.3% Monday to their lowest price since the stock began trading under the ticker symbol “DJT” earlier in 2024. Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) stock closed at $12.15/share, down nearly 82% from the company’s peak closing price of $66.22/share on March 27. The slump for the stock comes after a six-month lockup period on shares held by TMTG insiders — including Trump, TMTG’s directors and officers, and certain other securityholders — expired at the end of regular trading Thursday, Sept. 19. Related Stories VIP+ Generative AI Fueling ‘Exponential’ Rise in Celebrity NIL Rip-Offs: Exclusive Data Peacock Releases Trailer for 'Teacup,' New Horror Series From James Wan (TV News Roundup) Trump has said he has “absolutely no intention of selling” his shares in TMTG. “A lot of people think the reason [the company’s stock price is] down is a lot of people think I’m going to sell, and if I sell, it’s not going to be the same,” Trump said at a Sept. 13 press conference, per CBS News. “But I have absolutely no intention of selling.” Popular on Variety TMTG’s market capitalization currently stands at about $2.4 billion. That’s down from an intraday peak of more than $9.5 billion on March 26, CNBC reported. As of Aug. 15, Trump beneficially owned 56.6% of TMTG’s outstanding shares, making his stake currently worth about $1.4 billion — down from $5.2 billion at stock’s the highest closing price. The 114.75 million shares Trump holds includes 36 million “earnout shares” that TMTG determined he was entitled to in accordance with the merger agreement. TMTG calls Truth Social a “safe harbor for free expression amid increasingly harsh censorship by Big Tech corporations.” For the second quarter of 2024, TMTG reported $836,900 in net sales and a net loss of $16.37 million, per its 10-Q SEC filing for the period. For Q1, the company reported $770,500 in revenue and a net loss of $327.6 million; most of the loss for the first three months of the year was due to expenses associated with TMTG’s merger with special purpose acquisition company Digital World Acquisition Corp. to become a publicly traded company. According to an Aug. 23 filing with the SEC, TMTG’s board and audit committee authorized a share repurchase of an aggregate of 128,138 shares of the company’s common stock “from certain executive employees” at a prevailing market price of $22.70 per share. As consideration for the repurchase, TMTG said, it will remit $2.9 million plus applicable penalties and interest to the IRS and certain state taxing authorities in connection with the March 7 issuance of the TMTG Executive Promissory Notes. “TMTG’s success depends in part on the popularity of our brand and the reputation and popularity of President Donald J. Trump,” the company said in its most recent 10-Q filing. “The value of TMTG’s brand may diminish if the popularity of President Donald J. Trump were to suffer. Adverse reactions to publicity relating to President Donald J. Trump, or the loss of his services, could adversely affect TMTG’s revenues, results of operations and its ability to maintain or generate a consumer base.” The filing also noted that Trump “is involved in numerous lawsuits and other matters that could damage his reputation.” Shares in TMTG began trading on Nasdaq on March 26, 2024, under the ticker symbol “DJT” following the company’s merger with DWAC. Trump formed TMTG in 2021 after the former president had been kicked off Twitter (now called X), Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and other internet platforms, which said he had violated prohibitions against inciting violence in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Trump’s accounts have been reinstated by X, Meta’s Facebook and Instagram, YouTube and others, but he continues to use Truth Social as his preferred social media platform. Truth Social launched in early 2022. “TMTG was founded to fight back against the big tech companies — Meta (Facebook, Instagram and Threads), X (formerly Twitter), Netflix, Alphabet (Google), Amazon and others — that may curtail debate in America and censor voices that contradict their ‘woke’ ideology,” the company says in its prospectus. TMTG has not disclosed how many people use Truth Social. “At this juncture in its development, TMTG believes that adhering to traditional key performance indicators, such as signups, average revenue per user, ad impressions and pricing, or active user accounts including monthly and daily active users, could potentially divert its focus from strategic evaluation with respect to the progress and growth of its business,” it says in an updated prospectus filed Sept. 5.

Title: Former Merkel rival aims to become chancellor
URL: https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/2871017/former-merkel-rival-aims-to-become-chancellor
Time Published: 2024-09-23T21:00:00Z
Full Content:
Squeezed out of top-level politics by his arch-party rival Angela Merkel more than two decades ago, Friedrich Merz is on course to land his first-ever government job as Germany's next chancellor. The conservative Christian Democrat Party (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party, which together are topping nationwide polls, last Tuesday agreed to nominate Mr Merz, 68, as candidate for chancellor in next year's federal election. A wealthy corporate lawyer who took a long hiatus from politics after losing a power struggle within the CDU to Ms Merkel in 2002, Mr Merz is widely considered a polar opposite in both style and policy to the woman who led Germany for 16 years. Where Ms Merkel was a consensus-driven, even-tempered pragmatist who shifted the CDU more towards the centre, Mr Merz is a brash and provocative economic liberal who advocates for a revival of Christian values and has pulled it back to the right since being elected CDU chief almost three years ago. He has been heard railing in recent months against Berlin's handling of migration -- marked by Ms Merkel's own open-door policy -- calling instead for asylum seekers to be turned away at German land borders. A Catholic father-of-three, married to a judge, Mr Merz hopes to win back voters from the anti-migrant Alternative for Germany (AfD), which this month became the first far-right party to win a state election since World War II. In the process, though, he has made a series of populist statements -- such as accusing some Ukrainian refugees of "social welfare tourism" and the children of some Muslim immigrants of being "small pashas" with no respect for authority -- that CDU insiders fear could alienate more centrist voters. The conservative premier of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, Hendrik Wuest, once considered a rival for the chancellor candidacy, earlier this year warned in a newspaper column the CDU should stick to Ms Merkel's "policies of modernity" rather than "scoring cheap points". In what his critics call a sign of his thin skin, Mr Merz, who towers over his opponents at nearly 2 metres tall, made an unusual public dig at Mr Wuest in response. "He is sensitive and quickly vexed, especially when he feels unjustly treated," said Jutta Falke-Ischinger, co-author of an unofficial biography on Mr Merz titled The Unyielding One. "He doesn't have much impulse control." However, Falke-Ischinger said Mr Merz was more decisive than current Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who is accused of dithering by his opponents. "He [Mr Merz] has an open ear for everything and everyone, is reliable; once he says something, he does it," she said. Mr Merz, a protégé of the late CDU grandee Wolfgang Schaeuble, clinched the job as party chief by dint of persistence and by appealing to grass-roots members frustrated with what they viewed as Ms Merkel's sellout of its core principles, said Alexander Clarkson, a lecturer for German studies at King's College London. "But he does not have much deep support in the party and is one blunder away from coming under enormous internal pressure," he said. The conservatives, which scored their worst-ever result in the 2021 election, have since risen in polls to about 33%, although analysts say that is relatively modest given the unpopularity of Mr Scholz's fractious coalition. Mr Merz, like Mr Scholz, has long languished in politician popularity rankings although his star has risen slightly of late. "He lacks popularity, but maybe you don't need that in these times, but rather you need to show strength -- which he does," said a high-ranking CDU politician, speaking on condition of anonymity. Mr Merz, who grew up in a small western town as the eldest son of a judge, was pushed out of his role as CDU parliamentary leader by Ms Merkel in 2002 and left the Bundestag in 2009 in order to pursue a successful business career. The amateur pilot, who disclosed in 2018 that he was earning about €1 million (36.7 million baht) a year, has worked on the advisory and supervisory boards of several major companies, from Commerzbank to BASF. He was also chairman of the German arm of BlackRock, the world's biggest fund manager. Critics accuse him of being out of touch with ordinary Germans and prone to representing the interests of corporate elites over the people. His decision to fly a private plane to the wedding of Finance Minister Christian Lindner in 2022 in a country wary of ostentation sparked controversy. Supporters say his private sector experience can help him better understand how to reboot a stagnant economy. Mr Merz, the author of the 2008 book Dare More Capitalism, has said he wants to reduce social benefits and taxes, particularly on companies. He also wants to simplify Germany's notoriously complex tax system; annual tax returns should be so simple you could write them on a beer mat, he once said. The government should create more competitive conditions for all firms for example by lowering energy prices and foster innovation rather than certain sectors like e-mobility, according to Mr Merz, who long opposed Germany's exit from nuclear power. Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING Research, said the main problem with the proposals was that Mr Merz had not spelt out how he would finance them. "Merz's economic policy proposals all make sense but are typical opposition proposals and not yet constructive ideas for a next government," he said. Mr Merz's fiscal conservatism, in particular his opposition to common European debt, could also put the brakes on ideas to boost EU growth, for example through higher public investment. Still, Mr Merz, who started his political career as a European lawmaker, has described himself as a "a truly convinced European" and advocated for a closer union, in particular on defence and foreign policy. This and his more hawkish stance on both Russia and China arguably make him more aligned with French President Emmanuel Macron, whom he visited in Paris late last year, than Mr Scholz is, according to Eurasia Group. British World War II leader Winston Churchill is the politician who has marked him most, he says, other than Schaueble. Mr Merz has also described himself as "a convinced transatlanticist", chairing the "Atlantic Bridge", a non-profit fostering US-German ties, for 10 years. His ability to put into place any of his ideas will depend in part on his ability to form a coalition with the very three ruling parties he has now spent years attacking, given he -- like all leaders of mainstream parties -- has ruled out working with the AfD. "As chancellor, he might cater to that growing desire for politicians with clear convictions after the Merkel and Scholz years," said Carsten Nickel at political risk consultancy Teneo. "But German politics is all about compromise in the end, and that might be something that comes less naturally to Merz."

Server maker Super Micro Computer (SMCI) announced a 10-for-1 stock split last month that will take effect after the closing bell on Sept. 30. Here's what you need to know about the split. Shareholders will receive nine new Super Micro shares for every one they already own. Their overall stake in the company won’t change, but the stock will subsequently trade for 10% of its previous price. In other words, if Super Micro shares were trading at $1,000 before the split, an investor holding one share before the split would hold 10 shares priced at $100 each after the split. (Companies can also hold reverse splits, as some have done lately.) Super Micro shares skyrocketed early in 2024 to a high of nearly $1,200 due to surging demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure. They traded closer to $600 when the split was announced, and closed Monday at about $465. The shares have lost more than half their value over the past six months, thanks in part to disappointing recent results. Even so, the stock is still roughly 65% higher year-to-date. The move would be the latest split by a high-flying tech stock, with Broadcom (AVGO) and Nvidia (NVDA) having already split their shares 10-for-1 this year.

Title: Why Some Analysts Say Qualcomm's Potential Takeover of Intel is 'Impractical'

Intel (INTC) shares have gained ground as investors reacted to a Wall Street Journal report late Friday that said Qualcomm (QCOM) had made a “takeover approach” to the beleaguered chipmaker. However, securities analysts are less keen on the idea, with those at Bank of America calling it “intriguing but perhaps impractical.” A Qualcomm takeover could offer Intel a lifeline for its struggling foundry business, which produces chips for outside customers, the firm noted in a research note released on Saturday. Intel could fill its manufacturing facilities with Qualcomm products, and Qualcomm could become a significant customer for Intel’s silicon wafers. That said, Intel is saddled with more than $50 billion in debt, and Qaulcomm has just $13 billion in cash on its balance sheet, making a takeover deal difficult, the BofA analysts said. In addition, the move could “create confusion given potential for headcount and roadmap disruptions,” making such a merger a potential boon for rivals such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). For a Qualcomm-Intel deal to go through, it likely would require a level of buy-in from the U.S. and Chinese governments, analysts at JPMorgan wrote over the weekend. Qualcomm could look for the U.S. government to provide a capital commitment to the foundry business, the success of which is important to domestic semiconductor production. Then there’s regulatory approval from China, which analysts acknowledge would be a major obstacle for such a move. The country "historically has taken years to even consider medium sized transactions," the BofA analysts said. Over the weekend, Apollo Global Management offered to invest as much as $5 billion in Intel, according to a Bloomberg report. Intel previously agreed to sell Apollo a 49% stake in a chipmaking site in Ireland in June. Shares of Intel gained 3.3% on Monday, while Qualcomm stock was down 1.8%.

Venkata R Madabhushi, the Chief Marketing Officer of Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA), has recently engaged in significant trading activity involving the company's stock. According to a recent filing, Madabhushi sold a total of 4,685 shares of Mastercard's Class A Common Stock at an average price of approximately $489.86, resulting in a transaction value of over $2.2 million. The sale took place on September 20, 2024, and was executed in multiple trades with prices ranging from $489.18 to $490.00. The reported average sales price represents a weighted average, reflecting the various prices at which the stock was sold. Following this transaction, Madabhushi's direct ownership in the company decreased to 15,030.79 shares. In a separate transaction on the same day, Madabhushi also exercised options to acquire 2,598 shares of Mastercard stock at a price of $344.48 per share, totaling nearly $895,000. This transaction was carried out under a pre-planned trading plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which allows company insiders to set up a predetermined plan to buy or sell company stock. The plan was adopted on June 14, 2024, for personal financial management purposes. The filing also disclosed details about Madabhushi's employee stock options. As of the reporting date, he was awarded 8,054 employee stock options on March 1, 2022. Of those, 299 have vested and the remaining 2,685 are set to vest on March 1, 2025. These transactions provide insight into the trading behavior of one of Mastercard's top executives and are disclosed to the public as part of the company's commitment to transparency regarding the ownership and dealings of its insiders. Interested parties can request detailed information on the number of shares sold and the specific prices from the SEC, the issuer, or a security holder of the issuer, as the reporting person has undertaken to provide full information upon request. In other recent news, Mastercard has declared a quarterly cash dividend of 66 cents per share and announced a strategic acquisition of Recorded Future, a global leader in threat intelligence, for $2.65 billion. This acquisition, expected to contribute to Mastercard's revenue growth and diversification of services, has received positive outlooks from analyst firms Baird, BMO Capital Markets, and TD Cowen, while Compass Point has given Mastercard a Neutral rating. Simultaneously, Mastercard has priced new note issuances, including a $750 million note due in 2028 at 4.10%, a $1.15 billion note due in 2032 at 4.35%, and a $1.10 billion note due in 2035 at 4.55%. Baird suggests these issuances will likely have a negligible or neutral effect on the company's earnings per share. In a separate development, Safaricom, Kenya's leading telecommunications company, has partnered with Mastercard to enhance payment acceptance and cross-border remittance services in Kenya. This partnership is expected to leverage Safaricom's M-PESA's extensive merchant network and Mastercard's international payment infrastructure, potentially boosting Kenya’s payment acceptance market growth. The first initiatives of this partnership are expected to be rolled out in the coming months. These are the recent developments in Mastercard's strategic and financial landscape. Amidst the insider trading activity at Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA), it's important for investors to consider the broader financial landscape of the company. Mastercard, a prominent player in the Financial Services industry, is not only known for its operational success but also for its consistent shareholder returns. The company has raised its dividend for 13 consecutive years, showcasing a strong commitment to returning value to its investors. InvestingPro Data reveals that Mastercard boasts a market capitalization of $459.17 billion, reflecting its substantial presence in the market. Despite recent insider sales, the company's stock has been trading near its 52-week high, with a price percentage of 99.04% of that peak. This indicates a robust performance in the stock market and investor confidence in the company's prospects. However, it's worth noting that Mastercard is trading at a high earnings multiple, with a P/E ratio of 37.85 and an adjusted P/E ratio for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024 sitting at 36.21. This high valuation could suggest that the stock is priced optimistically relative to its near-term earnings growth. Moreover, the company's Price/Book multiple during the same period is at 61.89, which is considered high and might raise valuation concerns for value-focused investors. For those looking to delve deeper into Mastercard's financial health and future prospects, the InvestingPro platform offers numerous additional tips.

Title: Southwest Airlines Faces a Decisive Fight Over Its Future
URL: https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/southwest-airlines-elliott-investor-day/
Time Published: 2024-09-23T19:26:52Z
Full Content:
Southwest Airlines will host a blockbuster event in Dallas this week, to unveil a service most other carriers began offering decades ago. At its annual Investor Day, Southwest will showcase its first-ever plan for assigning passengers to specific airplane seats, including premium-priced larger ones that will require altering the layouts of the company’s previously egalitarian cabins. Selling a variety of seating options at different price points has long been the practice at Fort Worth–based American Airlines—and at Delta, and United, and most other major carriers around the world. Yet some insiders think Southwest will treat the announcement with the sort of fanfare that accompanied Apple’s introduction of the first iPhone—framing it as a this-changes-everything moment for the company. Even if Southwest CEO Bob Jordan doesn’t don Steve Jobs’s trademark black mock turtleneck, the event will mark a pivotal point in the airline’s 53-year history. That’s because among the shareholders watching carefully will be those at Elliott Investment Management, a so-called activist investment firm led by New York City billionaire Paul Singer. If Elliott doesn’t agree that Thursday’s announcements will deliver a quick enough boost to Southwest’s stock price, it will likely turn up the volume of its calls for heads to roll at the airline—including Jordan’s. That Elliott is in a position to force anyone out of Southwest’s C-suite confirms that things have already changed dramatically at the company. Particularly under its famed cofounder and CEO, the late Herb Kelleher, the airline has fiercely defended its independence, including its maverick business practices, such as open seating. But as the airline has struggled in recent years—not least with hugely disruptive delays and cancellations caused by decades of underinvestment in digital technology—Elliott has gained considerable influence over its future. On June 10, Elliott announced it had acquired a big stake in Southwest, and it now says it holds 11 percent of the airline’s 599 million outstanding shares—enough to call for a special meeting at which it could, with the backing of a majority of other shareholders, force out some or all of Southwest’s board members and, by extension, Jordan. Elliott, which declined to make an executive available to Texas Monthly for an interview, has yet to call for such a meeting. Southwest, whose executives also declined our interview requests, tried to fend off Elliott’s attack earlier this month by offering to have six of its board members resign and to shrink its board from fifteen directors to twelve by next year. During a meeting at Elliott’s offices in New York City, Gary Kelly, Southwest’s executive board chairman and former longtime CEO, also said he’d retire by May. Elliott trumpeted that appeasement offer as unprecedented. But two days after receiving it, the firm’s representatives made clear to leaders of the union that represents the airline’s mechanics that it wasn’t enough. In a subsequent memo to union members, Bret Oestreich, president of the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association, wrote that Elliott wants Kelly out before next spring. Elliot’s “vision of a Southwest turnaround is one where Robert Jordan does not remain as CEO,” Oestreich added. “If Elliott can assert enough Board influence, other top executives would also, most likely, be replaced.” Jordan has indicated he’s not ready to step down, nor is he inclined to dismiss other executives. Back in August, he wrote to employees that the standoff with Elliott was “a battle for the heart of our company and our future—your future.” The word “heart” was no doubt carefully chosen by a company that once dubbed itself “the love airline,” is headquartered at Love Field, chose LUV for its stock ticker symbol, and paints a giant heart on the belly of each of its planes. On Thursday, Jordan will have the chance to woo Southwest’s other shareholders, the vast majority of which are institutional investors, such as the Vanguard Group and BlackRock. Such investors tend to demonstrate more patience than do “activist” funds such as Elliott, which typically press for actions that would quickly boost the stock price and are often skeptical of executives who wish to make longer-term investments in their businesses. Indeed, one analyst, Sheila Kahyaoglu, a managing director at New York investment bank Jefferies, has said she expects that most Southwest shareholders are unlikely to vote Jordan out without first “entertaining a go-forward plan.” Jordan will have the chance this week to make his case. At Investor Day, he may tout the multiple ways in which he has expensively upgraded the technology Southwest uses to position its planes and flight crews where they’re needed around the country. He could cite his securing of multiple new contracts with all of Southwest’s unionized workers and, now, the addition of premium-seating fees and red-eye flights. Could he add a Steve Jobs–style “one more thing”? Might Southwest end its “bags fly free” policy, since Elliott has called bag fees one of the “key commercial innovations” that Southwest has “written off”? Investors and analysts are eager to find out. Whatever’s in the works, for an airline that has cultivated an irreverent, fun-loving brand reputation, the stakes are seriously high. What would it mean to run Southwest Airlines to Elliott’s liking? The firm offers a snapshot of its vision through a website it created called Stronger Southwest. Solutions include replacing a slew of executives and board directors with outsiders who would turn Southwest into an airline more like American, Delta, and United—with the same checked-bag fees and even more basic economy and premium seating options than Jordan may propose on Thursday. In materials posted to the Stronger Southwest site, Elliott lists multiple executives it might seek to replace. They include Kelly, who has worked for Southwest for 38 years, and Jordan, whose tenure is 36 years, as well as chief financial officer Tammy Romo (33 years) and chief administrative officer Linda Rutherford (32 years). Each of them represents a direct link to airline cofounder Kelleher and former company president Colleen Barrett, who together built Southwest from a tiny Texas-only operation that started flying in 1971 into an airline that today carries more passengers domestically than any other in the U.S. and whose market value was, as recently as 2008, greater than those of the six other major U.S. airlines combined. In past conversations I’ve had with Jordan, Kelly, Romo, Rutherford, and Kelleher (who died in 2019), the long tenure of Southwest’s leadership was considered a strength at the company—cited as key to Southwest’s famously familial corporate culture. Cheryl Hughey, the airline’s senior adviser for culture and engagement, who began working at Southwest in 1980 as a reservation agent, once told me, “It is very important to know your heritage and how the foundation [of the company] was formed. That’s what families do.” Elliot’s Stronger Southwest site doesn’t mention family or corporate culture. But it does quote Kelleher: “If you don’t change, you die. . . . If things change faster outside your company than they change inside your company, you’ve got something to worry about.” That quote, taken from a 2014 conversation between Gary Kelly and Kelleher that’s discussed on Kelly’s own LinkedIn page, must read like nails on a chalkboard to Southwest’s traditionalist insiders. Elliott’s Stronger Southwest site makes no mention of Kelleher’s pronouncements that the airline primarily exists to serve its employees—not its shareholders. Kelleher’s mantra was that if the company takes care of its people, the people will take care of the customers, whose loyal patronage will benefit the shareholders. Elliott might argue, though, that Southwest isn’t caring for its people as well as it once did. Materials on the Stronger Southwest site note a “massive decline in annual profit sharing pay for employees” in recent years. Southwest’s annual profits were 57 percent lower in 2023 than in 2019, even as revenue was 16 percent higher. As a result, the average Southwest employee has seen annual profit sharing decline by more than $9,600 since 2019, according to Elliott. Critics have labeled Elliott a “vulture fund” because of its history of buying distressed bonds of countries on the brink of going broke. Its founder, Singer, famously waged a fourteen-year-long global legal battle to collect on debts owed by the nation of Argentina. The battle nearly erupted in violence when Elliott obtained a court order to seize a three-hundred-foot Argentine naval ship while it was moored off the West African nation of Ghana. Crew members drew their weapons on a man who attempted to board the ship. Calmer heads prevailed, but in the end, Argentina ponied up $2.4 billion to Elliott. The New Yorker reported that that amount represented a 1,270 percent return on Elliott’s initial investment. Elliott isn’t expecting quite so eye-popping a return on its Southwest investment. If the airline is managed as Elliott would prefer, according to Stronger Southwest, its share price should reach $49, although Elliott doesn’t say how quickly that could happen. Such an increase would yield more than $1.2 billion for the firm. If Southwest hopes to keep its adversarial investor from forcing it to become more like American and Delta and United—which, by the way, haven’t exactly delighted investors over the past decade—it might look to its past for guidance. Kelleher once told me, during a conversation in his windowless office at Southwest’s old Love Field headquarters, that he spent years parrying with Wall Street. “I would go to New York in the early eighties,” he said, “and the investment community would tell me that they thought Southwest Airlines was going to have a very short future unless we changed to emulate what the airlines had traditionally done.” Kelleher resisted such calls, and as Southwest continued growing and posted rising profits, eventually Wall Street relented. But that only came after a few tense encounters, including one with an investment banker that I first read about in Thomas Petzinger Jr.’s 1996 book, Hard Landing. During an interview with Kelleher two decades ago, I asked him to confirm that confrontation, which had occurred in the same office where we were sitting. Kelleher, who loved to put on a show, was more than happy to reenact what occurred. He set a Merit Ultra cigarette down in an ashtray and leaped from his blue leather chair, telling me that the banker said Southwest seemed like the perfect target for a hostile takeover. Kelleher wasn’t about to let Southwest get gobbled up by some bigger competitor—be it crosstown rival American Airlines or someone else. In recounting the story, he walked over, put his hands on my shoulders, and showed me how he’d slowly lifted the investment banker out of his seat. At over six feet, Kelleher, a former high school basketball star, could be physically imposing, and his baritone voice could sound downright scary when he got serious, which he had been with the banker. As he backed the man up against a wall and poked him in the chest, “the guy turned white as a sheet,” Kelleher told me. Kelleher explained to the banker that if any company tried to take over Southwest, he would do anything necessary to stop it. “I will even burn this company to the ground if I have to,” he said. The shocked banker ran out the door, passing through the adjoining office of Colleen Barrett (who died earlier this year). Barrett rushed in to ask Kelleher what had happened. He replied: “I just delivered a message to Wall Street.” Up until the COVID-19 pandemic, Wall Street heeded that message. Southwest still boasts a strong claim to being what it calls “the most successful commercial carrier in the history of aviation.” After its founding, the airline posted 47 consecutive years of profits, running from 1973 until COVID wrecked the travel industry, in 2020. Unlike American or Delta or United or most major U.S. carriers, Southwest has never declared bankruptcy. Postpandemic, Southwest, like other airlines, has faced serious operational headwinds. Some of its problems have been worse than those of its peers, such as its holiday season meltdown in 2022. Southwest has remained profitable, but its stock is down about 1 percent since May 2023, while United’s and Delta’s are up about 17 percent and 39 percent, respectively. (American is down 21 percent.) Elliott thinks Southwest can deliver shareholders a big short-term gain by becoming more like its rivals, the very thing Kelleher fought off all those decades ago. At Investor Day, we stand to find out whether the airline will comply or whether it’s about to deliver another defiant message to Wall Street.

Title: Intel needs Qualcomm, but it's not a two-way street, analysts say

Time Published: 2024-09-23T18:42:00Z

After missing second-quarter earnings expectations and seeing its stock fall over 50% so far this year, Intel (INTC) is still attracting interest worth billions of dollars. Chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) is reportedly interested in taking over the chip pioneer in a deal that could be worth $90 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported last week. And alternative asset manager Apollo Global Management (APO) has also offered an equity-like investment that could be worth as much as $5 billion, according to Bloomberg. By taking over Intel, Qualcomm could potentially scale, gain leadership in the market for mobile, PC, and server core processor units, or CPUs, and have access to Intel’s sprawling chip fabrication plants, analysts at Bank of America (BAC) Global Research said in a note. They added that combining Qualcomm’s chip revenue of $33 billion with Intel’s $52 billion revenue would make Qualcomm the largest semiconductor company in the world. However, the analysts said regulatory and financial challenges from a potential deal would outweigh those benefits, and added they are skeptical of a proposed takeover, and believe confusion over the deal could end up benefitting Intel’s rivals, including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) (AMD), Nvidia (NVDA), and Arm. Here are three reasons Bank of America and other analysts say Qualcomm wouldn’t benefit much from an Intel takeover. A deal between a chip designer and a company with the factories to make those chips looks sensible from above, Richard Windsor, founder of research firm Radio Free Mobile, said in a note — but it doesn’t actually “fit so well.” While Qualcomm uses British chip firm Arm’s architecture for its PC chips, Intel’s x86 processors, which are used in a lot of computer and server hardware, are designed differently. Bank of America analysts also noted the difference, saying Qualcomm’s “existing established relationships” on the Arm architecture make “it tougher to bring product” to Intel’s mostly x86-based fabs. Meanwhile, Windsor said Intel’s x86 processors are “under assault on all fronts from Arm and accelerated computing,” and that Qualcomm has already spent two decades competing against Intel’s chips in the mobile and PC market. “Consequently, it makes no sense to become the owner of a fading titan when one is in a good position to partially or completely displace it from the market,” Windsor said. And Qualcomm already has a relationship with other chipmakers such as TSMC (TSM) and Samsung, Windsor said, meaning it already knows “how to design its chips to be optimally manufactured on these processes.” Therefore, having to redesign its chips to be manufactured by Intel, which has already slipped behind with cutting edge chips, “sounds like a risky proposition to me,” he said. If Qualcomm does go through with an acquisition, it would come at a premium to Intel’s current expected value of $87 billion, Bank of America analysts said, adding that Intel also has about $53 billion in debt. Meanwhile, Qualcomm has $13 billion in cash on its balance sheet, analysts said. Intel is also planning to spend billions to support a growing fab network, including a five-year, $100 billion expansion plan for plants in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon. While the chipmaker is expecting to receive almost $20 billion in direct federal funding and loans from the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act to support the effort, it makes up a small portion of how much the expansion plan is expected to cost. Meanwhile, the chipmaker recently saw its shares close on a high after the U.S. Department of Defense and U.S. Department of Commerce announced that it is eligible for a separate $3 billion in CHIPS Act funding under the Secure Enclave program. Windsor also said in his note that “Qualcomm would almost certainly pay for Intel with shares” which would lead to “dilution for existing holders of Qualcomm’s stock” (which includes Windsor). And while Intel’s shares have fallen this year, Windsor said it’s still “not cheap” due to the chipmaker’s falling revenue. Bank of America analysts said the potential deal faces a “tough regulatory environment, specifically in China,” where medium sized deals have, in the past, “taken years to even consider.” Therefore, analysts said, the potential to dominate the CPU market would actually work against a takeover, because it could face regulatory challenges. For example, the analysts noted Qualcomm’s failed acquisition of Dutch semiconductor company NXP (NXPI) in 2018, after it did not receive approval from China’s antitrust regulator.

European shares closed higher on Monday as a soft business activity reading strengthened the case for more monetary policy easing by the European Central Bank this year, with rate-sensitive sectors such as real estate and utilities rising. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index closed 0.4 per cent higher, recouping some losses following its biggest one-day drop since August in the last session. Autos led gains among major Stoxx sectors with a 1.9 per cent advance, while retail also gained 1.2 per cent. A survey showed euro zone business activity contracted sharply and unexpectedly this month as the bloc’s dominant services industry flatlined while a downturn in manufacturing accelerated. “A payback from the Paris Olympics was largely expected. But today’s release was much worse than many had anticipated, suggesting a rather gloomy underlying growth picture for the euro zone,” said Fabio Balboni, senior economist, euro zone at HSBC. Ryanair traded flat on the day despite announcing that it had arranged to fly the Leinster rugby team to its European fixtures this season from Belfast instead of Dublin Airport amid an ongoing farrago over the annual passenger cap at the aviation hub. As expectations of further monetary easing by the European Central Bank increased both AIB and Bank of Ireland lost ground, declining 3.86 per cent and 1.53 per cent respectively. Food giant Kerry traded up 1.85 per cent €90.60 on the back positive sentiment for the sector. Other movers included home-builder Cairn, which fell 1 per cent to €1.89. Germany’s DAX closed 0.7 per cent up while France’s benchmark ended near flat, bogged down by falling bank stocks. French banks including Credit Agricole, SocGen and BNP Paribas were among top declines on the Stoxx index, with the euro zone banks index sliding 1.8 per cent. The euro slipped against the dollar, while the yield on the German two-year bond, which reflects near-term rate expectations, slipped to 2.149 per cent. Rate-sensitive real estate rose 1.3 per cent while utilities, often traded as a bond proxy, gained 1.1 per cent. The ECB cut interest rates in June and also earlier this month. Among individual stock moves, Germany’s Commerzbank slid 5.7 per cent after Berlin said it does not support a takeover by Italy’s UniCredit. UniCredit shares closed 3.3 per cent lower. Aurubis dropped 10.1 per cent after Europe’s largest copper producer guided for lower earnings next financial year as it expects metal prices to fall and after hurdles with a production ramp-up hit its fourth-quarter earnings. UK shares ended higher on Monday after logging their worst day since August in the previous session, boosted by rising commodity-linked shares, while drugmaker AstraZeneca fell following a disappointing experimental precision drug trial. The blue-chip FTSE 100 closed 0.4 per cent higher, while the more domestically-focused FTSE 250 midcap index added 0.1 per cent. Precious metal miners led gains among the major FTSE 350 indexes with a more than 2 per cent rise as gold prices scaled record highs, driven by Fed rate cuts and demand for the safe-haven asset on geopolitical risks in the Middle East. Heavyweight energy shares added 0.6 per cent, tracking elevated crude oil prices. Both indexes had notched up their worst day in nearly seven weeks on Friday after the Bank of England held interest rates steady on Thursday, even as the Federal Reserve cut benchmark rates by an outsized 50 basis points. Last week Britain’s consumer price inflation data – which is closely watched by the Bank of England for its monetary policy – pointed to persistent price pressures in the services sector. AstraZeneca slipped 1.7 per cent after the drugmaker said its experimental precision drug did not significantly improve overall survival for patients with a type of breast cancer in a late-stage trial. Wall Street’s main indexes trended higher in choppy trading on Monday as investors focused on comments from Federal Reserve policymakers and steady factory activity data following the central bank’s decision to commence monetary policy easing. The Fed’s pivotal move on monetary policy in the previous week propped up the main indexes for monthly gains, bucking a historical trend where September has been a weak month for equities on average. Comments from a number of policymakers were the main focus on the day as investors scoured for clues on why the central bank kicked off its easing cycle with an outsized 50 basis points cut. Fed presidents such as Raphael Bostic, Neel Kashkari and Austan Goolsbee supported the central bank’s last rate cut and voiced support for more cuts in the rest of the year. Ten out of the 11 S&P 500 sectors were higher. Real estate stocks lead gains with a 0.9 per cent rise, while healthcare stocks declined 0.1 per cent. Having rallied for much of the year, the S&P 500 is a whisker away from an all-time high and the blue-chip Dow hit another intraday record high. Among rate-sensitive growth stocks, Tesla jumped 4.8 per cent, while Meta rose 1 per cent after Citigroup lifted its price target on the stock. – Additional reporting by Reuters Eoin Burke-Kennedy is Economics Correspondent of The Irish Times Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Nvidia Versus AMD: Which AI Stock Is The Better Buy Right Now?

getty A year ago, there was only Nvidia (NVDA) in the AI race. But now investors are looking at Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) as a potential competitor. Which AI stock should have a place in your portfolio? Let's lay out the details so you can decide. Nvidia designs semiconductors for use in AI, gaming, autonomous vehicles, robotics, 5G networks and data centers. While chip sales drive revenue, the company also supports a full platform of related offerings that developers use to create, deploy, run and scale enterprise applications on Nvidia's hardware. Nvidia established itself in the late 1990s by creating the graphics processing unit (GPU), primarily for use in gaming applications. In 2013, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang saw a bigger picture for his company. He saw artificial intelligence as the future of computing—and believed Nvidia could lead that future. The company then began working on programmable GPUs to support complex computing operations. Today, Nvidia is the recognized leader in AI infrastructure, selling far more AI chips than any competitor. The chip designer also maintains a customer list that includes the best tech stocks in the world. AMD has historically battled with Intel for market share in central processing units (CPUs). Intel remains dominant, but AMD has been a formidable competitor—at least since CEO Lisa Su spearheaded the launch of the company's high-performance Zen architecture in 2017. Five years later, AMD's market capitalization passed Intel's for the first time. AMD is now targeting the AI market and Su has made some key moves to compete with Nvidia. She quadrupled the company's R&D budget and acquired Xilinx, Nod.ai and ZT Systems. Xilinx makes programmable processors, Nod.ai develops open-source AI software and ZT Systems' designs and manufactures servers and related infrastructure for data centers. AMD does not yet compete meaningfully with Nvidia. For the most recent quarter, AMD's data center revenues were less than 10% of Nvidia's. But as Intel struggles, AMD is positioning itself to secure a double-digit share in AI chips—which should be a sizable opportunity going forward. Much more than breaking news, our diverse reporting digs deeper with unparalleled insights that empower you to make better informed decisions.

Nvidia and AMD won't necessarily compete head-to-head for AI-related revenue. Let's look at their go-to-market strategies to understand why. Nvidia's original AI strategy was to be first and best. And the company has capitalized on this approach. Huang's strategic vision combined with a proven product development process provides some insulation from even the best AI stocks. As well, Nvidia doesn't just make AI chips. The company maintains an entire platform around those chips, including optimized software and libraries, to support application development from start to finish. This platform approach is another competitive advantage that could make customers reluctant to switch to another provider. AMD has played catch-up with Intel for years, and the company will likely use similar tactics to take a piece of the AI market from Nvidia. Providing better value is the crux of the strategy. AMD can do that by offering more performance for the price. That could mean similar performance at a lower price or slightly lower performance with a much smaller price tag. Providing and pitching a comprehensive AI computing platform has been a lesser focus for AMD. However, the company has taken steps to broaden its offering. The recent acquisition of ZT Systems, for example, enables AMD to deliver a full set of computing and storage resources required to power AI data centers. Nvidia's trailing 12-month revenues sum to about $96 billion, which is nearly four times more than AMD's $23 billion. The earnings comparison isn't quite as lopsided, with Nvidia delivering diluted EPS of $2.13 to AMD's $0.84. Both companies report AI-related revenues within their data center divisions. Nvidia's data center revenue in the most recent fiscal quarter was $26.3 billion, up 154% from the prior year. AMD produced data center revenue of $2.8 billion, up 115% year over year. The table below shows market capitalization, forward P/E ratio, price/book ratio, PEG and stock price upside for Nvidia and AMD. Table data sources: Yahoo Finance, Market Beat. As you can see, Nvidia is a much bigger enterprise. Its market cap of $2.89 trillion makes it the world's third-largest public company, ahead of Alphabet and Amazon. Nvidia's valuation metrics, particularly the price/book ratio, are also well higher than AMD's. However, the upside according to analyst price targets is comparable. You may also want to see what we think Nvidia will look like in five years. Nvidia has a dominant market share position plus a reputation as the AI chip leader. AMD is working to establish itself as a solid second option. Fortunately for AMD, the AI chip market is predicted to be large enough to be lucrative for two companies. Su has predicted global spending on AI accelerators to reach $400 billion by 2027. If AMD could capture 20% to 30% of that, the company's data center revenues could increase sevenfold. It's also likely that the tech companies investing in AI infrastructure will want more than one supplier and more than one software stack. AMD's development software, ROCm is an open-source solution, while Nvidia's CUDA is proprietary. CUDA has a strong reputation, but some projects may require the flexibility of AMD's open-source solution.

Multiple research companies and AMD's CEO have predicted strong double-digit annual growth for AI infrastructure spending over the next several years. The growth opportunity is somewhat different for our two companies, however. In short, Nvidia will be playing defense, while AMD plays offense. With a running start in the AI space, Nvidia now owns an estimated 80% market share. The quick rise to the top created extreme growth in revenues and profits, as tech companies rushed to build out their AI capabilities. Unfortunately for Nvidia, the spending may moderate just as competitors come to market with viable alternatives. Nvidia can find growth, however, by doing what it does best: pushing the limits of what high-performance computing can do in terms of speed and efficiency. Improving its platform to bring AI computing to a wider market could be another source of growth. The company won't be complacent under Huang's direction. Nvidia has recently shortened its product refresh cycle from two years to one year—presumably to keep pace with AMD's update cadence. AMD has more to gain and less to lose than Nvidia, which is the more interesting position to hold. AMD chips are currently cheaper and about 80% as powerful as Nvidia's according to AI software firm MosiacML. After testing AMD MI250 alongside Nvidia A100 last year, MosiacML CTO Hanlin Tang believes AMD can close the performance gap. That will be AMD's path to solid market share and revenue gains, especially if the company stays competitive on price and can produce enough to meet demand. Both companies will have to manage supply constraints, regulations that limit the revenue opportunity in China as well as rising competition. But they also face specific challenges related to where each stands in its AI growth trajectory. Nvidia's biggest challenge will be defending its position. The sheer size of the market ensures fierce competition as GPU makers position themselves for a piece of AI spending. To keep from losing market share, Nvidia will need to innovate and execute product rollouts flawlessly. Ongoing improvements in speed and efficiency will support higher spending even as the initial AI buildout slows. In the absence of impressive product upgrades, Nvidia could face share losses as spending moderates. That would be a revenue headwind, which likely won't sit well with Nvidia investors. AMD's primary challenge is establishing itself as the best second option in AI, while integrating four acquisitions made in the last two years. The acquisitions should support a more favorable competitive position, but it won't be enough to overtake Nvidia's dominance. So, the big risk for AMD is missing its target and ending up competing for the third or fourth position in the industry. Supply constraints or strategic, product or execution errors could open the door for another player like Intel to win market share. For more information, see Nvidia vs. Intel. Analysts are optimistic about Nvidia stock and AMD stock. Both companies have an average rating of strong buy. With 40 analysts reporting on Nvidia, there are 20 strong buys, 17 buys and three holds. No one is recommending investors sell their NVDA positions. The 30 ratings for AMD include 15 strong buys, 11 buys and four holds. As with NVDA, analysts don't see a case for selling AMD currently. To evaluate market sentiment, we can look at NVDA and AMD stock price trends relative to the broader market. NVDA has outperformed AMD and the S&P 500 by a wide margin over the last six months. Nvidia is up nearly 30%, the S&P 500 grew 10% and AMD has fallen 14%. Performance in the last month, however, shows Nvidia as the loser. The company lost 10%, while AMD and the S&P 500 made slight gains. This is partly a function of Nvidia's high valuation, which makes it more reactive to economic news. AMD is the better AI stock in terms of value and upside. Yes, the company is an underdog that's unlikely to replace Nvidia as the recognized AI leader. But, AMD has operated from second place before and thrived under its current leader Su. Plus, the addressable market is so large that a smaller share position still means massive growth for AMD. Nvidia already has a huge growth record going for it, but the company is quickly lapping the big AI-related gains it has generated to date. Comparisons will get harder from here on out and that could create more volatility for the NVDA stock price. Nvidia has the advantage of being the first to market a comprehensive solution set for AI computing. AMD has a smaller offering which it has been growing through internal product development and acquisitions. Nvidia is estimated to have 70% or more market share in AI chips. AMD's market share is probably closer to 10%. AMD is a safer bet than Nvidia stock as a long-term play, though both companies are poised for bright futures. AMD's valuations are more reasonable, and Nvidia may be closer to seeing its growth level off. Both companies provide high-performance, AI-capable processors and related products and services including software for application development. Nvidia's platform CUDA is proprietary, while AMD's ROCm is open source. Open-source applications are more flexible but can also be more cumbersome.

Intel remains dominant, but AMD has been a formidable competitor—at least since CEO Lisa Su spearheaded the launch of the company's high-performance Zen architecture in 2017. Five years later, AMD's market capitalization passed Intel's for the first time. AMD is now targeting the AI market and Su has made some key moves to compete with Nvidia. She quadrupled the company's R&D budget and acquired Xilinx, Nod.ai and ZT Systems. Xilinx makes programmable processors, Nod.ai develops open-source AI software and ZT Systems' designs and manufactures servers and related infrastructure for data centers. AMD does not yet compete meaningfully with Nvidia. For the most recent quarter, AMD's data center revenues were less than 10% of Nvidia's. But as Intel struggles, AMD is positioning itself to secure a double-digit share in AI chips—which should be a sizable opportunity going forward.

Nvidia and AMD won't necessarily compete head-to-head for AI-related revenue. Let's look at their go-to-market strategies to understand why. Nvidia's original AI strategy was to be first and best. And the company has capitalized on this approach. Huang's strategic vision combined with a proven product development process provides some insulation from even the best AI stocks. As well, Nvidia doesn't just make AI chips. The company maintains an entire platform around those chips, including optimized software and libraries, to support application development from start to finish. This platform approach is another competitive advantage that could make customers reluctant to switch to another provider. AMD has played catch-up with Intel for years, and the company will likely use similar tactics to take a piece of the AI market from Nvidia. Providing better value is the crux of the strategy. AMD can do that by offering more performance for the price. That could mean similar performance at a lower price or slightly lower performance with a much smaller price tag. Providing and pitching a comprehensive AI computing platform has been a lesser focus for AMD. However, the company has taken steps to broaden its offering. The recent acquisition of ZT Systems, for example, enables AMD to deliver a full set of computing and storage resources required to power AI data centers. Nvidia's trailing 12-month revenues sum to about $96 billion, which is nearly four times more than AMD's $23 billion. The earnings comparison isn't quite as lopsided, with Nvidia delivering diluted EPS of $2.13 to AMD's $0.84. Both companies report AI-related revenues within their data center divisions. Nvidia's data center revenue in the most recent fiscal quarter was $26.3 billion, up 154% from the prior year. AMD produced data center revenue of $2.8 billion, up 115% year over year. The table below shows market capitalization, forward P/E ratio, price/book ratio, PEG and stock price upside for Nvidia and AMD. Table data sources: Yahoo Finance, Market Beat. As you can see, Nvidia is a much bigger enterprise. Its market cap of $2.89 trillion makes it the world's third-largest public company, ahead of Alphabet and Amazon. Nvidia's valuation metrics, particularly the price/book ratio, are also well higher than AMD's. However, the upside according to analyst price targets is comparable. You may also want to see what we think Nvidia will look like in five years. Nvidia has a dominant market share position plus a reputation as the AI chip leader. AMD is working to establish itself as a solid second option. Fortunately for AMD, the AI chip market is predicted to be large enough to be lucrative for two companies. Su has predicted global spending on AI accelerators to reach $400 billion by 2027. If AMD could capture 20% to 30% of that, the company's data center revenues could increase sevenfold. It's also likely that the tech companies investing in AI infrastructure will want more than one supplier and more than one software stack. AMD's development software, ROCm is an open-source solution, while Nvidia's CUDA is proprietary. CUDA has a strong reputation, but some projects may require the flexibility of AMD's open-source solution.

Multiple research companies and AMD's CEO have predicted strong double-digit annual growth for AI infrastructure spending over the next several years. The growth opportunity is somewhat different for our two companies, however. In short, Nvidia will be playing defense, while AMD plays offense. With a running start in the AI space, Nvidia now owns an estimated 80% market share. The quick rise to the top created extreme growth in revenues and profits, as tech companies rushed to build out their AI capabilities. Unfortunately for Nvidia, the spending may moderate just as competitors come to market with viable alternatives. Nvidia can find growth, however, by doing what it does best: pushing the limits of what high-performance computing can do in terms of speed and efficiency. Improving its platform to bring AI computing to a wider market could be another source of growth. The company won't be complacent under Huang's direction. Nvidia has recently shortened its product refresh cycle from two years to one year—presumably to keep pace with AMD's update cadence. AMD has more to gain and less to lose than Nvidia, which is the more interesting position to hold. AMD chips are currently cheaper and about 80% as powerful as Nvidia's according to AI software firm MosiacML. After testing AMD MI250 alongside Nvidia A100 last year, MosiacML CTO Hanlin Tang believes AMD can close the performance gap. That will be AMD's path to solid market share and revenue gains, especially if the company stays competitive on price and can produce enough to meet demand. Both companies will have to manage supply constraints, regulations that limit the revenue opportunity in China as well as rising competition. But they also face specific challenges related to where each stands in its AI growth trajectory. Nvidia's biggest challenge will be defending its position. The sheer size of the market ensures fierce competition as GPU makers position themselves for a piece of AI spending. To keep from losing market share, Nvidia will need to innovate and execute product rollouts flawlessly. Ongoing improvements in speed and efficiency will support higher spending even as the initial AI buildout slows. In the absence of impressive product upgrades, Nvidia could face share losses as spending moderates. That would be a revenue headwind, which likely won't sit well with Nvidia investors. AMD's primary challenge is establishing itself as the best second option in AI, while integrating four acquisitions made in the last two years. The acquisitions should support a more favorable competitive position, but it won't be enough to overtake Nvidia's dominance. So, the big risk for AMD is missing its target and ending up competing for the third or fourth position in the industry. Supply constraints or strategic, product or execution errors could open the door for another player like Intel to win market share. For more information, see Nvidia vs. Intel. Analysts are optimistic about Nvidia stock and AMD stock. Both companies have an average rating of strong buy. With 40 analysts reporting on Nvidia, there are 20 strong buys, 17 buys and three holds. No one is recommending investors sell their NVDA positions. The 30 ratings for AMD include 15 strong buys, 11 buys and four holds. As with NVDA, analysts don't see a case for selling AMD currently. To evaluate market sentiment, we can look at NVDA and AMD stock price trends relative to the broader market. NVDA has outperformed AMD and the S&P 500 by a wide margin over the last six months. Nvidia is up nearly 30%, the S&P 500 grew 10% and AMD has fallen 14%. Performance in the last month, however, shows Nvidia as the loser. The company lost 10%, while AMD and the S&P 500 made slight gains. This is partly a function of Nvidia's high valuation, which makes it more reactive to economic news. AMD is the better AI stock in terms of value and upside. Yes, the company is an underdog that's unlikely to replace Nvidia as the recognized AI leader. But, AMD has operated from second place before and thrived under its current leader Su. Plus, the addressable market is so large that a smaller share position still means massive growth for AMD. Nvidia already has a huge growth record going for it, but the company is quickly lapping the big AI-related gains it has generated to date. Comparisons will get harder from here on out and that could create more volatility for the NVDA stock price. Nvidia has the advantage of being the first to market a comprehensive solution set for AI computing. AMD has a smaller offering which it has been growing through internal product development and acquisitions. Nvidia is estimated to have 70% or more market share in AI chips. AMD's market share is probably closer to 10%. AMD is a safer bet than Nvidia stock as a long-term play, though both companies are poised for bright futures. AMD's valuations are more reasonable, and Nvidia may be closer to seeing its growth level off. Both companies provide high-performance, AI-capable processors and related products and services including software for application development. Nvidia's platform CUDA is proprietary, while AMD's ROCm is open source. Open-source applications are more flexible but can also be more cumbersome.

Title: Feminism, Debt and Organizing Against Argentina’s Far Right
URL: https://inthesetimes.com/article/feminism-debt-argentina-far-right-milei-organizing
Time Published: 2024-09-23T18:27:00Z
Full Content:
BUENOS AIRES — As part of the Ni Una Menos (Not One Less) Collective in Argentina, we have been organizing feminist strikes and actions against the far Right’s austerity plan and its attacks on the rights of women and LGBTQI+ communities. We hope to offer an analysis from a feminist perspective that our movements can apply in the fight against debt under the new, far-right administration of President Javier Milei. Milei assumed office in late 2023 promising deregulation and ​“chainsaw cuts” and quickly began ushering in a slew of austerity measures that have targeted a spectrum of public services, including universities. He also closed Argentina’s anti-discrimination agency and the ministry that handles women’s affairs. We have been developing strategies for collective organizing against debt and the financial colonization of everyday life. This analysis is somewhat novel in Argentina, and we find it fundamental to understanding this moment of Milei’s ascendance. For the first time in our history, the Argentine state spends more on debt payments than pension payments. Under Milei, household debt has also intensified alongside the deregulation of prices for basic goods and services. In researching our book, A Feminist Reading of Debt, we found a large number of women were in debt from purchasing those types of goods and services needed for social reproduction (such as taking care of families and repairing homes, among many others) — a situation exacerbated by Argentina’s agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2018. We call this ​“indebtedness to survive.” Alongside intellectuals like Silvia Federici, we think about the financial colonization of social reproduction as the invasion of finance into increasingly broader areas of life. That’s the context in which we approach the inherent antagonism of the term ​“financial caste.” We use the term in a very precise sense, which must be contrasted with how Milei and his libertarian political force have popularized the use of the word ​“caste.” They use this (and other terms) to present themselves as ​“outsiders,” signaling the political class as the cause of the problems that working people in Argentina face, which excludes the directors of major corporations and financial elites and institutions (banks, the IMF, investment fund managers, businessmen tied to digital finance) that benefit from crises in the Argentine economy. We refuse to let Milei hide his close ties with financial powers and corporations, which he obfuscates by redefining the language of his capitalist conservatism. We are forced to underscore the true meaning of ​“caste” for him and mark a concrete antagonism between the feminist struggle and those who try to profit from financial speculation at the expense of our bodies and spaces. We have outlined some of the lessons we have learned through our processes of resistance to the neoliberal shock policies applied by the extreme right — and we hope they can fuel others in their fights against far-right leaders devoted to corporations and the suppression of women and the working class. 1. For Milei, to govern is to destroy, create chaos and exercise cruelty The two novel characteristics of the neoliberal shockwave we are living through are its speed and violence. Milei derives his power from his links with hedge funds (like BlackRock) and powerful, extractivist corporations and the ultrawealthy (hence his frequent visits with Elon Musk). These deep ties are appearing as Argentine society is being reconfigured by new extremes of capitalism toward an extractive, warlike model. This system of governance is sustained through three vectors: the capacity for destruction (mass firings, elimination of entire state organs, destruction of social ties fostered by community groups); the creation of chaos (neoliberal shock politics and the imposition of new policies and norms, some of them unconstitutional); and the deployment of cruelty (withholding food from the poorest — and taking pride in it). None of it is about excesses or inadequacies but is a form of politics necessary to foster crisis and war. 2. We need to center decolonization There’s not much use arguing whether Milei is a symptom of the local impact of a global phenomenon, or an extreme national idiosyncrasy. So to better understand what is actually happening, we must consider what is new about Milei and to what degree his entrenchment in Argentine politics and society is not particular to national specificities and personal eccentricities. The impact of Milei’s far-right government, for example, exceeds former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro’s — because the crisis of the genocide in Gaza and the alignment of the United States and Israel have permitted Milei to approach the genocide on his own terms. But Milei too can be differentiated from the exponents of the far right of the Global North, like former U.S. President Donald Trump, because Milei does not operate with nationalism as the engine driving his regime. Instead, Milei’s project is neocolonial, from which he draws his power and effectiveness. As we have previously argued, neoliberalism in our region is inherently violent from its origins. The military dictatorship of 1976 — the moment at which the neoliberal model was applied — cannot be understood separate from the massive repression of popular uprisings. This authoritarianism is not an a posteriori deviation, and in that same way, the violence stemming from neoliberalism in Argentina is tied to processes of recolonization. We are now witnessing a new phase of that recolonization, which can be called ​“financial colonization” (including IMF austerity programs in various countries and the increasing presence of hedge funds targeting natural resources) and ​“military colonization” (as in the case of many Latin American countries, like Ecuador and Haiti, where the possibility of an internal war makes way for colonial domination). There is talk in Argentina of a form of national dissolution that would segment the country into sacrifice zones (with entire provinces linked to the activity of extractivist corporations), so centralizing the need for decolonization (by opposing vocabulary, terminology and practices) becomes a critical tactic. 3. Building power and redefining violence Feminists often think about the intersections of war to identify the emerging coordinates of violence. The war against the conditions of social reproduction (withholding food, liberalization of the prices of fundamental goods and services, freezing salaries) — as well as the war against the conditions for the reproduction of struggle (the economic crisis and debt that makes organizing and demonstrating nearly impossible) — is articulated with war as the global stage, meaning the far right can appeal to residents by polarizing localities that protest. Militarization is the highest stage of financial warfare, which is appearing in Ecuador, Haiti and Argentina (among others) in conditions somewhat similar to circumstances in Africa in the 1980s. Federici, using this perspective, highlights the necessity of generating a feminist antiwar movement to resist this militarization and financial warfare As militant activists and organizers ourselves, we have been obligated to rethink how we categorize and define violence. We have long been saying that violence fueled by toxic masculinity is incomprehensible without being embedded within a system of ​“economic violence,” which has transformed and intensified into ​“financial violence,” which (to invoke Étienne Balibar’s formulation) conforms to capitalism’s aim to become ​“absolute.” 4. Argentina is a laboratory for the rest of the world Milei’s far right is trying to channel a neoliberalism in crisis into relaunching a neo-extractivist project and agenda in the global market, particularly surrounding energy and lithium. One new development is that Milei’s government is not willing to make concessions in the face of increased social conflict. To affirm that Milei’s regime has fascist elements is not to say the majority of his voters are fascists. In fact, a great deal of his support can be explained through everyday economics. It’s a terrain that seems to be disregarded time and again in its inexorable materiality and, as such, in its political rationality. In the feminist movement, we have situated this link between fascism and everyday economics as a fundamental perspective to comprehend the economic violence endured by those who sustain the domestic economy, who go into debt just to survive while hearing from Milei that ​“there is no money” or ​“we’ll need to make sacrifices.” It presents our greatest challenge as anti-debt militants: How do we do politics when the language of austerity becomes the popular language? 5. The streets are a vital space The feminist marches that saw participation from hundreds of thousands of women in cities across Latin America on March 8 (International Women’s Day), including tens of thousands in Buenos Aires, were remarkable for several reasons. We used them against a far-right government that has publicly declared us to be the enemy, has defunded the right to abortion and has campaigned publicly with racist and misogynistic discourse. We organized in spite of the repressive protocol that criminalizes protest, which made self-care essential. And it was all in the midst of Milei’s government waging an economic war against the Argentine population, which makes organizing and mobilizing a huge undertaking. The greatest beneficiary of these neoliberal shock policies is the financial caste. The policies are enacted with the idea that feminized bodies, in ever more precarious conditions, will take on more work to sustain life. We will fight back through feminism of the people.

Title: AI Chip Maker Alphawave Sees Stock Tumble On Revenue Drop

Alphawave Semi was valued at £3 billion ($4 billion) when it debuted on the London Stock Exchange in ... [+] May 2021. Photographer: Tiffany Hagler-Geard/Bloomberg Alphawave Semi surprised investors this morning when the semiconductor company released interim earnings results that sent its London-traded shares tumbling by as much as 43% before paring the losses to finish the day down by 14%. Alphawave’s leadership said on Monday that it had to cut its revenue forecast for 2024, but still expects to hit its targets from next year onward. The chip designer said it now expects to generate revenue of $310 to $330 million in 2024, down from the $345 to $365 million it had projected earlier. Alphawave blamed the change in its outlook on the merger of two large AI customers in Korea as well as the timing of tape-outs in the second half of the year. Tape-outs occur when Alphawave has completed its work and transfers the finalized design of a semiconductor device to chip foundries for fabrication. The Canadian company does not actually manufacture the chips. Instead, Alphawave focuses on developing the technology within semiconductors that allows them to transmit data more rapidly for use in artificial intelligence. “Another guidance cut isn't helpful but the important part for us, we believe, is the underlying business remains strong and visibility on 2025 is improving, aided by Alphawave being exposed to the best end market in semis–AI,” Barclays analyst Simon Coles said in a note to clients. Barclays maintained an overweight rating on Alphawave’s shares, but lowered its price target to 190 pence from 195. The company’s shares closed Monday at 107.8 pence. “Our OW [overweight] is predicated on the fact that Alphawave only needs to take a little market share to see material growth in the coming years given the growth expected in its end markets,” Coles added. Alphawave’s filing on Monday showed that its revenue had been halved in the first half of the year to $91 million. The company also reported an adjusted net loss before depreciation, interest and taxes of $11.8 million, after booking a profit of $32.4 million in the same period last year. “We expect revenue and adjusted Ebitda in the second half to increase significantly over the first half as our high-quality design wins from last year tape-out and convert into revenue,” John Lofton Holt, executive chairman of Alphawave, said in its filing. Alphawave first debuted on the London Stock Exchange in May 2021 with a listing price of 410 pence and the backing of blue-chip asset managers BlackRock and Janus Henderson. In late 2021, the Financial Times raised questions over whether it had properly disclosed related-party transactions. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

September 23, 2024 13:57 ET | Source: Force For Good Force For Good LONDON, Sept. 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Force For Good: The world is failing to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and urgent action is needed to unlock progress and overcome the growing annual SDG funding gap, which now stands at US$14-17 trillion, a new report from Force for Good finds, US$112-136 trillion in total, up 10%, due to the costs of global climate transition and development needs in the Global South. Today, only 16% of the goal’s 169 underlying targets are on track to be met by 2030, with 50% falling behind, and 30% regressing below their 2015 levels when the SDGs were kicked off, the report finds. Nine ‘Big Ideas’, including climate transition frameworks, AI-enabled connectivity, and universal digital financial services, if scaled globally, have the cumulative potential to progress SDG achievement to nearly 90%, from less than 66% today, reigniting exponential progress. “This report shows how the global order and the systems itself can be transformed by delivering solutions en masse across the planet, engaging everyone in this endeavour ... By leveraging the strengths of governments, private companies, NGOS and mobilising the individual as an agent of change, we can create a sustainable, secure, and prosperous future,” said Ketan Patel, Chair of the Advisory Council. The world’s failure to meet the goals is being driven by a series of interrelated economic, political, geopolitical and environmental shocks - including the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine and Gaza, the energy, cost-of-living and climate crises – interacting with one another to create a ‘polycrisis’ that is diverting attention and resources away from sustainable development. A mass and fast roll out of the ‘Nine Big Ideas’, sponsored by appropriate champions across government, private sector or multi-lateral institutions, working with the United Nations, can make a transformative impact on developing countries, while benefitting the global economy. While the mass mobilisation of solutions will take a global effort, the largest developing countries, particularly India, China, and Brazil, account for two-thirds of the world’s sustainable development potential. These countries represent the first wave of opportunity in a multi-wave project to realize the future faster. Meeting the SDGs is a crucial step for the world in the transition to the next era of human civilization, building a platform on which further breakthroughs and technologies can create a sustainable, secure and superior future. About Force for Good Force for Good's mission is to mobilize capital, resources, and ideas as a force for good in the world at a time of profound change. The organization's Capital as a Force for Good Initiative engages the world's leading financial institutions and other stakeholders, to promote sustainable development through the deployment of capital and solutions to address global issues and enable the transition to a better future.

Novo Nordisk's (NVO) U.S.-listed shares lost ground Monday, a day before a Senate hearing on the costs of the company's popular weight-loss drugs Wegovy and Ozempic. CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen is scheduled to testify Tuesday from the company’s home in Denmark before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. The committee accused the company of charging "outrageously high prices" for its treatments. The committee said Americans with Type 2 diabetes pay $969 a month for Ozempic, compared to $155 in Canada, $122 in Denmark, and $59 in Germany. It added that Americans are charged $1,349 a month for Wegovy, more than the $186 in Denmark, $140 in Germany, and $92 in the United Kingdom. In an interview with NBC News last month, Jorgensen defended the company’s pricing, saying that insurance coverage varies from country to country, and that most Americans with health insurance pay $25 a month for Wegovy. Novo Nordisk shares were down 3.3% at $123.55 in intraday trading Monday, extending Friday's losses after the company reported disappointing results from a study of an experimental weight-loss treatment. Still, they are up about 19% from the start of the year. TradingView

Constellation Energy (CEG) has received positive analysts' reports after the power utility's announcement last Friday it would be restarting Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear plant to provide electricity for Microsoft's (MSFT) data centers. Barclays analyst Nicholas Campanella wrote in a note to clients that the move was "somewhat unexpected by the market," and that Barclays sees it "as positive" for the company, as well as for Talen Energy Group (TLN) and Public Service Enterprise Group (PEG). Campanella has an "overweight" rating on Constellation, with a price target of $211. KeyBanc analysts said Constellation's deal with Microsoft "suggests attractive economics" and they expect "positive momentum to continue." The called it "an important catalyst in demonstrating the value of nuclear generation" in the age of artificial intelligence (AI). KeyBanc has an "overweight" rating on the stock as well, and it also raised the price target to $265 from $230. The news on Friday sent Constellation Energy shares skyrocketing 22% to an all-time high. Although they are little changed in early afternoon trading Monday, they have gained about 120% year-to-date.

Title: Italy approves BlackRock holding more than 3% in Leonardo

ROME (Reuters) -Italy has approved BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), the world's biggest asset manager, holding a stake of more than 3% in Italian defence and aerospace group Leonardo, a document seen by Reuters showed on Monday. The document, sent by Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's office to parliament, deals with so-called "golden power" decisions. Rome has "golden powers" to block or set conditions on foreign and domestic investments, as well as governance changes, involving companies that operate in strategic sectors such as energy, telecoms, defence and banking. "I am happy for the interest of BlackRock. It is an important recognition," Leonardo chief executive Roberto Cingolani told Reuters. The cabinet granted the authorisation to BlackRock on Sept. 18 while also imposing some unspecified conditions, according to the document. Under Italian legislation, Meloni's office must approve share ownership in any strategic firm which is also listed on the Milan stock exchange when the stake crosses thresholds set at 3%, 5%, 10%, and various other intervals up to 50%. However, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters BlackRock was expected to trim its stake in a short time, as Leonardo's bylaws stipulate that no investor outside the public administration can own more than 3% of capital. Italy's economy ministry owns 30.2% of Leonardo, the country's leading defence group as well as a manufacturer of satellites and orbiting infrastructure. BlackRock is also a leading investor in Italy's financial sector, holding 7% of UniCredit and 5% of Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY), the country's top two banks.

Title: Danish PM shrugs off risks of Ozempic maker’s economic dominance
URL: https://qz.com/denmark-novo-nordisk-nokia-1851654843
Time Published: 2024-09-23T16:29:00Z
Full Content:
Denmark Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen downplayed concerns that Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk (NVO), the Scandinavian nation’s largest corporation, could someday drag down its economy the way the once-dominant Nokia (NOK) did to Finland in the 2000s. With a market value of $570 billion, Novo Nordisk has surpassed Denmark’s annual GDP. However, Frederiksen told Bloomberg on Monday that she didn’t see any risk associated with the size of Novo Nordisk. “I am extremely proud that we have big, now global, companies coming from Denmark. I don’t see a lot of risks with even the size of some of the companies, because we have a very strong economy also in other sectors,” Frederiksen said. “But we have of course to watch it.” Unrelenting demand for Novo Nordisk’s diabetes and weight loss drugs has made Novo Nordisk the most valuable company in Europe, surpassing luxury conglomerate LVMH last year. The Danish pharma giant helped boost the nation’s GDP in 2023 and is expected to do so again in 2024. The Nordic country’s largest bank, Danske Bank, forecast earlier this year that Denmark’s GDP will grow 2.1% in 2024, due primarily to Novo Nordisk. In 2023, Denmark’s GDP grew 1.8% — and much of its boost is owed to the pharmaceutical industry. Without pharmaceuticals, the agency says, the country’s GDP would have instead fallen 0.1%. Leading that growth is Novo Nordisk, with analysts expecting continued sales increases. Morgan Stanley analysts anticipate that the global market for GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic will reach $105 billion by 2030. The company reported in January that its 2023 sales jumped 31% to 232.3 billion Danish kroner ($33.8 billion), compared with 177 billion Danish kroner ($25 billion) in 2022. It also projects sales will increase by up to 22% to 28% in 2024. The situation is beginning to resemble Finland’s past reliance on Nokia, the once-dominant telecommunications company. According to estimates from the Finnish Economic Research Institute, Nokia accounted for 25% of Finland’s GDP growth between 1998 and 2007. But when rising competition from Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOGL), and Samsung in the smartphone market led to Nokia’s rapid decline in the early 2010s, Finland faced significant economic challenges. This downturn, combined with the effects of the Great Recession, resulted in widespread job losses and ushered in over a decade of economic difficulties for the country. Addressing concerns that Denmark could face similar challenges with its reliance on Novo Nordisk, Frederiksen emphasized the country’s economic diversity. “A good thing is that our export portfolio is spread across several areas that are less sensitive to the business cycle than in other places,” she said. Denmark is also home to other major companies like Carlsberg, AP Moller-Maersk (AMKBY), Vestas Wind Systems (VWDRY), and Lego.

U.S. equities were up slightly at midday to start the new week after last week's excitement over the Federal Reserve's 50-basis-point (bps) interest-rate cut sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average to an all-time high. The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq were all in the green. Tesla (TSLA) shares gained after Goldman Sachs said next month's planned robotaxi reveal could be a catalyst for the stock. Shares of Palantir Technologies (PLTR) and Erie Indemnity (ERIE) were higher on their first day as members of the S&P 500. Shares of Newmont (NEM), Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), and other gold miners advanced as the price of the precious metal hit a record high. General Motors (GM) shares declined after Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Mary Barra reiterated that the automaker would make only electric light-duty vehicles by 2035 even as EV demand slows. Shares of Ulta Beauty (ULTA) dropped when TD Cowen downgraded the stock, citing lower demand and increasing competition. American depositary receipts (ADRs) of Novo Nordisk (NVO) slipped ahead of tomorrow's Senate hearing on the drug maker's pricing of its wildly popular Wegovy and Ozempic weight-loss treatments. Oil prices were lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose slightly. The U.S. dollar climbed against the euro, but lost ground to the pound and yen.

The pension giant also committed another $1 billion to a BlackRock climate fund after dumping nearly $4 billion in public equities earlier this year. The New York State Common Retirement Fund cashed out of three multi-asset strategic partnerships worth more than $3 billion during July, according to its latest monthly transaction report. The $268 billion pension fund also committed $1 billion to a BlackRock climate change fund, marking the second straight month it invested in public equities after terminating a combined $3.8 billion worth of equity funds in March and April. The NYSCRF ended a Schroder Investment Management multi-asset fund within its multi-asset strategic partnership portfolio that was worth approximately $1.2 billion, which was allocated to cash. It also terminated multi-asset funds managed by Morgan Stanley Investment Management and Wellington Management, respectively, which were worth $1.1 billion each and were also allocated to cash. Within its public equities portfolio, the pension fund doubled its investment in BlackRock’s MSCI Climate Change Index to $2 billion. The commitment follows an initial $1 billion investment in January 2023. The fund tracks an index that measures opportunities and risks associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy. It was up 31% in 2023 and 15% annually over five years.

Title: Qualcomm has good reasons to bid for Intel — but a takeover probably won't happen
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/intel-challenges-qualcomm-pros-cons-takeover-2024-9
Time Published: 2024-09-23T15:32:56Z

If Qualcomm sees it through, its takeover of Intel would likely be the biggest in Silicon Valley history. While it has good reasons to go after the storied chip giant, a lot is working against it. The possibility of Intel handing its 56-year history over to a younger rival emerged last week after several reports said that the California semiconductor firm Qualcomm had approached it for a takeover. Qualcomm is no newbie in Silicon Valley. It was founded in 1985, 39 years ago. Since then, it has grown into a company worth over $188 billion, specializing in areas such as wireless networks, smartphone processors, and modems. But recent trouble brewing at Intel, a longtime chip designer and manufacturer, has apparently given Qualcomm reason to consider acquiring a company that has lost more than half its value this year and dropped to a market capitalization of just over $93 billion. While some of its top competitors, like Nvidia, have soared to new heights as a result of the generative-AI boom, Intel has struggled to capitalize on investor interest in the technology. It has also grappled with production and strategy challenges. The company took a serious tumble in August — a month in which it lost almost $30 billion in market value — after announcing the layoffs of 15,000 employees and a suspension of its dividend from the fourth quarter of this year. It's worth noting that Qualcomm's talks to take over this troubled business are very early stage and exploratory. A person close to Qualcomm told the Financial Times that the company "would only pursue a friendly deal." For some, the logic to pursue the deal is apparent. Speaking on CNBC last week, Patrick Moorhead, an industry analyst, said Intel's exposure to key areas like data centers and the PC market, as well as its chip-manufacturing capabilities — which Qualcomm lacks as it outsources that process to Taiwan's TSMC — meant there were "synergies in this." The company has also taken steps that seem to make it a more attractive purchase. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger announced a set of drastic measures last week to bring change to the company that could set it on a brighter path. He said these included a "multi-year, multi-billion-dollar" deal to work on custom chip designs with the tech heavyweight Amazon Web Services, a pause on plans to build plants in Europe, and the separation of its manufacturing unit, Intel Foundry, into its own entity. That said, not everyone is convinced that Qualcomm needs Intel — or that a buyout would be a good idea for either company. Richard Windsor, an equity-research analyst and the founder of Radio Free Mobile, thinks that while "it is possible to see how Qualcomm and Intel could fit together" — one company designs chips and the other has factories — a lot of Intel's bits wouldn't fit so well. "The vultures are hovering around Intel and while Intel will make a tasty and nutritious meal for some, I think Intel would end up sticking in Qualcomm's crop and give it a bad case of indigestion," he wrote in a note on Monday. He points to a few key reasons. Intel's x86 processors lag behind Qualcomm's and its rival firm Arm's offerings. Redesigning chips to be made by Intel "sounds like a risky proposition," he said, given Qualcomm's "already established excellent relationships" with manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ming-Chi Kuo, a Taiwan market analyst at the financial-services firm TF International Securities, went a step further, saying in a post over the weekend that a takeover of Intel could be "disastrous" for Qualcomm. My industry survey also indicates that Qualcomm is currently in takeover talks with Intel. However, if this acquisition were to go through, it could prove disastrous for Qualcommhttps://t.co/fJ7EozISve His rationale was that Qualcomm's "most critical focus should be on establishing competitiveness in AI chips" for segments like smartphones and that he didn't see an acquisition of Intel helping. It could boost its position in the market for artificial-intelligence PCs, but the analyst said he thought Qualcomm already had a strong standing in that area, with its processors used in Microsoft's Windows on Arm platform — a version of Windows running on Arm technology that Microsoft is committed to. "While the acquisition of Intel could rapidly increase Qualcomm's PC market share, it comes at a significant cost," he wrote. "Qualcomm can grow in the AI PC market even without the acquisition." It's also unclear how Qualcomm would find the cash to buy Intel. The company's cash on hand is $13 billion, but even with its free cash flow, it still falls far short of Intel's price. And the impact on competition would likely spark alarm among regulators. A Qualcomm bid for Intel could face similar regulatory obstacles to Nvidia's takeover attempt for Arm in 2020, which it abandoned in 2022. Intel will, of course, want to consider its options. Bloomberg reported on Sunday that a new option was on the table after the investment giant Apollo offered to make a "multibillion-dollar investment" in the company. That could offer the chip firm vital capital for its new plans and help it stand on its own two feet. Jump to

Alaska Airlines (ALK) said an IT issue was behind an issue with its system that caused flights to be delayed and a ground stop to be issued in Seattle Sunday night. The airline said the issue was resolved around 1 a.m. ET Monday, and told users flight operations and the airline's website should be back to normal. A total of 249 flights from Alaska Airlines were delayed Sunday, about 30% of their total schedule, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware. "Last night, we experienced an IT issue that caused significant disruption to our operation—including delayed flights," the airline said in a statement. "The issue has been resolved, but we expect residual impacts to our operation. We sincerely apologize to our guests who are impacted and are working to get all our guests to their destinations." The company also told Reuters that the incident was not the result of a hack or any malicious activity. Earlier this month, the airline lifted its revenue and profit projections for the current quarter, in part thanks to the struggles of competing airlines during this summer's CrowdStrike (CRWD) outage that delayed or canceled thousands of flights. Alaska Air Group shares were up 2.5% to $41 in early trading Monday and have gained close to 5% since the start of the year.

The transaction, which took place on September 19, involved the acquisition of 15,455 shares at a price of $16.14 each, amounting to a total investment of $249,443. This purchase is notable as it increases Saba Capital Management's holdings in the company to a total of 20,601,568 shares. The investment decision reflects Saba Capital's continued interest in the health sciences sector and its confidence in BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust's performance. BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust is known for its focus on the health sciences industry, which includes sectors like biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices. The trust's investment strategy and portfolio composition make it an attractive option for investors looking to diversify into this segment of the market. As a prominent investment firm, Saba Capital Management's market activities are closely watched by investors and analysts alike. The firm's latest move could signal a positive outlook for BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust, potentially influencing other investors' perceptions of the trust's value and prospects. The investment details were disclosed in a regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which provides transparency into the trading activities of the firm's executives and significant shareholders. These filings are a valuable resource for investors looking to understand the investment patterns and strategies of major players in the financial markets. For those interested in tracking the performance of BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust, the stock trades under the ticker symbol NYSE:BMEZ. As always, investors are encouraged to consider the broader market context and perform their own due diligence before making investment decisions. As Saba Capital Management increases its stake in BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust (BMEZ), investors are evaluating the trust's recent performance and financial metrics. According to InvestingPro data, BMEZ boasts a market capitalization of approximately $1.7 billion, with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 25.31, reflecting the market's valuation of the company relative to its earnings. One of the standout InvestingPro Tips for BMEZ is its significant dividend yield, which currently stands at an impressive 13.19%, as of the last dividend with an ex-date of September 16, 2024. This yield is particularly attractive to income-focused investors who are looking for steady cash flows from their investments. In contrast, a point of concern may be the weak gross profit margins, which could indicate challenges in maintaining profitability relative to sales. Additionally, the valuation implies a poor free cash flow yield, suggesting that the price investors are willing to pay for each dollar of free cash flows is relatively high. Despite these concerns, BMEZ has been trading near its 52-week high, with the price being 96.26% of the peak, indicating strong investor confidence and a potentially bullish outlook among market participants. The trust has also experienced positive total returns across various time frames, with a year-to-date price total return of 17.71% and a one-year price total return of 24.4%.

The HKMA has engaged 11 firms for advanced e-HKD+ digital currency trials, so far. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has announced the launch of the second phase of its central bank digital currency (CBDC) pilot program, known as e-HKD, according to a Sept. 23 statement. The second phase will delve into advanced use cases for digital money, emphasizing e-HKD and tokenized deposits for individuals and businesses. The first phase focused on testing CBDC applications in domestic retail payments, offline transactions, and the settlement of tokenized assets. The HKMA stated that the initiative has evolved from its original e-HKD focus and is now rebranded as Project e-HKD+ to align with the changing fintech landscape. The HKMA has engaged 11 firms from various sectors to investigate e-HKD applications in three main areas, including tokenized asset settlement, programmability, and offline payments. Some of the participants reportedly involved in phase 2 include ANZ, Airstar Bank, Aptos Labs, BlackRock, Bank of Communications (Hong Kong), ChinaAMC, China Mobile, DBS, Fidelity International, Kasikornbank, and Sanfield. The HKMA stated that these firms will evaluate the commercial viability of new digital money forms within real-world settings, aiming to enhance accessibility for individuals and corporations. The results of Phase 2 will provide insights into the practical challenges of creating a digital money ecosystem that integrates both publicly and privately issued digital currencies. Project e-HKD+ will further develop the necessary technology and legal framework to support potential future issuance of e-HKD for both individuals and businesses. To foster collaboration, the HKMA will establish the e-HKD Industry Forum. This platform will enable participating institutions to discuss common challenges and explore the scalable implementation of new digital money forms. Industry-led working groups will address specific topics, initially focusing on programmability. Similar to Phase 1, an e-HKD sandbox will be available for pilot participants to facilitate prototyping, development, and testing of use cases. During Phase 2, the HKMA will collaborate closely with the selected firms over the next 12 months to share key findings with the public by the end of next year. HKMA chief executive Eddie Yue stated: “Project e-HKD+ signifies the HKMA’s commitment to digital money innovation. The e-HKD Pilot Programme has provided a valuable opportunity for the HKMA to explore with the industry how new forms of digital money can add unique value to the general public. The HKMA will continue to adopt a use-case driven approach in its exploration of digital money.” Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Northvolt to axe 1,600 jobs as Europe's EV hopes stall
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/northvolt-to-axe-1600-jobs-as-europes-ev-hopes-stall-3627890
Time Published: 2024-09-23T14:45:47Z
Full Content:
By Marie Mannes STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Northvolt plans to cut 1,600 jobs at its base in Sweden, or about a fifth of its global workforce, as Europe's biggest hope in the electric vehicle battery market struggles with production problems, sluggish demand and competition from China. The leader in efforts to build a European automotive battery industry said on Monday it would suspend plans for a large expansion of its Northvolt Ett factory in Skelleftea, northern Sweden. In an effort to cut costs, Northvolt slimmed down its business earlier this month, departing from its original mission to be an all-in-one shop offering everything from material production and battery making to end-of-life recycling. With Volkswagen (ETR:VOWG_p) among its owners, Northvolt has led a wave of European startups investing billions of dollars in battery production to serve the continent's automakers as they switch from internal combustion engines to EVs. But the Swedish company has struggled with order delays. Problems scaling up production led BMW (ETR:BMWG) to pull a $2 billion order in June. Northvolt said on Monday it would focus on ramping up the first 16 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of annual battery cell production capacity at Northvolt Ett, while shelving a construction project that had aimed at increasing its capacity by another 30 GWh. Currently, the company produces less than 1 GWh and originally planned for the factory to ultimately make batteries for over one million cars a year, at 60 GWh of capacity. Growth in EV demand is also slower than some in the industry projected, and competition is stiff from China, which accounts for 85% of global battery cell production, International Energy Agency data shows. "We are determined to overcome the challenges we face, and to emerge stronger and leaner," Northvolt co-founder and CEO Peter Carlsson said in a statement. "We now need to focus all energy and investments into our core business." The company's R&D hub, Northvolt labs, will slow all programmes and expansion, while maintaining the fundamental platforms, it said. It did not mention the fate of planned gigafactories in Germany and Canada, which are at risk of being postponed. EUROPEAN PROSPERITY Northvolt's "level of ambition and their level of realism at the moment is fairly good in that they're not pushing blindly ahead when it's not working," said Evan Hartley, an analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. Northvolt is still loss-making despite securing orders worth over $50 billion from customers including top investor Volkswagen, underscoring Europe's struggle to compete with the dominance of Chinese battery makers such as CATL and BYD (SZ:002594). The Swedish firm has organised $15 billion in equity and debt financing from a raft of players including Goldman Sachs - its second-biggest investor - and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), according to filings, and has been trying to raise more to fund its ramp-up. It lost $1.2 billion last year, up from a $285 million loss the year before. Its cash on hand at the end of 2023 was $2.13 billion. Former European Central Bank head Mario Draghi warned this month that Europe needed a far more coordinated industrial policy and massive investment to keep pace economically with the United States and China. But many European governments are financially stretched following the COVID pandemic and grappling with anaemic growth. Sweden's Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said on Sept. 13 that while he wanted companies engaged in green technologies to thrive, the government would not take a stake in Northvolt. The government has also said it will not lend to the company. Carlsson said all interested parties should work with the company. "I believe it's important going forward that all the stakeholders we work with now - customers, shareholders, lenders, and also national stakeholders - are contributing to a good long-term solution, because this is about European prosperity and competitiveness," he told Swedish radio.

Title: Microsoft shares downgraded to neutral with no change in price target

DA Davidson has revised its rating on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), transitioning from a "Buy" to a "Neutral" stance, while keeping the price target unchanged at $475.00. The adjustment comes amidst observations that competitors have caught up with Microsoft in the AI segment, which has been a significant factor in the company's previously high valuation. According to DA Davidson, the competitive landscape in AI technology has evolved to a point where Microsoft's leading edge has diminished. This change has led to a reassessment of the tech giant's stock, resulting in a downgrade. Despite this, the firm has decided to maintain the existing price target for Microsoft's shares. The firm's analysis places Microsoft at the fourth position within the Mag6 ranking, a leaderboard of major tech companies that includes Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google's parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), with Microsoft now trailing behind Amazon, Meta, and Apple. The Mag6 is often used as a benchmark to gauge the performance and valuation of leading tech companies. Microsoft's stock performance has been notably robust, with an increase of 92% since DA Davidson initiated coverage in January 2023. This growth outpaced the S&P 500's rise of 49% during the same period, highlighting Microsoft's strong market performance relative to the broader index. In other recent news, Constellation Energy and Microsoft have joined forces to restart a unit of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania. This initiative is in response to the growing demand for electricity by tech companies, particularly for data centers that support advanced technologies. The revival will focus on Unit 1 of the facility, with an investment of approximately $1.6 billion and an expected operational date by 2028. Microsoft has agreed to purchase energy from the reactivated plant for a period of 20 years. Meanwhile, Google has made a significant move into the carbon offset market by purchasing 50,000 metric tons of nature-based carbon removal credits from a Brazilian startup named Mombak. This agreement represents Google's first venture into Brazilian carbon projects and is part of a larger commitment to achieve these credits by 2030. In a recent development, Mizuho reaffirmed its positive outlook on Microsoft shares, maintaining an Outperform rating following the announcement of a new $60 billion share repurchase program and a nearly 11% increase in its quarterly dividend. These financial strategies signal Microsoft's ongoing commitment to returning value to shareholders and confidence in its future performance. Similarly, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)., the parent company of Facebook, has entered into an agreement with BTG Pactual’s forestry arm to acquire up to 3.9 million carbon offset credits. This deal extends through 2038 and is part of Meta’s strategy to achieve net-zero emissions by 2030. The credits originate from BTG Pactual Timberland Investment Group's forest restoration efforts in Latin America. As Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) faces a shifting competitive landscape in AI technology, it's essential to consider various financial metrics that offer a broader understanding of the company's current market position. With a market capitalization of $2.4 trillion, Microsoft stands as a colossal player in the tech industry. The company's P/E ratio, a measure of its current share price relative to its per-share earnings, is 36.79, indicating a high valuation in the market. This is further emphasized by its P/E ratio for the last twelve months as of Q4 2024, which is slightly lower at 36.61. Microsoft's revenue growth remains solid, with a 15.67% increase over the last twelve months as of Q4 2024, showcasing the company's ability to expand its sales. Additionally, the firm's gross profit margin of 69.76% during the same period reflects its efficiency in controlling the costs associated with its goods and services. From an investment standpoint, two InvestingPro Tips highlight Microsoft's financial stability and market presence. The company has raised its dividend for 19 consecutive years, demonstrating a commitment to returning value to shareholders. Moreover, Microsoft is recognized as a prominent player in the software industry, which aligns with its historical performance and the maintained price target by DA Davidson despite the downgrade to a "Neutral" stance. For investors looking for more in-depth analysis and additional tips, InvestingPro offers a total of 15 InvestingPro Tips for Microsoft, which can be accessed through the platform to aid in making informed investment decisions.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) and Samsung Electronics reportedly have been considering building large new chip-making factories in the United Arab Emirates amid surging demand for artificial intelligence (AI) computing. According to The Wall Street Journal, the projects being discussed "involve complexes that could contain numerous factories and cost over $100 billion in aggregate," but "government officials and industry executives say substantial technical and political hurdles remain." Among the hurdles on the technical side: The need for "super-clean water" to rinse silicon wafers—an issue when most of the UAE's water is produced via desalination—and "concerns about the availability of engineering talent to staff major new factories far from the companies' home bases." The report also said that the two companies have had talks with U.S. officials worried that the advanced AI chips produced would make their way to China, a key trading partner of the UAE. Government subsidies globally have been helping the chip industry expand in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. In the U.S., the government has been doling out billions in grants as part of the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 to ensure production is done domestically. TSMC's American depositary receipts (ADRs), which edged higher as markets opened Monday, are up almost 70% this year.

The firm also noted the successful integration of VMWare, which contributed $3.8 billion in revenue. Broadcom's partnership with Tower Semiconductor (NASDAQ:TSEM) for the production of Wi-Fi 7 RF front-end modules (FEMs) was also announced, presenting opportunities for enhanced mobile connectivity performance. Furthermore, KeyBanc Capital Markets maintained its Sector Weight rating on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), citing the introduction of Wi-Fi 7 across all new iPhone models as a potential benefit for Broadcom. Baird reiterated its Outperform rating on Broadcom, highlighting a revised AI-related revenue forecast for fiscal year 2024 of $12 billion, due to robust demand from major cloud service providers. These recent developments underscore Broadcom's strategic moves and potential for growth in the tech industry. In light of Broadcom Inc.'s (NASDAQ: AVGO) latest technological release of the Sian™2 DSP PHY, it's pertinent to consider the company's financial health and market performance, which can provide investors with a broader context for its innovative activities. Broadcom's commitment to growth is reflected in analysts' positive outlook, anticipating sales growth in the current year. This is a testament to the company's robust position in the Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment industry, where it remains a prominent player. From a financial perspective, Broadcom's market capitalization stands at an impressive $799.14 billion, underscoring its significant presence in the market. The company's revenue growth over the last twelve months up to Q3 2024 has been remarkable, at 32.04%, indicating a strong upward trajectory in its financial performance. Furthermore, the company's P/E ratio, though high at 151.43, may reflect market expectations of future earnings growth, supported by a substantial gross profit margin of 74.71% during the same period. Investors looking for stability in returns may find comfort in Broadcom's consistent dividend payments, which have been maintained for 15 consecutive years. The dividend yield as of late 2024 stands at 1.24%, with a notable dividend growth of 15.22% over the last twelve months.

Traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange . Photographer: Michael Nagle/Bloomberg You probably hear about the Dow Jones Industrial Average every day, but how much do you really know about it? Q. What is the Dow Jones Industrial Average anyway? A. It’s a venerable U.S. stock-market index, that Charles Dow invented in 1896. It comprises 30 stocks, which the selection committee at Dow Jones & Co. (now part of News Corp.) considers to be leaders in their industries. Q. Was it always 30 stocks? A. When Charles Dow invented the index, it contained only 12 stocks. Some of the original stocks were American Cotton Oil Co., American Sugar Refining Co., Chicago Gas Co., National Lead Co. and United States Leather Co. Many of the original 12 merged into other companies and none of them are still in the index. Q. Are the stocks equal-weighted in the index? A. Not at all. They are weighted according to each stock’s price. That’s because the index was created before there were computers. Charles Dow added up the 12 prices and divided by 12. As a result of this quaint weighting system, Goldman Sachs (GS), with a stock price of $498.93 as of September 21, has about ten times the weight of Verizon (VZ), with a stock price of $44.33. Unscientific? You bet. Most modern stocks indices, such as the Standard & Poor’s 500, are weighted according to each stock’s market value. Q. Then why do people still pay attention to the Dow industrials? A. Professionals mostly use the S&P 500. But the Dow carries an aura of familiarity, history and tradition. Also, it’s nice to be able to research stocks (even if in a crude fashion) before 1923 when Standard & Poor’s started to publish an index. Q. What’s the highest weighted stock in the Dow? A. At the moment, it is UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH), with a stock price of $575, giving it an 8.9% weight in the average. Q. What’s the most lightly weighted stock? A. Intel Corp. (INTC), priced at $21.84, for a 0.34% weight. Q. What’s your favorite stock among the 30? A. I think highly of JPMorgan Chase and Co. (JPM). The nation’s largest bank, headed by the capable and charismatic Jamie Dimon, should benefit as the Federal Reserve cuts short-term interest rates. Q. What’s your least favorite? A. Probably Boeing Co. (BA). The strike by its machinists will get resolved, but I’m more worried about the long-term fallout from the company’s recent safety failures (most notably, a fuselage panel falling off in flight). To shore up quality and prevent future accidents, I believe Boeing will have to slow production. It will also be burdened with more federal regulatory oversight. Q. Is the word “industrial” in the index’s title misleading? A. A bit. For Dow index purposes, if a stock isn’t a utility or transportation stock, it’s an industrial. Q. What is Dow Theory? A. The theory postulates that a market advance is sustainable if, and only if, the Dow Jones transportation average (which Charles Dow invented in 1884) “confirms” a rise in the Dow Industrials. I’m a bit skeptical of the theory. Services are now a big part of the economy, reducing the importance of transportation. Q. How often do the components of the industrial average change? A. In 130 years, the Dow Jones selection committee has changed the components of the average 58 times. In most cases, more than one stock was replaced. Thus, the average has 30 current members and (if my count is correct) 111 former members. Q. What are the most recent changes? A. This year, Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) was added and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA) was dropped. In 2020, the selection committee added Amgen Inc. (AMGN), Honeywell International Inc. (HON) and Salesforce Inc. (CRM) to the average, eliminating Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Raytheon Technologies Corp. (RTX). Q. Do stocks dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average usually flop? A. Not at all. In fact, during the past 25 years, stocks kicked out of the average has outperformed their replacements. General Electric Co., which was one of the index’s original members, has revived its fortunes (and split into three successor companies) since it was booted in June 2018. GE was replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance, which has fallen 84% in the past five years and was itself kicked out in February 2024. Disclosure: Personally and for clients, I own shares in Pfizer. Some of my clients own Exxon Mobil, Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan. A hedge fund I run has call options on Intel, RTX and Walgreens, and put options on Boeing. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: What's Happening With FMC Stock?

UKRAINE - 2021/05/31: In this photo illustration the FMC Corporation (Food Machinery and Chemical ... [+] Corporation) logo is seen on a smartphone and a pc screen. (Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) FMC Corporation stock (NYSE: FMC), an agricultural science company focused on products to improve crop yield and quality, currently trades around $64 per share, roughly 51% below its pre-inflation shock highs of around $131 seen in April 2022. FMC has fared much worse than its peer – CF Industries stock (NYSE: CF) – down 10% over this period. FMC stock has been weighed down after falling sales volume and destocking dampened its financial performance over the last year or so. Its business in Latin America also took a massive hit, with sales down 33% y-o-y in 2023. FMC saw its stock trading at around $101 in June 2022, just before the Fed started increasing rates, and it’s still trading 36% below those levels. This compares with 51% gains for the S&P 500 index over this period. The decrease in FMC stock over the recent years has been far from consistent, with annual returns being more volatile than the S&P 500. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is much less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could FMC face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a recovery? Returning to the pre-inflation shock level of $130 implies that FMC stock will have to gain around 2x from here, and we don’t think that will materialize anytime soon. We do think FMC stock has a some room for growth. It currently trades at 2x trailing revenues, compared to its average P/S ratio of 2.3x seen over the last three years. Notably, the $72 average of analysts price estimate reflects around 12% upside from here. Our detailed analysis of FMC Corporation’s upside post-inflation shock captures trends in the company’s stock during the turbulent market conditions seen since 2022. It compares these trends to the stock’s performance during the 2008 recession. 2022 Inflation Shock Timeline of Inflation Shock So Far: In contrast, here’s how FMC stock and the broader market performed during the 2007/2008 crisis. Timeline of 2007-08 Crisis FMC and S&P 500 Performance During 2007-08 Crisis FMC stock declined 20% from nearly $18 in September 2007 (pre-crisis peak for the markets) to $14 in March 2009 (as the markets bottomed out). It bounced after the 2008 crisis to levels of around $20 in early 2010, rising nearly 40% between March 2009 and January 2010. The S&P 500 Index saw a decline of 51%, falling from levels of 1,540 in September 2007 to 757 in March 2009. It then rallied 48% between March 2009 and January 2010 to reach levels of 1,124. FMC’s Fundamentals Over Recent Years FMC Corporation’s revenue declined from $5.0 billion in 2021 to $4.1 billion in the last twelve months. This can be attributed to lower sales volumes amid destocking of its products. A drought in Brazil last year also weighed on its sales. Not only did the company see its sales decline, its operating margin contracted from 22.5% in 2021 to 13.9% now. However, there has been some recovery this year. The company’s Q2 sales were up 4% -y-o-y on an organic basis. The North America region led this growth with sales rising 24% y-o-y. Its adjusted earnings of $0.63 per share were up 26% y-o-y. Looking forward, FMC expects its revenue to be in the range of $4.30 billion to $4.50 billion in 2024, reflecting a 2% decline at the midpoint versus 2023. It expects adjusted earnings to be in the range of $3.02 to $3.64 per share, reflecting a decline of 12% at the midpoint versus 2023. Does FMC Have A Sufficient Cash Cushion To Meet Its Obligations Through The Ongoing Inflation Shock? FMC’s total debt increased from $3.3 billion in 2021 to $4.2 billion now, while its cash decreased from $517 million to $472 million over this period. The company also garnered $481 million in cash flows from operations in the last twelve months. Given that FMC’s market capitalization is $8 billion, a debt level of $4 billion implies a high debt to equity ratio of around 50%. Its cash as a percentage of assets of under 4% is low. This implies that the company’s financial position isn’t great. Conclusion With the Fed’s efforts to tame runaway inflation rates helping market sentiments, we believe FMC Corporation stock has the potential for some gains once fears of a potential recession are allayed. That said, the pressure on the company’s sales volume and a large debt obligation, remains a significant risk factor to realizing these gains. While FMC stock has room for some gains, check out how FMC’s Peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons.

Title: Sam Altman and former Apple executives are making an AI device

OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman is teaming up with former Apple (AAPL) design executive Jony Ive and Laurene Powell Jobs, widow of Apple founder Steve Jobs, to start a new artificial intelligence device company. Ive confirmed the project Tin in an interview with the New York Times published Saturday. According to the former Apple executive, it all started when Airbnb (ABNB) CEO Brian Chesky — a close friend of Altman’s and client of Ive’s design company, LoveFrom — arranged for the pair to meet for dinner last year. From there, Altman and Ive continued to meet, and decided that they would build a new device, with Ive responsible for the design. Ive and Emerson Collective, a firm founded by Powell Jobs, have already contributed, according to the Times. By the end of this year, the startup could reach $1 billion in funding. The secret project already has a physical office space and 10 employees. Key staffers include Tang Tan, who headed product design teams for the iPhone and Apple Watch, and Evans Hankey, who succeeded Ive as Apple’s design chief. Ive left Apple in July 2019 after nearly three decades with the iPhone maker, and founded his own design studio, LoveFrom, shortly after. The Information first reported talks between Altman and Ive over an AI hardware project a year ago. Meanwhile, Altman’s OpenAI, the company behind popular generative AI chatbot ChatGPT, is in talks with several investors to raise billions of dollars in new funding, which would value the company at more than $100 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal. The funding round is reportedly drawing big names, including Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), and chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) — which is in talks to potentially contribute $100 million. The latter owns a 49% share of OpenAI’s profits after contributing approximately $13 billion to startup, including $10 billion in backing in January 2023. Over the past two years, OpenAI has become the most influential generative AI company on the market. ChatGPT hit 100 million weekly users earlier this year, and kicked off the genAI and chatbot boom with the success of its flagship model. With that growth, OpenAI’s influence — and value — has continued to snowball. A deal allowing employees to sell stakes in the company valued OpenAI at $86 billion late last year, nearly triple what it was earlier in 2023.With that growth, OpenAI’s influence — and value — has continued to snowball.

Title: Intel is having a brutal year — but suddenly everybody wants a piece of it

Intel (INTC) is reportedly in talks for two multi-billion dollar deals — including a takeover — as the struggling chipmaker continues to draw interest from investors. Bloomberg, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, reports that alternative asset manager Apollo Global Management (APO) has offered to invest as much as $5 billion. That comes just days after The Wall Street Journal reported that Qualcomm approached Intel with a takeover bid. Intel stock rose 4% to $22.69 per share in pre-market trading Monday. After missing revenue expectations for its second-quarter earnings in August, the once-dominant chipmaker’s stock fell 27%. The company reported revenue of $12.8 billion in the second quarter of 2024, falling short of Wall Street’s $12.9 billion estimates. The earnings miss was partly due to Intel’s decision to “more quickly ramp” its Core Ultra artificial intelligence CPUs, or core processing units, that can handle AI applications, Intel chief executive Pat Gelsinger said on the company’s earnings call. So far this year, Intel has seen its stock slide 54%, as it falls behind new rivals like Nvidia (NVDA) amid the artificial intelligence boom. To help give its business a boost, the Santa Clara, California-based company last month announced a plan to save $10 billion in 2025. That includes reducing its headcount by roughly 15,000, or 15% of its workforce. Gelsinger said these were the “most consequential changes” in the company’s history. Intel has also reportedly hired Morgan Stanley and other advisors to help fend off potential activist investors, according to CNBC. But it’s looking to mount a turnaround, starting with several billions of dollars worth of investments from a pair of lucrative contracts announced last week. The Department of Defense and Department of Commerce announced Intel had been awarded up to $3 billion in direct funding under a part of the Chips Act known as the Secure Enclave, which is meant to expand manufacturing of cutting-edge chips for the U.S. government. Also last week, Intel and Amazon Web Services (AMZN) announced a multi-year, multi-billion-dollar collaboration to advance U.S.-based chipmaking in Ohio. David Dietze, senior investment strategist at Peapack Private Wealth Management (PGC), previously told Quartz that the AWS partnership and additional federal funding could mark the beginning of a turnaround for Intel.

Intel (INTC) shares are surging in premarket trading as Apollo Global Management reportedly mulls an investment, days after another report of a Qualcomm (QCOM) takeover approach; Palantir Technologies (PLTR) and Dell Technologies (DELL) become members of the S&P 500 today; Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) and Samsung Electronics reportedly have been considering building UAE chip megafactories; AstraZeneca (AZN) shares are falling as its breast cancer drug misses its target; and China's sudden call for a press briefing tomorrow is raising expectations of a massive stimulus plan by regulators. U.S. stock futures are edging higher after the Federal Reserve's jumbo-sized interest-rate cut last week. Here's what investors need to know today. Intel (INTC) shares are jumping 4% in premarket trading after Bloomberg reported on Sunday that asset manager Apollo Global Management has offered to invest as much as $5 billion in the struggling chipmaker. The news came after The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday afternoon that Qualcomm (QCOM) has approached Intel about a potential acquisition. Intel shares have lost more than half their value this year. Palantir Technologies (PLTR) stock is slipping 1% and Dell Technologies (DELL) is edging lower in premarket trading as the two companies join insurer Erie Indemnity (ERIE) in becoming members of the S&P 500 today. However, the data-analytics firm and the PC maker have both seen their shares gain in the runup to today's benchmark index entry. The companies will be replacing American Airlines Group (AAL), Etsy (ETSY), and Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO). Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) and Samsung Electronics reportedly have been considering building large new factories in the United Arab Emirates to meet surging demand for artificial intelligence (AI) computing. According to The Wall Street Journal, the projects being discussed "involve complexes that could contain numerous factories and cost over $100 billion in aggregate," but "government officials and industry executives say substantial technical and political hurdles remain." AstraZeneca's (AZN) American depositary receipts (ADRs) are falling about 2% after the pharma giant said its experimental cancer drug datopotamab deruxtecan, jointly developed with Japan's Daiichi Sankyo, failed to meet goals in a Phase 3 breast cancer trial. The news comes just weeks after the Anglo-Swedish firm said a late-stage trial of the same drug didn't significantly improve patients' overall lung cancer survival rates. China announced plans for an ad-hoc press briefing tomorrow on the economy by its financial regulators, including its top central banker—fueling investor hopes that Beijing is planning to issue large stimulus measures to boost the hard-hit economy. Bloomberg reported that some economists are expecting the regulators to cut policy rates or the amount banks need to set aside as reserves, and also measures to support the country's troubled housing market. The People's Bank of China also lowered its 14-day reverse repurchase rate Monday.

Could Oracle (ORCL) be this year’s next big AI-fueled hypergrowth story? It's already had a blockbuster 2024. After a recent runup powered by an upbeat AI-fueled outlook, the database giant has become the second best-performing tech stock in the S&P 500 of the year—trailing only AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA). The surge has thrilled shareholders and enriched founder Larry Ellison, who is in a nip-and-tuck race with Amazon's (AMZN) Jeff Bezos to be the world’s second-richest person. But while some hot stocks get the full backing of Wall Street, analysts are divided about what's next for Oracle. The mean price target on Oracle's shares is currently $174.67, according to Visible Alpha, only a modest 4% above Friday's close. Oracle, with a client base that includes Fortune 500 companies as well as governments, remains one of the world’s leading database enterprise companies, though it faces rising competition from newer rivals in an increasingly cloud-centric environment. And there is plenty of support for Oracle out there, with more than half of the analysts tracked by Visible Alpha currently sporting "buy" ratings on the shares. Jefferies analysts said they believe Oracle could be "getting its mojo back” after attending the company’s recent CloudWorld event, where the tech stalwart said it expects sales to nearly double in the next five years on AI-driven demand for cloud services. Bernstein called Oracle their “top investment idea” after the event, citing Oracle’s cloud services growth, AI vision, and the shift of its flagship database business to the cloud, writing that “the sun shines in the Oracle Cloud.” Recent agreements with Big Three cloud providers Amazon, Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google, as well as its "AI-first cloud architecture" could also play a role in helping Oracle support growth, according to Melius analysts, who see those partnerships as a signal that those companies "need to work with Oracle to keep driving their own Cloud segment growth to please investors." Bernstein analysts said the partnerships could also give Oracle opportunities to introduce its services to new customers, as well as sell existing customers on a wider range of offerings. “Now that the train has left the station, we believe investors will continue to reward Oracle for faster revenue growth,” Melius analysts wrote. Some analysts, however, expressed skepticism about Oracle's ability to deliver on its new growth targets and suggested they could leave the company little room for error. At Oracle's annual briefing for financial analysts, the company said it expects its revenue will rise to at least $104 billion by fiscal 2029, nearly doubling the $53 billion Oracle reported in June for fiscal 2024. The company also raised its sales projection for fiscal 2026 to at least $66 billion, up from an earlier $65 billion. Both of those figures were well ahead of the analyst consensus compiled by Visible Alpha. Citi analysts called the new targets "aggressive" and said Oracle could be “reaching for the sky" with its projections. "It's hard for us to underwrite," they wrote. "We're comfortable on the sidelines.”

The company also raised its sales projection for fiscal 2026 to at least $66 billion, up from an earlier $65 billion. Both of those figures were well ahead of the analyst consensus compiled by Visible Alpha. Citi analysts called the new targets "aggressive" and said Oracle could be “reaching for the sky" with its projections. "It's hard for us to underwrite," they wrote. "We're comfortable on the sidelines.”

Title: Nvidia gets almost half its revenue from just 4 customers. Here's who they might be

When Nvidia (NVDA) reported $30 billion in revenue in its second-quarter earnings results, the AI chipmaker disclosed that almost half of that came from only four customers. While the customers are anonymous in Nvidia’s 10-Q regulatory filing, “Customer A” made up 14% of Nvidia’s revenue, while two customers made up 11%, and the fourth made up 10%. Those sales — representing about 46% of its revenue, or $13.8 billion — “were primarily attributable to the Compute & Networking segment,” the company said. “We have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers, and this trend may continue,” Nvidia said in the filing. Nvidia’s top buyers are likely to include Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) — major players in the generative artificial intelligence boom. Even ChatGPT-maker OpenAI could be one. Here’s what each of these companies, believed to be among Nvidia’s top customers, are doing with its high-in-demand AI chips. In July, Google-parent Alphabet reported sales of nearly $85 billion for the second quarter — smashing Wall Street’s expectations by $840 million. “Our strong performance this quarter highlights ongoing strength in Search and momentum in Cloud,” chief executive Sundar Pichai said in a statement. Alphabet’s Cloud revenue surpassed $10 billion for the first time, while its operating profit was over $1 billion. “Our AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions for cloud customers have already generated billions in revenues and are being used by more than 2 million developers,” Pichai said. And while AI Overviews, the AI search feature rolled out to Google Search in May, initially went awry, generating wrong and even dangerous information, Pichai said the company had made “great progress,” and increased engagement for users between 18 and 24. Google announced in July it was making its fastest, most cost-efficient model, 1.5 Flash, available in the unpaid version of its Gemini chatbot in over 40 languages and more than 230 countries and territories. With 1.5 Flash, Gemini will have “quicker and more helpful responses,” Google said, adding that users would notice improvements to Gemini’s reasoning and image processing abilities. In August, Google brought back Gemini’s ability to generate images of people, after having to pause the feature in February, when users pointed out that Gemini was generating historically inaccurate images of people, including racially diverse Nazi-era German soldiers. Months after Nvidia unveiled its next-generation, highly sought-after Blackwell chips, Amazon Web Services, the largest cloud computing provider in the world, “fully transitioned” its order of Nvidia’s Hopper chips for Blackwell because the “window between Grace Hopper and Grace Blackwell was small,” the company told The Financial Times. In April, Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy said in an annual letter to shareholders the company is “optimistic that much of this world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS.” While Amazon spent about $1.5 billion on Nvidia’s H100 chips in 2023, the company has also built its own chips: Trainium for training its AI models, and Inferentia, a chip for inferencing. Meanwhile, the company is reportedly working on an AI chatbot, internally called “Metis,” to rival OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The chatbot will be accessible through a web browser, and will be powered by one of the company’s internal AI models, Olympus, Business Insider reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter as well as an internal document. Olympus is reportedly more powerful than Amazon’s publicly available AI model, Titan. While Amazon changed the virtual assistant game when it launched Alexa in 2014, the company’s new AI-powered Alexa is not even close to being ready, Fortune reported, citing unnamed former employees. Amazon reportedly doesn’t have enough data nor access to the chips needed to run the large language model (LLM) powering the new version of its virtual assistant. It has also reportedly deprioritized the AI-powered Alexa to focus on building generative AI for its cloud computing unit, AWS. However, an Amazon spokesperson told Quartz its former employees are incorrect and uninformed on its current Alexa AI efforts, and that the Amazon Artificial General Intelligence team has access to both in-house Trainium chips and Nvidia graphics processing units, or GPUs. In March, Amazon completed its $4 billion investment in AI startup Anthropic — its largest investment in an outside company ever. In July, Meta released its open-source Llama 3.1 models that it says are its “most capable” to date. The largest model, Llama 3.1 405B, has 405 billion parameters, or the variables a model learns from training data that guide its behavior. Llama 3.1 405B rivals its closed-source competitors from OpenAI and Google in “state-of-the-art capabilities,” including general knowledge, math, and translating languages, Meta said. The release also included upgraded versions of its 8B and 70B models, which were introduced in April. Meta said it trained the model with over 16,000 of Nvidia’s H100 GPUs, or graphics processing units. Meanwhile, Nvidia announced an Nvidia AI Foundry service for enterprises and nation states to build “supermodels” with Llama 3.1 405B. Meta’s Llama models are used to power its AI chatbot, Meta AI, which is available on Facebook, Instagram, and other platforms. Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s chief executive, told Bloomberg the company is working on Llama 4. In September, Microsoft unveiled “the next wave” of its Copilot artificial intelligence tools in its suite of work apps. The AI-powered features include Business Chat, which databases web data, work data, and business data into a new tool called Copilot Pages, where human and AI-generated data can be edited, added to, and shared between work teams. Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said the new tool was part of his “daily habit.” Microsoft also launched Copilot in Excel with Python, making it possible to use the programming language to work with data in Excel with natural language, not coding. The new Copilot also includes AI-enabled features for Powerpoint, Outlook, Word, OneDrive, and Teams, which Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has said he uses “a lot.” And the company introduced Copilot agents, or AI assistants, that can be used to automate certain business tasks. In March, Business Insider reported that some Microsoft customers were complaining that Copilot was falling short of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. However, employees said Microsoft 365 Copilot had mostly positive feedback, but some customers using older versions of Microsoft’s suite of business tools were expecting the more advanced Copilot to work with it, leading to the unfavorable comparisons with ChatGPT. In May, Microsoft announced Copilot Plus PCs, or its laptops equipped with AI hardware and support for AI applications, that would be available from its major laptop partners, including Dell (DELL) and HP (HPQ). The company said in May it had released 30 “responsible AI” tools with over 100 features to support AI applications developed by its customers on its Azure cloud computing platform. Microsoft’s shares reached a record high in March after it announced its Copilot for Security tool, which it called the AI industry’s “first generative AI solution” for security and IT professionals; it’s trained on “large-scale data and threat intelligence,” including over 78 trillion security signals that the company processes daily, Microsoft said. Tesla, which its founder and chief executive Elon Musk has touted as an AI company, has worked on its Full Self-Driving (FSD) tech for years. The electric vehicle company has been accused of exaggerating its driver-assistance system, but in July, analysts said its latest update was encouraging. “There have been 90+ updates to the FSD system in the last four years, and fully autonomous Teslas still don’t exist,” Alexander Potter, an analyst at Piper Sandler, wrote. But “judging by user reviews on the X platform, version 12.5 is revolutionary.” In September, Tesla unveiled its Actually Smart Summon feature for its S3XY electric vehicles. The feature allows Tesla owners to order their car to drive to their location or another destination via the Tesla app. Another feature, called Dumb Summon, allows owners to move their vehicle forward or backward through the app. Tesla also has a humanoid robot called Optimus in development, which it put on display at China’s World Artificial Intelligence Conference in July. The second-generation robot, which is not yet at full-scale production, is “capable of performing tasks that are unsafe, repetitive or boring,” the company says. In June, Musk claimed that robots will eventually power the company to a $30 trillion market cap. Musk, who also founded an AI startup called xAI, announced in September that its training cluster, called Colossus, is powered by 100,000 Nvidia H100 graphics processing units, or GPUs, and is expected to double in size to 200,000 chips, including 50,000 of Nvidia’s more powerful H200 chips, “in a few months.” In July, he posted a poll on his social media platform X, asking if Tesla should invest $5 billion in xAI, “assuming the valuation is set by several credible outside investors.” When it released ChatGPT in November 2022, AI startup OpenAI kicked off the current generative AI boom that has seen major tech companies, including its partner, Microsoft, spend billions on Nvidia’s chips. Despite its startup status, OpenAI is undoubtedly one of the leaders in the race, with its models consistently outperforming those of its competitors. In September, OpenAI released its series of “reasoning models” that it said can “think” through problems before responding — “much like a person would.” The model series, which is available now as o1-preview through ChatGPT and the company’s API, can handle more complex tasks and problems in science, coding, and math than earlier OpenAI models. The company also announced OpenAI o1-mini, a smaller and cheaper version of the new model, which can help developers with coding tasks. In May, the startup released a flagship model called GPT-4o, which it called a step towards much more natural human-computer interaction.” The model can accept combinations of text, audio, images, and videos, and generate combinations of text, audio, and images, OpenAI said. The company added that the new model was 50% cheaper and twice as fast as its predecessor, GPT-4 turbo. Sam Altman, OpenAI’s chief executive, said in March that he thought its GPT-4 model “kind of sucks.” However, he said ChatGPT-4o “feels like magic to me.”

Title: Twin Insurgency, Irregular War, and Oil Theft in Nigeria and Brazil: An Overview

Twin Insurgency, Irregular War, and Oil Theft in Nigeria and Brazil: An Overview Zachary Z. Horsington This article reviews the concept of twin insurgency and its constituent components of criminal insurgency and plutocratic insurgency in order to illuminate case studies of oil theft in Nigeria and Brazil. Gilman’s concept of twin insurgency represents a fusion of Sullivan’s concept of criminal insurgency, and Bunker’s concept of plutocratic insurgency.[1] Mutually, these concepts are essential to perceiving the threat environment associated with Nigerian and Brazilian oil theft, as both cases feature blurred criminality and politics conducted by a range of networked twin insurgent threat actors and their accomplices. As such, Gilman, Sullivan, and Bunker’s concepts concerning the criminal-plutocratic insurgent nexus will be examined, as well as a number of other corresponding irregular warfare theories, before the Nigerian and Brazilian oil theft case studies are investigated in detail. Crude Oil Barrells, Niger Delta, Stakeholder Democracy, CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 Twin Insurgency Sullivan’s theory of criminal insurgency describes a threat spectrum of criminal evolution between first generation ‘turf’ gangs, and third generation insurgent criminals, differentiated by their politicization, internationalization, and sophistication.[2] First generation gangs are highly territorial, localized, and limited in political scope, though they nonetheless “undermine the ability of the state to perform its legitimizing security and public service functions” through their low-level unlawfulness.[3] They are typically confined to neighborhoods, where their activities are not highly sophisticated, as compared to subsequent generations.[4] Second generation criminal organizations, on the other hand, attempt to coopt “bureaucrats and elected officials of a targeted political or security entity,” for profit motivated reasons.[5] “They may embrace a broader political agenda (albeit market focused), operate in a broader (sometimes multi-state) context, and conduct more sophisticated operations,” as they typically leverage emerging net-warrior capabilities.[6] As compared to first generation gangs, there is more expanded territorial and international reach, more complex internal self-organization, more diversified criminal activity, and typically an increase in violence and/or threats of violence against non-aligned individuals.[7] Finally, third generation entities seek exclusive zones of autonomy, to “de facto (in fact, whether legally or not) transform [themselves] into states-within-a-state,” which are able to leverage “authoritative allocation of values [and resources] in that social or physical terrain”.[8] Thus, “third generation gangs are mercenary/political gangs able to exert a combination of market and political influence to control territory”.[9] Their “evolved political and economic aims” contest, if necessary “the state monopoly of violence in a particular geographic space,” exploiting warlordism, “corruption, privatization of public goods and relativism of all kinds”.[10] Sophisticated criminal insurgents may also leverage near full-spectrum, all-domain capabilities to support their activities when required.[11] Gilman argues criminal insurgents are often fashioned from “the global disenfranchised,” and concurs with Sullivan that they espouse micro-sovereignties beyond mere profit motivation.[12] Such entities “resist, coopt, and route around states as they seek ways to empower and enrich themselves in the shadows of the global economy”.[13] Simultaneously they “deploy their resources to corrupt, coopt, or challenge incumbent political actors,” although the distinction between criminal and political violence is certainly blurred.[14] Conversely, Bunker describes plutocratic insurgents as “high net worth globalized elites,” who seek to insulate themselves from “public spaces and obligations—including taxation—and to maximize their ability to generate profits transnationally”.[15] Through predatory capitalism, corruption, public looting, the privatization of public spaces, stateless tax avoidance, and lobbied tax cuts, plutocratic insurgents evade both the law and accountability in luxurious techno-palaces.[16] Often in consort with criminal insurgents, such threat actors also seek to consolidate favorable transnational micro-sovereign enclaves.[17] Gilman observes that transnational plutocrats increasingly disassociate their personal accomplishments “from the success of the national societies in which they reside”.[18] While some individuals continue to perceive a “debt of obligation to the societies in which they have enriched themselves,” this is a scant and shrinking minority.[19] This has resulted in self-reinforcing positive feedback loops whereby: “plutocratic insurgents increasingly see no reason to contribute anything to their host societies and, indeed, actively contest the idea that citizenship comes with economic responsibilities”.[20] Thus, many are highly open to engaging in corruption, as they see no reflective value or responsibility in influencing efficacious and equitable state functions. Criminal and plutocratic insurgents “thrive in (and indeed try to foster) weak-state environments,” while at the same time their operations reinforce conditions of weakness.[21] They may migrate and attempt to reshape their environment to exclude competitors and insulate themselves from legal and public accountability. Plutocrats have insurgent potential to exploit transnational systems and local grievances overseas to expand their operations. The intersection, overlap, and symbiosis between criminal and plutocratic insurgency is a polycephaly Gilman describes through the concept of “twin insurgency”.[22] Both insurgents frequently cooperate and compete with each other to carve out de facto micro-sovereignties and zones of autonomy by disemboweling and decimating anyone’s capacities to constrain their activities. The final landscape consists of “diverse enclaves of heterogeneous political authority and of non-standardized social-service provisioning arrangements”.[23] As these non-standard arrangements materialize, “national and local authorities proliferate a variety of increasingly one-off exceptions to the general rules, incrementally traducing the liberal notion of equality before the law”.[24] The subsequent “proliferation of exceptional and unique micro sovereignties” enables further “jurisdictional arbitrage,” and non-state demands for “sovereign exceptions”.[25] The twin insurgency may also privately run select services and security traditionally provided by the state, and the civilians who live in these pseudo/semi-autonomous sectors of insurgent control “increasingly recognize the insurgents rather than the hollowed-out state as the real source of local power and authority”.[26] Ucko and Marks argue there may be merit in applying irregular warfare/counterinsurgency approaches to respond to sophisticated organized crime.[27] “The point is not to militarize further the response to organized crime. Instead, counterinsurgency in its theory is a political activity. Its contribution to consideration of organized crime is to cast the phenomenon as fueled by specific political and social drivers which must, alongside the criminal actors, also be addressed”.[28] While Ucko and Marks do not explicitly delineate the threshold whereby a criminal threat actor should be responded to with irregular war/fare approaches beyond traditional law enforcement, Sullivan, Bunker and Gilman’s arguments regarding criminal sovereignty interests transcending greed befittingly provide more clarity on this.[29] This demands the population be considered the center of gravity regarding warfare aspects, and sovereign dysfunction concerning the war itself.[30] Nonetheless, Ucko and Marks highlight how traditional organized crime responses have a “tendency to view the state unquestioningly as a provider, and its enemies as the threat,” which ignores “the very heart of the problem: a lack of government legitimacy and split loyalties among the population”.[31] They emphasize how legitimacy is not static, and instead “subjective, fluid, contextual, and contested; nothing can be taken for granted”.[32] Thus, “the state cannot in any way assume to hold legitimacy merely because it is duly constituted or has legal status”.[33] Ucko and Marks argue that political elites oftentimes are “more interested in retaining power and privilege than addressing the reasons for strife” when tackling irregular war/fare threats.[34] They note tendencies “to militarize even ‘whole-of-government’ endeavors,” and resource allocations in favor of kinetic operations in such situations, both of which realize actions disconnected from any “viable political process that gives military activity strategic meaning”.[35] Legitimacy can be shaped through coercion, although “sustaining cooperation is made easier if co-option also plays a role. Either way, gaining legitimacy means more than emotive affinity; it also involves a self-interested calculation that such loyalty is likely to pay off”.[36] Their arguments reflect “the artificiality of the state in many insurgency-threatened contexts,” and highlight how “in such contexts, the attempted imposition of the state can be deeply counterproductive”.[37] Ucko and Marks advise instead interfacing with “local structures that regulate life away from the state, so that they may be co-opted to benefit both center and periphery within the context of a loosely unified national compact,” as these “local institutions are often seen as more legitimate by the local population”.[38] Ucko and Marks champion “the state underwriting and empowering informal variations on the periphery, thereby satisfying local needs, empowering local political allies, and contributing to a desire to be part of, rather than resist, the state at the heart of it all”.[39] This is – of course – easier to write than realize. However, their arguments provide nuance in perceiving organized crime as “not an extension of a foreign body to the existing system, country or infrastructure,” but instead as a “product of a country’s history, its social conditions, its economic system, its political elite and its law enforcement regime”.[40] They remark that “this is not an invitation to moral relativism”.[41] Instead, their arguments offer a kaleidoscope to consider “why social contracts and political settlements are fueling organized crime,” in order to better “distinguish between crime as a coping mechanism and crime as exploitation,” while – of course – scrutinizing “the state’s role in enabling either”.[42] Doing so may enable better differentiation “between foot-soldiers, who in dysfunctional conditions can readily be replaced, and the organizers of criminal activity, who are more inaccessible and may even enjoy some level of state protection”.[43] Hackett argues that sovereignty defines irregular war.[44] While the population may be considered the center of gravity regarding the warfare, the dynamic construct of sovereignty should be considered the center of gravity for the war itself.[45] Previous discussions surrounding the motivations behind Irregular Warfare are highly dichotomous: there is ‘our’ political will and ‘theirs’.[46] Thus, Hackett’s arguments go beyond and consider dis/functional sovereignty as publicly dynamic and intersocial.[47] Hackett defines irregular war as: “the apotheosis of conflict between the people and the state, a violent dialectic between a faction and a sovereign expressed outside existing political institutions”.[48] He argues that the “intervening factor is sovereign dysfunction, and its presence in the conflict leads to irregular wars in which insurgents, conventional forces, and ­third-party interventions seek to preserve, destroy, or transform the state through organized political violence”.[49] Hackett describes sovereign dysfunction as “the disconnect between a state’s de jure (legally recognized) structure and its de facto behaviour, especially in the liminal space between what the people demand, what the state promises, and what is delivered”.[50] Counterinsurgency understands that there is no military solution, but instead a “military component to a larger strategy that is framed in political ends, flanked by all instruments of national power, working in concert through the direction of a single, unified leadership and grand strategy”.[51] While this seems a basic understanding, Hackett observes throughout the Cold War and the Global War on Terror that thought, practice, and disconnection expose enduring institutional gaps associated with reconciling and interfacing ‘sovereignty’ and public opinion to extinguish irregular threat actors.[52] It is how McChrystal’s Task Force 714 were able to defeat al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) highly efficiently, but could not comprehend the genesis of Islamic State.[53] It is why Afghanistan is governed by the Taliban again today, and how Islamic State and al-Qaeda continue to gain territory across Africa and Asia. This discussion related to sovereignty and irregular war is all the more significant considering climate change and the climate-conflict nexus.[54] Schmidt’s concept of Discursive Institutionalism is particularly relevant here, as is Däniker’s concept of The Guardian Solider.[55] If state security apparatuses seriously want to better understand Irregular War/fare, in identifying the population and sovereignty as its center of gravity, they must function as more dynamic, socially discursive institutions. Lythgoe (2020) argues against hyper-decentralized command: it is not so much how centralized or decentralized your system is, but how dynamic it is in fluidly interpreting the right state, at the right time, for the right context.[56] The same elasticity is required to inform dialogic interactions in the public domain. However, this is all highly counterintuitive for state security apparatuses, which typically consider secrecy/transparency as binary, see public exposure negatively, and seek minimal partnership.[57] It is understood that the Information Revolution has transformed state/non-state capacities into self-organized, leveraged instruments of power in novel, efficient ways. The fields of Netwar and Chaoplexic Warfare examine this potential.[58] General Stanley McChrystal’s concepts of a ‘Team of Teams’ and F3EAD (i.e., find, fix, finish, exploit, analyze, disseminate) represent applications of these ideas at the most sophisticated and classified level.[59] These theories accentuate complex adaptivity and decentralized operations, although they do not explain how the system should best treat independent feedback in the public domain and public partnership. Indeed, a critical short-coming concerning Information Operations (IO) identified by Lieutenant Colonel Norman E. Emery, of the US Army, is that it “neglects a key target of irregular warfare: the relevant population not categorized as adversarial”.[60] Security apparatus-public affairs currently function as a one-way street: operations are coordinated through public channels to either support ‘friendly’ forces or disadvantage ‘adversary’.[61] It is clear that the global threat environment has changed dramatically in the last 25 years. While many of the components of twin insurgency have existed long before Gilman, Sullivan and Bunker, their nexus, hybridization, and capacities today manifest in novel ways that challenge current institutional understanding, jurisdiction, and best practice.[62] As highlighted by Ucko and Marks and Hackett, institutional gaps concerning these threats are not unique to the past or any one nation: more clarity is needed and more discursive methods need to be tested.[63] All these theories are highly relevant to consider when examining Nigerian and Brazilian oil theft, as state responses have been, and continue to largely be, highly securitized/militarized. Nigeria functions as a mono-economy, depending on oil for over 95% of its export revenue, 6-9% of its GDP, and 70% of its total budget expenditure.[64] More than 90% of its oil production occurs in the Niger Delta Region and offshore.[65] The magnitude of oil theft in Nigeria is astronomical. Between 2009-2020, the Nigerian Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) found that 619.7m barrels of crude were lost due to theft and sabotage, valued at ₦16.25t (USD46.16b).[66] Security, repairs, and maintenance of damaged assets cost the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) ₦136b (USD91.48m) in 2023.[67] This is slightly less than the ₦147b (USD98.88m) they spent in 2022.[68] Unprecedented revenue losses were observed between 2019-2022 (USD2.1b, USD1.9b, USD7.2b and USD22.4b respectively).[69] In 2022, losses to theft were upwards of 700,000 barrels per day (bpd).[70] In 2023, National Security Adviser Nuhu Ribadu cited loses of 400,000bpd to thieves.[71] Losses for this year are estimated at 470,000bpd, although many speculate the figures are much higher.[72] This equates to roughly USD700m lost to theft and vandalism each month.[73] In January 2023, Nigeria’s national oil production rate was 1.4m bpd (condensate and crude) [74] – 1.5m bpd was reported in February, falling to 1.2m bpd in March.[75] For the same three-month period this year (2024), the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) reported: 1.6m bpd, 1.5m bpd, and 1.4m bpd respectively (condensate and crude).[76] However, separating crude from condensate reveals: 1.32m bpd in February, 1.23m bpd in March, and 1.28m bpd in April.[77] While the situation may be slightly improving, Nigeria is nonetheless tight-rope walking its OPEC quota of 1.5m barrels per day, and clearly relying on condensate to veneer its production.[78] The state of Nigeria’s oil facilities is also dire. The Federal Government owns four refineries, although none are currently operational.[79] Two may be online by the end of this year.[80] Likewise, out of 57 Petroleum Prospecting Licences (PPL) displayed by the NUPRC, about 33 are non-producing oil blocs.[81] Government security efforts offshore have been successful, although they have arguably displaced and entrenched threats onshore. The International Maritime Bureau indicates a decline in offshore criminality within the Gulf of Guinea since 2021.[82] Nigeria accounted for 17% of reported incidents in 2021, compared to 42% in 2020.[83] While no incidents were reported offshore in 2022, onshore oil theft that year was the worst Nigeria has ever experienced. Indeed, most incidents offshore in 2021 occurred in anchorages, ports and harbors, which should have signaled signs of threat displacement.[84] Considering Nigeria’s oil is produced mainly in the Niger Delta, it is here where the majority of oil theft occurs. The displacement of the pirates closer to the coastline and back ashore since 2022 has only magnified onshore oil theft and the diversity of threat actors involved. The graph below shows NNPC reported weekly cases of theft for the first few months of 2024.[85] Igbintade finds monthly case numbers oscillate around 1,337.[86] Udi (2024) finds the majority of reported theft cases occur in the Central and Eastern regions of the Niger Delta, with less and less occurring offshore in deep water.[87] Figure 1: NNPC Weekly Reported Theft Cases [85] The situation is so bad that Shell recently decided to completely divest its onshore assets and exclusively operate offshore.[88] While the Federal Government recently announced that Shell, Total Energies, and Exxon Mobil have committed to invest USD13.5b over the next two years to increase Nigerian oil output overall, a number of significant challenges need to be overcome before any robust security can be realized.[89] The 1966 anti-Igbo pogrom contributed to the outbreak of Nigeria’s Civil War, although Biafra’s oil wealth and Federal Government opportunism should not be understated as causes as well.[90] As argued by Okwelum, “Biafra’s independence would certainly have cut the nation’s [potential] oil wealth production in half,” which they argue influenced the Federal Government to extinguish any chance at Biafra secessionism.[91] Niger Delta communities continue to experience ethnic disenfranchisement, external exploitation, and livelihood insecurity. Niger Delta underdevelopment and persistent pollution is not merely a product of local criminality and oil theft: persistent federal mismanagement, corruption, and greed define national resource allocation and economic activity.[92] It has been estimated that more than 80% of Nigeria’s oil and gas revenues benefit just 1% of the populous.[93] Simultaneously, 50% of Nigeria has been designated impoverished by the World Bank, and 40% of those under age 25 in the Niger Delta Region are unemployed.[94] The recent removal of government fuel subsidies has not helped to remedy the situation.[95] In 2007, Nigeria’s unemployment rate was 6%; in 2019, it was 30%.[96] More generally, the Nigerian Federal Government has not harmonized economic development and reinvestment into the country’s surging population.[97] Currently at 200m, Nigeria’s population is set to double by 2050.[98] Current policy and practice cannot accommodate such growth. Recent protests highlight how government disenfranchisement is fervent nationwide. Nigerian food inflation stands at 40%, and according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, the country already has the highest number of food insecure people on the planet (31.8 million).[99] The naira (currency) has lost 70% of its value against the US dollar over the past two years, following two devaluations.[100] Petrol prices are rising sharply, and electricity droughts continue to plague large swaths of the population.[101] National food, economic, and power insecurity will continue to magnify instability across the Niger Delta, unless more substantive internal transformation occurs. As such, Niger Delta grievances are likely to persist and deepen. Animosity is also directed against foreign oil corporations, who are perceived to be a neo-colonial presence in-country. They have long been considered by many Nigerians to be dishonest, exploitative, and/or ethnically/religiously prejudiced. In 1993, Shell operations were affected by over 100 communal disturbances, which contributed to the loss of approximately 12m barrels of oil, worth around ₦369b (USD248m).[102] Shell’s recent decision to move exclusively offshore reveals the company’s reduced risk appetite, although the decision is perhaps also influenced by the Supreme Court’s recent ruling in favor of Shell regarding a USD878m oil spill case, which had previously halted the sale of its onshore assets.[103] Local apathy towards foreign oil conglomerates also stems from their reputation (whether warranted or not) for environmental degradation. Corporate community development initiatives have also been lackluster and at times outright counterproductive. They have willing called for harsh security responses against demonstrators, and have paid out millions to co-opt local chiefs.[104] The formal authority of chiefs is still not officially constitutionally defined, and is currently being reviewed.[105] Conflict has spiked before, and will continue to do so, until underlying dysfunctional sovereignty and the Niger Delta’s underdevelopment are addressed. Hundreds of oil facilities were vandalized between 1998-2003, and ethnic militias escalated between 2005-2010 to taking hostages, detonating cars, and attacking installations on-land and at-sea.[106] Losses in revenue related to direct attacks against Nigerian oil infrastructure cost the Federal Government USD6.8b between 1999-2004, and losses sharply increased again around 2006/7.[107] Bish et al. highlight that, while amnesty programs were introduced after the 2008 surge in Niger Delta violence, persistent low intensity conflict since 2012 indicates unaddressed and simmering grievances and tensions.[108] Indeed, the amnesty program itself has been scrutinized for its inconsistent Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) principles, lack of supplementary employment for many militants, sporadic salaries, discrimination, and generous stipends to select militant leadership.[109] The failure of demobilization and youth movements has further augmented the influence of cults, militia, and street gangs.[110] Thus, as argued by Okwelum, the disenfranchised communities of the Niger Delta region perceive oil theft to be a “display of local expertise and an entrepreneurial free market response to local economic dysfunction, chronic energy shortages, and government’s failure to deliver on basic public services,” rather than a criminal activity.[111] Historical legacy, underdevelopment, external exploitation and environmental devastation continue to fuel local resentments which transliterate into criminality, namely oil theft, in an attempt to alleviate “their impoverished condition”.[112] While many Nigerian Criminal Armed Groups (CAGs) espouse separatism or flaunt ethnic and religious sentiments, considering the dire economic situation in the Niger Delta, significant scrutiny is required to decipher and distinguish socio-political interests from financial motivations. Such distinction is necessary to discriminate criminal insurgents from organized criminals. While it is clear that dysfunctional sovereignty is apparent in the Niger Delta Region, clearer differentiation between these threat actors is necessary to better tailor state response. As argued by Okwelum: “The face of the jerry-can-wielding-rural-poor is not the face of oil theft.” Considering the flagrant and widespread corruption, “they are [merely] the foot soldiers paraded before the public as a decoy and deceit”.[113] As argued by Katsina, and Moliki, Nkwede, and Dauda, structural, socio-economic, and political imbalances predominantly fuel Nigeria’s national security threats.[114] Until such factors are adequately addressed, twin insurgency will continue to thrive in Nigeria. Nigerian oil theft is not technologically sophisticated. Basic hot and cold tapping and scooping practices are widespread. Tanker interdiction occurs in littoral waters, and so-called artisanal refineries are pervasive across the Niger Delta Region. A spokesperson for Tantita Security Services Nigeria Limited, a Nigerian private security company led by former militant leader Government Ekpemupolo (a.k.a. Tompolo), recently said that: “Most of the [stolen] oil is locally refined from the Niger Delta. A vessel can bring 10,000tons from Europe, take 60,000tons from Niger Delta, and falsify the documents, claiming it is from Europe”.[115] Trucks are also used to transport stolen oil to “neighboring Cameroon, Niger Republic, Chad and so on. Nigerian oil goes everywhere”.[116] Oil is stored in sacks for handling purposes and camouflage.[117] To pass through the abundance of road blocks in Nigeria, a single number plate will be legitimately registered for transit, and forgeries of the relevant documentation will be used by multiple trucks.[118] No sooner is one tap or distillery shutdown before multiple replacements appear, “in a few hours”.[119] Moreover, “you will find women and children inside the bush working and contributing their share to the oil theft”.[120] Thieves often install CCTV around their taps to provide early warning against security forces.[121] Threat actors have attacked oil facilities with light weapons and explosives; industry personnel have been kidnapped; and many are implicated in egregious inter-ethnic/religious/community human rights abuses. Coordinated industrial action has also occurred. Threat actors are typically armed with indigenously produced small arms, although looting government stores and smuggling have provided more sophisticated weapons. In 2021, The Organized Crime Index ranked Nigeria far higher than the West African average (8 vs 5.5).[122] The Eastern Security Network (ESN) and Boko Haram are both known to loot government stockpiles, and the Cameroonian border towards the Southeast is known to be assailable.[123] Simultaneously, Nigeria’s indigenous arms manufacturing industry is ever-expanding. Indigenously produced models are typically four times cheaper than imported pieces, and a rudimentary pistol can cost as little as ₦3,500 (USD2.4).[124] For perspective, Nigeria’s official minimum wage is ₦70,000 (USD43) per month, although it is likely to be much less in practice. In 2022, a Presidential Committee on Small Arms and Light Weapons estimated that 60% of illegal arms in circulation in Southeast Nigeria are artisanal pieces.[125] Nigeria’s artisanal light arms production is now a fully-fledged local industry, which will significantly complicate future DDR. Irregular threat actor groups associated with oil theft typically operate as cellular networks rather than as hierarchies.[126] Nearly all threat groups are resilient to leadership decapitation as well, as they operate cells, frequently referred to as ‘houses’ or ‘decks’.[127] Most oil thieves do not associate themselves with a specific threat actor group. Group affiliation and overt marketing typically attracts government attention and fierce response. Thus, most oil thieves affiliate informally across ethnic, religious, and community lines. Groups may be temporarily formed or revived, and criminals may participate across multiple groups and localities. Despite the opaque threat environment a few notable groups may be differentiated as insurgent criminals. Other, purely profit-motivated groups exist too, as do other less publicized separatist movements involved in oil theft. Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB): A separatist group founded in 2012 that seeks to re-establish an independent Biafran state.[128] The group commands significant influence over Nigeria’s ethnic Igbo community and claims resource/land rights within Biafra’s historic borders (present-day Abia, Akwa Ibom, Anambra, Bayelsa, Cross River, Ebonyi, Enugu, Rivers, Imo States, Nigeria).[129] Mazi Chika Edoziem (previously deputy) is its new leader, as Nnamdi Kanu (leader since 2013 and British citizen) is currently imprisoned by the Department of State Services (DSS).[130] The group’s spokesman is Emma Powerful. Dr. Fredrick Onyeali and Onyekachukwu Ezemba are the original founders of the current IPOB movement. The group operates the Eastern Security Network (ESN) and Black Marines as security forces. ESN is quite a sophisticated paramilitary entity, evidenced by a prison break in Imo State in 2021, which freed 1,800 IPOB inmates.[131] The group is still very active, and recently claimed the lives of six civilians and five soldiers in Aba.[132] The military responded by launching a raid which attempted to arrest those responsible, although six IPOB were killed in a firefight.[133] In April, 2021, IPOB formally allied itself with the Ambazonia Governing Council (AGovC) and the Ambazonia Defence Forces.[134] The alliance was denounced by the Interim Government of Ambazonia as well as by other Biafran separatist groups. Niger Delta Avengers (NDA): Openly seeks to cripple oil production.[135] Threatened ‘Operation Humble’ in June 2021, a campaign of violence against the NFG, as well as the destruction of oil installations, although no attacks were publicly attributed to them after this statement.[136] Field Commander Tu-ere, (AKA Queen of the Creeks) was assigned to lead the operation, who was previously involved in bombing the Chevron Valve offshore platform in May, 2016; the Shell Forcados 48-inch Export line in June, 2016; and the Exxon Mobil Qua Iboe 48 Crude Oil Pipeline in July, 2016. Known to operate in Ondo, Bayelsa, Edo, Delta, Imo, Abia and Akwa Ibom States, Nigeria.[137] In June last year, NDA spokesperson Mudoch Agbinibo called for: “The international community to come and support the restoration of our rights to peaceful self-determination… Since the amalgamation of Nigeria in 1914 to date, our resources have been used to sustain the political administrative livewire of Nigeria to the exclusion of the Niger Delta… We want our resources back to restore the essence of human life in our region for generations to come because Nigeria has failed to do that. The world should not wait until we go the Sudan way”.[138] Unyekisong Akwa Ibom (UAI): Comprises former members of the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND), the Niger Delta Volunteer Force, Movement for the Actualization of the Niger Delta Republic, Niger Delta People’s Salvation Force, Niger Delta Avengers, Niger Delta Liberation Force and Niger Delta Movement for Justice and Niger Delta Warrior.[139] Akwa Ibom indigenes argue militant amnesty programs have consistently discriminated against them.[140] UAI views government amnesty/peace initiatives in the Niger Delta as inherently discriminatory and enablers of corruption. The group seeks to secure oil facilities within their territory, and issued ultimatums to the Nigerian government in 2021 and 2022, although no action followed.[141] UAI is believed to still be led by General Dede Udofia and Major Ibanga Ekang. Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND): Despite the group having officially dissolved, it is understood that factions/ethno-religious groups previously under the umbrella of MEND continue to operate independently to this day. Other groups that have previously attacked/threatened oil operations which may be active or have members acting autonomously: Niger-Delta People’s Volunteer Force; Red Egbesu Water Lions; Joint Niger-Delta Liberation Force; Niger-Delta Red Squad; Niger-Delta Greenland Justice Mandate; Niger-Delta Youth Movement; Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People; Federated Niger-Delta Ijaw Communities; Niger-Delta Liberation Force; Niger-Delta Civil Society Coalition; Coalition of Niger-Delta Agitators; Bakassi Strike Force; Niger Delta Vigilante; the Icelanders; and the Outlaws.[142] This list is not exhaustive. Cult groups are also influential, leveraging “whole communities, churches, schools- universities, secondary schools and even primary schools, government positions and political structures in the Niger Delta”.[143] Both cults and militia function strong traditional spiritual elements, “mainly based on the revival and strong influence of the Egbesu deity in Ijaw communities”.[144] Finally, many of these threat actors are sophisticated net-warriors as they involve themselves in complex and robust networks, however they may not be technologically elaborate and benefit from the ancillary operational security. Bala argues: “Nigerian security is influenced by a garrison military mentality”.[145] Joab-Peterside also argues that the “state’s approach to security is dominated by the character of deterrence exhibited by unrestrained willingness to show maximum force at the slightest hint of insecurity”.[146] Nigeria’s history of colonialism and 36 years of post-independence military dictatorship have influenced a status quo whereby “force is used for punitive rather than preventative and corrective purposes of civil law enforcement and justice delivery”.[147] Despite over two decades of democracy in Nigeria, its armed forces continue to preponderate over the Nigerian Police Force (NPF) regarding internal security operations. This is despite the NPF being “constitutionally created for and mandated for the task”.[148] The armed forces have displayed steadfast interest in managing internal security operations, oftentimes directly interfering with police efforts.[149] Simultaneously, the military persistently laments how overstretched its forces are and how distracted it is from its primary constitutional responsibility: defending Nigeria’s territorial integrity.[150] The tendency to militarize internal security response has resulted in significant internal distrust and rivalry between the armed forces and its civilian counterparts.[151] Agencies operate as silos and intelligence is more often hoarded, rather than shared.[152] Despite an inordinate amount of disbursement towards the armed forces and numerous kinetic and non-kinetic operations in the Niger Delta Region, oil theft and criminal insurgency remain entrenched. As argued by Hackett, there should only be a “military component” to a holistic grand strategy, “flanked by all instruments of national power, working in concert,” which maneuvers a political end.[153] Nigeria’s military has dominated internal security operations since its independence, although the threat environment in the Niger Delta Region has not much improved. It is time to consider alternative methods and more efficacious and equitable federal resource allocation. The severity of the security situation in Southeastern Nigeria has seen the emergence of hybrid sovereign, non-state (often armed) groups in response to the criminality and weaponary. As mentioned previously, former Niger Delta warlord Government Ekpemupolo (a.k.a. Tompolo) leads Tantita Security Services Nigeria Limited. In August, 2023 Tantita was awarded a one-year contract worth ₦48b (USD32.3m) to provide security services to the Niger Delta Region.[154] This is not the first time the Federal Government has allegedly been contractually involved with Tompolo, as it bought 20 maritime patrol vessels worth over ₦15b (USD103.4m) from Global West Vessel Specialist Limited in 2012, a company widely believed to be owned by him.[155] Tantita currently claims to oversee 9m of its own staff, 38m community youth, and 22m intelligence agents.[156] There appears a clear conflict of interest, or at the very least collusion. Yet, Tompolo’s efforts have attracted praise, and his security forces have displayed successes in-field. Other private security entities do exist, such as Galaxy Security Services.[157] State governments have also established their own hybrid sovereign organizations to maintain security. In January 2020, all six Southern Nigerian states united to establish the Western Nigeria Security Network (WNSN) (a.k.a. Operation Àmò̩té̩kùn, i.e., Operation ‘to kill as fast as a cheetah’ in Yorùbá).[158] Àmò̩té̩kùncontinues to operate across all Southwestern Nigerian states except Lagos, with personnel comprising of “vigilantes, local hunters, community youths, farmers and menial workers”.[159] In April 2021, Ebonyi State setup the Ebube Agu Security apparatus.[160] This was formally disbanded by Nigerian courts early 2023 after evidence suggested the group was involved in “human rights abuses, extortions, illegal arrests and [illegal] use of fire arms”.[161] State governments command no constitutional power to arm indigenous security networks they form, and thus, many groups are in direct breach of Nigeria’s separation of powers and its monopoly over violence.[162] As argued by Bish et al. and Joab-Peterside, many of these state-level hybrid sovereign entities are politicized in the run-up to elections to support or deter certain candidates.[163] This not only undermines public confidence regarding the efficacy of the existence of such groups, but also erodes Nigeria’s democratic process, and contributes to escalating violence. Hybrid sovereign/private actors can provide stability if they are properly overseen and managed within legal frameworks. The presence of so many such actors, and the legacies of misuse, clearly dilute the Federal Government’s monopoly on violence and erodes Nigeria’s sovereignty. The NPF is significantly impeded in its ability to respond to threats associated with systematic oil theft in Nigeria. It functions as a federal police force. As argued by Baje, NPF officers are “inadequately trained, live in dilapidated barracks, and are poorly paid”.[164] At the same time, they are understaffed and/or are diverted to conduct personal private protection. The NPF officially employed over 370,000 officers in August 2023. Nigeria’s population stands at approximately 220m.[165] The International Association of Chiefs of Police recommended ratio of officers to citizens is 3.4:1000, and United Nations’ stands at 1:450.[166] Nigeria currently sits around 1:600, which is insufficient considering the domestic security situation. As argued by Ibrahim, this statistic is also undermined by the fact that around 150,000 of the officers are “engaged in VIP protection, rather than routine policing”.[167] While many Inspector Generals have committed to ceasing rented private protection services from NPF officers, the widespread practice continues.[168] A significant community policing initiative was launched in September 2020, whereby the government allocated ₦13b (USD35m) to absorb 10,000 new constables.[169] Not much has been gained from this, as underlying issues associated with NPF have not been rectified; corruption and mismanagement continue to be widespread; and the oil theft situation has not improved. As argued by Nigerian senator Orji Uzor Kalu, tapping and illegal refining “only make up for a small portion of the theft,” although their “environmental impact is vast”.[170] As argued by Senator Kalu, Okwelum and Tantita spokesmen, the plutocratic insurgency associated with coordinating and managing Nigerian oil theft represents a significant threat to national security.[171] Okwelum highlights there is a tendency to “inflate the quantity stolen in order to magnify the enormity of the scourge and justify the need for deploying the armed forces,” or to “minimize the quantity stolen in order to attenuate the adverse publicity it exposes the industry internationally and collaterally and in order to attract direct foreign investment,” when it suits the “state-oil-complex”.[172] Simultaneously, as argued by Garuba, the presidency of Ibrahim Babangida (1986-1993) also entrenched nepotistic Federal appointments regarding Nigerian oil officials who supervise the industry.[173] As argued by Moses, on the one hand “corrupt resident oil authority officials allow for the successful tapping of oil pipelines,” and on the other “the Nigerian security forces or militant organizations offer guided escorts for the transportation of stolen refined crude oil products”.[174] Indeed, security forces have frequently been accused of “facilitating the disappearance of captured vessels and re-appropriated sale of seized products to foreign markets”.[175] While the Nigerian Navy may report historic destructions of illegal oil refineries, as argued by Bish et al., oil thieves and site owners merely interpret crackdowns as “attempts to pressure them into paying bribes”.[176] Former Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, openly accused the Nigerian military of actively and systematically colluding with oil thieves, and Human Rights Watch cites widespread corruption across all Nigeria’s service branches.[177] On-land state security operations are known to be plagued with corruption too. For example, the Governor of Borno State, Professor Babagana Zulum, personally witnessed state security forces associated with ‘Operation Positive Identification’ collect illegal tolls at a checkpoint along the Maiduguri-Damaturu highway.[178] Such extortion justifiably ignites public outcry, and continues to undermine public perceptions of the Armed Forces. As argued by Bamidele Ademola-Olateju, a former commissioner in Ondo State: “[Nigerian] oil theft is not for the poor, it is an extensive racket involving the military, security apparatchiks, politicians, dubious industrial moguls and the oil companies”.[179] Nigerian plutocratic insurgency is naturally obscure, although plenty of admonitions exist, and persisting legislative gaps and elastic legal instruments continue to appear. Both the Ayo Irikefe Commission of Inquiry – an investigation instigated by the Shagari against the Obasanjo administration regarding missing oil assets worth ₦2.8b (USD1.9m) – and the Pius Okigbo Panel of Inquiry – an investigation instigated by the Abacha against the Babangida administration following the post-Gulf War oil bounce of the 1990s – were obfuscated and subdued by corruption.[180] Formal transparency and accountability measures associated with oil theft and federal inquiry have not improved at all. The Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mallam Sanusi Lamido, has cited that between January 2012 and July 2013, the NNPC itself was defrauded of 594m barrels of crude valued at approximately USD65.3b, and was only able to recover approximately USD15.5b (24% of the total value) of this lost oil, therefore failing to account for roughly USD49.8b.[181] A more recent controversy involved the Deep Blue Project (DBP), an integrated maritime awareness scheme, led by the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA). DBP was funded from the Cabotage Vessel Financing Fund (CVFF).[182] The CVFF was established under the Coastal and Inland Shipping Act (a.k.a. the Cabotage Act of 2003) to foster indigenous tonnage to work within Nigerian waters.[183] Two percent of the CVFF was allocated to Nigerian ship owners so that they could borrow money from the fund at single digit interest rates for littoral cabotage trading.[184] However, in December 2021, a member of the House of Representatives accused NIMASA and then-Minister of Transportation Rotimi Amaechi of diverting USD195m from the CVFF to fund the DBP without House approval.[185] This is despite the fact that no ship owner has successfully accessed the CVFF since its inception.[186] Extra-budgetary expenditures known as ‘security votes’ are also known to be flagrantly abused.[187] As highlighted by Bala, these funds are “not subject to the government executives’ declaration and not under the scrutiny of the public or even the established government auditing institutions of the anti-corruption agencies”.[188] These pseudo slush funds operate formally and informally, and are used to realize political and personal objectives. Transparency International exposed these ‘security votes’ account for around USD670m annually.[189] As argued by Bala, this dwarfs the annual international security assistance Nigeria receives. It is more than the Nigerian Army’s budget, more than the Nigerian Navy and Air Force’s annual budgets combined, and exceeds 70% of the Nigerian Police Force’s annual budget.[190] More transparent frameworks are necessary in order to restore public confidence, and more impartial resource allocation is desperately needed. Ex parte law is also brazenly abused, with the use of emergency judicial decisions in legal cases. Convener of the Transparent Bar Initiative, Douglas Ogbankwa, has faulted some law enforcement agencies regarding their frequently arbitrary and coercive use.[191] He highlighted that many ex parte motions “were done without the knowledge of the account holders, who should be aware of the situation in order to defend themselves”.[192] Senate President, Godswill Akpabio, also recently stated that the abuse of ex parte orders in political cases by judges should be curbed.[193] “To curb it, it is imperative that the National Judicial Council exercises stringent oversight. We recommend prompt and decisive punishment for judges who are found to abuse their authority in this manner”.[194] Significant legislative gaps also exist. Both Nigeria’s Terrorist Acts (2011 and 2013) lack a national definition for terrorism, and the Federal Government’s stance regarding negotiation with threat actors is not clear.[195] Likewise, no laws currently regulate the management of ill-gotten-gains associated with kidnapping and piracy following criminal capture.[196] Seized illegal proceeds are always forfeited to the Federal Government. Pervasive and systematic nepotism also undermines rule of law and due process. As highlighted by Bala, government/military appointments are typically defined across ethno-religious and political lines rather than meritocracy.[197] Such practices “breed disregard for the rule of law,” and jeopardize interagency synergy.[198] Prevalent corruption across Nigeria continues to create dysfunctional sovereignty, which will continue to encourage irregular threat actors. Nigeria currently does not operate State Police, although discussion regarding their formation is occurring in government. While some local police forces did exist in the 1960s, all were either eventually absorbed into the NPF or dismantled following military dictatorship.[199] The topic of state police has been fiercely contested, as many believe they should have been reinstated in 1999, following the end of military dictatorship.[200] House of Assembly speakers from across all 36 states recently announced their support for the proposal in a communiqué.[201] State legislators still need to endorse an official amendment to be passed onto the National Assembly.[202] However, two-thirds of Nigeria’s National Assembly must endorse it, followed by the President, for it to be realized.[203] President Bola Tinubu has championed and campaigned for State Police for decades, and thus he is unlikely to reject it.[204] Noticeable supporters include Senate President Godswill Akpabio and former President Goodluck Jonathan.[205] Although, while the Minister of Police Affairs, Senator Ibrahim Gaidam has shown his support, the Inspector General of Police directly contradicts him.[206] Many have argued for a long time that the adoption of state police would enable more effective and efficient policing.[207] Advocates highlight current limitations regarding the highly centralized command associated with the NPF. Nwogwugwu and Kupoluyi explain that a federally centralized police system alienates police as an institution and a service from rural communities.[208] As argued by Moliki, Nkwede, and Dauda: “The peculiarity of the security challenges of each state can be better managed by the officers who understands the language, geography and the peculiar security challenge of the people they would be policing”.[209] Considering Nigeria is home to over 300 ethnic groups who vary across a range of social, religious, economic, and geographic factors, Tony also highlights the need for “a policing model that is adaptable and sensitive to local contexts”.[210] It is this line of argument, focused around “local exclusiveness”, which Senator Ibrahim Gaidam, Minister of Police Affairs, champions too. While states currently administer their own magistrates, high courts, assemblies and legislators, they do not command the concomitant powers to police their own territories.[211] While this does consolidate the Federal Government’s monopoly on violence, state sovereignty is affected, and the NPF remain spread thin across 774 localities commanded from Abuja.[212] Conversely, ex-Lagos police commissioner, Abubakar Tsav, stated that the “establishment of state police will signal the beginning of the disintegration of the country,” as he believes that state governments would deploy their new forces “against their perceived political opponents”.[213] In 2018 he argued that politicians “are not civilized enough and tolerant of opposing views and cannot preside over a competent and impartial police force”.[214] His sentiments have been echoed by many, including the Inspector General of Police (IGP) Kayode Egbetokun, although such arguments often extend to also include ethnic, community, and religious adversaries too.[215] As observed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives Abbas Tajudeen, “there is a palpable fear among our citizens – a fear of potential tyranny and the misuse of police powers if control is devolved to the state level”.[216] Indeed, the Northern Elements Progressive Union (NEPU) in 1958 and the Willink Commission both opposed regional police on these grounds.[217] Alternatively, Emeritus Catholic Archbishop of Abuja, John Cardinal Onaiyekan, Assistant Inspector General of Police, Ben Okolo, and the Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Abdulrosheed Akanbi all suggest mending the dire state of the NPF first.[218] This includes hiring more officers, improving their welfare package, and enhancing overall NPF capabilities and infrastructure. Simultaneously, the Assistant Inspector General suggested merging the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Commission (NSCDC) and the Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC) under the command of the NPF.[219] State police could very well be misused, and punishing such practices would represent a new responsibility for the NPF. Considering that the current separation of powers is murky, appropriate transparency and accountability measures could enhance state-federal cooperation, facilitate more autonomous state level security, and ultimately contribute to healthier national unity. In order to tackle the twin insurgency, the Federal Government must not merely continue to invest in improving its police and military, but also seriously consider more substantive and equitable socioeconomic development and DDR in the Niger Delta Region. Romsom argues that both Nigeria and Brazil “show characteristics of the state as smuggler model”.[220] While criminal insurgency is not so prevalent in Brazil, as the majority of criminals stealing oil do not overtly espouse sovereignty aspirations, plutocratic insurgency is nonetheless rife. Oil theft has evolved into a conspicuous threat in Brazil since around 2014, when it reported a single incident.[221] In 2016, 73 incidents were reported.[222] Petroleo Brasileiro S.A. (Petrobras), the Brazilian state oil company observed that most of the oil theft that year occurred on the São Paulo-Rio de Janeiro axis, which is where five of the company’s largest refineries are located.[223] Above and below ground, hot and cold taps are erected by Brazilian oil thieves, much like in Nigeria, although the quantities they steal is markedly less significant.[224] In November 2023, approximately 30,000 liters of stolen fuel were intercepted by police, taken from the São Paulo-Brasília (Osbra) pipeline, which supplies the International Airport of Brasilia.[225] Four men were arrested, and around R$780,000 (USD138,000) worth of damage was inflicted.[226] Killings have been linked to oil theft operations, and there are indications that ‘turf’ wars exist between gangs regarding where their taps reside.[227] A few incidents have caused spills too.[228] Much like in Nigeria, criminals use tanker and water trucks to smuggle stolen fuel to concealed artisanal refineries, after which it is sold at illegal service stations or small-town, streetside vendors.[229] Brazil’s Federal Highway Police have increased the number of roadblocks they operate between Rio and São Paulo, although as observed in Nigeria, these may be easily circumvented by organized criminals.[230] Brazilian groups have previously generated false cargo invoices to deceive police.[231] Roadside hijackings of fuel trucks also regularly occur, with around ten cases a week occurring between the Gabriel Passos Refinery and the Ring Road.[232] Drivers do not typically suffer any injuries during these incidents, although the frequency with which they occur is increasing.[233] Brazilian law enforcement has responded and successfully dismantled many gangs associated with oil theft. Indeed, Transpetro, the logistics unit of Petrobras, reported a 60% decline in fuel theft at its pipes in São Paulo in 2020.[234] In June, three full and four empty trucks were seized in Fazenda Garcia, in Guapimirim, in the Baixada Fluminense, following an anonymous tip, which cited seeing 15 armed men.[235] A 100,000 liters of stolen fuel were seized, and one man was eventually detained.[236] Likewise, in May 2024 an adulterated fuel laboratory was dismantled by police, in Dias d'Ávila, Salvador, Bahia.[237] 600,000 liters of adulterated fuel were seized, including diesel, gasoline and ethanol, which was likely destined to be resold to gas stations.[238] Ten trucks and three fixed tanks were found (storing cargo worth R$3.3m [USD584,000]), as well as suction machines, hoses, gloves, dye, fuel symbology plates, samples of fuel types, and accounting documents.[239] Another adulterated fuel laboratory was also previously shut down by police in Feira de Santana, in January 2024.[240] Overall, theft overall costs Transpetro over R$150m (USD28.2m) a year.[241] Gangs may be quickly formed and dismantled, and may steal millions in less than a year.[242] A police operation in July 2023, which served 47 search and seizure warrants across Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo and Paraná exposed one such group.[243] Three chiefs oversaw the organization: one was responsible for scouts and drivers; another managed logistics and clandestine fuel derivation and extraction; and one was the financial director.[244] Specialists also included tap installers, recruiters who targeted professionals who worked mainly on oil platforms, welders, truck suppliers and false invoice forgers.[245] Harsher penalties were recently introduced specifically concerning fuel theft. In April, Brazil’s Infrastructure Commission passed bill 828/2022, which increased the punishment regarding theft of petroleum or derivatives, natural gas, hydrated ethyl alcohol, fuel, or other fuel fluids from four to ten years imprisonment, plus a fine.[246] Receipt of such illicit products will earn the same punishment.[247] Senator Alessandro Vieira also partially accepted an amendment proposed by Senator Luis Carlos Heinze to include biofuels as well.[248] The rapporteur added that the storage of such illegal fuel products may also be considered a crime.[249] Nonetheless, oil thieves in Brazil are markedly white-collar. Indeed, as argued by Slattery, Brazilian criminals “have infiltrated the four largest gasoline chains in Brazil,” whereby they are estimated to control “hundreds, if not thousands,” of service stations.[250] Paulo Miranda, head of the industry group Fecombustíveis, cites that First Capital Command (one of Brazil's most notorious organized criminal groups) controls approximately 300 gas stations in São Paulo state alone, which accounts for 3% of Brazil’s pumps.[251] Oil grafting at stations is lucrative, and Instituto Combustive Legal estimates the illicit industry to be valued at around R$23b (USD4.2b) a year.[252] Many groups also fence illicit petroleum products through asphalt companies too.[253] Oil criminals in Brazil also exploit petroleum tax regimes between states, as they vary widely region-to-region.[254] Ethanol tax in Rio de Janeiro is 32%, compared to 13% in neighboring São Paulo.[255] This creates huge incentive to conduct criminality across state lines. Brazilian think tank Fundação Getúlio Vargasestimated that criminals reaped approximately R$7.2b (USD1.3b) in 2019 through such fuel tax evasion alone.[256] Oil theft in Mexico has divulged into a glaringly similar situation to Nigeria, whereby billions of dollars of oil are unaccounted for each year by the state oil company Pemex. Colombia and Venezuela are also affected, although to a lesser degree. In Colombia, siphoned oil is increasingly refined into “pategrillo,” a low-grade fuel fabricated at illegal refineries used to produce cocaine.[257] Smith observes a positive relationship in Colombia between increased cocaine production and increased oil theft.[258] Considering that at least 22 organized crime groups operate across approximately one-quarter of Brazil’s Amazon rainforest, it is likely that a similar dynamic functions in Brazil.[259] A myriad of similar, different, and competing hybrid sovereign and private security actors function policing across Brazil.[260] As argued by Durão, Larkins, and Argentin, the Brazilian federal police have not effectively regulated state branches regarding the widespread practice of ‘bico’, whereby police establish or participate in private security. Through a series of interviews, they discovered that such practices are “not only tolerated, but even encouraged by police superiors”.[261] “Rather than seeing the blurring between different fields of security and police and crime as signs of incomplete democratization or incomplete regulation,” Durão, Larkins and Argentin (2023) observe jurisdictional ambiguity as an “intentional productive force which allows for material gain for key actors, in this case police officers themselves”.[262] Nonetheless, they argue that “the confusion between public and private policing for some may essentially mean earning extra money, but for many others it constitutes an endless extension of power, violence, entrepreneurship and political influence”.[263] Such is the case in Nigeria as well, and both the Brazilian and the Nigerian government must do more to better regulate these non-state security forces to ameliorate public confidence, and/or strengthen and consolidate official state forces so that there may be no need for extraneous redundancies. Transparency International attributed a score of 36/100 (i.e., 0=highly corrupt and 100=very clean) to Brazil in 2023, placing it 104/180 on its global corruption perceptions index.[264] In 2012, Brazil scored 43/100, an all-time historic peak, just before the massive Lava Jato corruption scandal enveloped the state oil company Petrobras, and numerous contractors and politicians.[265] Brazil’s overall corruption is incrementally worsening, which will likely exacerbate oil theft across the country. Its security architecture has also been observed to be significantly affected by a lack of transparency, police brutality, machismo, and prejudice toward certain minority groups.[266] Simultaneously, Milícia have existed across Brazil for more than half a century.[267] Their current form spawned from Rio de Janeiro’s favelas in the late 1990s and early 2000s, under the pretense of residential narco protection.[268] Predominantly comprised of active-duty and retired police officers, milícia extort rent from communities under their assumed control.[269] In 2013, it was found that across approximately 1,000 favelas in Rio de Janeiro, 45% were controlled by milícia organizations and 37% by narcos.[270] Milícia are known to control telecommunication towers, internet cables, and TV providers, so much so, a special police task force had to be created in October 2020 to respond.[271] By May 2021, over 20 clandestine internet and cable TV providers were ceased and over 600 milícia members were arrested.[272] Losses to the economy were estimated near R$1.1b (USD195m).[273] 26 telecommunication masts across Rio de Janeiro were also compromised that year.[274] Milícia are known to participate in oil theft and the sale of bootleg product to service stations.[275] As argued by Sullivan and Bunker, “the state-militia nexus amplifies criminal competition for control yielding a hybrid form of criminal-political violence.[276] Information regarding corruption associated with Brazilian oil theft is scarce. Although in 2017, Brazilian police suspected insider threats in Petrobras to have helped setup illegal taps near the Duque de Caxias refinery, as they were observed to be precisely engineered.[277] Moreover, Marcelo Queiroz dos Anjos, a captain in the Military Police, was the head of an oil theft gang which operated in the municipalities of the Baixada Fluminense.[278] Although he surrendered to police in 2021, which accelerated the demise of his organization, the group nonetheless stole a total of 169,500 liters of oil and caused Transpetro/Petrobras a loss of about R$2m (USD354,000).[279] Police eventually arrested four others and served 14 search and seizure warrants.[280] Another gang dismantled in July 2023 involved three brothers, two military police officers, and an outsourced Transpetro employee.[281] The group had managed to inflict losses worth around R$1b (USD175m).[282] Considering that oil theft continues in Brazil, and the scale of influence organized criminals command across it, it is highly likely that insider threats persist. Petrobras is also a state-owned entity, so it is likely that insider threats extend into the Brazilian government as well, as Lava Jato revealed. Oil theft in Nigeria is dire, and the situation in Brazil reveals symptoms previously observed in Mexico. There is no universal response to threats associated with oil theft, although both the Brazilian and Nigerian governments can do more to remedy dysfunctional sovereignty and underdevelopment. Plenty of information is available regarding Nigerian oil theft, although more transparency, accountability, and enforcement around the issue is necessary. The prospect of State Police represents an exciting, albeit precarious opportunity for Nigeria, as their presence may be used to refocus state responses around more indigenous law enforcement, rather than predominantly kinetic military activities. Nonetheless, all Nigerian security forces must demonstrate better behaviour regarding discrimination, brutality, corruption, and extra-judicial abuse in order to mend public trust and de jure authority more generally. Industrial actors must also rehabilitate community sentiment regarding environmental degradation and exploitation. The Patriotic Liberation Front in Niger also recently attacked the PetroChina-funded Niger-Benin crude oil pipeline, paralyzing the pipeline and killing six, to coerce the cancellation of a USD400m China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) oil deal signed in April.[283] Onshore oil investment across West Africa will continue to be stifled if the security situation more generally does not improve, and the Nigerian government should be wary of how regional oil related instabilities influence violence and theft dynamics across the Niger Delta, and vice versa. Information regarding oil theft in Brazil as a whole is scare, although it is clear that elements of Gilman’s twin insurgency function at the pipes, the pumps, and among Brazil’s plutocratic elite. State security forces, much like Nigerian ones, have frequently dismantled oil theft gangs, criminal extractive tools, and illegal refineries, although the problem persists. Both countries are observed to operate/allow hybrid sovereign and/or private security contractors to combat oil theft. While a few have proven themselves, the patchwork of security actors involved nonetheless undermines and complicates state sovereignty, its monopoly on violence, and creates jurisdictional ambiguities. Regulation rather than standardization/absorption may realize more efficacious and fair security, as positive aspects of local tailoring may be exploited under adequate legal frameworks and oversights, although this is easier said than done. Nonetheless, all security sector reform must to be paired with significant government-community dialog and socio-economic development in order to dismantle environmental drivers which influence crime and insurgency. The Nigerian government has a lot of work to do before it can claim symbiosis with Niger Delta Communities, assuage foreign investors, and dethrone Algeria to once again become the leading African oil producer. Likewise, the Brazilian government must also do more to prevent the oil theft situation from deteriorating into that observed in Mexico.[284] Endnotes [1] Robert J.

On Friday, TD Cowen maintained its Buy rating on shares of CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) with a steadfast price target of $380.00. The firm's outlook remains positive as CrowdStrike introduced a comprehensive range of updates to its Falcon platform, which is anticipated to broaden its total addressable market (TAM) to $116 billion by the calendar year 2025. The firm acknowledged potential challenges, such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s likely move to limit kernel level access for security vendors. Nevertheless, the firm is confident that such changes will not undermine CrowdStrike's long-term competitive position, citing the critical nature of the Falcon platform's mission. TD Cowen also addressed the issue of customer retention, noting that there have been no significant signs of client turnover following service disruptions. This observation supports the firm's belief that the forecasts for CrowdStrike's annual recurring revenue (ARR) by fiscal year 2026 are on the conservative side. The firm's endorsement of CrowdStrike's stock reflects confidence in the company's growth prospects and the strategic value of its product offerings. The Falcon platform's innovations are viewed as a key driver for expansion within the cybersecurity market. The $380.00 price target suggests that TD Cowen sees substantial upside potential for CrowdStrike's stock. The firm's rating and target are based on the company's strategic updates, market opportunity, and resilience in the face of industry challenges. In other recent news, CrowdStrike Holdings has been the focus of several analyst reviews and strategic initiatives. Goldman Sachs reaffirmed a Buy rating on CrowdStrike with a revised price target of $324, following the cybersecurity firm's Fal.Con 2024 conference. The company's Falcon Flex (NASDAQ:FLEX) product was highlighted, contributing to more than a 65% average increase in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR). Scotiabank, Truist Securities, CapitalOne, and Piper Sandler maintained their respective ratings, reflecting confidence in CrowdStrike's growth potential despite uncertainties surrounding near-term financial projections. CrowdStrike exceeded expectations in its second fiscal quarter in terms of ARR, revenue, and non-GAAP earnings per share, although the guidance for the third fiscal quarter and fiscal year 2025 fell short of consensus estimates. The company's management reiterated their long-term ARR goal of $10 billion by the fiscal year 2031. To achieve this, CrowdStrike launched strategic initiatives such as CrowdStrike Financial Services and established partnerships with Dazz and 1Password to enhance cloud security measures. These recent developments follow CrowdStrike's successful navigation through a major challenge earlier this year when a software update led to global outages. The company's crisis management skills were put to the test and subsequently showcased at their Fal.Con 2024 event. The company's ability to acquire new customers, as well as its strategies for upselling and cross-selling, are expected to be key factors influencing the company's revenue through 2025. As CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) continues to innovate and expand its Falcon platform, real-time data from InvestingPro aligns with TD Cowen's optimistic view of the company's growth potential. With a robust market cap of $67.99 billion, CrowdStrike's financial health is underlined by a substantial cash position that eclipses its debt, suggesting a solid foundation for future investments and growth. Additionally, the company's impressive revenue growth of over 33% in the last twelve months as of Q2 2025 highlights its strong performance in the cybersecurity sector. InvestingPro Tips further reveal that analysts are expecting net income growth this year for CrowdStrike, which could reinforce investor confidence. While the company trades at high valuation multiples, such as a P/E ratio of 396.59 and a Price/Book ratio of 23.83, these figures reflect its high growth trajectory and market confidence in its strategic direction. Moreover, the company has demonstrated a high return over the last year, with a price total return of 62.99%, showcasing its strong market performance. For investors looking for more detailed analysis and additional tips, there are 15 more InvestingPro Tips available for CrowdStrike, providing a deeper dive into the company's financials and market position.

Title: FTC trustbuster Lina Khan: feared in boardrooms, cheered on by progressive

Time Published: 2024-09-22T23:00:29Z

Watch CBS News By Lesley Stahl September 22, 2024 / 7:00 PM EDT / CBS News Everywhere you go people are complaining about inflation: voters say it's their number one issue. Enter trustbuster Lina Khan – the youngest chair ever of the Federal Trade Commission – just 32 when she was named. She says much of the blame for the exorbitant prices on everything from food to concert tickets, is widespread corporate consolidation. The FTC's mission is breaking illegal monopolies, blocking mergers that stifle competition, and protecting consumers from a system Lina Khan says is rigged against them. But she's so aggressive that she's feared and loathed in boardrooms - seen as a zealot and a bully, and yet -- At town hall meetings around the country, Lina Khan is often swarmed by young people taking selfies, small business owners giving her cards, union members – to whom she preaches the perils of business monopolies. Lina Khan: Too often fewer and fewer companies are controlling more and more of the market. And what that means is companies can start ripping you off, hiking prices, stealing from you. She calls these events her "listening tours," that she does in both red and blue districts -- this one hosted by Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Crowd Member: Every time I go to the supermarket, I get sticker shock. Groceries are so expensive now. What can be done to help people like me who are worried about grocery prices? Thank you. Lina Khan: The FTC is currently in court trying to block the largest grocery merger in U.S. history. Between Kroger – that owns Ralph's - and Albertsons, that owns Safeway. Together they have nearly 5,000 locations. Khan says this merger risks raising food prices even higher than they are now. Lesley Stahl: Grocery prices have gone through the roof. I believe that you think it's because of monopolies, but most economists say that it's because of supply chains caused by Covid and the Ukraine war. So which is it? Lina Khan: So there's no doubt that the pandemic and the war led prices to soar. What's been interesting is that even as some of those supply chain pressures have eased, prices have not come down concurrently as much. Lesley Stahl: So instead of inflation, are you contending that it's greedflation? That these monopolies are deliberately hiking the prices? Lina Khan: So there's a lot of discussion about what's driving the inflation and we've actually seen some executives boast on earnings calls about how inflation is great for their bottom line. Lesley Stahl: They say that? Lina Khan: They have said that publicly, yes. Lesley Stahl: What about the argument that when companies merge prices often come down, because of efficiencies, scale? Lina Khan: But even if those efficiencies arise, if the company's not checked by competition it won't have an incentive to pass those benefits on to the consumer because those consumers may not have anywhere else to go. Another consumer concern: the high cost of medicine. Pharmacist: As far as negotiating prices— Khan talks to independent pharmacists about the tricks and traps she says big pharma uses to jack up prices. For example, she zeroed in on the makers of asthma inhalers for extending their patents to keep low-cost generics off the shelves. Lesley Stahl: On these inhalers, they cost $7 in France. The same exact inhaler is around $500 in the United States. Wow. Now, something's out of whack. Lina Khan: We agree. So we took a close look at this and we found that companies were listing patents for things like the inhaler cap or the strap on your inhaler, so nothing to do with the actual ingredients of the drug or the formulation or composition of the drug. Lesley Stahl: So this is an inhaler for asthma. Show us what the innovation was that they claimed allowed them to extend the patent. Lina Khan: So it's this strap that they listed a patent for, this little piece of plastic. Lesley Stahl: No! They were saying that they should be able to continue the patent; generics can't come in for the medication, because they put that strap on-- Lina Khan: That's right-- Lesley Stahl: --to make sure you didn't lose the cap. Lina Khan: That's right. After the FTC sent warning letters to the four major inhaler makers, three of them – including this one - dropped the price from hundreds of dollars to just 35. And two days ago, the FTC filed a lawsuit to bring down the price of insulin and scores of other drugs, suing three companies the agency says are responsible for manipulating most of the prices. Lina Khan: These really fundamental things about people's daily material lives are affected by things like antitrust. But investment bankers, venture capitalists, and top CEOs say she's biased against them - that Lina Khan picks on winners because they're winners and thinks big is always bad. Lesley Stahl: Actually, Khan's doggedness represents a shift in policy, a mandate to reverse decades of a hands-off strategy toward mergers and acquisitions. It was introduced by Ronald Reagan and adopted by all presidents since, including Clinton and Obama, until President Biden put an end to it. President Biden (in 2021): We are now 40 years into the experiment of letting giant corporations accumulate more and more power, and where-- what have we gotten from it? Less growth, weakened investment, fewer small businesses. Under President Biden the FTC and the Justice Department have unleashed a crackdown, suing scores of companies, including Ticketmaster, Nvidia, and the big five: Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Apple, and a court just deemed Google an illegal monopoly. It's a revolution, and the face of it is Lina Khan. Male Student: We're all law students and we love you. Female Student: Can we have a selfie? Lina Khan: Sure! Male Student: Three, two, one. Thank you. When Khan was a student here at Yale Law School, she wrote a paper called "Amazon's Antitrust Paradox" contending that even though Amazon's prices are low, it's still a monopoly. Lesley Stahl: This was seen as an extraordinary breakthrough. And it went viral. Less than five years later, President Biden made her head of the agency that polices Amazon. Lesley Stahl: You know, Amazon is a very popular company. People like the convenience, the choice, the prices are pretty moderate. And they're afraid that you're gonna tamper with something that's good, that they like. Lina Khan: Our investigation uncovered that Amazon's illegal practices were actually raising prices for consumers because it had illegally muscled out rivals, locked them out of the market in ways that if you had more competition that Amazon hadn't squashed, consumers would be even better off. Amazon denies doing anything illegal and says if Khan wins, prices will go up. Also in the FTC's crosshairs: the issue of tech giants buying up smaller companies. Lina Khan: In the technology markets we went through a couple of decades where we saw over 800 acquisitions by the five big players, not a single one of which was blocked. And some of those we realize ended up leading to significant harm. Just to give you a concrete example, there were companies that were offering Americans greater privacy and they were promising that we're not gonna use your data, we're not gonna sell it, we're not gonna spy on you everywhere all the time. After some of those firms were bought up by one of the big guys, all of those data privacy policies changed overnight. And so Americans lost those privacy protections. Lesley Stahl: You're talking about Facebook and WhatsApp? Lina Khan: Yes, that's one example of that. She's now suing over Facebook's acquisitions of Whatsapp and Instagram. Lesley Stahl: Is the mandate to reverse what's gone on for 40 years, to undo some of the mergers that were approved. Lina Khan: We've identified not just one merger, but a whole string of mergers that some of these large companies made that we believe were illegal, that we believe were anti-competitive. Lesley Stahl: But they were approved. Lina Khan: They were not blocked, they were not challenged. But the courts don't always side with her. The FTC has lost a couple of big cases against Meta and Microsoft. Yet her cage-rattling has had a chilling effect where companies simply drop their merger plans. Lina Khan: Sometimes, you know, the companies decide that they're gonna abandon the merger. Lesley Stahl: If someone just says, "I'm not going to go forward," that's a win? Lina Khan: That's right. Lesley Stahl: Obviously the companies are complaining like hell, screaming. They don't like you. They're afraid of you. Lina Khan: Well, look, we're doing our job enforcing the law-- and— Lesley Stahl: They are they're afraid you're going to tie 'em up in court, you're going to cost them a lot of money and they're saying, "It's just not worth it." Lina Khan: So it's important to step back and keep all of this in context. Of all the thousands of deals that are proposed every year, the FTC and DOJ collectively investigate maybe 2% or 3%. That might not sound like a lot, but start-up founders complain that she's spooking investors so much, she's actually stifling innovation. Others fear that her chasing the tech giants will cause a domino effect. Earlier this month, after it was reported that her counterpart at the Justice Department subpoenaed the chip maker Nvidia the stock market plunged. Lesley Stahl: Do you ever worry about the power that the FTC and the chairman have that could result in a destabilizing of basically the whole economy? Lina Khan: Of course we have to worry. But we also should worry about the destabilizing effect that can arise from companies believing that they're above the law, and that they can be reckless, take massive risks in ways that can crash the economy, and then they can get away with just a slap on the wrist. And that creates a destabilization too. Khan can be seen as a belated reaction to the financial crisis when the government decided banks were "too big to fail." But has the pendulum swung too far? Corporations are pushing back with their own lawsuits to rein her in, setting up a possible showdown at the Supreme Court over the fate of the FTC. Lesley Stahl: Should you be concerned that you are flirting with diminishing the muscle-- the powers that you have if the Court decides you're wrong? And this Court could very likely say you're wrong. Lina Khan: I think one challenge that agencies can face is when they shrink their own powers and authorities by not actually using the authorities that Congress has given them. She's obviously unlikely to survive in her job if former President Trump wins, though she's admired by vice presidential nominee JD Vance – Sen. JD Vance: Well look, I don't agree with Lina Khan on every issue to be clear, but I think that she's been very smart about trying to go after some of these big tech companies. She's surprisingly popular with other MAGA Republicans. Lesley Stahl: There's even a nickname for conservatives who support you. What is it? Lina Khan: I'll let you– Lesley Stahl: Khan-servatives. Khan-servatives. On the flip side, it's unclear she would keep her job if Vice President Harris wins. Lesley Stahl: Some of her biggest donors are people who want her to get rid of you. They want you off the scene. And they're not just saying it privately. They're going on television. Lina Khan: Look, you know, my focus is not listening to what CEOs are saying on TV. You know, it's important in these jobs to really stay focused and block out a lot of the noise. Lesley Stahl: If you were asked to keep this job, would you say yes? Lina Khan: Obviously, those are conversations one has with one's family and that sort of thing. But— Lesley Stahl: You don't wanna have it with me? Lina Khan: But absolutely, I mean, there's so much work to be done, and it's such an honor to be in this role. And it would be an honor to have that opportunity to keep going.

Title: Is Amazon’s RTO Mandate A Signal For Other CEOs To End Remote Work?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/julianhayesii/2024/09/22/is-amazons-rto-mandate-a-signal-for-other-ceos-to-end-remote-work/
Time Published: 2024-09-22T21:30:31Z
Full Content:
Many other companies are likely to follow a RTO mandate for two reasons. Slowly but surely, as the pandemic's unique circumstances fade, companies are backtracking on hybrid and remote work arrangements and rapidly restoring pre-pandemic business norms. Companies like Dell, Salesforce, and Bank of America have already established return-to-office (RTO) policies. Walmart recently joined the RTO mandate but is attempting to address concerns with a state-of-the-art, 350-acre campus designed to build community and make in-office work more appealing to employees accustomed to flexible arrangements. Amazon is the latest company to take a stricter stance on RTO. In a recent memo, CEO Andy Jassy announced that all employees will be required to return to the office five days a week starting January 2, 2025. Jassy aims to strengthen Amazon's culture and teams, aspiring to operate like "the world's largest startup." Like others before it, Amazon's decision has sparked debate, drawing both detractors and proponents. Detractors argue that remote work leads to happier, more productive employees. Some even suggest that RTO policies are thinly veiled cost-cutting measures, allowing companies to avoid traditional layoffs. Dropbox, for example, has fully embraced virtual work, reinforcing that remote setups can thrive. On the other side, proponents of in-office work emphasize benefits like mentorship and addressing isolation issues. Nearly 4 in 10 parents say they go days without leaving their house when working from home, and 33% report feeling "very isolated," according to the Modern Family Index conducted by The Harris Poll for Bright Horizons. This debate over the ideal work environment is unlikely to end soon. However, RTO policies offer advantages in two critical areas for companies looking to strengthen their culture and teams. A KPMG survey reveals that 79% of CEOs expect their hybrid employees to return full-time to the office by 2027, an abrupt rise from just 34% earlier this year. Jassy and other CEOs like Starbucks' Brian Niccol believe teams should be together as much as possible, as shared in Bloomberg. Jassy's memo emphasized that being in the office makes it "easier for our teammates to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture; collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective; teaching and learning from one another are more seamless; and, teams tend to be better connected to one another." Amazon wants to act like a startup—agile, fast, and efficient. Reducing barriers to these goals is the bet Amazon and other companies are making with these policy reversals. Moreover, RTO could mitigate some of the negative aspects of remote work, such as isolation and loneliness, along with blurred work-life boundaries. According to a Wall Street Journal report, remote employees sometimes feel heavily isolated and akin to feeling more like mercenaries than part of a cohesive unit. As organizations grow, they often become mired in red tape and bureaucratic inefficiencies. These inefficiencies can frustrate employees and slow down operations, affecting overall performance. Jassy's memo hints at these challenges: "Do we have the right org structure to drive the level of ownership and speed we desire?" The frustration with unnecessary meetings, excessive layers of approval, and prolonged deliberation is widespread. Jassy's note echoes this sentiment: "pre-meetings for the pre-meetings for the decision meetings, a longer line of managers feeling like they need to review a topic before it moves forward, owners of initiatives feeling less like they should make recommendations because the decision will be made elsewhere." Unfortunately, communication can suffer when teams disperse, and the company grows. By returning to the office, Amazon aims to streamline communication, reduce management layers, and empower individual contributors. The goal is to see improvements in performance, collaboration, and overall culture. With Amazon's latest RTO policy, companies are signaling that they view flexible work arrangements as a benefit, not a given right. Management and organizations are reverting back to pre-COVID business norms, where leaders can interact face-to-face with their teams rather than through a monitor. While remote work and hybrid arrangements have advantages, only time will tell which approach best supports the organization and its people in the modern business world. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: CRWD FINAL DEADLINE: ROSEN, NATIONALLY REGARDED INVESTOR COUNSEL, Encourages CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. Investors with Losses in Excess of $100K to Secure Counsel Before Important September 30 Deadline in Securities Class Action – CRWD

September 22, 2024 12:21 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Sept. 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of Class A common stock of CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD) between November 29, 2023 and July 29, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important September 30, 2024 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased CrowdStrike Class A common stock during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the CrowdStrike class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=27534 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2024. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) CrowdStrike had instituted deficient controls in its procedures for updating its Falcon software platform, and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (2) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of the CrowdStrike’s customers; and (3) such outages could pose, and in fact ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to CrowdStrike. As a result of these materially false and misleading statements and omissions, CrowdStrike stock traded at artificially high prices during the Class Period. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the CrowdStrike class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=27534 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: CrowdStrike (CRWD), Press Reports Ex-Employees Say “‘Quality control was not part of our process,’” Securities Class Action Pending - Hagens Berman

September 22, 2024 12:03 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On September 12, 2024, SEMAFOR reported that software engineers at cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike “complained about rushed deadlines, excessive workloads, and increasing technical problems to higher-ups for more than a year before a catastrophic failure of its software paralyzed airlines and knocked banking and other services offline for hours.” Hagens Berman urges CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD) investors who suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge who may be able to assist in the investigation to contact its attorneys.

(CRWD): According to the September 12, 2024 reporting by SEMAFOR, in the wake of CrowdStrike’s disastrous update to its flagship Falcon Sensor security product that contained a bug that caused a massive overnight outage affecting 8.5 million Windows computers around the world, a certain former employee said “‘[s]peed was the most important thing’” and “‘[q]uality control was not really part of our process or conversation.’” The SEMAFOR article, “CrowdStrike ex employees: ‘Quality control was not part of our process,’” states “[a]lmost two dozen former software engineers, managers, managers and other staff described a workplace where executives prioritized speed over quality, workers weren’t always sufficiently trained, and mistakes around coding and other tasks were rising.” SEMAFOR also reported that “[o]ne former senior manager said they sat in multiple meetings where staff warned company leaders that CrowdStrike would ‘fail’ its customers by releasing products that couldn’t be supported.” The pending litigation focuses on the propriety of CrowdStrike’s representations concerning the efficacy of its AI-native CrowdStrike Falcon platform, including assurances that its technology was “validated, certified, and tested.” The complaint alleges that CrowdStrike’s assurances were false and misleading because the company failed to disclose that: (1) it instituted deficient controls in its procedures for updating Falcon and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (2) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of CrowdStrike customers; and (3) such outages could pose, and ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to the company. The company’s assurances came into question beginning on July 19, 2024, when CrowdStrike issued an automatic update for its flagship Falcon Sensor security product which contained a bug and caused a massive overnight outage that affected 8.5 million Windows computers around the world, disrupting businesses, airports, train stations, banks, broadcasters, and the healthcare sector. Many affected machines were unable to restart, instead showing a blue error screen sometimes called “the blue screen of death.” The news was accompanied by several analyst downgrades with one at Guggenheim downgrading CrowdStrike from buy to neutral, reportedly writing that “[t]he restoration of its reputation may take more time and will likely affect new business signings at least in the near-term.” Then, on July 29, 2024, news outlets reported that one of CrowdStrike’s customers (Delta Airlines) which suffered more than 6,000 flight cancellations hired a prominent attorney to seek damages caused by the faulty update. These events have driven the price of CrowdStrike shares down $84.24 (-24%) since July 18, 2024.

Email paydirt@dirtcheapgold.com Gold has historically been considered a strong store of value, especially during times of economic uncertainty or inflation. Over the long term, the price of gold has steadily increased, reflecting its role as a hedge against currency depreciation and market volatility. While gold may not offer the same short-term returns as stocks, it tends to retain its value over time, making it a popular choice for preserving wealth. However, like any investment, its performance can fluctuate, and it's important to consider it as part of a diversified portfolio. A stacker is someone who accumulates precious metals, like gold or silver, as a form of wealth preservation. Stackers typically prefer physical bullion such as coins or bars and focus on long-term investment strategies. The goal is often to "stack" as much metal as possible to protect against inflation or economic uncertainty. Most stackers aim to accumulate 5-10% of their net worth in metal. Stacking starts with choosing the right type of gold for your collection. Most beginners opt for popular 1 ounce coins or bars like the American Gold Eagle or Canadian Maple Leaf. Make sure to buy from reputable dealers, compare premiums over spot price, and consider storage options like a safe or bank vault. Diversify your purchases over time, and be mindful of your budget, ensuring that you buy when the price aligns with your goals. The premium on gold coins and bars is the additional cost above the spot price of gold. This premium covers manufacturing, minting, distribution, and dealer costs. Coins tend to have higher premiums than bars due to their intricate designs and collectible value, whereas bars are usually closer to the spot price because they are simpler to produce. We focus on 1-ounce gold bars and coins because they are the most popular and widely traded form of gold bullion. They offer a great balance between affordability and liquidity, making them ideal for both new investors and experienced stackers. Larger bars might offer lower premiums, but 1-ounce products are more flexible when it comes to buying, selling, or trading. Costco began selling gold to members in 2023, offering 1 oz gold bars primarily through its online store. Executive members can enjoy a 2% discount, and using the Costco Anywhere Visa card adds an additional 2% cashback â a combined 4% discount that you'll receive later in the form of a rebate. These savings make Costco a competitive option for purchasing gold, though stock is often limited and sells out quickly. Costco's products don't always appear in the main list on this page, but the table below shows all of the 1 ounce gold products currently available on Costco's website. The discounted prices of these products might make them competitive with products from other sellers. Purchase from Costco or Walmart. Those sellers don't have higher prices or fees for credit cards. Storing your gold securely is crucial to protecting your investment. Many stackers choose to store their gold in a home safe, but itâs important to ensure it is fireproof and bolted down. Alternatively, you can store gold in a bank's safe deposit box or a specialized vault service, which offers additional layers of security and insurance. Whether you need to pay sales tax on gold depends on your location. In many states or countries, precious metals like gold are exempt from sales tax if purchased for investment purposes, especially above certain thresholds. Itâs important to check local tax laws to see if exemptions apply where you live. Selling gold is relatively straightforward. You can sell to local coin shops, bullion dealers, or on online platforms like r/Pmsforsale that specialize in precious metals. Itâs important to shop around for the best offer, as prices and premiums may vary. Ensure you understand any fees involved before making a transaction. The amount you can sell your gold for depends on the current spot price of gold and the type of gold you are selling. Dealers will typically offer you slightly below the spot price to cover their costs, and this is known as the buyback price. The condition and purity of your gold, as well as market demand, can also affect the price. Shop around for competitive offers, and always sell to a reputable dealer to get the best value.

Investors seeking stocks that can withstand short-term pressures and deliver over the long term should track the recommendations of top Wall Street analysts. Bearing that in mind, here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. This week's first pick is game developer Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO). In August, the company reported better-than-expected adjusted earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Recently, Baird analyst Colin Sebastian reiterated a buy rating on Take-Two Interactive stock with a price target of $172. The analyst is upbeat about the company's upcoming releases and expects its bookings to increase by at least 40% in the next fiscal year following mid-single-digit growth this year. Sebastian's robust bookings growth estimate is backed by the expected release of key titles – Civilization VII, Borderlands 4 and the much-anticipated Grand Theft Auto VI (GTA VI). Moreover, he expects the company's new console/PC releases to deliver about $2.25 billion in incremental bookings. He anticipates the mobile business will contribute around $3.1 billion, and catalog/live services will generate $2.5 billion in the full year. While management has expressed high confidence in its ability to release GTA VI next year, the analyst thinks that any potential delay between two fiscal years would have a limited impact on TTWO's two-year earnings path. He expects this vital release to generate about $3 billion of bookings in the first year, while enhancing the company's financial flexibility with over $2 billion in free cash flow. "Beyond the next 12-24 months, Take Two should benefit from the long-tail of live services/catalog sales and further depth in the pipeline with sequels to Red Dead, BioShock and Max Payne, and perhaps new 2K sports franchises," said Sebastian. Sebastian ranks No. 286 among more than 9,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 56% of the time, delivering an average return of 12.8%. (See TTWO Ownership Structure on TipRanks) Baird analyst Peter Benedict is bullish on the prospects of membership-only warehouse chain Costco Wholesale (COST). Earlier this month, Costco reported a 7.1% rise in its net sales for the retail month of August (the four weeks ended Sept. 1). Excluding the impact of changes on gasoline prices and foreign exchange, Costco's August comparable sales also grew 7.1%. Benedict noted that the August comparable sales growth was sequentially steady compared to the 7.2% increase in July, as stronger traffic was offset by some moderation in average traffic growth. Benedict increased his Q4 fiscal 2024 EPS estimate to $5.10 compared to the Street's consensus estimate of $5.07 per share to reflect better-than-expected sales in the fiscal quarter. "COST's traction with consumers continues to stand out against an increasingly challenged spending backdrop," said the analyst. Benedict highlighted that the company delivered solid core comparable sales growth yet again and displayed persistent strength in the non-foods area, even as there is continued softness in discretionary categories across most of the retail sector. The analyst thinks that Costco's "growth staple" appeal remains intact, thanks to its consistent performance, store network expansion, encouraging membership key performance indicators and the recently announced fee hike. He reiterated a buy rating on COST stock with a price target of $975. Benedict ranks No. 30 among more than 9,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 71% of the time, delivering an average return of 16.1%. (See COST Options Trading on TipRanks) Streaming giant Netflix (NFLX) is the third pick for this week. Despite macro pressures and intense competition in the streaming space, the company has been able to impress investors with its crackdown on password sharing and the rollout of an ad-supported tier. JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth contends that while "advertising is not in NFLX's DNA" and the company is creating the ad tier from scratch, it has the ability to emerge as a major ad player as scale and monetization grow in 2025 and beyond. He estimates that ad revenue, excluding the subscriptions component, will account for more than 10% of the company's revenue in 2027. The analyst acknowledges that the scale of Netflix's ad tier currently lags behind that of peers like Amazon, which gained from automatically including its Prime members in its ad-supported tier. That said, he is confident that Netflix can boost its scale by making changes in plans and pricing, bundling offers and providing live content that has extensive appeal. Anmuth further explained that while Netflix's ad tier is dilutive to its overall average revenue per member, the impressive 150% growth in the company's upfront ad sales commitments, greater scale and improved focus on ad formats and ad tech should drive higher monetization. Overall, Anmuth is optimistic about Netflix's ability to grow its top line in the mid-teens this year and in 2025, further improve its margins, and deliver multi-year free cash flow growth. He reaffirmed a buy rating on NFLX stock with a price target of $750. Anmuth ranks No. 99 among more than 9,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 61% of the time, delivering an average return of 17.7%. (See NFLX Financials on TipRanks) Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Federal Reserve officials will speak this week, providing more insight into their recent decision to reduce interest rates. Friday's release of the August Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index will show whether inflation continues to slow. Investors can expect fresh data on new and pending home sales, along with an update on housing prices, and consumer sentiment surveys. Micron Technology (MU), Costco Wholesale (COST), Accenture (ACN), and more will also report earnings. Monday, Sept. 23 Tuesday, Sept. 24 Wednesday, Sept. 25 Thursday, Sept. 26 Friday, Sept. 27 Following last week’s closely watched Federal Reserve decision to enact a jumbo-sized interest rate cut, investors will hear from Fed officials this week about their impressions of the U.S. economy. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will deliver pre-recorded opening remarks at Thursday’s 2024 U.S. Treasury Market Conference, his first remarks since last week’s press conference. Other notable speakers will deliver remarks at the event, including New York Fed President John Williams, Fed Vice Chair Michael Barr, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, and Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, and Boston Fed President Susan Collins are also scheduled to deliver remarks this week. On Friday, market watchers will likely be focused on the latest inflation data, as the August reading of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index will show whether price pressures continue to cool. The July PCE reading showed the Fed’s preferred inflation measurement was down to an annual rate of 2.5%, still higher than the central bank’s target. Investors will look for more progress on inflation. KB Home’s earnings report on Tuesday could also provide some insight into the health of the housing market. According to a Bank of America analysis, the Fed’s interest rate decision is likely to drive down mortgage rates and potentially improve homebuilders' performance. Memory chip maker and Nvidia (NVDA) partner Micron Technology will report earnings Wednesday, after Morgan Stanley recently downgraded its stock, warning about the health of the memory chip market. Micron’s report comes after its prior quarter earnings were lower than analysts projected, and its revenue guidance disappointed investors. Costco’s earnings on Thursday follows its recent decision to raise membership fees for the first time in seven years, effective Sept. 1. Analysts are expecting the retailer to report higher year-over-year revenue and profit, with memberships rising to 75 million.

Title: After The Fed Rate Cut: Soft Landing Checklist
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2024/09/22/after-the-fed-rate-cut-soft-landing-checklist/
Time Published: 2024-09-22T10:38:32Z

While the aggressive rate cut was a good start, whether it will prevent the economy from descending ... [+] into recession remain unknown. This article will identify some data to gauge the effectiveness of the Fed’s actions in supporting the economy. Chair Powell and the Federal Reserve delivered a larger-than-expected half percentage point (0.50%) decrease in short-term interest rates last week. While the rate cut was a virtual certainty, the path forward and whether it will prevent the economy from descending into recession remain unknown. This piece will identify some data to gauge the effectiveness of the Fed’s actions in supporting the economy. Because of the aggressive first move from the Fed, the odds of an economic soft landing should be considered higher than before the move. Though the real (after-inflation) Federal Funds rate remains above 2023, there are likely more rate cuts in the pipeline. After-Inflation Federal Funds Rate Futures pricing assumes another cut to short-term interest rates of at least 25 (0.25%) basis points at the November Fed meeting and a 50% chance of a 50 (0.50%) basis point rate cut. The December meeting has expectations identical to those for November. Number Of Rate Cuts Expected In seven of the last nine easing cycles, the economy was either in recession when the rate cuts began or ended in recession. Still, stocks usually rose in the twelve months after the cuts started. Stocks and the Magnificent 7 reacted positively to the outsized rate cut. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), underperformed the S&P 500 on the week but are now only 6.6% below their early July highs. The S&P 500 reached a new all-time high during the week, eclipsing the July 16 high. Stock Market Performance The U.S. economy remains resilient, with the Atlanta Fed’s estimate of third-quarter GDP at 2.9%. These estimates provide a real-time estimate of economic growth since quarterly GDP reports are provided with a significant lag. 3Q 2024 U.S. GDP Growth Estimate Other valuable high-frequency reports are the initial and continuing filings for unemployment benefits. These claims have improved lately, but any significant softening in the labor market should be seen here first. Initial Jobless Claims The job market has softened. While the unemployment rate at 4.2% remains low on an absolute basis, it has risen off the lows enough to trigger the Sahm Rule, which has an unblemished track record of forecasting recession. There are several reasons to believe that the Sahm Rule might be overstating the risk of recession during this cycle. Monitoring the prime-age, 25 to 54 years old, employment-to-population ratio should help signal when concern about the rising unemployment rate is warranted. The rising prime-age employment-to-population ratio is evidence of some less dire outcomes in the labor market and the economy so far. The employment-to-population ratio is a monthly statistic updated in the monthly jobs report, and so is the unemployment rate. Prime-Age Employment-To-Population Ratio: 3 Month Average Separately, defensive stocks, less impacted by the economy, have often outperformed the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks during these easing cycles since they tend to correspond with periods of economic uncertainty or eventual contraction. Last week showed a better performance for economically sensitive stocks, bolstering the case that markets also viewed the Fed’s actions as supportive of better odds of avoiding recession. Cyclicals Versus Defensives Banks tend to underperform the S&P 500 before and often during recessions since their loan losses and profits are inexorably tied to the economy. Bank stocks significantly outperformed last week, adding to the optimistic view of the impacts of the more significant Fed rate cut on the economy. U.S. Banks Relative Performance Finally, the consumer is crucial for the health of the economy. Looking at the relative performance of the consumer discretionary sector can help indicate when the consumer and, by extension, the U.S. economy might be in trouble. The equal-weighted S&P 500 consumer discretionary index is used; otherwise, Amazon.com (AMZN) would dominate the analysis given its massive size in the capitalization-weighted index. Consistent with the other measures shown, consumer discretionary stocks outperformed. Consumer Discretionary Relative Strength Based on the indicators reviewed in this analysis and current economic data, the base case remains a soft landing. This COVID-related economic cycle is unlike any other, so our typically reliable yield curve and Sahm rule indicators should be viewed more skeptically than usual. The initial reaction to the larger-than-expected 50 basis point rate cut from the Fed has been positive across the soft landing checklist. It indicates that market participants are assigning higher odds of avoiding recession following Chair Powell’s aggressive start to easing monetary policy. If history is any indicator, success in avoiding a recession is no sure thing. Since markets reflect a higher likelihood of a soft landing, investors should expect price declines for stocks and other risk assets if recession probabilities increase. Since the eventual outcome remains unknown, investors should be mindful of their asset allocation and consider rebalancing after the robust stock gains. Owning high-quality and less economically sensitive stocks alongside technology and cyclical companies should benefit equity portfolios if the economy and earnings falter. Disclosure: Glenview Trust currently has holdings of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Alphabet (GOOGL) within its recommended investment strategies.

Chair Powell and the Federal Reserve delivered a larger-than-expected half percentage point (0.50%) decrease in short-term interest rates last week. While the rate cut was a virtual certainty, the path forward and whether it will prevent the economy from descending into recession remain unknown. This piece will identify some data to gauge the effectiveness of the Fed’s actions in supporting the economy. Because of the aggressive first move from the Fed, the odds of an economic soft landing should be considered higher than before the move. Though the real (after-inflation) Federal Funds rate remains above 2023, there are likely more rate cuts in the pipeline. After-Inflation Federal Funds Rate Futures pricing assumes another cut to short-term interest rates of at least 25 (0.25%) basis points at the November Fed meeting and a 50% chance of a 50 (0.50%) basis point rate cut. The December meeting has expectations identical to those for November. Number Of Rate Cuts Expected In seven of the last nine easing cycles, the economy was either in recession when the rate cuts began or ended in recession. Still, stocks usually rose in the twelve months after the cuts started. Stocks and the Magnificent 7 reacted positively to the outsized rate cut. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), underperformed the S&P 500 on the week but are now only 6.6% below their early July highs. The S&P 500 reached a new all-time high during the week, eclipsing the July 16 high. Stock Market Performance The U.S. economy remains resilient, with the Atlanta Fed’s estimate of third-quarter GDP at 2.9%. These estimates provide a real-time estimate of economic growth since quarterly GDP reports are provided with a significant lag. 3Q 2024 U.S. GDP Growth Estimate Other valuable high-frequency reports are the initial and continuing filings for unemployment benefits. These claims have improved lately, but any significant softening in the labor market should be seen here first. Initial Jobless Claims The job market has softened. While the unemployment rate at 4.2% remains low on an absolute basis, it has risen off the lows enough to trigger the Sahm Rule, which has an unblemished track record of forecasting recession. There are several reasons to believe that the Sahm Rule might be overstating the risk of recession during this cycle. Monitoring the prime-age, 25 to 54 years old, employment-to-population ratio should help signal when concern about the rising unemployment rate is warranted. The rising prime-age employment-to-population ratio is evidence of some less dire outcomes in the labor market and the economy so far. The employment-to-population ratio is a monthly statistic updated in the monthly jobs report, and so is the unemployment rate. Prime-Age Employment-To-Population Ratio: 3 Month Average Separately, defensive stocks, less impacted by the economy, have often outperformed the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks during these easing cycles since they tend to correspond with periods of economic uncertainty or eventual contraction. Last week showed a better performance for economically sensitive stocks, bolstering the case that markets also viewed the Fed’s actions as supportive of better odds of avoiding recession. Cyclicals Versus Defensives Banks tend to underperform the S&P 500 before and often during recessions since their loan losses and profits are inexorably tied to the economy. Bank stocks significantly outperformed last week, adding to the optimistic view of the impacts of the more significant Fed rate cut on the economy. U.S. Banks Relative Performance Finally, the consumer is crucial for the health of the economy. Looking at the relative performance of the consumer discretionary sector can help indicate when the consumer and, by extension, the U.S. economy might be in trouble. The equal-weighted S&P 500 consumer discretionary index is used; otherwise, Amazon.com (AMZN) would dominate the analysis given its massive size in the capitalization-weighted index. Consistent with the other measures shown, consumer discretionary stocks outperformed. Consumer Discretionary Relative Strength Based on the indicators reviewed in this analysis and current economic data, the base case remains a soft landing. This COVID-related economic cycle is unlike any other, so our typically reliable yield curve and Sahm rule indicators should be viewed more skeptically than usual. The initial reaction to the larger-than-expected 50 basis point rate cut from the Fed has been positive across the soft landing checklist. It indicates that market participants are assigning higher odds of avoiding recession following Chair Powell’s aggressive start to easing monetary policy. If history is any indicator, success in avoiding a recession is no sure thing. Since markets reflect a higher likelihood of a soft landing, investors should expect price declines for stocks and other risk assets if recession probabilities increase. Since the eventual outcome remains unknown, investors should be mindful of their asset allocation and consider rebalancing after the robust stock gains. Owning high-quality and less economically sensitive stocks alongside technology and cyclical companies should benefit equity portfolios if the economy and earnings falter. Disclosure: Glenview Trust currently has holdings of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Alphabet (GOOGL) within its recommended investment strategies.

Investing.com -- Here is your Pro Recap of the top takeaways from Wall Street analysts for the past week. InvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today! What happened? On Monday, Mizuho downgraded Southern Company (NYSE:SO) to Neutral with a $90 price target. *TLDR: Mizuho sees limited catalysts for further outperformance despite a 21% P/E premium. Strong load growth and robust capital plan should support SO’s 5-7% EPS growth rate and maintain a strong balance sheet through 2026. What’s the full story? Mizuho downgraded Southern Company to Neutral, after previously upgrading it in April 2023 when shares were trading at a 4% P/E premium to the group. The firm initially argued that shares could re-rate to a double-digit premium as Vogtle Unit 4 neared completion. However, with shares now trading at a 21% P/E premium to the electric utility group, Mizuho sees few catalysts for further outperformance. Despite moving to the sidelines on SO, Mizuho believes that strong load growth in SO’s service territory, driven by data center demand and reshoring of manufacturing, should make the company’s 5-7% EPS growth rate more durable. The firm also believes that management can maintain a robust capital plan, a strong balance sheet with 17% FFO/Debt, and minimal equity needs of $350 million per year through 2026. Neutral at Mizuho means “The stock’s total return is expected to perform in line with the unweighted, expected total return of the analyst’s industry coverage universe over the next 12 months. “ What happened? On Tuesday, Redburn-Atlantic upgraded Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) to Buy with a $99 price target *TLDR: Redburn-Atlantic highlights Shopify’s innovation, social media integrations, and Shop Pay as key growth factors. The firm is forecasting 29% revenue CAGR and 40% EBIT margin by 2026. What’s the full story? Redburn-Atlantic highlights Shopify’s industry-leading innovation, social media integrations, user-friendly platform, and unique Shop Pay button functionality as key factors positioning it to capitalize on structural growth. The firm’s extensive ecosystem and platform capabilities have cemented Shopify as the ecommerce provider of choice for merchants of all sizes, with significant enterprise merchant wins anticipated in 2025. Redburn-Atlantic upgrades its recommendation on Shopify to Buy, citing the company’s multi-faceted moat characterized by scale, high switching costs, and an impenetrable three-sided network. The firm forecasts a 29% net revenue CAGR from 2023-26 and a 40% EBIT margin by 2026, resulting in projections 24% above 2026 EBIT consensus. The price target is set at $99, based on above-consensus earnings and a fair multiple in line with peers in the internet, fintech, and software sectors. Buy at Redburn-Atlantic means “Redburn Atlantic argues that the stock price will rise by at least 15% over one year. For high beta stocks the hurdle rate may be commensurately higher. “ What happened? On Wednesday, Wolfe Research downgraded ResMed Inc (NYSE:RMD) to Underperform with a $180 price target. *TLDR: Wolfe rates RMD Underperform with a $180 target, citing disruption risks from Lilly’s GLP-1 medication. Analysts see 10% upside and 30%-40% downside risk, projecting mid-single digit growth. What’s the full story? Wolfe analysts rate RMD shares as Underperform with a $180 target price, applying a 20x P/E multiple to NTM EPS of roughly $9. This lower multiple reflects anticipated disruption risks to RMD’s business in 2025-2026 due to Lilly’s potential launch of an obstructive sleep apnea indication for its GLP-1 medication tirzepatide. Wolfe’s total addressable market analysis suggests a 15%-25% long-term impact on the CPAP opportunity, leading to a sustainable growth rate more likely in the mid-single digits rather than high-single digits. The analysts present two comparison sets: HSD med tech growers with a 25x-27.5x P/E and MSD med tech growers with a 15x-20x P/E. They believe RMD’s growth expectations align more with the upper end of the MSD range. A doctor survey projects a negative 6% impact on CPAP prescription volumes, framing the potential shift from HSD to MSD growth. Wolfe sees a 10% upside potential with a 30%-40% downside risk over the next 12-24 months. Underperform at Wolfe means “The security is projected to underperform analyst's industry coverage universe over the next 12 months.” What happened? On Thursday, BTIG upgraded DoorDash Inc (NASDAQ:DASH) to Buy with a $155 price target. *TLDR: BTIG raises estimates for DASH due to near-term strength and long-term growth drivers. Positive EBIT and net income expected in 2H; rideshare-delivery sector shows secular growth. What’s the full story? BTIG has been closely monitoring DoorDash due to a positive category bias, strong execution, and upward pressure on estimates. The analyst highlights three key reasons for raising estimates: ongoing near-term strength and under-appreciated long-term drivers, important milestones with positive EBIT and net income expected in the second half, and the rideshare-delivery sector being a rare area of secular growth in consumer-facing Internet. The analyst emphasizes the desire to increase exposure to DASH relative to more mature categories like eTravel, online dating, and real estate services. BTIG sees significant potential in DASH’s continued growth and milestones, positioning it as a compelling investment opportunity. Buy at BTIG means “A security which is expected to produce a positive total return of 15% or greater over the 12 months following the recommendation. The BUY rating may be maintained as long as it is deemed appropriate, notwithstanding price fluctuations that would cause the target to fall outside of the 15% return. “ What happened? On Friday, B. Riley initiated coverage on Reddit (NYSE:RDDT) at Buy with a $75 price target. *TLDR: B. Riley sees Reddit’s unique platform and early monetization phase driving growth. Attractive risk/reward profile at 31x 2025 EBITDA, with potential for significant leverage. What’s the full story? B. Riley highlights Reddit’s unique value proposition to users, advertisers, and content licensees through its platform, which supports tens of millions of users across over 100,000 communities. This creates a vast and growing repository of curated content. The broker believes Reddit is in the early stages of monetizing its platform through advertising and data licensing, positioning it for healthy top-line growth and margin gains in the coming years. At approximately 31x 2025 estimated EBITDA, B. Riley finds the risk/reward profile attractive, given the prospects for above-industry growth and significant leverage over the next several years. The broker sees Reddit’s potential for continued expansion and profitability as a compelling investment opportunity Buy at B. Riley means “We generally expect “Buy” rated stocks to have an above-average risk-adjusted total return over the next 12 months. We recommend that investors buy the securities at the current valuation."

Title: 5 big analyst AI moves: SK Hynix hit by double downgrade; ADI named Top Semis Pick

Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week. InvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today! During the week, William Blair analysts have initiated coverage on Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) with an Outperform rating, voicing confidence in the company’s potential for strong earnings per share (EPS) growth and stock price appreciation over the coming years. The firm pointed to several growth drivers for Arm, including “1) higher Average Selling Prices (ASPs) driven by improved monetization and higher value IP; 2) share gains in newer markets like data center; 3) tailwinds from AI driving higher demand for overall compute; and 4) a new upgrade cycle in mobile/PCs.” While Arm’s stock trades at a premium compared to its peers, William Blair believes this is justified by the company’s robust growth outlook, which is expected to become clearer in the financial forecasts for 2026 and 2027. Their discounted cash flow analysis indicates around 35% upside potential for Arm’s shares, supported by sustained revenue growth and increasing profitability over the next decade. In a separate note, William Blair also assigned an Outperform rating to Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), noting the company's strategic expansion into software as a way to buffer against the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry. The firm believes that the chipmaker is positioned for continued growth, driven by AI-related demand in networking and custom chip segments, along with the shift to subscription-based models in its VMware (NYSE:VMW) division. Analysts highlighted that nearly two-thirds of VMware customers have transitioned to subscriptions, a significant rise from the 30% seen prior to the acquisition. They also noted that AVGO is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 26x and an enterprise value to free cash flow ratio of 22x based on their 2025 projections, slightly below the median of its peers. “We see room for multiple expansion as the sustainability of growth in networking, customer AI chips, and software becomes clearer,” the note states. Shares of SK Hynix (KS:000660) dropped on Thursday following a double downgrade from Morgan Stanley, with analysts shifting their rating from Overweight to Underweight. In a note, analysts remarked that "the sun is still shining" for the company at the moment. They predict 2024 will be another strong year for SK Hynix, driven by increasing DRAM prices heading into the fourth quarter, which should lead to "exceptional near-term earnings." However, the outlook beyond the fourth quarter appears less favorable. While the long-term potential for DRAM, particularly due to AI-driven demand from data centers, is still promising, the firm noted that cyclical shortages are coming to an end. “Looking past 4Q24, we see sustained risks to the top line and EPS as growth slows, pricing falls, and rising competition in high-bandwith memory (HBM) challenges sustainable long-term margins,” the analysts added. In addition to downgrading the stock, Morgan Stanley also cut its price target for SK Hynix by more than half, lowering it from 260,000 to 120,000 Korean won. In a research note released Tuesday, Citi analysts named Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) as their new top pick in the semiconductor sector. The decision follows Citi's update to its semiconductor stock ranking table, which included a price target adjustment for Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) and an upgrade of Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN). The firm maintains a positive outlook on the semiconductor industry as a whole. Citi highlighted ADI's lower downside risk in the automotive sector compared to other analog semiconductor makers, particularly following the company’s recent earnings report. This reduced risk, according to Citi, makes ADI well-positioned amid ongoing market uncertainties, leading the firm to rank it at the top of its semiconductor stock table. "ADI is our top pick," Citi analysts stated, adding that they see "lower downside risk in Autos versus other analog names given they have just announced earnings." Broadcom and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), both key players in the AI sector, remain in Citi's second and third spots, respectively. Wedbush analysts said that they believe the AI revolution trade has gained momentum following the Federal Reserve’s 50 basis point rate cut, signaling a favorable environment for Big Tech and AI stocks. Wedbush views this aggressive rate cut, alongside a dovish dot plot extending into 2025, as creating a "very bullish backdrop" for the tech sector. The Fed’s move marks a momentous shift, as many investors had been waiting for this signal to fully engage with tech growth stocks leading into 2025. The firm pointed out that the broader technology sector has remained resilient, with recent earnings reports, such as those from Oracle, indicating that the AI revolution is entering its software and application phase. Recent observations from Asia suggest the tech supply chain is preparing for significant expansion, spurred by an expected $1 trillion in AI capital expenditures in the coming years. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) remains at the forefront of this revolution, with its GPUs being described by Wedbush as the "new oil and gold" of the IT industry. With the Federal Reserve’s rate-cutting cycle now underway and AI tech spending beginning to accelerate, Wedbush analysts continue to hold a bullish outlook for tech stocks, expecting further gains into 2025. Meanwhile, analysts at Melius Research have upgraded Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) from Hold to Buy, setting a price target of $210. They emphasize that Oracle founder Larry Ellison and CEO Safra Catz are not only leveraging their influence but also taking a more strategic approach with partnerships, positioning Oracle’s AI-first Cloud as a key growth driver. Ellison’s strong connections in the tech world, including access to GPUs and agreements with Cloud CEOs, along with his friendship with customer Elon Musk, have played a role, Melius’s team notes. While Oracle’s stock is up 54% year-to-date, the firm’s analysts believe this upgrade might not be late, suggesting the stock could be in the middle of a larger move. "We see close to $8.50 in terms of an EPS run rate within 2 years—and with our biggest worries muted—we find it hard not to put a 25x multiple on a company set to grow faster than Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE)," they said.

September 21, 2024 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, Sept. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Indivior PLC (NASDAQ: INDV), CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD), DXC Technology Company (NYSE:DXC), and Five Below, Inc. (NASDAQ: FIVE). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Indivior PLC (NASDAQ: INDV) Class Period: February 22, 2024 - July 8, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 1, 2024 The Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants (1) grossly overstated their ability to forecast the negative impact of certain legislation on the financial prospects of Indivior products, which forecasting ability was far less capable and effective than Defendants had led investors and analysts to believe; (2) overstated the financial prospects of SUBLOCADE, PERSERIS and OPVEE, and thus overstated the Company's anticipated revenue and other financial metrics; (3) knew or recklessly disregarded that because of the negative impact of certain legislation on the financial prospects of Indivior's products, Indivior was unlikely to meet its own previously issued and repeatedly reaffirmed FY 2024 net revenue guidance, including its FY 2024 net revenue guidance for SUBLOCADE, PERSERIS and OPVEE; (4) knew or recklessly disregarded that Indivior was at a significant risk of, and/or was likely to, cease all sales and marketing activities related to PERSERIS; and (5) knew or recklessly disregarded that, as a result of the foregoing, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. For more information on the Indivior class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/INDV CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD) Class Period: November 29, 2023 - July 29, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 30, 2024 CrowdStrike is a global cybersecurity company that provides software that helps prevent data breaches. According to the complaint, CrowdStrike’s main product is the Falcon software platform, which purportedly uses artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to detect, prevent, and respond to security breach threats. The CrowdStrike class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) CrowdStrike had instituted deficient controls in its procedure for updating Falcon and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (ii) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of CrowdStrike’s customers; and (iii) such outages could pose, and in fact ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to CrowdStrike. The CrowdStrike class action lawsuit further alleges that on July 19, 2024, news broke that a flawed Falcon content update caused major worldwide technology outages for millions of devices running Microsoft Windows. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell more than 11%, according to the complaint. Then, on July 22, 2024, the CrowdStrike class action lawsuit further alleges that Congress called on CrowdStrike CEO, defendant George Kurtz, to testify regarding the crisis and CrowdStrike’s stock rating was downgraded by analysts such as Guggenheim and BTIG. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell more than 13%, according to the complaint. Finally, on July 29, 2024, news outlets reported that Delta Air Lines had hired prominent attorney David Boies to seek damages from CrowdStrike following the software outage, according to the complaint. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell nearly 10%, according to the CrowdStrike class action lawsuit. For more information on the CrowdStrike class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/CRWD DXC Technology Company (NYSE:DXC) Class Period: May 26, 2021 - May 16, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 1, 2024 According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants misrepresented its ongoing “transformation journey” and the Company’s ability to integrate previously acquired companies and business systems. While touting its ongoing success in implementing that integration, DXC repeatedly stressed its commitment to reducing the Company’s restructuring and transaction, separation, and integration (“TSI”) costs in order to increase its free cashflow and “unleash [its] true earnings power.” In truth, Defendants knew or recklessly disregarded that the Company was only able to reduce its restructuring and TSI costs by limiting its integration efforts. The complaint alleges that on August 3, 2022, DXC reported disappointing first quarter results, despite having reiterated its guidance just six weeks prior. DXC blamed its poor performance on the fact that its “cost optimization efforts have moved at a slower pace than anticipated.” These disclosures caused the price of DXC common stock to decline by 17%, from $31.52 per share to $26.15 per share. Then, on May 16, 2024, DXC’s CEO admitted that “the previous restructurings did not set a real, clean, solid, fully integrated baseline for profitable growth” because the systems that were acquired over time were “never integrated, never deduped,” and admitted that the Company was “not [a] fully functional organization.” DXC also announced it would need to spend an additional $250 million to achieve the restructuring and integration process it falsely claimed to have been successfully implementing during the Class Period. These disclosures caused the price of DXC common stock to decline nearly 17%, from $19.88 per share to $16.52 per share. For more information on the DXC class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/DXC Five Below, Inc. (NASDAQ: FIVE) Class Period: December 1, 2022 - July 16, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 30, 2024 According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided investors with false and/or materially misleading information about Five Below’s financial strength and operations, including its outlook for the first quarter and full year 2024. This information included Five Below’s statement that net sales are expected to be in the range of $826 million to $846 million based on opening approximately 55 to 60 new stores in the first quarter. Further, Five Below claimed that net sales for the full year are expected to be in the range of $3.97 billion to $4.07 billion based on opening between 225 and 235 new stores. Investors discovered that these statements were false and/or materially misleading when, on June 5, 2024, Five Below announced disappointing first quarter 2024 sales result and cut its full year 2024 guidance stating, “Net sales are expected to be in the range of $3.79 billion to $3.87 billion based on opening approximately 230 new stores.” At the same time, Five Below claimed that for the second quarter, “Net sales are expected to be in the range of $830 million to $850 million based on opening approximately 60 new stores.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

Title: Elon Musk's X is the least-trusted Big Tech company, according to a survey — on par with the US government

Time Published: 2024-09-21T18:18:15Z

Americans think Elon Musk's X is as trustworthy as the US government. And that's not a compliment. A May survey published by All About Cookies, a company promoting digital security and online privacy, asked 1,000 US adults how much they trusted Big Tech and media companies compared to their government. EMARKETER, a market research company owned by Business Insider's parent company, shared the survey data on Friday. While companies like Amazon and Google topped the list, Musk's platform came in dead last. The survey's data showed that 70% of respondents trust Amazon, 65% trust Google, and 64% trust Netflix. Only 29% trusted TikTok, which ByteDance, a Chinese company, owns. US officials worry that ByteDance shares data with the Chinese government and have demanded it divest TikTok to an American-owned company or face a nationwide ban. Even fewer — only 28% of respondents — however, trusted X, the same percentage that trusted the US government. The survey showed that 43% of respondents distrusted the US government, while 44% distrusted X. Although the survey didn't clarify why respondents ranked X last on the list, the platform has been a magnet for controversy since Musk purchased Twitter in 2022 for $44 billion, rebranded it, and overhauled how it moderates content. Musk conducted mass layoffs after taking control of Twitter, particularly among its trust and safety team, whose numbers dwindled from about 230 employees to about 20. More trust and safety staffers were laid off the following year. Yoel Roth, once the head of the trust and safety team, resigned from the company soon after Musk's arrival. Concerns about misinformation on the social media app grew quickly after Musk's purchase, so he launched Community Notes in 2022. A 2023 Bloomberg report said it analyzed almost 400 X posts that contained false information about the ongoing conflict between Israel and Gaza, however, and found that it typically took more than seven hours for a Community Note to appear, and some took 70 hours. Musk himself has faced backlash for his own questionable posts, including in 2023 when business leaders criticized him for amplifying an antisemitic post on X. He backtracked in January during a conference hosted by the European Jewish Association, saying he was "naive" about antisemitism and is "Jewish by association." Musk is now dealing with the fallout from another X post this month after former President Donald Trump survived a second apparent assassination attempt. Musk asked in the post why President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris haven't also faced similar threats. Musk's post immediately drew backlash for promoting political violence, prompting him to delete it and defend himself, calling it a "joke." The US Secret Service told Bloomberg News it is "aware" of Musk's post and is investigating the matter. Musk's X has also run afoul of multiple foreign governments, most recently in Brazil, where X lawyers on Friday finally capitulated to demands for stricter content moderation months after the country's Supreme Court ordered a nationwide ban of the platform. Representatives for X did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Jump to

September 21, 2024 07:16 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, Sept. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) and certain of the Company’s senior executives. If you invested in Ford, you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/ford-motor-company. Investors have until October 7, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in Ford securities. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan and is captioned Guzman v. Ford Motor Company, et al., No. 24-cv-12080. What is the Lawsuit About? Ford is an automotive manufacturing company that develops, delivers, and services a range trucks, cars, and luxury vehicles worldwide. The complaint alleges that during the relevant period, the company misrepresented its warranty reserves and that it had completed a sequence of organizational changes designed to ensure higher quality and lower costs. In truth, Ford was experiencing higher warranty costs, and the warranty reserves did not accurately reflect the quality issues in its vehicles. On July 24, 2024, after the market closed, Ford announced second quarter 2024 financial results (the “2Q24 Press Release”). The 2Q24 Press Release revealed that the Company’s “[p]rofitability was affected by an increase in warranty reserves” and “higher warranty costs.” It was reported that, in the second quarter, Ford’s warranty and recall costs totaled $2.3 billion, $800 million more than the first quarter and $700 million more than a year ago. This news caused the price of Ford’s stock to decline by $2.51 per share, or over 18%, to close at $11.16 per share on July 25, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/ford-motor-company.

Title: Market Lessons: 20 Companies With Dazzling Growth In Revenue Per Share

Pornpimone Audkamkong/Getty Images W hat makes a growth stock? The first thing most investors look at is the earnings per share. But there’s a case to be made for giving equal attention to revenue growth. More precisely, you want companies whose revenue per share figure is growing at an impressive exponential rate. Winners on this score include such Wall Street favorites as Tesla, Block (the parent company of the Square payment network) and Meta Platforms (Facebook, that is). Ahead of them in the rankings are some less familiar names: Cheniere Energy, which exports liquified natural gas; Alnylam, a money-losing but very promising developer of RNA-based medicines, and MercadoLibre, a Latin American e-commerce platform whose shares see heavy trading on Nasdaq. Some smart investors have zeroed in on the top lines of companies. One was Charles Allmon (1921 – 2015), whose long-running Growth Stock Outlook newsletter included half a dozen stocks that appreciated more than 10,000% while on the recommended list. In an interview with Forbes on the occasion of his retirement at age 87, Allmon explained his philosophy. "In the long run a company cannot grow any faster than its sales," he said. "I look at sales first, earnings second and balance sheet third." Yes, earning growth matters a lot, and it’s scored in our review of earnings growers (see story list at bottom). But here we consider only revenue, not what companies get out of it. The sorting is by growth in revenue per share, since a boost in revenue made possible by a dilution of the share base doesn’t do much good for investors. Example: International Flavors & Fragrances, which makes chemicals for food and perfume aromas, looks pretty good in total revenue, better than tripling it over the past decade. But it has tripled its share count in that period. Its revenue per share growth comes in at an unimpressive 3% a year. Contrast that to Oracle Corporation, which sells software to maintain corporate databases. It is using its fount of profits to reduce the share count with buybacks. Thus, while Oracle’s total revenue has been growing at only a 3% rate, its revenue per share has been growing 10%. The analysis starts with 1,614 companies in the FactSet database that trade in the U.S., have market capitalizations over $1 billion and show revenue and shares outstanding numbers for at least 10 of the 12 years 2013-2024 (the last being a forecast). The long-term growth number is what comes out of an exponential fit to the revenue per share history. Predictability measures how closely that history tracks an exponential line (the statistician’s coefficient of determination), with a penalty for missing years. The top 10% of the group in predictability get the “Very High” label, the next 15% “High,” the next 15% “Above Average.” Among big companies with “Above Average” or better predictability, here are 20 standouts, with revenue per share growth between 22% and 58%: Not quite squeaking in are two names you expect to see: Amazon.com and Alphabet (i.e., Google). They both make the second ranking, however. This roster is limited to big companies with growth rates above 18% and Very High predictability: The final list is an assortment of revenue disappointments. It includes a woebegone utility (the former Pacific Gas & Electric), a good company in a shrinking industry (Artisan Partners, active management), a telephone company that wasn’t sure about diversifying into content (AT&T) and two greater-fool speculations (GameStop and AMC Entertainment). The revenue and share count statistics used as inputs come from FactSet, the price/earnings ratios from YCharts. Conclusions about growth rates are the author’s. The calculation uses a share count estimate for December 2024 that is an extrapolation of the recent trend in shares outstanding.

Title: Cory Doctorow at DEFCON: Disenshittify or Die

Why Trust Tech Report Tech Report is one of the oldest hardware, news, and tech review sites on the internet. We write helpful technology guides, unbiased product reviews, and report on the latest tech and crypto news. We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. Cory Doctorow, a renowned science fiction author and journalist, gave an enthralling speech at the recently concluded DEF CON. titled ‘DISENSHITTIFY OR DIE’. The word enshittification may seem alien to most people and it probably can’t be contained in a simpler definition. It is an entire process of exploiting end-users through a series of steps. Consider this: when the Internet first came into existence, the platforms were very simple. But is it the same now? A big NO, take Microsoft for example. Now, they allow you to use apps on the cloud, and track the features that are most important to you. They then take those features out of the basic package and sell them to you separately. This is called enshittification. The first step of this enshittification process starts with businesses appearing to be good to their end users. For example, Facebook shows you what you want to see, Uber charges less for cabs, and Amazon subsidizes goods and returns, and puts the best match of products at the top of the search results. However, there’s a hidden, more sinister part of stage one – locking in users. Now, there are several ways a platform can lock users in. Apple parts also use parts pairing, which is DRM handshakes between subcomponents and the main device, so that you cannot use third-party parts to fix a broken device. Plus, every part of the device has a microscopic Apple logo, so third-party parts are subject to trademark violation. Once businesses have locked users in, they start making things worse for users and better for themselves. For instance, platforms poison their search results with ads. Let’s take Amazon for example, who sells its search results, making $38 billion every year. And this costs a ton of money for businesses. Around 45% of the price of these products goes to Amazon. As a result, businesses have to increase the prices to make up for the lost margin. But that’s not the end. Amazon has a policy called the ‘Most Favoured Nation Status’ which means that the cheapest price they offer must be matched on Amazon. So what’s the solution? Businesses raise their prices everywhere – Target, Walmart, and your local shops. Similarly, Facebook poisons your feed too. It shows you less of the content from the people you follow and more of sponsored content and boosted posts. There’s an old adage that says “If you’re not paying for the product, then you’re the product”. However, Cory does not agree with this. Apple once offered a one-click option to opt out of app-based surveillance and 96% opted out. But now. Apple has turned on iOS spying, which collects users’ data for ad targeting with no option to opt out. So, even after paying $1,000 for the phone, you’re still the product. The same goes for Facebook’s ad business. This is the phase where businesses suck out all the utility from their products leaving users trapped. They do so through twiddling. With this, businesses alter the service backend to change its operations, costs, prices, search ranking, and other foundation aspects of the system. Digital platforms have made twiddling very easy. The same goes for YouTube videos. After spending thousands of dollars on a video, it is the algorithm that decides who watches them. In many cases, these videos don’t even reach the subscribers. However, there are some upsides to twiddling as well. Forbes’ Emily Baker White revealed that TikTok has a feature called the heating tool. When applied to a user’s account, this tool boosts videos from that particular creator, which reaches millions of users, irrespective of the recommendation algorithm. But why does TikTok do this? Let’s say TikTok wants more sports content on its platform. They randomly pick an account and heat it up so that the content gets a lot of traction. When other creators see this, they think that sports content is in trend and they start making similar content. And quite naturally, they do not get the traction similar to the first creator and they end up thinking that they’re missing something and doing TikTok wrong. The same thing goes for Uber drivers making $100,000 a year, sub-stackers rolling in dough, or Joe Rogan’s Spotify payout. The reason is pretty simple – the less value a business gives to suppliers, customers, and workers, the more value is left to be divided between the shareholders and executives. But, the real question is why NOW? Earlier there were consequences to enshittification. For example, companies like MySpace and Yahoo Search are down in the dumps, since they enshittified their products way too early. But now, there are no consequences of enshittification. Let’s explain the lack of consequences. There are four forces that discipline tech companies: Your customers should not find it easy to leave you and switch to a rival product. For example, the network effect of Facebook has prevented its users from leaving. But the main question is whether there’s an alternative. Similarly, Apple, Microsoft, and Google aren’t making things companies but buying them, which has led to a monopolistic market economy. This, in turn, has been made possible due to the government’s unexplained tolerance towards anti-competitive mergers and acquisitions, predatory pricing, and market-distorting exclusivity deals, which are prohibited by antitrust laws. This has made companies too big to fail, which in turn, has made them too big to care. And once companies realize that you’ve nowhere to go and no alternative in sight, they start treating you badly. When the government stopped caring about antitrust laws, they killed all hopes of regulation. Regulation is only meaningful when the regulator is more powerful than the companies it regulates. When the companies become bigger than the government, it becomes almost impossible to regulate them, irrespective of their crimes. And this hefty risk paid off for IBM when Ronald Reagan became the President. Regan believed in a monopoly-driven economy and dropped the case on IBM. Let’s take the example of an industry where there are 100 companies, each fighting for a share of the market. These businesses are too busy thinking about snatching the food off others’ plates and poaching employees and customers. Now imagine these 100 companies merging into five giant corporations, which basically become a ‘cartel’. Now, getting a consensus becomes easier and so does capturing the regulators. This has given them the power to escape privacy or labor rights, just because they do it with an app. For example, spying on your phone activities doesn’t seem to be a privacy violation to businesses just because they do so with an app. The same goes for algorithmic wage violations. So once the competition was killed and cartels overtook regulators, there was still something that could be done – disenshittification. In the tech field, every enshittificatory alteration can be disenshittified. So, every time HP sells you expensive ink, it is inviting a third-party seller to sell a refill kit. Or when Tesla installs codes that do not let you charge your whole battery, it is inviting a competitor to sell you a jailbreaking kit. Once the customer finds ways to disenshittify the enshittified product, that customer is lost forever. This is exactly how interoperability works and is a major check on enshittification. Tech workers have always been in short supply, which gives them an upper hand. And to make these workers work crazy hours, businesses came up with a trick – vocational awe. Businesses appealed to their love for technology and managed to convince them that they were the heroes of the digital transformation. This whole vocation awe worked for a while – employees did put in some hard hours. But, it also backfired for businesses. Since the supply was still short, there was always another employer ready to pay them just as much. But eventually, supply caught up with the demand. Last year, 260,000 tech workers were fired and the businesses gained the upper hand. Businesses and bosses have always been like this. They want to charge hefty prices, while delivering the least value and share as little as possible with workers, users, suppliers, and customers. However, earlier when they tried to enshittify their business, constraints like competition, regulation, interop, and workers stopped them. But now, when all these forces have melted away, the enshittification lever is free to move. During the end of this speech, Cory called for the formation of a new good internet. But for that, the four constraints should be reinstated. The first constraint is competition. After almost 40 years of lull, antitrust is finally coming back. For example, Wiz refused to be merged with Google, which was supposed to be the largest merger in history.. New merger guidelines are being rolled out by the FTC and the DoJ. Countries like the USA, UK, Australia, Canada, Japan, and South Korea are taking more antitrust action in the last 4 years than they did during the past 40 years. The EU passed the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which requires a dominant platform to open up APIs so that third-party businesses can offer interoperable services. But that’s not the case with the DMA, it is called an ‘Act’, which means it is enforced in the EU’s federal courts and not Ireland. Even US lawmakers are working towards creating new privacy laws. There has been a movement called the Right to Repair led by the Repair Coalition.
