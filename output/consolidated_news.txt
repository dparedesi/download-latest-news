With Tom Capper, we will dive into fresh data comparing the prevalence of AI Overviews by industry, geographic location, search intent stage and more, along with what factors correlate with appearing in them. SEO may evolve, but the fundamentals remain the same. Focus on these nine basic steps to optimise your site to help boost your ranking Many things have changed in SEO since Google first came online in 1998. Today, with personalized results influenced by user behavior, location, and device, standing out in search engine results is more challenging than ever. The one thing that hasn’t changed is this: Your organic traffic is directly tied to your search engine ranking positions (SERPs). If your keywords rank at or near the top of Google’s search results, boundless traffic will follow. Conversely, a lack of visibility in the SERPs will leave your site struggling to attract organic traffic, regardless of its quality. In this guide, I’ll break down actionable steps to boost your rankings. I’m going to go out on a limb here and give you the definitive answer, “It depends.” While I recognize this is frustrating and seems like a cop-out, it’s the truth. SEO doesn’t happen in a vacuum and every situation offers a unique set of variables. Skill, budget, the level of competition, and how your website stacks up can all play a role in how quickly one can move the dial. Google’s John Mueller has said it can take “several hours to several weeks” for Google to index new or updated content. However, even with drastic changes, it can take months – or even a year – to see a significant impact. Mueller recommends: The best way to rank faster? Create high-quality, useful content that searchers will love. In Mueller’s words, make your site “fantastic.” Poor website structure and information architecture can doom even the best SEO campaigns. If your website is difficult for users to navigate and Google to crawl, your rankings are likely to suffer. Building a solid technical and UX foundation ensures both search engines and users find what they’re looking for. While Core Web Vitals (e.g., LCP, FID, and CLS) are important indicators of performance, don’t get bogged down chasing perfect scores. A site that’s technically sound and provides a great user experience will naturally outperform competitors in the long run. Audit your website using Google Search Console’s coverage and crawl stats reports. Identify and fix three major issues this week, such as broken links, slow-loading pages, mobile-friendliness problems, Core Web Vitals issues, or indexing errors. Recheck crawl stats in two weeks to confirm improvements and ensure Google can efficiently index your site. High-quality content that embodies Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (E-E-A-T) is a cornerstone of modern SEO. Google rewards content that satisfies user intent and offers value, so prioritize crafting pieces that answer real questions and solve problems. Choose your top 3 underperforming URLs in terms of CTR or average position in Google Search Console. Update each with a fresh expert citation or new insights aligned with search intent. Add a new section or FAQ to deepen the content. Track CTR and engagement metrics over the next four weeks to measure improvement. Making your pages engaging and search-engine-friendly requires optimizing both your content and the way it’s structured. This involves crafting concise, descriptive titles, leveraging meta descriptions, and strategically using internal links to enhance user navigation and SEO performance. Identify three underperforming pages with high impressions and low CTR using Google Search Console. Rewrite their meta descriptions to align with searcher intent, incorporating primary keywords naturally. Add at least one internal link to each of these pages from related high-traffic content, using descriptive anchor text. Monitor changes in CTR and engagement metrics (e.g., bounce rate) over the next four weeks to assess improvements. Schema markup helps search engines understand your content better and enhances your visibility with rich results like star ratings, pricing details, and more. By structuring your data, you make it easier for search engines to deliver relevant information to users directly in the search results. Below is an example of Product schema markup for an ecommerce website: This code includes essential product details such as name, image, description, pricing, availability, and customer ratings, making it eligible for rich search results. Schema.org provides various schema types designed for specific content formats, including: Selecting the appropriate schema type for your content ensures better alignment with user search intent and increases your chances of appearing in rich search results. Select one key product or service page and implement schema markup using JSON-LD format. Validate the code using Google’s Rich Results Test. Track impressions, CTR, and click performance in Google Search Console over two weeks. Aim for at least a 1% CTR improvement, which can translate to 100+ additional clicks if the page receives 10,000 monthly impressions. If the initial implementation is successful, expand schema markup to five additional pages over the next month, focusing on high-traffic content. Google now prioritizes the mobile version of your website for indexing and ranking. Ensuring your site is mobile-friendly is no longer optional – it’s essential for SEO success. Key Strategies for Mobile Optimization: Actionable Recommendation Use Google Search Console’s Mobile Usability report to identify pages with issues such as “Text too small to read” or “Clickable elements too close together.” Focus on fixing three key problems, like adjusting text size, improving button spacing, or optimizing navigation. Enhance performance further by compressing images and enabling lazy loading. Monitor bounce rates and mobile impressions in Google Analytics over the next four weeks, aiming for a 5% reduction in bounce rates and improved engagement. Backlinks are still critical for SEO, but the emphasis should be on quality over quantity. Links from reputable websites signal to Google that your site provides authoritative and valuable content. That said, building backlinks isn’t an overnight win – it’s a long-term game that requires patience and consistent effort. Identify three high-authority websites in your niche using a tool like Ahrefs or Semrush. Develop a targeted outreach plan to pitch high-value content, such as a guest post or a link to an existing guide or resource on your site. Focus on offering genuine value to their audience. Track new backlinks acquired over the next three months using Google Search Console or a backlink monitoring tool, and measure their impact on referral traffic and rankings. Backlink acquisition is a marathon, not a sprint. Focus on creating high-quality content that naturally earns links, and steer clear of black-hat tactics – they’ll land you in hot water with Google. Google rewards websites that regularly update their content, as it signals ongoing relevance and authority. Stale or outdated information can damage your credibility and rankings. Review your top five performing pages in Google Analytics. Refresh two pages by adding updated data, insights, or visuals. Track engagement metrics like bounce rate and time on page over the next four weeks, and aim for a 10% improvement in these key performance indicators (KPIs). For local businesses, being visible in local search results can make or break your bottom line. Optimizing your Google Business Profile (GBP) and using location-specific keywords are essential steps. Review your Google Business Profile. Add or update three photos, refine your category selection, and ensure your business hours are accurate. Identify three location-specific keywords and incorporate them into your homepage or a key service page. Monitor local impressions in GBP Insights over two weeks to measure impact. If you serve users in multiple countries, international SEO ensures your content resonates with diverse languages, regions, and cultures. Identify your top international markets in Google Analytics. Implement hreflang tags for at least one language or region, and translate your highest-performing page. Monitor international traffic in Google Analytics over three months to track growth. SEO doesn’t have to feel overwhelming. Start by implementing one or two actionable steps this week, such as refreshing content, updating your GBP, or optimizing a page for international audiences. Use tools like Google Analytics and Search Console to track your progress over the next month and adjust as needed. SEO may evolve, but the fundamentals remain the same. By focusing on key strategies like delivering great content, optimizing for mobile and local audiences, and building high-quality backlinks, you can position your site for long-term success. Make incremental improvements, track your metrics, and adapt based on what works. With a consistent approach, you’ll see your rankings, traffic, and engagement improve over time.

Title: A Lesson in Creativity and Capitalism from Two Zany YouTubers
URL: https://www.newyorker.com/culture/rabbit-holes/a-lesson-in-creativity-and-capitalism-from-two-zany-youtubers
Time Published: 2025-01-08T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
For this week’s Infinite Scroll column, Cal Newport is filling in for Kyle Chayka. James Hobson began publishing videos on YouTube in 2006, when he was still a high-school student in Ontario, Canada. His early uploads were crude by today’s standards—some gymnastics tricks, some parkour, and some mildly anarchic silliness (for example, a 2009 clip of Hobson drinking raw eggs). “It was just the easiest way of sharing videos with my friends,” Hobson told me recently. “I would upload on YouTube and then share a link using MSN messenger.” Hobson’s relationship with YouTube began to evolve in 2013, when he crafted a pair of metal claws to help him dress up as Wolverine, the Marvel superhero, for Halloween. The resulting video, which he titled “Make It Real: The Wolverine’s Claws!,” was so popular that photographers asked him to star in photo shoots; a follow-up video in which he electrified the claws earned him a writeup in a tech publication. “That’s kind of cool,’ ” Hobson remembers thinking. A year later, another installment of “Make It Real” showed him building a mechanical exoskeleton of the kind used in “Elysium,” a science-fiction film starring Matt Damon, out of perforated square tubing and compact hydraulic actuators. The exoskeleton attracted even more viewers than the Wolverine claws, and Hobson—a systems mechanical engineer—began to reconsider his line of work. In 2015, Hobson quit his job to become a professional YouTuber, funding the transition by taking money out of his fledgling retirement account and selling laser-engraved goods on Etsy. “I had, like, six months to make it happen,” he recalled. Fortunately for him, his next project, a real-life version of Captain America’s electromagnetic shield, drew millions of views and pushed his subscriber count past five hundred thousand. He began attracting sponsorships and soon was earning enough sponsorships to make his channel financially stable. Hobson then followed a well-worn playbook in the world of creative capitalism, one deployed by numerous startups and scrappy media companies: get as large as you can as fast as you can. “Once we started growing, I was, like, ‘I want a really big property. I want a warehouse and outdoor space and room to do really big projects,’ ” Hobson told me. When he quit his job, he’d been making videos in his garage, but by 2019 he was leasing a thirteen-thousand-square-foot warehouse. In the twenty-twenties, he took out a multimillion-dollar mortgage on an even bigger warehouse, surrounded by forests, ponds, and fields—in his words, “a perfect backdrop for filming.” Hobson, known online as the Hacksmith, called the new location HERC, for Hacksmith Engineering Research Campus. He said it was loosely modelled on the headquarters of Stark Industries in Marvel’s “Iron Man” series. His staff grew to thirty people. At first, the expansion of Hobson’s business kept pace with his ambitions. “We doubled in size year over year,” he told me. “It was pretty darn exponential.” But, when subscriber growth slowed, HERC’s operating costs remained high. Two rounds of layoffs followed, and the company managed to stave off bankruptcy in large part because its online shop, Hacksmith.store, was unexpectedly successful. The classic strategy of scaling up left Hobson disillusioned. When I talked to him, he said that, as the head of a large, chronically cash-strapped organization, he was stressed out and nostalgic for the days when he could obsess over a single project. “Making videos has become a lot less fun for me,” he told me. Colin Furze, a former plumber whose YouTube channel has more than thirteen million subscribers, is like Hobson’s British doppelgänger; their career paths are a study in contrasts. When we spoke, Furze had recently posted a video titled “Digging A SECRET GARAGE Part 4 Digging Done!,” which showed him at home in a suburb of Stamford, England, pouring concrete in a large, subterranean garage that he was excavating in his front yard. Furze plans to store his vintage DeLorean there; he will summon it to the surface with a hidden elevator fit for the Batcave. The video has been viewed more than five million times. Furze, like Hobson, began publishing videos on YouTube in the early days after the platform’s launch. Initially, he filmed BMX tricks, but as he got older he gained showmanship; in one video, he modified a towed van so that he could serve meals to people in other cars while driving. An early hit came when, for reasons he cannot fully reconstruct, he decided to build the world’s largest bonfire. “I collected pallets for over a year,” he told me. A short video clip of the feat attracted hundreds of thousands of views. (At the time, YouTube did not accept uploads of large files.) In 2010, Furze broke another record on camera when he accelerated a supercharged mobility scooter to more than seventy miles per hour. He was later invited to ride it onto the stage of “Good News,” a TV show, but a crucial cable snapped during filming, forcing him to improvise a conversation with the host from backstage as he frantically made the repair. An employee of Sky, the British broadcaster, was impressed by Furze’s banter and brought him to London to audition for a co-host’s job on a new program called “Gadget Geeks.” He landed the role. While building zany contraptions for the show, Furze learned the importance of onscreen charisma and projects that were over the top—what the producers called “TV big.” After the season completed filming, in 2011, he kept building gadgets for his personal YouTube channel. His video of the “world’s fastest” stroller has attracted seven million views. He has so far earned nearly double that audience for a follow-up project in which he attached a jet engine to a bicycle. (The video’s description read, “Why not put a massive pulse jet on the most rubbish bike to hand seems a cracking idea to me HAHAHA.”) Furze, like Hobson, suddenly had sponsors eager to fund his work. He could now make a living on YouTube. Here, Furze’s path diverges from Hobson’s, creating a sort of natural experiment with an unexpected result. Hobson parlayed his early success into rapid growth, with his budget soon ballooning to a quarter of a million dollars a month. Furze, by contrast, continued to conceive, film, and edit his videos almost entirely on his own, with his modest budget almost exclusively dedicated to the materials needed for his projects. His wife sometimes held a camera, and his friend Rick sometimes lent a hand with builds, but Furze did not hire any formal staff and worked primarily in a back-yard workshop and an old barn. (Hobson, who knows Furze, told me that he was shocked to learn that the barn, which gets very hot in the summer, isn’t even air-conditioned.) In 2024, Hobson and his team published twenty-five videos that have attracted more than twenty-seven million total views. In the same period, Furze’s five videos, which he produced more or less by himself, have earned eighteen million total views. In addition to this content on his main channel, Furze also posted behind-the-scenes footage of his subterranean-garage project on a second channel called 2 Much ColinFurze. “Everybody went absolutely nuts for it,” he told me. These additional videos bring his total views in 2024 to forty-three million—much higher than Hobson’s number, generated with a fraction of the stress and expense. For these two exercises in creative capitalism, bigger investment didn’t lead to better results. I asked Hobson and Furze what they thought was going on, and they both highlighted an unusual feature of media platforms on the Internet: the personal connection that creators establish with viewers. “When it was just out of my garage—even though it was a really nice garage—the content was a lot more relatable,” Hobson said. “People become such earnest fans, because they know you and are watching for you. Just because you can do a higher-production-value thing doesn’t mean you’ll succeed.” In this context, a low-tech setup can come across as more authentic. “How people describe the channel is that it’s like you’re in the shed with me,” Furze told me. “As soon as someone was with me, and the camera was moving . . . they knew it wasn’t just me.” (Some fans tell Furze that they’ve been watching him since they were kids, which, he said, makes him feel old.) When Hobson scales up a project, his audience often grows, too—but not enough. “Our really big, out-there projects typically work,” he said. For one recent video, his team spent more than a year recreating a bulletproof suit worn by Keanu Reeves in several “John Wick” movies. It has generated more than twenty-three million views. Hobson can star in only so many videos, however. “I can’t create enough of those to cover our base expenses,” he said. “Unless I have a bunch of these queued up—which I don’t—it’s not really sustainable.” Furze, by contrast, sometimes strategically keeps his projects modest. “Some of my best performing ideas have been the stupid, silliest ideas that have cost virtually nothing,” he said. He spent a couple of hundred dollars on making a life-size concrete Weeble, a toy that wobbles on a rounded, bottom-heavy base without falling over; a V.P.N. provider signed on as a sponsor and the video racked up ten million views. “If you can nail that every week or month, then you’re absolutely laughing,” Furze told me. Furze’s solo success is a quirky challenge to the traditional narrative that survival requires continually growing, and that a small number of well-financed winners eventually eat most of the economic pie. He demonstrates that in certain corners of the creative economy an individual with minimal overhead can work on select attention-catching projects and earn a generous upper-middle-class income. Beyond this relatively modest scale of activity, however, the returns on additional investment rapidly diminish. As Hobson’s experience suggests, there’s no obvious path for a D.I.Y. video creator to turn his channel into a multimillion-dollar empire, even if he wants to. Furze seems to be maxing out the financial potential of his medium by staying small. In the context of the media industry as a whole, the low-key success of indie YouTubers is unusual. As entertainment companies compete to amass viewers, budgets have ballooned: TV shows such as “Gotham” (Fox) and “Masters of the Air” (Apple TV+) spend hundreds of millions of dollars in production. One show, “Rings of Power” (Amazon Prime Video), cost a billion. Tellingly, when the all-star YouTuber Mr. Beast moved his online shtick to Amazon Prime, in the form of a ten-episode series called “Beast Games,” the streamer invested a hundred million dollars to produce a TV-worthy product. The movie industry also famously rewards capital-intensive blockbusters. Universal spent a hundred and fifty million just on the marketing for its fall hit, “Wicked.” Even the comparatively staid book-publishing industry relies on major investments in a few mega-best-sellers to achieve profitability. In 2022, reportedly only three hundred and twenty books sold more than fifty thousand copies, the approximate threshold required to earn a hundred thousand dollars in royalties. On certain newer media platforms, however, Furze seems like an archetype rather than an exception. E-mail newsletter writers, podcasters, TikTok influencers, and OnlyFans stars follow similar principles to carve out a good living without the need for endless growth and investment. The fact that these formats rely on the Internet is not coincidental. A key element of their success—their ability to support an intimate connection between creators and a dedicated audience—may be inherently easier to achieve online. It’s this same element that is hard to scale up. It takes a long time to build a loyal audience and a lot of work to maintain it. And, because the Hobsons and Furzes of the world operate in idiosyncratic niches, there’s a limit to the total number of fans they can ultimately attract. Their model is better for builders of secret suburban garages than for old-fashioned entertainment companies seeking enormous profits. These dynamics matter, because they tell us something more general about how the creative economy is evolving. It’s still true that the real money to be made tends to go to a small number of tech companies; YouTube, for example, keeps about half of the ad revenue generated by the videos it hosts. But YouTube’s incentive to continue making money arguably encourages it to keep its service friendly to its most popular users. (Both Hobson and Furze had good things to say about YouTube.) It’s easier to cultivate a thousand Colin Furzes, each with an audience of a million, than to try to attract a billion viewers to a single hit show. All of this seems like good news for fans of a broader creative middle class. It’s still hard to become a successful YouTuber, Substacker, or podcaster, but the barrier to trying is relatively low, and a large number of people can succeed on these relatively modest scales—something that might not be true in the more traditional hit-driven mediums. In our era of consolidation and polarization, many online spaces can seem dreary, toxic, addicting, or some combination of the three. As my colleague Kyle Chayka wrote in 2023, most of the Web just “isn’t fun anymore.” In Furze, however, I sensed some of the optimism of the early Internet. Toward the end of our conversation, I asked him whether he thought his one-man-band model would remain viable in years to come. “I can’t see why not,” he replied. “There will always be a place on the Internet for the lo-fi, garage-bred stuff. People will always want what’s real.” ♦

Title: Mark Zuckerberg unveils his latest persona: Elon Musk

Meta's about-face on fact-checking shows how Musk has remade the world in his image. While Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk never did face off in that cage match, "Uncle Elon" has bested Zuck in the political arena, becoming one of the most powerful unelected figures in modern US history. Now, in hopes of forging a friendlier relationship with the Trump administration a second time around, Zuckerberg seems to be following a new mantra: If you can't beat Elon, be him. On Tuesday, Meta announced it would end third-party fact-checking and replace it with a more hands-off content-moderation policy in which users police one another through community notes — just like Musk's X. In a video announcing the changes, Zuckerberg said that "governments and legacy media" had pushed for more censorship in recent years, and that Meta had decided its "complex systems" had "too many mistakes and too much censorship." "The recent elections," the Meta CEO added, "also feel like a cultural tipping point towards, once again, prioritizing speech." His language would have sounded natural coming out of the mouth of Musk, who shared Zuckerberg's video on X and dubbed Meta's move "cool." Community notes is only the latest page Zuckerberg has taken from his billionaire rival's playbook. Whether conducting mass layoffs or removing the guardrails to social media or joining forces with Musk against their shared competitor OpenAI or spending time at Mar-a-Lago, Zuckerberg has been following Musk's lead more often. This isn't the first time Zuckerberg, who has helmed Facebook since he was 19, has reinvented himself. From the brash, hoodie-wearing Harvard dropout in Facebook's early days to the suit-wearing, meat-smoking, Silicon Valley nice guy in the years after the company went public to the hardened, martial-arts-practicing "wartime"-mode Zuck who emerged in the wake of the most turbulent period in company history, Zuckerberg has fashioned several personas that approximate what his company most needs him to be at the time. In 2025, don't let his longer hair, oversize T-shirts, and statement jewelry fool you. The persona Mark Zuckerberg has taken on to ensure Meta's success as his historical adversary Donald Trump returns to the White House acts a lot like Donald Trump's right-hand man, Elon Musk. When Musk bought Twitter in 2022, he shaved content moderation to bare bones in the name of free speech and cut more than 80% of its staff, sending shockwaves through the tech world. Many speculated that Twitter would crack under the pressure, and die. When, despite some hiccups, the platform continued to function largely as normal, Zuckerberg, like several other tech CEOs, applauded Musk for making Twitter "leaner" (doing so on the Musk superfan Lex Fridman's podcast). Meta also laid off 11,000 workers days after Musk took over Twitter, and Zuckerberg then dubbed 2023 "the year of efficiency" at Meta, cutting another 10,000 people. Zuckerberg now also plans to move trust-and-safety workers from California to Texas, following in step with Musk, who has relocated X from San Francisco to Texas, where he has also located Starlink and The Boring Company. And as Zuckerberg stayed quieter throughout the 2024 presidential election after Meta took heat for misinformation in 2016 and 2020, Musk did the opposite. The world's richest man appeared onstage alongside Trump, backed Trump with more than $250 million, and posted to X incessantly in support of the now president-elect. Musk has again come out on top, as he now sits at the pinnacle of political influence and is poised to radically reshape government spending as he and Vivek Ramaswamy spearhead the Department of Government Efficiency. Big Tech's other power players who want a favorable relationship with Trump are left to follow in his path. Since November, Apple's Tim Cook, Open AI's Sam Altman, and Amazon have each donated to Trump's inaugural fund. Zuckerberg has done that and more, including visiting Mar-a-Lago to have dinner with the president-elect; naming UFC CEO Dana White, a close Trump ally, to Meta's board; and promoting Joel Kaplan, a longtime Republican lobbyist, to chief global affairs officer. (On Tuesday, Kaplan gave an interview on "Fox & Friends" to promote the company's content-moderation changes.) All of this is meant to quell a once adversarial relationship between Zuckerberg and Trump, who had threatened to imprison Zuckerberg if his social sites interfered with the 2024 election and years ago accused Facebook of being "anti-Trump" and colluding against him (Zuckerberg pushed back against such claims). As my colleague Peter Kafka wrote of the community notes news: "There's no way to see Zuckerberg's moves as anything other than a straightforward attempt to please Trump and the incoming president's conservative allies, who have often complained that Zuckerberg's properties were biased against them." Even Trump said Tuesday that Meta was "probably" responding to his own past threats against Zuck by pivoting. The very fact-checkers who will soon be dismissed by Meta began with a program in December 2016, after Facebook faced harsh criticism for its role in spreading misinformation in Trump's first election a month prior. Meta actively worked to downplay political content following the January 6, 2021, insurrection, and it suspended Trump from Facebook and Instagram (Meta lifted the suspension in early 2023, saying the public should be able to access what politicians are saying; the move came shortly after Musk allowed Trump back on Twitter). When Meta launched Threads, its own Twitter competitor, in 2023, the Instagram head, Adam Mosseri, said the new app would not encourage breaking news and politics posts. But Musk, who has rebuilt X in his own image to favor conservative and far-right accounts, has found that a social-media site can win when embracing the president. On Tuesday, Meta also said it would reverse course and stop downgrading political content, and start phasing politics back into users' feeds. (A Meta spokesperson referred to past public statements but did not provide new comment for this story.) Early research on X's community notes shows the move has led to mixed results when it comes to combating misinformation. But changes at X have certainly proved a mammoth victory for Musk, whose wealth has grown by an estimated $200 billion since the election. As he's molded himself more in Uncle Elon's image, Nephew Zuck may also find himself in Trump's favor. Amanda Hoover is a senior correspondent at Business Insider covering the tech industry.

This agreement positions AST SpaceMobile to combine its existing low-band spectrum coverage in the continental United States with premium lower mid-band spectrum access, creating an enhanced framework for reliable and widespread connectivity. The company's advanced communications arrays, the largest deployed in low Earth orbit, will support this integration to deliver better performance across diverse applications. "Adding premium lower mid-band spectrum access in the United States to the AST SpaceMobile network gives us long-term access to a large block of a scarce resource, significantly enhancing our planned space-based cellular broadband offering," said Abel Avellan, Chairman and CEO at AST SpaceMobile. "Alongside the previously announced 850 MHz nationwide network plans, access to the largest available block of high-quality nationwide spectrum will position us to deliver on our goal of peak data transmission speeds up to 120 Mbps, together with our mobile network operator partners, to enable a true broadband experience directly from space to everyday smartphones." The agreement, facilitated through a binding Restructuring Support Agreement with Ligado Networks ("Ligado") and its creditors, grants AST SpaceMobile long-term usage rights for 80+ years. This includes up to 40 MHz of L-Band MSS spectrum and an additional 5 MHz in the 1670-1675 MHz Band in the United States. Completion of the transaction depends on finalizing definitive documentation, anticipated in early 2025. Upon execution, Ligado will receive approximately 4.7 million penny warrants convertible into AST SpaceMobile Class A shares, subject to a 12-month lock-up. Regulatory approvals and other conditions will determine the transaction's closing, which also includes $550 million in additional consideration supported by institutional financing. AST SpaceMobile has arranged for a non-recourse senior-secured delayed-draw term loan facility to finance this commitment, with annual payments of approximately $80 million for spectrum rights. Ligado will also receive long-term net revenue sharing rights. The transaction aligns with Ligado's ongoing restructuring efforts. UBS Securities LLC is serving as the exclusive financial advisor for AST SpaceMobile. Legal counsel includes Freshfields and Sullivan and Cromwell. The company's advancements include the September 2024 launch of five BlueBird satellites, which are the largest commercial communication arrays in orbit. These satellites offer non-continuous broadband services across the United States and select global markets, with the aim of achieving nationwide coverage. The next-generation Block 2 BlueBird satellites will feature even larger arrays and deliver up to 10 times the bandwidth capacity, supporting speeds up to 120 Mbps for a full range of cellular services.

Inflation fears drag down U.S. marketsU.S. stocks fell and Treasury yields rose on Tuesday as the ISM services index shows a big jump in prices for December. Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed on Wednesday. South Korea's Kospi rose 1.3%. It was boosted by shares of Samsung Electronics, which climbed around 3.6% even as the company forecast that its fourth-quarter profits would come in lower than LSEG expectations. Meta ends fact-checking programMeta on Tuesday announced it will eliminate its third-party fact-checking program to "restore free expression" and move to a "Community Notes" model, similar to the system on Elon Musk's platform X. Employees took to their internal forum and criticized the company's decision, made two weeks before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration. Anthropic's potential $60 billion valuationAnthropic, the artificial intelligence startup founded by former OpenAI research executives, is in late-stage talks to raise as much as $2 billion at a $60 billion valuation, CNBC has confirmed. The funding round is being led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, according to a person familiar with the matter. Anthropic, which has been backed heavily by Amazon, is the creator of the AI chatbot Claude. India might benefit from Trump, portfolio manager saysU.S. President-elect's Donald Trump's plans to impose heavy tariffs on China make India's geopolitical positioning "favorable in this Trump 2.0 era," according to GIB Asset Management's portfolio manager Kunal Desai. India is an attractive investment destination because of its monetary sovereignty and improving return on equity, Desai said. [PRO] Cautionary signs in stock marketHoward Marks, the co-founder and co-chairman of Oaktree Capital Management who famously foresaw the dot-com bubble, is seeing five cautionary signs in the stock market. While Marks isn't calling it a bubble, he's concerned over signs of froth in equities. Here's what investors should pay attention to, according to Marks. In a sign of how much investors are currently worried about inflation returning, the Institute for Supply Management's services index, an inflation reading typically secondary to more significant data points like the consumer price index, is sending shock waves through the market. The price index for December's ISM report jumped to 64.4% from 58.2% in November, representing a rise of more than 10%. It's the first time since January 2024 the reading has come in above 60%, noted Steve Miller, chair of ISM's Business Survey Committee. That might only be the start of an unwelcome upward trend. Miller attributes some of the expansion in service activity to "risk management for impacts from ports strikes and potential tariffs" — both of which generate inflationary pressures. In response, investors pushed up the 10-year Treasury yield to 4.699% during the U.S. trading day, the highest level since April 26. They also dialed down their expectations for a 25 basis points rate cut at the U.S. Federal Reserve's January meeting, pricing in a 4.8% chance of that happening, down from an 8.6% probability just a day ago, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. Stocks suffered. The S&P 500 dropped 1.11%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.42% and the Nasdaq Composite slid 1.89%, dragged down by a fall in tech stocks. Nvidia slumped 6.2%, breaking its three-day winning streak. "You're getting a recalibration of inflation expectations and Fed rate expectations. That's triggered this small sell-off in the equity markets after the earlier enthusiasm," said Tom Hainlin, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Asset Management Group. But the strong ISM report also suggests the U.S. economy's still doing well, which provides fertile ground for profit growth, said Hainlin. And as David Lefkowitz, CIO head of US equities for UBS, wrote in a Monday note, "profit growth matters more" than valuation for returns over the next 12 months. One data point from one measure of inflation doesn't chart out the path of inflation or corporate health for the year ahead. But it pays to tread carefully for now. — CNBC's Jeff Cox, Sean Conlon, Pia Singh and Lisa Kailai Han contributed to this report. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: Meta kills its fact checking programme and house prices keep rising

Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning Meta is to shut down its third-party fact-checking programme, moving to the so-called community notes model favoured by rival platform X, and lift restrictions it had previously imposed on some topics on its platform. Under the new rules, users of Facebook, Instagram and Threads will be able to flag posts that are potentially misleading and need more context. The announcement came shortly after conservative Joel Kaplan was named as Meta’s new head of global policy, replacing former UK Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg. The move also comes a day after the company named three new directors to its board, including Dana White, UFC chief executive and a close friend of US President-elect Donald Trump. Ciara O’Brien reports. House prices across the country will probably rise by as much as 8 per cent this year, according to estate agent DNG, which would bring the average price of a second-hand home in Dublin to almost €630,000. The company, in its latest residential market review and outlook, forecasts prices will “continue to rise”, with an increase of “at least mid-single digit figures” anticipated due to the “continued lack of new homes available to purchase by private buyers”. Colin Gleeson has the story. In his column, John McManus looks at how a Workplace Relations Commission ruling has essentially killed off the idea of a worker’s right to work from home, and what the wider ramifications of the ruling may be. We all want to save money if we can, but there are many different places to store your money depending on what you are saving for. In Money Matters, Joanne Hunt looks at the issues at play and the options savers have. Angry truckers are accusing a shipping company of price gouging after it doubled charges for some loads on the Irish Sea as a result of Holyhead’s closure. As Barry O’Halloran reports, Luxembourg-based shipping group CLDN has told hauliers ago that it would require a surcharge of twice the normal booking rate for any loads above a company’s “usual allocations”. Barry also reports that a key British division of developer Sean Mulryan’s Ballymore Group earned €1.6 million profit in the 12 months to March 31st, reversing the previous year’s €6 million loss, accounts show. At least €100 million in warehoused debt from a scheme introduced to help businesses during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic is not recoverable, Revenue has said. Colin Gleeson reports that some €3 billion of the €3.2 billion included in the warehouse at its peak in January 2022 has now been either settled or secured under a phased payment arrangement. Fresh plans for an apartment scheme by Lioncor on the grounds of Terenure College in Dublin have addressed all the grounds for refusal to a previous scheme, according to planning documentation lodged by the developer. Gordon Deegan has read the report. Digital pathology company Deciphex has raised $32.3 million (€31 million) from investors in a new funding round that will help fuel its global expansion. The company secured backing for its Series C round from Molten Ventures, with significant participation from ACT Venture Capital, Seroba, Charles River Laboratories, IRRS Investments, HBAN Medtech Syndicate and Nextsteps Capital. Ciara has the story. Bank of Ireland is to cut rates on certain deposit products, becoming the first domestic bank to do so since the European Central Bank (ECB) started to cut official borrowing costs last June. Joe Brennan reports. Joe also reports that Deutsche Bank analysts see AIB’s net interest income sliding 11 per cent this year, at almost twice the pace of the other two domestic retail banks, as it downgraded its rating on the AIB’s stock. Novo Banco, the Portuguese bank led by former AIB chief financial officer Mark Bourke, fired its chief risk officer following an internal probe into what the lender described as “suspicious” financial transactions. Planning permission for almost 900 apartments on the site of the old Dundrum shopping centre in Dublin has been refused following a long-running battle and hundreds of objections from locals.

Title: Disturbing your silence is my job but I want to make a little room for peace

“Hello from somewhere in the sky over Brussels,” my phone flashes. The tingle from my friend’s message so many kilometres up in the sky gives me the tiniest sense of what those 1979 internet pioneers must have felt when they sent the word “Lo” across the world wide web. As the initial thrill of contact fades, it feels not like my friend and I had cracked a code of the modern era but that we’d broken a secret code. The inside of a giant metal box in the sky has become an unlikely sacred space. It is oddly one of the few truly disconnected places we have left. Disconnected with the outside world, connected with ourselves, where we are. Yes, sometimes my head gets unintentionally connected with my seat-neighbour’s pungent armpit. But I am present. In the discomfort of that noxious connection. (While I do know some airlines have had wifi for years, I am, like most Irish people, on the low-budget, short-haul end of the aviation world.) Another unlikely sanctuary is the rail line surrounding Seapoint Dart station. For years this Bermuda triangle of mobile phone signal would make me audibly gasp in frustration, as I’d hear the “beep, beep, beep” of my cut-off phone call or see “no internet connection” cross my screen over and over in the middle of adding Weetabix to my online supermarket order. Smartphones make the harried and frazzled life of a full-time working parent just-about possible. Fifteen years ago I’d have had to give my whole Saturday morning over to the weekly shop instead of simply adding milk and butter to my virtual basket on my journey to work. Or I’d have to stay in the office late instead of answering urgent emails at my kitchen table while discussing river erosion over a fourth class geography book. But mobile phones also leave us with few silent retreats. There are almost no gaps for the thoughts to creep in, to give us perspective. You could describe the five-minute journey between Salthill and Blackrock Dart stations, catching glimpses of the daily colour-changes of Dublin Bay, as unproductive. But it is in these slivers that there is room to stop and listen and hear what is inside. Whether it is good or bad. Joyful or painful. We are surrounded by ways to pull us out of our inner life. This always-on world is reliably at hand to offer us a distraction. And distraction is a broad church. From “being productive” in buying gifts, or proofreading a report on your phone before a deadline, to aimlessly watching videos we don’t even control, engrossed by the TikTok Chicken Dance challenge ... scroll, scroll, scrolling the algorithm. [ Pro tips from ancient thinkers: why are people in their teens and twenties suddenly so obsessed by the Stoics?Opens in new window ] If there is pain or grief to be felt or deep thinking to be had, there is the soothing flicker of the screen to help us keep it light, keep it in the shallow, to numb us. Emptiness lets things rise to the top. It lets reflection catch you unawares. I pass a familiar-looking house and feel a jolt inside. I don’t reach for my phone. I remember my recently-passed vibrant sister. I hear her lovely laugh and smile. I feel her warm welcome. I know I’ve an emptiness at missing her. But most importantly I feel this. Swimming also brings me to this reposeful place. For 30 minutes there is just me and my strokes and the water. Surprising ideas enter my head, as if randomly out of nowhere. But I wonder were they just in a queue, waiting for some room to bubble up. Going back to my locker at the pool always brings the same tightness in my chest. I pick up my phone with a twitch. What have I missed? Are my kids okay? The screen almost always tells the same story. At most there’s some breaking news push alert on a new twist in the big story of the day from one of the dozen news sites I’ve signed up to for work. My relief and disappointment are simultaneous. I am sharply aware of the irony of me writing on this topic. For disturbing the silence is my job. Daily I send Irish Times news notifications to people’s phones. I try to make enticing social media posts and catchy headlines, to pull readers out of their worlds, away from their own thoughts. Distracted by the dopamine hit of a breaking story. [ Dermot Whelan: ‘Mindfulness isn’t a cult. We don’t have to get naked and cover ourselves in hummus’Opens in new window ] But this merely reflects the hyperconnected world we all occupy. In so many ways the phone in my pocket gives me power, productivity, flexibility, in my attempt to “have it all”. So today I speak for making a little room for peace and silence. Let’s never fix the signal gap at Seapoint Dart station. And Ryanair and Aer Lingus, don’t even think about giving us wifi on board our short-haul flights. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: ‘It’s a hilariously wonderful idea’: Coastal saunas a hot ticket amid icy Irish temperatures

Dublin swimming haven the Forty Foot provided the unlikely – and blustery – backdrop for a mobile sauna in the days before Christmas. Over the past 250 years, the much loved bathing spot, at a promontory in Sandycove beside the James Joyce Tower, has witnessed many a sight, most famously, perhaps, Buck Mulligan’s dip there in Ulysses. But one suspects that even Joyce couldn’t have imagined a wooden 10-person sauna on wheels perched there, overlooking the sea. It was as if an alien spaceship had landed, with hardy swimmers and walkers stopping to gawp as they rounded the concrete wind shelters of the Forty Foot, on a rocky outcrop reaching into Dublin Bay. The spot has become temporary home to the The Hot Box Sauna company, which has been awarded a licence by Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council. The council became the first of Dublin’s local authorities to trial the use of mobile saunas as part of a pilot scheme over two months in December and January. Others are situated at Killiney beach and Dún Laoghaire Baths. Helen Smirnova, a civil engineer with the council’s Infrastructure and Climate Change division, said that for the previous year the council had been receiving requests for saunas to be installed. “We were asked if we would be interested in placing saunas in public grounds. There are a lot of saunas in private grounds but only one or two other local authorities around the country allow this scheme,” she said. [ Tailbacks from Forty Foot stretch for miles as Christmas swimmers descendOpens in new window ] Ms Smirnova said the council decided to begin the trial after it was approached by people involved in the business and by members of the public. “We can’t just allow someone to set up and we couldn’t prioritise one particular vendor over another,” she said. “We had to make it a fair competition for those applying for the licence. It’s a good opportunity to do a trial and what we viewed as the best service providers were given a licence.” Up to 15 applications were made to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council; five saunas are now based in the three locations and have the option to open from 7am to 7pm three days weekly. One of the key stipulations for operators is that they must provide their own insurance. Whether or not the saunas become permanent features hasn’t yet been decided. The council will consider factors such as what the atmosphere is like around the pop-ups, cleanliness, traffic and safety. [ Rediscovering Ireland’s sea sauna tradition: ‘It’s like a modern-day pub, except you leave feeling great’Opens in new window ] Ms Smirnova said the council “wanted to find out if the locals were okay with the set up”. She said there had not been “a major amount of complaints as of yet” but some concerns had been raised. The council will compile a report and make a decision within months on whether or not to continue the scheme, she added; the saunas would be run by private entities, with tenders for each location advertised. Meanwhile, Waterford City and County Council has licensed two outdoor saunas, or hot pods, which are operating at Kilmurrin Cove and Clonea Strand. A spokesperson said the “general reaction has been very positive” and that the local authority intends to extend the offering. Back at the Forty Foot, friends Kate Blaney, Jane Young and Caroline Somers, from Sandycove, Booterstown and Blackrock respectively, were full of praise for the concept of a local authority licensing saunas. Ms Somers said she loved it. “It’s great for this time of year to encourage people to use saunas while getting in and out of the sea,” she said. “The council should definitely try to keep it operating.” Ms Young was introduced to the pop-up by a friend. “They are a great addition,” she said. Ian McColl, from Dún Laoghaire, who happened upon the sauna while out walking his dog, said that if he had known about it before he “would have definitely used it”. “It’s a hilariously wonderful idea,” he said. Micheál Beirne (23) who works for The Hot Box Sauna company, which operates in five locations around Ireland, said the business takes all concerns from members of the public on board, including over whether a person’s body can cope with going from hot to cold temperatures so quickly. “In Finland and, indeed, other Scandinavian countries, the use of saunas outdoors is part of their culture. When using a sauna people should go at their own pace,” he said. The majority of people “love it”, Mr Beirne said of the concept. “I get great satisfaction from this job. I love hearing about how people found out about saunas,” he said. “Saunas are a good place for people to socialise. It gets them outdoors and in this day and age, with our fast pace of life and social media, individuals are feeling the burden of loneliness. In Finland 80 per cent of people who use such saunas are aged over 60.” Forty-five minute slots can be booked for €15; all users must be aged over 18. The trial ends on Friday, January 31st. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Bezos-owned Washington Post cuts more jobs, reports say

The Washington Post is laying off nearly 100 workers, or 4% of its staff, in an attempt to stem growing losses. The cuts will affect mainly employees on the business side of the storied US newspaper owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. The publication is among many news outlets struggling in the digital age as a growing number of online platforms compete for advertising revenues. The layoffs come at a time of turmoil at the company after Mr Bezos broke with tradition and blocked an endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of the US presidential election in November. "The Washington Post is continuing its transformation to meet the needs of the industry", a spokesperson for the newspaper said. "Changes across our business functions are all in service of our greater goal to best position The Post for the future." In 2023, the Washington Post reported losses of $77m (£45m) and falling readership on its website. That same year, the newspaper announced it was offering workers voluntary buyouts in a bid to cut headcount by 10%. Mr Bezos wrote an opinion piece explaining that blocking the endorsement was necessary because of growing public perception that the "media is biased." Still, the newspaper said 250,000 of its readers cancelled their subscriptions in protest. Since then, several high-profile journalists, including investigative reporter Josh Dawsey, who confirmed on X that he was taking a job at The Wall Street Journal, have also left the newspaper. Managing editor Matea Gold is joining the Post competitor The New York Times, the Times confirmed. The apparent conflict between Bezos and the newspaper's top talent took a turn for the worse on Saturday when Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist, Ann Telnaes, said she was resigning from the Washington Post. That came after the newspaper refused to publish a satirical cartoon that showed Mr Bezos and other tycoons kneeling before a statue of President-elect Donald Trump. Last month, Mr Bezos announced Amazon would donate $1m to Trump's inauguration fund and make a $1m in-kind contribution. Mr Bezos also described Trump's re-election victory as "an extraordinary political comeback" and dined with him at the president-elect's Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida. The Amazon and Blue Origin founder is one of several tech leaders who has made the trip to Mar-a-Lago. In February, Mr Bezos announced that he would sell shares in technology giant worth around $8.5bn. The firm had previously said its founder would sell up to 50 million shares by the end of January 2025. The multi-billionaire moved to Florida last year, which has no state tax on share sales above $250,000. Two Amazon satellites launch to test the tech for a global broadband system in the sky.

The hedge fund also adjusted its position in Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), increasing its direct holdings by 51.30%, from 440,335 shares in the second quarter to 666,095 shares in the third quarter. Call options in Tesla dropped by 17.16%, from 3.93 million to 3.26 million contracts, while put options saw a steep decline of 38.31%, from 9.10 million to 5.62 million contracts. Why It Matters: Millennium made notable changes to its holdings in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), raising its direct stake by 80.97%, from 3.08 million shares to 5.57 million shares. Call options in SPY decreased slightly by 2.01%, from 3.74 million to 3.67 million contracts, while put options increased by 34.89%, from 6.44 million to 8.68 million contracts. Millennium, founded by Englander in 1989 with just $35 million, showed notable activity across other major holdings. The fund increased its Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) position with a 10.8 million purchase of iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (NYSE:IBIT). The investment shifts occur as Millennium faces potential structural changes. The firm is reportedly in early-stage discussions with BlackRock Inc. regarding a possible equity stake sale, which would mark the first external investment in Millennium’s management company during its 35-year history. Englander, who began his career as a floor broker and trader on the American Stock Exchange, has maintained 100% ownership of Millennium since its inception. The firm employs multiple investment strategies, including relative value, equity arbitrage, fixed income, and quantitative approaches.

January 07, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, Jan. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz (NASDAQ:KSPI), Applied Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:APLT), Nextracker Inc. (NASDAQ:NXT), and Transocean Ltd. (NYSE: RIG). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz (NASDAQ:KSPI) Class Period: January 19, 2024 - September 19, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 18, 2025 According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz continued doing business with Russian entities, and also providing services to Russian citizens, after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, thereby exposing the Company to the undisclosed risk of sanctions; (2) the Company engaged in undisclosed related party transactions; (3) certain of the Company’s executives have links to reputed criminals; and (4) as a result, defendants’ statements about Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. For more information on the Kaspi class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/KSPI Applied Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:APLT) Class Period: January 3, 2024 - December 2, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 18, 2025 The complaint alleges that on November 27, 2024, Applied Therapeutics issued a press release announcing that it had received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) for the New Drug Application (NDA) for govorestat, the Company’s lead drug candidate. The CRL indicated that the FDA completed its review of the application and determined that it was unable to approve the NDA in its current form citing deficiencies in the clinical application. Following this news, the price of Applied Therapeutics’ common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $10.21 per share on November 26, 2024, Applied Therapeutics’ stock price fell to $8.57 per share on November 27, 2024 before falling further to $2.03 on November 29, 2024 and $1.75 per share on December 2, 2024, a total decline of more than 80%. After market hours on December 2, 2024, Applied Therapeutics disclosed it received a “warning letter” from the FDA referring to the clinical trial issues underlying the CRL. Applied Therapeutics’ disclosure of the “warning letter” prompted a further decline in the stock price as investors discovered the seriousness and severity of the Company’s clinical trial errors. From a closing market price of $1.75 per share on December 2, 2024, Applied Therapeutics’ stock price fell to $1.69 per share on December 3, 2024 before falling further to $1.38 per share on December 4, 2024 and $1.29 per share on December 5, 2024. For more information on the Applied Therapeutics class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/APLT Nextracker Inc. (NASDAQ:NXT) Class Period: February 1, 2024 - August 1, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 25, 2025 The filed complaint alleges that defendants made false statements and/or concealed that: (a) the impact of project delays on Nextracker's business, financial results, and prospects was far more severe than represented to investors; (b) permitting and interconnection delays had materially impaired Nextracker's ability to convert backlog into revenue at historical conversion rates; (c) Nextracker had been unable to offset the negative impact from project delays through increased client demand and the purported ability to pull forward its other projects in the manner represented by defendants; (d) Nextracker did not possess the competitive advantages which purportedly shielded it from industry-wide headwinds or the ability to effectively offset the adverse effects of project delays as claimed by defendants; and (e) as a result of (a)-(d) above, defendants lacked a reasonable basis for their positive statements about Nextracker's business, financial results, and prospects. For more information on the Nextracker class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/NXT Transocean Ltd. (NYSE: RIG) Class Period: October 31, 2023 - September 2, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 24, 2025 The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) the Discoverer Inspiration and the Development Driller III were considered non-strategic assets; (2) the Company's recorded asset valuations were overstated; (3) as a result, the Company would take nearly twice the vessels' sale price in impairment if sold; and (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants' positive statements about the Company's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. For more information on the Transocean class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/RIG About Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C.: Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. is a nationally recognized law firm with offices in New York, California, and South Carolina.

Inflation fears drag down U.S. marketsU.S. stocks fell and Treasury yields rose on Tuesday as the ISM services index shows a big jump in prices for December. Europe's regional Stoxx 600 index added 0.32%. Shares of Volvo Car closed more than 9% higher after the Swedish carmaker reported a new global sales record for 2024. Meta ends fact-checking programMeta on Tuesday announced it will eliminate its third-party fact-checking program to "restore free expression" and move to a "Community Notes" model, similar to the system on Elon Musk's platform X. Employees took to their internal forum and criticized the company's decision, made two weeks before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration. UK's long-term borrowing costs surgeYields on long-dated U.K. government bonds or gilts surged to their highest levels since the late 1990s after a tepid debt auction fueled worries over demand. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said concerns are growing that the U.K. may encounter stagflation — a scenario where inflation stays high or rises while economic growth slows. Anthropic's potential $60 billion valuationAnthropic, the artificial intelligence startup founded by former OpenAI research executives, is in late-stage talks to raise as much as $2 billion at a $60 billion valuation, CNBC has confirmed. The funding round is being led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, according to a person familiar with the matter. Anthropic, which has been backed heavily by Amazon, is the creator of the AI chatbot Claude. [PRO] Cautionary signs in stock marketHoward Marks, the co-founder and co-chairman of Oaktree Capital Management who famously foresaw the dot-com bubble, is seeing five cautionary signs in the stock market. While Marks isn't calling it a bubble, he's concerned over signs of froth in equities. Here's what investors should pay attention to, according to Marks. In a sign of how much investors are currently worried about inflation returning, the Institute for Supply Management's services index, an inflation reading typically secondary to more significant data points like the consumer price index, is sending shockwaves through the market. The price index for December's ISM report jumped to 64.4% from 58.2% in November, representing a rise of more than 10%. It's the first time since January 2024 the reading has come in above 60%, noted Steve Miller, chair of ISM's Business Survey Committee. That might only be the start of an unwelcome upward trend. Miller attributes some of the expansion in service activity to "risk management for impacts from ports strikes and potential tariffs" — both of which generate inflationary pressures. In response, investors pushed up the 10-year Treasury yield to 4.699% during the U.S. trading day, the highest level since April 26. They also dialed down their expectations for a 25 basis points rate cut at the U.S. Federal Reserve's January meeting, pricing in a 4.8% chance of that happening, down from an 8.6% probability just a day ago, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. Stocks suffered. The S&P 500 dropped 1.11%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.42% and the Nasdaq Composite slid 1.89%, dragged down by a fall in tech stocks. Nvidia slumped 6.2%, breaking its three-day winning streak. "You're getting a recalibration of inflation expectations and Fed rate expectations. That's triggered this small sell-off in the equity markets after the earlier enthusiasm," said Tom Hainlin, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Asset Management Group. But the strong ISM report also suggests the U.S. economy's still doing well, which provides fertile ground for profit growth, said Hainlin. And as David Lefkowitz, CIO head of US equities for UBS, wrote in a Monday note, "profit growth matters more" than valuation for returns over the next 12 months. One data point from one measure of inflation doesn't chart out the path of inflation or corporate health for the year ahead. But it pays to tread carefully for now. — CNBC's Jeff Cox, Sean Conlon, Pia Singh and Lisa Kailai Han contributed to this report. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: Turbulent Timeways returns for seven weeks of Timewalking dungeons, plus the new Timely Buzzbee mount!

NEXT | Khadgar's countdown is over, so here's how to earn the Witness of t... While we wait for The War Within patch 11.1, the WoW developers continue to give us a steady stream of content with the return of the Turbulent Timeways. For the next seven weeks we’ll have an active Timewalking event, encouraging us to revisit old dungeons and factions. In addition to the standard rewards from Timewalking, this Turbulent Timeways event will reward us with with the Timely Buzzbee mount for completing the Master of the Turbulent Timeways 2 achievement, which is a meta-achievement requiring you to run dungeons for five of the seven weeks. If you need another reason to jump in, there’s also increased gear rewards: the weekly quest to complete five Timewalking dungeons will reward a cache with Heroic Nerub-ar Palace gear (item level 610-619) instead of Normal difficulty loot. These pieces can also be upgraded with crests to increase their power.If you’re more concerned about the collectibles available with Timewalking Badges, the Turbulent Timeways event is a great time to stock up on them: you can get 500 a week on each character via the quest drop you get by running a single Timewalking dungeon, with additional Badges for every boss you kill. Those still looking to purchase mounts will be well on their way, and if there are any other items you are missing — or reputation you want to finish — now’s the perfect time to acquire them. Reputation gains for the week’s faction are boosted by 50% and you can buy tokens for bonus reputation at Timewalking vendors. You may even be lucky enough to acquire the Infinite Timereaver, which is what I keep telling myself every time I queue up.Since the most recent Timewalking event (ignoring the persistent Classic Timewalking during the 20th Anniversary) was for Cataclysm, the Turbulent Timeways will start with Mists of Pandaria Timewalking the week of January 7. Unlike last time the weeks will be in expansion order, and Warlords of Draenor will not be skipped.Here are the dates for each Timewalking week during Turbulent Timeways:Week of January 7: Mists of PandariaGate of the Setting Sun, Mogu’shan Palace, Scholomance, Shado-Pan Monastery, Stormstout Brewery, Temple of the Jade SerpentWeek of January 14: Warlords of DraenorAuchindoun, Bloodmaul Slag Mines, Everbloom, Grimrail Depot, Shadowmoon Burial Grounds, SkyreachWeek of January 21: LegionBlack Rook Hold, Court of Stars, Darkheart Thicket, Eye of Azshara, Neltharion’s Lair, Vault of the WardensWeek of January 28: ClassicDeadmines, Dire Maul East, Dire Maul West, Stratholme, Zul’FarrakWeek of February 4: Burning CrusadeDungeons: Blood Furnace, Botanica, Magisters’ Terrace, Mana-Tombs, Shattered Halls, UnderbogRaid: Black TempleWeek of February 11:Wrath of the Lich KingDungeons: Azjol-Nerub, Forge of Souls, Gundrak, Halls of Lightning, Nexus, Utgarde KeepRaid: UlduarWeek of September 18: CataclysmDungeons: Blackrock Caverns, End Time, Lost City of the Tol’vir, Stonecore, Throne of the Tides, Vortex PinnacleRaid: FirelandsWhile the Timewalking raids — Black Temple, Ulduar, and Firelands — will be available during their respective weeks, they do not have any additional rewards during the Turbulent Timeways event. Still, you’ll get a quest drop from each for an additional 500 Timewarped Badges.To get the Timely Buzzbee mount you’ll need to get the accountwide Master of Timeways 30% experience buff five of the seven weeks of the event. This is accomplished by running four Timewalking dungeons on the same character, as each run adds a stacking experience buff labeled Distilled Knowledge of Timeways until Master of Timeways is earned.

Title: Everything NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang announced at its CES 2025 keynote

NVIDIA held its CES 2025 keynote last night with CEO Jensen Huang and it was surprisingly eventful. The company finally unveiled its much awaited GeForce RTX 5000 GPUs that promise a considerable performance uplift, to start with. The company didn't stop there, also announcing Project Digits, a personal AI supercomputer, along with DLSS 4 and more. Here's a wrap-up of what happened — and you can watch the whole event uncut, via the YouTube embed below. (Spoiler alert: It's more than 90 minutes long.) Huang strode out in a new snakeskin-like leather jacket and revealed the much-anticipated RTX 5090 GPU. With 32GB of GDDR7 RAM and an impressive 21,760 CUDA cores, the new flagship can deliver up to twice as much relative performance, particularly for ray-tracing (RT) intensive games like Cyberpunk 2077. In fact that particular title ran at 234 fps with full RT on in a video demo, compared to 109 fps on the RTX 4090. It's not cheap, though, priced at $1,999. The company also revealed the $549 RTX 5070 with a far more modest 6,144 CUDA cores and 12GB of DDR7 RAM, along with the $749 RTX 5070 Ti and $999 RTX 5080. A key part of the RTX 5000-series launch was the introduction of DLSS 4, the latest version of the company's real-time image upscaling technology. It features a new technology called Multi Frame Generation that allows the new GPUs to generate up to three additional frames for every one frame the GPU produces via traditional rendering — helping multiply frame rates by up to eight times. It also represents what NVIDIA calls the "biggest upgrade to its AI models" since DLSS 2, improving things like temporal stability and detail, while reducing artifacts like ghosting. Finally, NVIDIA launched Project Digits, a "personal AI supercomputer" designed for AI researchers, data scientists and students. It uses NVIDIA's new GB10 Grace Blackwell superchip, providing up to a petaflop of performance for testing and running AI models. The company says a single Project Digits unit can run models 200 billion parameters in size, or multiple machines can be linked together to run up to 405 billion parameter models. And for its intended audience, Project Digits is relatively cheap at $3,000. On top of all that, the company introduced NVIDIA Cosmos world foundation models for robot and AV development, the NVIDIA DRIVE Hyperion AV platform for autonomous vehicles and AI Foundation models for RTX PCs "that supercharge digital humans." It's all explained in the video above and NVIDIA's CES 2025 keynote blog. CES — and Huang's keynote — are happening against the backdrop of continued volatility in the company's stock price. NVIDIA shares (ticker NVDA) spiked ahead of Huang's address, closing on Monday just shy of Apple's market cap pinnacle. But Tuesday saw a reversal, with the stock down more than 6 percent. Still, some are betting it's a toss up between the two tech giants as to which will hit the $4 trillion market valuation first. Update, January 7 2025, 4:18PM ET: This story has been updated with new details on Nvidia's stock price.

Title: Bitcoin’s Price Prediction For 2025: What To Watch For This Year

As 2025 unfolds, bitcoin’s trajectory will be shaped by increased sovereign adoption, liquidity ... [+] dynamics and integration into corporate treasuries. Bitcoin’s remarkable journey in 2024 set the stage for a transformative year. With institutional adoption skyrocketing, regulatory clarity improving and technological advancements accelerating, the question on everyone’s mind is: where will bitcoin go in 2025? This article explores bitcoin’s current state, the factors shaping its price, expert predictions, opportunities and challenges for the coming year. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or a curious observer, here’s what you need to know about bitcoin’s potential in 2025. Bitcoin’s evolution in 2024 cemented its status as a mainstream asset. With its price breaching the $100,000 mark, it drew unprecedented interest from institutional investors, retail traders and governments. The approval of multiple spot bitcoin ETFs by the SEC was a pivotal moment, ushering billions in new liquidity and normalizing bitcoin as a legitimate investment vehicle. Institutional adoption was another major milestone. Leading firms like BlackRock and BNY Mellon embraced bitcoin, offering custody and trading solutions to their clients. This institutional confidence supported a dramatic and sustained rise in bitcoin’s price in 2024. Now, we may see a virtuous cycle of increased inflows and reduced volatility. Bitcoin’s position on corporate balance sheets also looks set to grow, with corporations like MicroStrategy expanding their holdings to record levels and dozens of other companies following suit. With regulatory frameworks becoming clearer and adoption growing across industries, bitcoin entered 2025 with significant momentum. Its resilience and unmatched monetary properties make it a cornerstone of the emerging digital financial ecosystem. Several forces are shaping bitcoin’s price in 2025, ranging from institutional adoption and regulatory developments to technological innovation. Together, these factors will determine whether bitcoin continues its upward trajectory or faces hurdles in its mainstream acceptance. Institutional participation in bitcoin markets reached historic levels in 2024, with firms like BlackRock, BNY Mellon and Fidelity integrating bitcoin into their offerings. Spot bitcoin ETFs, hailed as a watershed moment, provided regulated avenues for large capital pools, such as pension funds and retirement accounts, to gain exposure. This wave of adoption not only brought new liquidity but also reduced market volatility, making bitcoin more attractive to risk-averse investors. In 2025, increased institutional participation could further stabilize bitcoin’s price and cement its role as a core portfolio asset for long-term wealth preservation. Regulation played a defining role in bitcoin’s 2024 success, with the SEC approving multiple spot ETFs and clarifying its stance on bitcoin as a commodity. These developments bolstered investor confidence and fostered broader acceptance. Looking ahead, regulation could either propel bitcoin to new heights or present obstacles. In the long term, bitcoin will overcome any roadblocks put in its way by regulators, lobbies or financial institutions, because capital naturally flows into the hardest form of money available. However, financial incumbents can slow the speed of adoption if they mount a strong resistance to bitcoin. Bitcoin’s technological ecosystem continues to evolve, enhancing its scalability, privacy, and utility. “Layer 2” (L2) innovations like the Lightning Network enables near-instant transactions at negligible cost. Newer L2 technologies like Ark and Fedimints will continue to mature, pushing forward bitcoin’s viability as a medium of exchange. Upcoming advancements, such as privacy-enhancing features like Silent Payments and improved self-custody solutions will make bitcoin even more secure and accessible. Additionally, bitcoin-backed lending protocols are poised to unlock liquidity without requiring holders to give up custody of their assets. These developments will reinforce bitcoin’s appeal as both a currency and a store of value. The events of 2024 have sparked a wide range of predictions for bitcoin’s price in 2025, reflecting varying levels of optimism and caution. Bullish predictions for bitcoin's price in 2025 from posts on X suggest a significant upward trend. CNBC analyst Tom Lee’s target number is $250,000. Matthew Sigel of VanEck forecasts $180,000. These forecasts reflect a strong belief in continued institutional adoption, the impact of bitcoin ETFs, and the cyclical nature of bitcoin's price movements post-halving. Of course, mega-bulls like Cathie Wood and Michael Saylor expect multi-million dollar bitcoin in the next few years, though not necessarily in 2025. Bearish analysts caution against over-exuberance, highlighting macroeconomic risks like tightening monetary policies and potential regulatory crackdowns. A historical correlation with M2 suggests that bitcoin may depreciate as monetary conditions tighten. Peter L. Brandt, a respected market analyst, warns that his technical analysis might indicate a crash to $78,000, but that the price could then either continue declining or rise precipitously. There are no indicators that we have another “crypto winter” on the horizon, but then again, there weren’t any clear indicators that one was going to come in 2022, either. The collapse of the politically-connected money laundering operation known as FTX, and the subsequent attempts to cover up ties between stolen money and donations to prominent political leaders, unexpectedly blew up what had been a favorable macroeconomic environment for continued bitcoin price appreciation. The thing about black swans is that they are, well, black swans – there’s always a chance that bitcoin adoption will be temporarily held back by another liquidity crisis in fiat-based finance. Some price targets for 2025 are more neutral in nature. As a typical example, this X user suggests bitcoin might start the year with a dip around $80,000 to $85,000 due to the January inauguration, then recover to make new all-time highs but face rejections before trending higher into a blowoff top by the end of the year. Some investors who believe quantum computing advancements threaten bitcoin have rated BTC a “hold.” Although these investors are correct to point out that quantum computing will necessitate changes to bitcoin’s protocol, there is no reason to single out bitcoin in this regard. Encryption is a key part of virtually all modern businesses, so by this logic, all stocks would also be rated a hold indefinitely until company leadership can present a credible plan for post-quantum transition. In 2025, developments in regulation, technology, and mainstream acceptance are set to significantly impact bitcoin’s exchange rate with the dollar. Below are key trends that could drive bitcoin’s continued growth. Global liquidity conditions in 2025 may create a favorable environment for Bitcoin’s appreciation. China’s bond market rally, with 10-year yields hitting multi-decade lows due to rate cut expectations, signals a broader shift in economic policy. Simultaneously, U.S. Treasury bills are maturing at unprecedented levels, and there is a strong possibility that the U.S. federal government will pivot toward tariffs as a revenue source, which could significantly raise the prices of consumer and capital goods in the short term. These factors point to an inflationary environment, with the Federal Reserve likely constrained in its ability to tighten monetary policy further. Historically, such inflationary pressures have resulted in asset price increases, which would mean bitcoin’s price could rise alongside stocks, real estate and other stores of value. Sovereign adoption of bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset remains a compelling possibility for 2025. In the U.S., the regulatory shift toward bitcoin-friendly policies, exemplified by pro-bitcoin voices within the Trump administration, could set a precedent for broader acceptance. This legitimacy, in turn, could prompt other nations to explore bitcoin as a reserve asset. Sovereign adoption also reduces circulating supply, as reserves are typically held long-term and removed from active market liquidity. As more nations accumulate bitcoin for strategic reserves, a combination of reduced supply and increased demand could lead to sustained price increases. Mainstream integration of bitcoin into business treasury operations could be a defining trend in 2025. MicroStrategy’s addition to the QQQ index signaled that markets are increasingly willing to embrace companies with substantial bitcoin holdings. Additionally, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) rule change now allows companies to report bitcoin holdings at fair market value rather than cost basis, making it more appealing for firms to hold bitcoin without distorting their balance sheets. An emerging ecosystem for collateralized lending, including bitcoin-backed debt instruments, is also taking shape. This development enables companies to secure liquidity without selling their bitcoin holdings, effectively integrating bitcoin-backed financing into standard business operations. As more firms adopt these practices, bitcoin’s role as a core asset for financial resilience and growth will become more prominent, driving further adoption and market demand. Despite bitcoin’s remarkable progress, several challenges could impact its growth in 2025. These include state-led attempts to control financial systems, speculative concerns around future technologies, and macroeconomic uncertainties. Understanding these potential hurdles is crucial for gauging bitcoin’s resilience and long-term outlook. As bitcoin adoption grows, state actors may attempt to assert control over financial sovereignty through regulatory measures and Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank (ECB), outlined ambitious plans for 2025, including launching the digital euro and reshaping euro banknotes. These initiatives are part of a broader strategy to maintain influence over monetary systems amid growing inflationary pressures. CBDCs could be used to limit bitcoin’s role by offering a state-backed alternative, potentially accompanied by stricter regulations on decentralized currencies. However, history shows that attempts to suppress bitcoin often have the opposite effect, driving adoption as users seek financial systems resistant to control and censorship. The geopolitical instability in regions like Europe, coupled with the ongoing U.S. embrace of bitcoin, could further highlight the contrast between permissionless money like bitcoin and state-issued digital assets. Fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) about quantum computing’s impact on bitcoin’s security has recently resurfaced in mainstream discourse. Critics claim that future quantum computers could break bitcoin’s cryptographic security, rendering the network vulnerable to attack. However, quantum computing will pose a problem for virtually all digital systems that modern life relies upon. Bitcoin’s encryption protocol can be upgraded to be quantum-safe. Upgrading thousands of other systems and protocols could be much more challenging. In reality, quantum computing is a problem for every single system that uses encryption, and will need to be addressed with a Y2K-style effort with all hands on deck. Quantum computing doesn’t pose a unique problem for bitcoin. Macroeconomic conditions remain a significant factor influencing bitcoin’s performance. Global economic uncertainty, driven by inflationary pressures, geopolitical conflicts and shifts in monetary policy, will continue to shape financial markets. In Europe, rising inflation rates and political instability — exacerbated by coalition collapses in major economies like Germany and France — add further complexity. In the U.S., fiscal challenges, including the potential shift to tariffs as a revenue stream, could influence both domestic and global financial dynamics. While bitcoin thrives in inflationary environments due to its scarcity, extreme economic instability can also deter adoption if liquidity becomes constrained. Conversely, prolonged economic turbulence could position bitcoin as a safe-haven asset for those seeking to preserve wealth outside traditional financial systems. Bitcoin’s trajectory in 2025 depends on a combination of factors, from institutional adoption and technological innovation to regulatory clarity. While short-term volatility remains likely, the long-term outlook for bitcoin is robust, with adoption trends and monetary properties driving its growth. However, nobody can predict the price of bitcoin. Investors should approach this asset class with a long-term perspective, understanding its potential as a tool for generational wealth creation, not a reliable source of short term trading profits. As bitcoin continues to mature as an asset, the strategies for investing in it are evolving. This section explores key strategies — diversifying your portfolio, staying informed on market trends, and leveraging dollar-cost averaging — to help navigate bitcoin investing in 2025 and beyond. Bitcoin remains a high-growth asset with significant upside. BlackRock now recommends an optimal allocation of about 2%. What this means is that one of the largest financial firms in the world sees bitcoin as playing a role in managing the risk and growth potential of a mainstream portfolio. In 2025 and beyond, when we talk about diversification across asset classes, bitcoin will be assumed to be part of the picture. The mantra to simply buy and HODL bitcoin is easy to understand and follow, and has provided substantial returns over the long term. However, if you are one of those investors that feels like something is missing unless you’re actively researching and investing in market movers, the thing to watch in 2025 is corporate adoption. Companies that incorporate bitcoin into their treasury strategy may perform differently than others, as we saw with MicroStrategy in 2024. Several new ETFs are awaiting approval that would provide exposure to companies that hold bitcoin on their balance sheets. Dollar-cost averaging allows investors to build a bitcoin position over time, reducing the impact of short-term price fluctuations. This technique lets you set it and forget it, rather than trying to time the market. Modern bitcoin platforms make it easy to dollar-cost average into bitcoin. Bitcoin’s journey through 2024 cemented its position as a cornerstone of the global financial landscape. Institutional adoption surged with the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs, while regulatory clarity and technological advancements strengthened its appeal as a long-term asset. Despite potential challenges, including macroeconomic uncertainty and state-level opposition, bitcoin’s unmatched monetary properties continue to drive global demand. As 2025 unfolds, bitcoin’s trajectory will be shaped by increased sovereign adoption, liquidity dynamics and integration into corporate treasuries. Whether bullish or cautious, one fact remains indisputable — bitcoin’s adoption curve only points upward. Investors should approach this asset with a long-term perspective, recognizing it as a tool for generational wealth in an era where financial innovation and sound money converge. While predictions vary, long-term adoption trends suggest upward momentum, despite potential short-term volatility. That said, it is impossible to predict bitcoin’s price. You should always do your own research and consult your financial advisor before investing. Yes, institutional participation is a key driver, providing liquidity and stabilizing markets. ETFs and other traditional financial instruments are providing bitcoin exposure to investment portfolios that could never access it before. While there is always the possibility that a government decides to attack bitcoin using environmental policy, the political winds in the U.S. have shifted in such a decisive way in favor of bitcoin that I believe a major environmental campaign against bitcoin is unlikely in 2025. Bitcoin tends to appreciate over long time scales but exhibits price volatility in the short term. That’s why it’s usually a good idea to only invest what you can afford to set aside and not touch for a long time. Rather than timing the market, use dollar-cost averaging techniques to buy small amounts consistently over time. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks reversed early gains to close firmly lower as cautious investors weighed new economic data, while Nvidia (NVDA) retreated from its record close despite the company's big artificial intelligence plans. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell over 1.1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) lost roughly 1.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) bounced around throughout the day but ended the session down about 0.4%. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) added roughly 7 basis points to hover just below 4.7%. And bets on when the Federal Reserve will next cut interest rates were pushed back, too. Early on Tuesday, the Institute for Supply Management's nonmanufacturing PMI indicated the service sector continued to expand last month, although the prices paid index jumped to a nearly two-year high of 64.4, up from the prior 58.2. The surge in prices "is a worry for the Fed," Capital Economics North America economist Thomas Ryan wrote. "This serves as a good reminder that the Fed's fight against inflation is not over, particularly going into a year where tariffs and immigration curbs are set to reignite price pressures." Additionally, JOLTS job openings rose more than expected during the month of November. Fewer hires were also made compared to the previous month while the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, fell to 1.9% from 2.1% in October. The data sets the stage for Friday's all-important December jobs report. Investors are now betting with almost certainty that the central bank keeps interest rates unchanged later this month, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Traders are also placing a less than 50% chance the central bank cuts rates ahead of its June meeting. Meanwhile, Nvidia shares reversed gains to fall over 6% after hitting a record close just one day prior. The chip maker was the Dow's worst performer of the session. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's CES keynote on Monday revealed a new AI superchip among other planned products. US stocks closed in a sea of red on Tuesday as traders recalibrated Fed rate cut bets following a string of mixed economic data and concerns over an uptick in inflation. Big Tech led the declines with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) shedding roughly 1.9%, dragged down by shares of Nvidia (NVDA), which lost over 6%. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell over 1.1% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) ended the session down about 0.4%. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) added roughly 7 basis points to hover just below 4.7%. Job openings rose more than economists expected in November, but other signs of cooling in the labor market have persisted as fewer Americans left their jobs and hiring continued to slow. On Tuesday, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) showed 5.27 million hires were made during the month, down from the 5.39 million made during October. The hiring rate fell to 3.3% from the 3.4% seen in October. Also in Tuesday's report, the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, fell to 1.9% from 2.1% in October. Both the quits rate and hiring rate are now lower than they were before pandemic. Oxford Economics lead US economist Nancy Vanden Houten described Tuesday's release as consistent with a "no hire, no fire" labor market. Largely, this is seen as an OK scenario for the Federal Reserve's maximum employment mandate, as long as conditions don't worsen. In December, Fed Chair Jerome Powell described the labor market as "looser than pre-pandemic" but also noted that, for now, the labor market is cooling in a "gradual and orderly way." The key question remains whether things can stay in this state if the Fed holds interest rates steady over the next several months or if more softness emerges, prompting a rate move from the central bank. "We don’t think we need further cooling in the labor market to get inflation down to 2%," Powell said. Trump made quite a few eyebrow-raising comments over the past few days, from suggesting Canada could become the 51st US state to implying military force could be used to acquire the Panama Canal and Greenland. But one strategist told Yahoo Finance not to pay too much attention to the president-elect's policies or rhetoric. At least not yet. "Trump's approach is very simple in a lot of ways," Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors, told Yahoo Finance's Market Domination. "There are a lot of outlandish comments and objectives that will largely go by the wayside." Arone noted that while Trump will likely attempt to tackle or make progress on most of his campaign promises, like tax cuts for corporations and curbs on immigration, much of his rhetoric will likely be used as a bargaining chip or a starting point to negotiate something better. "Look at what already happened this week with tariffs," he said, referring to a Washington Post report from earlier this week that said Trump's team is now exploring more limited tariffs than anticipated. "We've seen this movie before," he said. "That's why investors are too obsessed with all the outcomes on this." Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: The surprise departure of Federal Reserve vice chair for supervision Michael Barr is focusing new attention on Michelle Bowman, named by analysts as the person most likely to become the Fed’s new top banking cop. The conservative Fed governor and former state banking commissioner of Kansas "seems like the likely choice," Stifel chief Washington policy strategist Brian Gardner said in a note Monday. Bowman "is the logical candidate," added TD Cowen’s Jaret Seiberg in a separate note. What helps Bowman's chances, according to analysts, is that there currently is no empty seat on the Fed's board of governors for Trump to fill with an outsider. Barr said he will remain as a Fed governor until his term is up in 2032. So Trump either has to leave the Fed vice chair for supervision position empty until Fed governor Adriana Kugler's term expires Jan. 31, 2026, or nominate an existing Fed governor to the post. Bowman would fit that qualification. Bowman, if selected, could take the regulation of the nation’s largest banks in a new direction. Read more here. Meta shares fell nearly 2% on Tuesday after CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced an end to the company's third-party fact-checking program. Originally designed to curb misinformation, the program will now be replaced by a user-driven model similar to X's Community Notes. "We are going to get back to our roots and focus on reducing mistakes, simplifying our policies, and restoring free expression on our platforms," Zuckerberg said in a video posted by the company. "Fact-checkers have just been too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they have created, especially in the US." “We’ve reached a point where it’s just too many mistakes and too much censorship.” As Yahoo Finance's Hamza Shaban reports, the move highlights intersecting shifts in media, technology, and politics as the Biden era comes to an end. Meta is responding to competition from X as popular platforms continue to shun traditional media and as tech industry executives attempt to win favor under a second Trump administration. Shares of AI software firm Palantir Technologies fell more than 6% after Morgan Stanley reinstated coverage of the company with an Underweight rating. Morgan Stanley analyst Sanjit Singh set his 12-month price target for the stock at $60, implying shares could drop another 15% on top of Tuesday's decline. Even with Tuesday's drop Palantir shares have rallied over 340% over the past year, fueled by a broader boom in artificial intelligence and the US government’s growing interest in AI war technologies. The stock was added to the S&P 500 in September. Its most recent quarterly earnings surpassed expectations thanks to higher-than-anticipated spending from the US government on its AI tech. Palantir is led by oft-controversial CEO Alex Karp and was co-founded by conservative tech mogul Peter Thiel. The firm has at times faced backlash for its partnerships with government agencies, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Israeli Defense Force (IDF). Bitcoin (BTC-USD) dropped below the critical $100,000 mark on Tuesday, echoing broader market losses as better-than-expected economic data sparked fears of an inflation resurgence. In mid-afternoon trade, the largest cryptocurrency traded around $97,000 a token after prices on Monday topped $100,000 for the first time since Dec. 19. Smaller cryptocurrencies like ethereum (ETH-USD) dropped 7% to trade above $3,400 a coin. Vaccine makers' stocks rose Tuesday following the first reported bird flu death in the US as well as an uptick in COVID-19 cases, per CDC data. Moderna (MRNA) surged nearly 12%. Moderna in July 2024 was awarded $176 million from the US government to advance the development of its mRNA H5N1 (bird flu) vaccine, which is in early stages of testing. Pfizer (PFE) is also developing an mRNA vaccine for H5N1. Shares of the company rose a more modest 1.4% midday Tuesday. Its partner on a COVID-19 vaccine, BioNTech (BNTX), rose over 5%. Meanwhile, German biotech firm CureVac (CVAC) rose 5.9%. CureVac is developing an mRNA bird flu shot in collaboration with Indian pharma giant GlaxoSmithKline (GLAXO.BO), which was up a little more than 1%. Also amid the COVID-19 uptick, vaccine maker Novavax (NVAX) rose over 10%. The US dollar (DX=F, DX-Y.NYB) pushed higher on Tuesday, rebounding after the currency was on track for a one-week low following reports President-elect Donald Trump won't commit to an aggressive tariff plan. “The dollar has swung to a gain today after the ISM services (54.1) and job openings (8.1M) strongly beat expectations in December, leading markets to roll back their expectations for Federal Reserve easing this year to only 33 basis points," Kyle Chapman, FX markets analyst at Ballinger Group, wrote in an email. “There are two main points leading the dollar higher. The first is a rebound in labor demand reflected in the strong rise in job openings, and the second is the strongest ISM prices paid index since February 2023," he said. Prices paid in the services sector jumped to a nearly two-year high, suggesting the inflation fight is not yet finished. Following the data's release, traders scaled back rate cut bets, placing a less than 50% chance the central bank cuts rates ahead of its June meeting, per the CME FedWatch Tool. "It is certainly too early to call a reacceleration in inflation from this round of data, and markets will take the bigger clues from non-farms on Friday," Chapman said. "With the market now firmly biased towards only a single rate cut this year, for me the room is only growing for a pullback in the overstretched hawkish repricing of the Fed path.” President-elect Donald Trump announced a new multibillion-dollar foreign investment to build new data centers across the United States as interest and exploration of artificial intelligence intensifies. Trump revealed on Tuesday that Damac Group, based in Dubai and backed by billionaire developer Hussain Sajwani, will invest $20 billion into the build-out. "They feel so strongly about the country that they want to let people know about it," the president-elect said during a press briefing at Mar-a-Lago. "It's an honor to have such a great investor." Trump said the investment will be used to create "massive new data centers" across the Midwest and Sunbelt regions "and keep America on the cutting edge of technology and artificial intelligence." The project's first phase will begin in a handful of states, including Texas, Arizona, Oklahoma, Michigan, and Indiana, among others. Prices paid in the services sector during December shot higher, casting concern over the path forward for inflation. Data from the Institute of Supply Management showed the prices paid index jumped to a reading of 64.4 in December, up from 58.2 the month prior. Broadly, activity in the sector also increased with the ISM services index rising to 54.1 in December from 53.5 in November. "The surge in the prices paid index to a nearly two-year high of 64.4, from 58.2, is a worry for the Fed as it is consistent with PCE supercore inflation remaining at 3.5% until the middle of next year," Capital Economics North America economist Thomas Ryan wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday. "This serves as a good reminder that the Fed's fight against inflation is not over, particularly going into a year where tariffs and immigration curbs are set to reignite price pressures." The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) quickly moved higher after the release, adding roughly 7 basis points to hover just below 4.7%. And bets on when the Federal Reserve will next cut interest rates were pushed back too. Traders now see a less than 50% chance the Fed cuts rates before the central bank's June meeting, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Yesterday, traders saw a roughly 55% chance the Fed will have cut interest rates by at least 25 basis points by the end of its May meeting. Markets sold off as rates chugged higher. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), which opened the day in the green, was down about 1%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC), which had also been positive earlier in the session, fell about 0.4% Job openings rose more than expected in November as investors continue to dissect the pace of the labor market slowdown amid questions over how much further the Federal Reserve will slash interest rates this year. New data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Tuesday showed that 8.1 million jobs were open at the end of November, an increase from the 7.84 million in October. The October figure was revised higher from the 7.74 million open jobs initially reported. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected Tuesday's report to show 7.74 million openings in November The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) also showed 5.27 million hires were made during the month, down from the 5.39 million made during October. The hiring rate fell to 3.3% from 3.4% in October. Also in Tuesday's report, the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, fell to 1.9% from 2.1% in October. Total quits decreased to 3.07 million from 3.28 million in October. US stocks edged higher on Tuesday, with Nvidia (NVDA) once again lifting market sentiment. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) inched up 0.3%, holding near tech-fueled prior-session gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also rose 0.3%, while those on the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added around 0.2%. Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose as much as 2.5% in premarket trading following CEO Jensen Huang’s keynote at the tech industry’s annual CES trade show in Las Vegas late Monday. Huang's presentation gave a flurry of updates on upcoming Nvidia products that preview what’s next in the burgeoning artificial intelligence market and other emerging technologies. Nvidia shares closed at a record high of $149.43 Monday ahead of Huang’s keynote — eclipsing its prior record close of $148.88 reached back on Nov. 7. Read more here.

Title: Stock market today: Nasdaq leads stock declines as traders pare rate cut bets, Nvidia plummets after record close

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks reversed early gains to close firmly lower as cautious investors weighed new economic data, while Nvidia (NVDA) retreated from its record close despite the company's big artificial intelligence plans. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell over 1.1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) lost roughly 1.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) bounced around throughout the day but ended the session down about 0.4%. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) added roughly 7 basis points to hover just below 4.7%. And bets on when the Federal Reserve will next cut interest rates were pushed back, too. Early on Tuesday, the Institute for Supply Management's nonmanufacturing PMI indicated the service sector continued to expand last month, although the prices paid index jumped to a nearly two-year high of 64.4, up from the prior 58.2. The surge in prices "is a worry for the Fed," Capital Economics North America economist Thomas Ryan wrote. "This serves as a good reminder that the Fed's fight against inflation is not over, particularly going into a year where tariffs and immigration curbs are set to reignite price pressures." Additionally, JOLTS job openings rose more than expected during the month of November. Fewer hires were also made compared to the previous month while the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, fell to 1.9% from 2.1% in October. The data sets the stage for Friday's all-important December jobs report. Investors are now betting with almost certainty that the central bank keeps interest rates unchanged later this month, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Traders are also placing a less than 50% chance the central bank cuts rates ahead of its June meeting. Meanwhile, Nvidia shares reversed gains to fall over 6% after hitting a record close just one day prior. The chip maker was the Dow's worst performer of the session. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's CES keynote on Monday revealed a new AI superchip among other planned products. US stocks closed in a sea of red on Tuesday as traders recalibrated Fed rate cut bets following a string of mixed economic data and concerns over an uptick in inflation. Big Tech led the declines with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) shedding roughly 1.9%, dragged down by shares of Nvidia (NVDA), which lost over 6%. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell over 1.1% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) ended the session down about 0.4%. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) added roughly 7 basis points to hover just below 4.7%. Job openings rose more than economists expected in November, but other signs of cooling in the labor market have persisted as fewer Americans left their jobs and hiring continued to slow. On Tuesday, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) showed 5.27 million hires were made during the month, down from the 5.39 million made during October. The hiring rate fell to 3.3% from the 3.4% seen in October. Also in Tuesday's report, the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, fell to 1.9% from 2.1% in October. Both the quits rate and hiring rate are now lower than they were before pandemic. Oxford Economics lead US economist Nancy Vanden Houten described Tuesday's release as consistent with a "no hire, no fire" labor market. Largely, this is seen as an OK scenario for the Federal Reserve's maximum employment mandate, as long as conditions don't worsen. In December, Fed Chair Jerome Powell described the labor market as "looser than pre-pandemic" but also noted that, for now, the labor market is cooling in a "gradual and orderly way." The key question remains whether things can stay in this state if the Fed holds interest rates steady over the next several months or if more softness emerges, prompting a rate move from the central bank. "We don’t think we need further cooling in the labor market to get inflation down to 2%," Powell said. Trump made quite a few eyebrow-raising comments over the past few days, from suggesting Canada could become the 51st US state to implying military force could be used to acquire the Panama Canal and Greenland. But one strategist told Yahoo Finance not to pay too much attention to the president-elect's policies or rhetoric. At least not yet. "Trump's approach is very simple in a lot of ways," Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors, told Yahoo Finance's Market Domination. "There are a lot of outlandish comments and objectives that will largely go by the wayside." Arone noted that while Trump will likely attempt to tackle or make progress on most of his campaign promises, like tax cuts for corporations and curbs on immigration, much of his rhetoric will likely be used as a bargaining chip or a starting point to negotiate something better. "Look at what already happened this week with tariffs," he said, referring to a Washington Post report from earlier this week that said Trump's team is now exploring more limited tariffs than anticipated. "We've seen this movie before," he said. "That's why investors are too obsessed with all the outcomes on this." Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: The surprise departure of Federal Reserve vice chair for supervision Michael Barr is focusing new attention on Michelle Bowman, named by analysts as the person most likely to become the Fed’s new top banking cop. The conservative Fed governor and former state banking commissioner of Kansas "seems like the likely choice," Stifel chief Washington policy strategist Brian Gardner said in a note Monday. Bowman "is the logical candidate," added TD Cowen’s Jaret Seiberg in a separate note. What helps Bowman's chances, according to analysts, is that there currently is no empty seat on the Fed's board of governors for Trump to fill with an outsider. Barr said he will remain as a Fed governor until his term is up in 2032. So Trump either has to leave the Fed vice chair for supervision position empty until Fed governor Adriana Kugler's term expires Jan. 31, 2026, or nominate an existing Fed governor to the post. Bowman would fit that qualification. Bowman, if selected, could take the regulation of the nation’s largest banks in a new direction. Read more here. Meta shares fell nearly 2% on Tuesday after CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced an end to the company's third-party fact-checking program. Originally designed to curb misinformation, the program will now be replaced by a user-driven model similar to X's Community Notes. "We are going to get back to our roots and focus on reducing mistakes, simplifying our policies, and restoring free expression on our platforms," Zuckerberg said in a video posted by the company. "Fact-checkers have just been too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they have created, especially in the US." “We’ve reached a point where it’s just too many mistakes and too much censorship.” As Yahoo Finance's Hamza Shaban reports, the move highlights intersecting shifts in media, technology, and politics as the Biden era comes to an end. Meta is responding to competition from X as popular platforms continue to shun traditional media and as tech industry executives attempt to win favor under a second Trump administration. Shares of AI software firm Palantir Technologies fell more than 6% after Morgan Stanley reinstated coverage of the company with an Underweight rating. Morgan Stanley analyst Sanjit Singh set his 12-month price target for the stock at $60, implying shares could drop another 15% on top of Tuesday's decline. Even with Tuesday's drop Palantir shares have rallied over 340% over the past year, fueled by a broader boom in artificial intelligence and the US government’s growing interest in AI war technologies. The stock was added to the S&P 500 in September. Its most recent quarterly earnings surpassed expectations thanks to higher-than-anticipated spending from the US government on its AI tech. Palantir is led by oft-controversial CEO Alex Karp and was co-founded by conservative tech mogul Peter Thiel. The firm has at times faced backlash for its partnerships with government agencies, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Israeli Defense Force (IDF). Bitcoin (BTC-USD) dropped below the critical $100,000 mark on Tuesday, echoing broader market losses as better-than-expected economic data sparked fears of an inflation resurgence. In mid-afternoon trade, the largest cryptocurrency traded around $97,000 a token after prices on Monday topped $100,000 for the first time since Dec. 19. Smaller cryptocurrencies like ethereum (ETH-USD) dropped 7% to trade above $3,400 a coin. Vaccine makers' stocks rose Tuesday following the first reported bird flu death in the US as well as an uptick in COVID-19 cases, per CDC data. Moderna (MRNA) surged nearly 12%. Moderna in July 2024 was awarded $176 million from the US government to advance the development of its mRNA H5N1 (bird flu) vaccine, which is in early stages of testing. Pfizer (PFE) is also developing an mRNA vaccine for H5N1. Shares of the company rose a more modest 1.4% midday Tuesday. Its partner on a COVID-19 vaccine, BioNTech (BNTX), rose over 5%. Meanwhile, German biotech firm CureVac (CVAC) rose 5.9%. CureVac is developing an mRNA bird flu shot in collaboration with Indian pharma giant GlaxoSmithKline (GLAXO.BO), which was up a little more than 1%. Also amid the COVID-19 uptick, vaccine maker Novavax (NVAX) rose over 10%. The US dollar (DX=F, DX-Y.NYB) pushed higher on Tuesday, rebounding after the currency was on track for a one-week low following reports President-elect Donald Trump won't commit to an aggressive tariff plan. “The dollar has swung to a gain today after the ISM services (54.1) and job openings (8.1M) strongly beat expectations in December, leading markets to roll back their expectations for Federal Reserve easing this year to only 33 basis points," Kyle Chapman, FX markets analyst at Ballinger Group, wrote in an email. “There are two main points leading the dollar higher. The first is a rebound in labor demand reflected in the strong rise in job openings, and the second is the strongest ISM prices paid index since February 2023," he said. Prices paid in the services sector jumped to a nearly two-year high, suggesting the inflation fight is not yet finished. Following the data's release, traders scaled back rate cut bets, placing a less than 50% chance the central bank cuts rates ahead of its June meeting, per the CME FedWatch Tool. "It is certainly too early to call a reacceleration in inflation from this round of data, and markets will take the bigger clues from non-farms on Friday," Chapman said. "With the market now firmly biased towards only a single rate cut this year, for me the room is only growing for a pullback in the overstretched hawkish repricing of the Fed path.” President-elect Donald Trump announced a new multibillion-dollar foreign investment to build new data centers across the United States as interest and exploration of artificial intelligence intensifies.

Title: Even Hims & Hers is giving Trump money
URL: https://qz.com/hims-hers-trump-donation-1851734677
Time Published: 2025-01-07T20:25:00Z
Full Content:
The millennial-focused digital health company Hims & Hers (HIMS-7.12%) has donated $1 million to President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration fund. It joins the growing ranks of corporate donors to the fund, including Facebook parent company Meta (META-1.54%), Amazon (AMZN-0.37%), OpenAI, Uber (UBER-2.05%), and Bank of America (BAC+0.10%). The donations are viewed by some as an attempt to curry favor with the incoming administration. For instance, on Tuesday, outgoing U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chair Lina Khan remarked that it’s only natural for Amazon and Meta to seek favorable terms with the Trump administration regarding antitrust cases initiated by the previous administration. Hims & Hers’ donation was first reported by Axios. “At Hims & Hers, we stand with leaders and advocates who are committed to improving America’s broken healthcare system,” the company told Quartz in an emailed statement confirming the donation. “For far too long, this system has forced Americans to struggle – financially and with limited access — to get essential medications and the care they need, especially for stigmatized conditions.” Hims & Hers was founded in 2017, known as just “Hims” at the time, as a platform for men to get prescriptions online for erectile dysfunction and hair loss medications. Since then, it has expanded to offer treatments for men and women to address skin care, anxiety, and overall sexual health. Its stock has surged over 200% in the last 12 months after the company started offering more affordable and off-brand versions of popular weight-loss drugs last year. In May Hims & Hers started offering its customers a compounded version of semaglutide, the active ingredient in the diabetes and weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, both of which are produced by Novo Nordisk (NVO+2.42%). Compounding is the process of customizing an approved drug by a state-licensed pharmacist or physician to meet the specific needs of an individual patient. Typically, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits compounding drugs that are just copies of commercially available medications. However, drugs that are in shortage, which semaglutide currently is, are not considered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be commercially available. The future of the compounded weight-loss drug market under the Trump administration remains uncertain. Trump has nominated Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which oversees the FDA. Kennedy has repeatedly been critical of pharmaceutical solutions to obesity. However, his views contrast those of another Trump supporter — Elon Musk. Musk, the richest person alive and the co-head of President-elect Donald Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has been supportive of expanding access to affordable GLP-1 weight-loss medications like Ozempic.

Title: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says company's racing to get next-gen Blackwell chips 'into every data center in the world'

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang expects the rollout of its next-gen Blackwell chips to be the company's biggest revenue driver soon. "We're racing to get Blackwells into every data center in the world," Huang said in an interview with Yahoo Finance from the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas on Tuesday. Huang added that he expects Blackwell revenues to eclipse sales of Nvidia’s prior-generation Hopper chips "early this year." Analysts expect Nvidia’s data center business to continue its blockbuster growth thanks to the rollout of its Blackwell lineup. In its most recent quarter, nearly 90% of its revenues came from this segment. The company is currently ramping up production of its high-powered Blackwell chip for AI applications and expects to ship several billion dollars worth of the hardware in the fourth quarter alone, with far more expected throughout the year ahead. Fourth quarter revenue at Nvidia tallied $35.1 billion. On Monday, Huang spent much of his CES keynote address talking about the opportunity in robotics and self-driving cars, which he expects will be one of the biggest computing industries in the world. "We've been working on self-driving cars now for some time," Huang said, noting that Nvidia’s technology for autonomous driving is already set to generate $5 billion in annual sales for the AI chipmaker. "If it's already a $5 billion business for us, imagine how big it's going to be when we have 100 million new [self-driving] cars per year,” Huang added. "This is likely going to be one of the largest robotics industries in the world and one of the largest computing industries in the world." On Monday, Huang unveiled the company’s Cosmos platform for developers to simulate their self-driving vehicle software, its latest push into the auto market. The executive also unveiled Nvidia’s partnerships with Toyota (TM) and autonomous trucking company Aurora Innovation (AUR), which will use its specialized chips for self-driving vehicle systems. Its newest DRIVE Thor chip for autonomous driving is based on the architecture for its latest Blackwell AI chips. Aurora stock rose more than 30% following the news on Tuesday. Nvidia stock, which opened at a record high on Tuesday, was down more than 5% in afternoon trade. Nvidia's Automotive and Robotics segments currently make up a relatively small portion of its overall revenue. In Q3, the division brought in $449 million compared to its Data Center business, which brought in $30.8 billion of its $35.1 billion in total revenue. At CES, Nvidia also unveiled a new, pint-sized artificial intelligence superchip called GB10 used in its (also new) client supercomputer. The supercomputer — sized to fit on the average-sized desk — is part of Nvidia’s Project DIGITS announced Monday, advertised to developers, researchers, and students. The device will be available in May for $3,000. "In the case of AI, we started in the cloud," Huang told Yahoo Finance. "We're coming into PCs, into personal computers … we want people to be able to access Nvidia AI, however you like to do it."

Nvidia (NVDA) is going all-in on A.I. agents as it seeks to cash in on what CEO Jensen Huang calls a “multi-trillion dollar opportunity” that could change how IT teams operate. During his keynote speech at the 2025 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) yesterday (Jan. 6) in Las Vegas, Huang unveiled Nvidia’s Nemotron family of large language models that developers can use to build A.I. agents—autonomous bots that can perform complex tasks without human control. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. Built with Meta (META)’s Llama model, the open-sourced Nemotron models, including Nano, Super, and Ultra, allow developers to “create and deploy” A.I. agents they can fine tune to specific business needs, Nvidia said. Applications include customer support, fraud detection, and inventory management optimization. By deploying A.I. agents, companies can “achieve unprecedented productivity,” according to the company. “In the future, these A.I. agents are essentially a digital workforce that are working alongside your employees doing things for you on your behalf,” Huang said during his keynote. “The way you would bring these specialized agents into your company is to onboard them just like you would on-board an employee.” In a live demonstration, Huang showcased examples of A.I. agents with digital replicas of his face. The A.I. research assistant agent for students, for instance, is designed to take documents like lectures, academic journals and financial results and synthesize them into an interactive podcast for “easy learning.” The software security agent can scan software and alert developers if vulnerabilities are detected so they can take immediate action. Other A.I. agents displayed included roles like financial analyst, employee support and factory operations. “The IT department of every company is going to be the HR department of A.I. agents in the future,” Huang said. Major companies are already lining up to use Nvidia’s Nemotron models. One early user is the enterprise software giant SAP. Philipp Herzig, chief A.I. officer at SAP, said in a release the company expects “hundreds of millions of enterprise users” to interact with Nvidia’s A.I. agents to “accomplish their goals faster than ever before,” Another enterprise software giant, ServiceNow, will use Nvidia’s new models to “build advanced A.I. agent services” that can solve a complex range of problems in a move to “achieve more with less effort,” Jeremy Barnes, the company’s vice president of platform A.I., said in a release. Nemotron is just one of many products Huang announced during his nearly two-hour-long keynote. The CEO also unveiled a new family of its latest Blackwell chips which the company claims is three times more powerful than previous generations of GPUs. The Blackwell family is expected to create a $100 billion market opportunity for Nvidia, Stifel analyst Ruben Roy wrote in a note last November. On top of that, Huang announced the GB200 NVl2, a super chip that it claims will supercharge the capacity for data centers to run A.I. workloads. Nvidia isn’t just betting big on its highly sought-after chips. Huang also announced the Cosmos foundation model to advance physical A.I. like humanoid robots, the DRIVE Hyperion platform to train self-driving vehicles, and Project Digits, a $3,000 personal supercomputer that Nvidia says is 1,000 times more powerful than a typical laptop. Nvidia also announced two autonomous driving partnerships, one with Toyota and the other with Aurora, a self-driving truck startup. The latest A.I. developments cements Nvidia’s position as a global leader in the A.I. revolution. Prior to Huang’s speech, Nvidia’s stock jumped more than 3.4 percent to a record high of $149.43 per share after market close in anticipation of the CES announcements. That surge sent Nvidia’s market value up to $3.47 trillion, briefly surpassing Apple’s. Nvidia’s market value grew by over $2 trillion last year.

We recently published a list of Top 10 AI Stocks on Wall Street’s Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) stands against other AI stocks on Wall Street's Radar. As reported by Reuters, Wall Street’s main indexes rose on Monday to more than one-week highs, driven by a rally in semiconductor stocks and news suggesting that the incoming Trump administration could adopt a less aggressive tariff stance than previously anticipated. READ ALSO: Top 10 AI Headlines Shaping Wall Street for 2025 and 10 AI Stocks Taking Wall Street by Storm Microsoft has recently announced that it plans to invest $80 billion in AI-enabled data centers in fiscal 2025, suggesting how semiconductor demand is expected to remain strong this year. According to Citigroup, the company’s spending plan was a “modest positive” update as it removed the risk of a drop in capital expenditures. Ever since OpenAI launched ChatGPT in 2022, investments in AI have surged drastically. Since AI requires drastic computing power, tech companies have been investing billions to enhance their AI infrastructures and broaden their data center networks. The race, however, isn’t just limited to the US. Efforts are being made to protect the country’s leadership in AI against the rest of the world, particularly China. China, in turn, has begun offering developing countries subsidized access to scarce chips, and it’s also promising to build local AI data centers. Moves like these could position the country as an AI leader in the future, something that the US is actively making efforts to avoid. However, regardless of the capital expenditures companies are making toward AI, one analyst says that these are no longer going to be enough in 2025. David Dietze of Peapack Private Wealth Management said that a major theme for 2025 is going to be “Show Me The Money”. Dietze said that even though major companies have been investing billions in AI partnerships and similar initiatives, investors are soon going to be demanding proof of returns. “Wall Street’s the type of place where it’s like, ‘Show me the money, like, yesterday…These investments and capital expenditures are great, but when does the cash flow start coming in? And right now many AI companies have gotten a pass on that, but I think increasingly Wall Street’s going to say, ‘No, we’ve seen the capital expenditures, you’ve got the AI label, but now we want to see the cash flows coming in from that. And that’s what we’re gonna be watching so carefully next year”. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

(NASDAQ:PLTR) is a leading provider of artificial intelligence systems. Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR) has had a spectacular year fueled by artificial intelligence, but an analyst from Morgan Stanley has recently turned negative on the red-hot stock. On January 6th, analyst Sanjit Singh assumed company coverage with an “Underweight” rating and placed a $60 price target on the stock, an estimated 25% downside from Friday’s close. According to Singh, despite Palantir’s (PLTR) early AI strides, the potential risks seem to outweigh the potential rewards. The firm, which hadn’t previously rated the stock, acknowledged that the company has been performing well and has good momentum, but also contended that the stock price already reflects this success which is “more than priced in at the current multiple premium”. “The skills/capabilities of the enterprise with respect to building AI applications should likely improve, which may make it difficult for Palantir (PLTR) to sustain its current level of momentum, creating downside risk given the premium valuation of the shares”. Overall, PLTR ranks 8th on our list of AI stocks on Wall Street's Radar. While we acknowledge the potential of PLTR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

AI to better train robots and cars as well as new gaming chips dominated Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's keynote speech at the CES 2025 conference on as the world's second most valuable firm expounded upon its potential to expand its business. Nvidia introduced what it calls Cosmos "foundation" models that generate photo-realistic video which can be used to train robots and self-driving cars at a much lower cost than using conventional data. By creating what is known in the tech industry as "synthetic" training data, the models can help robots and cars understand the physical world similar to the way that large language models helped chatbots generate responses in natural language. Users will be able to give Cosmos a text description that can be used to generate video of a world that obeys the laws of physics. This promises to be much cheaper than gathering data as it is done today. To train self-driving cars, for example, companies have fleets of vehicles that roam streets to gather data, and humanoid robots are often trained by having real humans repeat tasks over and over. Huang, however, cautioned that the Cosmos models will need much more data before hitting their "ChatGPT moment". Cosmos will be made available on an "open licence," similar to Meta Platforms Llama3 language models that have become widely used in the tech industry. "We really hope (Cosmos) will do for the world of robotics and industrial AI what Lama3 has done for enterprise AI," Huang said. The new gaming chips use Nvidia's 'Blackwell' AI technology to give video games movie-like graphics, especially in a field known as 'shaders,' which can help images like a ceramic teapot look more realistic by adding imperfections and fingerprint smudges to its surface. The new chips also have AI technology to help game developers generate more accurate human faces, an area where players are apt to notice even slightly unrealistic features. The chips, which Nvidia calls its RTX 50 series, will range in price from US$549 to US$1,999, with top models arriving on January 30 and lower-tier models coming in February. Nvidia said its mid-grade US$549 gaming chips will match the company's previous flagship chip, the RTX 4090 which sold for US$1,600. Nvidia also said that Toyota Motor will use its Orin chips and automotive operating system to power advanced driver assistance across several models. It did not give details about the models. Huang expects automotive hardware and software revenue of US$5 billion by February 2026, up from an expected US$4 billion this year. CES 2025, formerly known as the Consumer Electronics Show, runs January 7-10 in Las Vegas and is used to debut products ranging from new automotive technology to quirky gadgets, as well as showing new ways to use artificial intelligence. Nvidia's stock closed at a record high of US$149.43 on Monday, bringing its valuation to US$3.66 trillion and making it the world's second-most valuable listed company behind Apple.

Title: Nvidia's (NVDA) Conference Fails to Reverse Crypto AI Token Downswing
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/01/07/ai-tokens-fail-to-mirror-2024s-epic-surge-despite-bullish-nvidia-conference

Full Content:
Artificial intelligence (AI) crypto tokens are failing to live up to their lofty 2024 goals despite Nvidia's (NVDA) recent conference sparking bullish sentiment among AI stocks in the traditional markets. Last March, the NEAR token doubled in the lead-up to Nividia's annual conference, gains that were mirrored across the wider crypto AI market. Fetch.AI (FET), the graph (GRT) and singularityNET (AGIX) all posted significant rallies to the upside in unison with the conference. This year, however, AI tokens have shown their fragility. NEAR is down by more than 8% in the past 24 hours while FET slumped nearly 9%. NVDA in contrast began the year trading at $133 and rose by 15% to $153 on Monday as the conference began. There are several reasons why AI tokens are no longer getting the attention they once received. One of those is the emergence of AI agent tokens, which share similarities with memecoins due to their volatile nature and cult-like followings. Investors are more inclined to trade these tokens as they have the potential for triple, even quadruple-digit gains compared to regular AI tokens, which are harder to move due to their larger market caps. And just like memecoins, AI agent tokens have more potential for deeper losses as well. Another reason is simply a lack of interest; Google search trend show that searches for "NEAR token" and "Fetch.ai" are down by 47% and 84% respectively since March. The fall from grace is hardly surprising, the crypto market is very fickle and has a habit of punishing sectors that rise rapidly in a speculative nature. Last year's rally was exactly this: people invested in AI tokens as they believed it would be the primary narrative of the crypto bull market, but instead, it was bitcoin that stole the show with 10's of billions dollars of ETF inflows and bullish sentiment around Donald Trump's presidential victory. AI tokens are still in their infancy, however. Few crypto AI projects were used in the mainstream, as many of the products were still being built. Nvidia, meanwhile, announced a $3,000 mini supercomputer called Digits, which will be available to purchase in May. Oliver Knight is the co-leader of CoinDesk data tokens and data team. Before joining CoinDesk in 2022 Oliver spent three years as the chief reporter at Coin Rivet. He first started investing in bitcoin in 2013 and spent a period of his career working at a market making firm in the UK. He does not currently have any crypto holdings. ABOUT CONTACT POLICIES

From Goldman Sachs (GS) to Morgan Stanley (MS), many of the largest banks in the U.S. are quitting an international climate group amid rising political pressure as the nation enters a second Trump presidency.

First launched in April 2021, the United Nations’ Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) aims to make the financial sector more environmentally sustainable by converges banks, insurers and investors to set sustainability targets in line with the group’s standards. The NZBA has more than 140 bank members across 44 countries that manage $64 trillion in total assets. But in recent weeks, U.S. banks have been pulling out of the group en masse. Goldman Sachs was the first major Wall Street bank to pull out of the NZBA, announcing its departure on Dec. 6 without giving a reason. The move came just days after Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued BlackRock (BLK), Vanguard and State Street—three of the largest asset managers in the world—for conspiring to manipulate energy markets. Paxton accused these institutional investors for pressuring coal companies in which they own large stakes into reducing production and deceiving investors into pursuing ESG (environmental, social and governance) strategies. On its website, Goldman Sachs still keeps its commitment to achieve net-zero carbon emission by 2030 across its operations and supply chain. The bank said it’s still “very focused on the increasingly elevated sustainability standards and reporting requirements imposed by regulators around the world.” Wells Fargo (WFC) announced its departure from the group on Dec. 20. Again, the bank did not provide a reason but maintains a sustainability page on its website, which includes a goal to reduce energy usage from 2019 levels by half before 2030. Four days before Wells Fargo’s withdrawal, a number of climate advocacy groups co-published a letter to the NZBA addressing “slipping standards” within the group. “The alliance must not seek to appease or accommodate potential defectors or remain complacent when its members dilute their targets, as doing so undermines the very purpose of the coalition and jeopardizes global climate goals,” the letter said. For instance, Morgan Stanley loosened its target to align with the Paris Agreement’s maximum warming goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius to 1.7 degrees Celsius—“a lower ambition scenario requiring less emissions reductions by the bank,” the letter said. Citigroup (C) and Bank of America (BAC) both quit the NZBA on the last day of 2024. Citi said it’s working towards its own goals outside of the group while Bank of America said it will continue working with clients on environmental issues and meeting their needs. Like their peers, Citi’s net-zero goals and Bank of America’s environmental sustainability commitments remain published on their respective websites. Both banks seek to achieve net-zero carbon emission across its financing activities, operations and supply chain by 2050. Morgan Stanley quit the NZBA on Jan. 2. The bank also gave no reason for its defection but maintains its internal climate goals. The bank says it reached carbon neutrality in 2022, but is still working on reaching net-zero financed emissions, with interim goals set for 2030. Some ESG experts see the exodus as more of an attempt to align with political pressure than a retreat from climate commitments. “Financing sustainable initiatives is increasingly linked to long-term profitability and market demand,” Sunil Kansal, head of consulting and valuation services at the ESG consulting firm Shasat, told Observer. “What matters is not the framework but the outcome. Banks will continue to drive the green transition, adapting their strategies to evolving circumstances.” “These exits are not a rejection of climate action. They reflect a reaction to multiple factors,” Chris Pyke, chief innovation officer at the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB), told Observer. He alluded to factors like reporting burdens, challenging targets and—perhaps most relevant for U.S. banks—antitrust scrutiny from Republican lawmakers. As the nation heads into a second Trump presidency, efforts to firm up environmental reporting regulations are likely to fall flat given his anti-regulation stance.

Nvidia’s (NVDA-0.18%) shares tumbled Tuesday morning after rallying the previous day to close at an all-time high. The chipmaker’s shares were down by more than 4% during late morning trading — a reverse after climbing 2.5% at the market open and setting a new intraday all-time high of $153.13. The previous day, Nvidia’s shares climbed more than 3% to reach a record close of $149.43 per share — cents higher than its previous record close of $148.88 in early November. The chipmaker’s shares rallied Monday ahead of chief executive Jensen Huang’s keynote at the Consumer Electronics Show. Huang announced a suite of artificial intelligence tools for AI agents and updates to the chipmaker’s robotics efforts at the annual Las Vegas trade show Monday night. The chip leader also unveiled its next generation RTX Blackwell GPUs for gaming ranging between $549 and $1,999. To end the keynote, Huang announced Project DIGITS, a personal AI supercomputer that can run AI models with up to 200 billion parameters — more than OpenAI’s GPT-3. The device, which is aimed toward AI researchers and developers, will be available from Nvidia and its partners in May, and starts at $3,000. The chipmaker designed the AI supercomputer with Taiwanese semiconductor company MediaTek. The chip company’s Taiwan-listed shares were up by 4.5% at the market close. Ahead of Huang’s keynote, Bank of America (BAC+0.10%) reiterated its “buy” rating on Nvidia in a note, with research analyst Vivek Arya describing CES as “a positive catalyst” for the chipmaker. “[W]hile we don’t doubt NVDA’s capabilities, we are unsure as to when and how fast they can influence NVDA’s financials,” Arya said about the chipmaker’s robotics strategy. In a note on Tuesday, Bank of America maintained its buy rating on its top pick, and Arya said Huang’s keynote highlighted the chipmaker’s “continued dominance in genAI compute and ecosystem.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Earthquakes and Blowouts Undermine Case for Carbon Storage in Texas

Texas has seen surging interest from companies hoping to bury carbon dioxide in its oilfields, putting the state at the vanguard of a government-subsidized program to fight climate change. But pumping CO2 into the ground could exacerbate earthquakes and well blowouts already happening in the Permian Basin as Texas struggles to manage wastewater disposal, potentially undermining public support. “Without legitimate oversight of underground injection in Texas, we expect more geyser-like well blowouts, sinkholes, leaks from plugged and unplugged wells, and injection-induced earthquakes,” said Virginia Palacios, executive director of Commission Shift, a Texas watchdog group pushing for tougher oversight of the oil and gas industry. Such consequences have rarely happened as a result of CO2 injection over the decades the technology has been deployed. The unprecedented vast volume of carbon now proposed for burial, however, worries activists and researchers. Carbon sequestration is vital to U.S. government goals to reduce emissions that cause global warming. The Biden administration’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, landmark climate-change legislation, includes billions of dollars worth of subsidies for CCS projects. While President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to gut the IRA, energy experts say CCS subsidies will likely survive due to bipartisan support. Trump’s transition team did not provide comment. Several companies, including Occidental Petroleum OXY.N, plan to take advantage of IRA subsidies. The projects are concentrated in Texas, where CCS proponents argue underground geology is ideal for storing liquid and gaseous waste. PERMIT APPLICATIONS JUMP Over the last 12 months, the number of applications filed with the Environmental Protection Agency for carbon injection permits in Texas has jumped by 63% to 43, according to the agency, making it a national leader. But Texas is dogged by problems linked to disposal of drilling wastewater underground. The Texas Railroad Commission (RRC) regulator has grappled with leaks and blowouts from orphan wells, as well as earthquakes, triggered by higher pressure underground from water injection. Reuters spoke with a dozen Texas landowners and researchers who said proposed CO2 projects need more oversight than the state can offer to avert environmental and safety risks. The RRC is seeking authority from the EPA to oversee its own permitting program for carbon sequestration to speed up approvals. The EPA, which is also reviewing Texas’ handling of wastewater permitting following the blowouts, said the request was being considered. The RRC said in a statement it is capable of effectively regulating CO2 injection wells, adding it has hired more staff. Trump’s victory increases the chances Texas will get this authority, experts say. North Dakota was the first state to receive oversight authority during Trump’s first term and its governor, Doug Burgum, is Trump’s pick for interior secretary, which includes responsibility for drilling permits on federal land. Burgum did not respond to requests for comment. REASON FOR CONCERN One of the biggest Texas projects is the Stratos direct air capture joint venture in Ector County between Occidental and asset manager BlackRock. It is expected to inject 8.5 million metric tons of CO2 starting next year. The county has numerous abandoned wells at risk of erupting if underground pressure rises and CO2 eats away at cement plugs, said oil and gas attorney Sarah Stogner, who represents landowners that have had blowouts. There have been 19,700 wells drilled in the county since 1993, according to data from state agencies. Nineteen are orphan wells, with no company legally responsible for ensuring they remain plugged, including three close to the Stratos site. Raymond Straub, a hydrogeologist who owns a Texas groundwater services firm, testified at an October EPA hearing that he was concerned Occidental did not devote enough attention to the unplugged or badly plugged orphan wells in the project area. Occidental spokesperson William Fitzgerald said the company had done extensive site surveys to ensure it would be safe. “This survey confirmed the location of three wells, which Occidental will address prior to beginning CO2 injection,” he said. “There is more than 3,000 feet of confining rock layers above the sequestration zone to securely contain the CO2.” A pilot project by agribusiness ADM ADM.N in Illinois, the first of its kind meant to demonstrate the technical feasibility of commercial carbon injection, has suffered leaks and other setbacks, underscoring worries. ADM spokesperson Jackie Anderson said the leaks have presented no risk to surface or groundwater or to public health, and that the company is confident in CCS technology. Dominic DiGiulio, an independent energy analyst and former EPA official who has studied CCS, said, however, that CO2 can corrode the cement casings of plugged wells. “These abandoned wells will in fact leak,” he said. A 2023 paper by Chinese researchers, published in Earth-Science Reviews, said CO2 injection could also boost the risk of earthquakes. The researchers did not respond to requests for comment. Large leaks could acidify groundwater, and suffocate people and animals if it displaces oxygen above ground, according to nonprofit Pipeline Safety Trust. “This is supposed to be permanent storage,” said Carolyn Raffensperger, executive director of the Science and Environmental Health Network. “If it can’t even contain it for 10 years, why do we think it can contain it forever?” she added, referring to ADM’s project.

Title: Trumpy Tech Billionaires Pretty Psyched To #MakeAmericaUnemployedAgain
URL: https://www.wonkette.com/p/trumpy-tech-billionaires-pretty-psyched
Time Published: 2025-01-07T17:02:13Z

Throughout most of the last four years, we’ve had an incredibly tight job market, with the unemployment rate frequently dipping lower than at any time over the past five decades. This has made things very difficult for employers who prefer to pay their employees very little money. “No one wants to work anymore!” they cried, as so many of their potential employees went to work for companies willing to pay them a living wage. Now that we are embarking on yet another Trump presidency, some of his wealthiest, techiest supporters are excitedly sharing their ideas for loosening that jobs market up. Elon Musk has been very vocal about how he would like to expand the H-1B visa program because he believes that there are not enough Americans who are smart enough for him to hire. While much of the MAGA riot over this has revolved around the fact that (gently speaking) they do not care for Indian people and non-white immigrants in general and do not want them in our country, there are reasonable criticisms to be made about the way the H-1B visa program used to allow companies to replace fully qualified American workers with foreign workers who will accept less money and have less leverage in negotiations because they can’t just go and switch jobs very easily. As Bernie Sanders noted, “If these jobs are only going to ‘the best and brightest’ [as Musk said], why has Tesla employed H-1B guest workers as associate accountants for as little as $58,000, associate mechanical engineers for as little as $70,000 a year, and associate material planners for as little as $80,000 a year?” It does make one wonder! Musk’s nemesis, OpenAI/ChatGPT guy Sam Altman, is also very excited about replacing American workers — but he wants to replace them with AI. Loving this post? Not a free or paid subscriber yet? Let’s fix that! In a recent blog post on his personal site, Altman wrote: We are now confident we know how to build AGI [AI that is smarter than humans are] as we have traditionally understood it. We believe that, in 2025, we may see the first AI agents “join the workforce” and materially change the output of companies. We continue to believe that iteratively putting great tools in the hands of people leads to great, broadly-distributed outcomes. Now, people who know way more about this than I do will tell you that no one should listen to a damn thing Altman says, as he is full of shit. Fair! Also, no one needs to be a tech expert to notice that he’s been talking for a month about how ChatGPT is losing money on its $200 a month subscriptions, and how OpenAI just won’t survive unless they are allowed to use copyrighted materials without paying for them — and that he may be hoping that telling potential investors that exciting new anti-labor developments are afoot will lead to a cash infusion. But I have to say, I do think it is somewhat important that a guy who just donated a million dollars to Donald Trump’s inauguration is so very jazzed about replacing workers with AI programs. Will this upset MAGA as much as Musk’s H1B takes? It’s hard to be sure, and would likely depend on whether the robots can trace their lineage back to the Mayflower or not. Of course, the American Right has been very excited about AI and the potential it has to replace creatives like artists, photographers, actors, writers, musicians and what have you. They don’t really care about the job loss there, because people in the creative professions tend to be liberals, and they’re excited because they think AI will allow them to shape popular culture themselves without actually having to develop any talent or skill. They are also frequently quite jazzed about the idea of just being able to have the robots make them their own “personalized” movies and television shows so they won’t accidentally be exposed to ideas (and faces) they don’t like. Those who are most excited about AI tend to believe it will only take the jobs of people they dislike, or jobs that they don’t think should be jobs in the first place. Like the drummer I went on a Tinder date with who was thrilled that AI would allow him to make music and even write songs without having to deal with singers or guitarists. (It did not go well!!) But The Guardian reports, in its article about Altman’s claim, that many companies are hoping to build AI programs to replace workers of all kinds: OpenAI is reportedly planning to launch an AI agent codenamed “Operator” this month, after Microsoft announced its Copilot Studio product and rival Anthropic launched the Claude 3.5 Sonnet AI model, which can carry out tasks on the computer such as moving a mouse cursor and typing text. McKinsey, for instance, is building an agent to process new client inquiries by carrying out tasks such as scheduling follow-up meetings. The consulting firm has predicted that by 2030, activities accounting for up to 30% of hours worked across the US economy could be automated. Bloomberg reported that Operator will use a computer to take actions on a user’s behalf, such as writing code or booking travel. Of course, not all of these Trumpy tech guys want to get rid of workers and replace them with AI. Some are doing it the old fashioned way, by just eliminating their jobs entirely. The Washington Post, owned by Jeff Bezos, the second richest man in the world after Musk and fellow giver of $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund, is reportedly about to lay off “many dozens” of staffers this week. Bezos could easily pay every Post staff member’s salary out of his own pocket change, so it’s more likely that this is due to wanting to gut the paper and let it die in darkness, or gut the paper and replace all of the current staff with people who would never make a cartoon satirizing his new partnership with Trump. Mark Zuckerberg, too, has recently announced his plans to move content moderation to Texas, where he can get away with paying workers less than in California — likely requiring current workers to move or get laid off, as he has done previously. Donate Just Once! These last two likely seem like good news to the MAGA faithful, but it’s worth noting how very, very casual these fellas and companies are about purging workers. The likelihood that it will only affect the Left and not “Real Americans” like them is pretty much nil. Things just don’t usually work that way. After all, Bezos’s Amazon has already announced coming layoffs in 2025, as have Boeing and Spirit Airlines. But hey! These tech guys and the people who own other companies headed towards major layoffs this year are set to get some major tax cuts — so perhaps the wealth will just trickle down after all. And if not, at least there may be jobs with all those employers who couldn’t find cheap enough workers over the last four years. America first! Thank you for reading Wonkette. This post is public so feel free to share it with everyone you love (or hate). Share Hey these billionaire techbros are going to be fine. Not so much the rest of us. And anything with creativeness is considered "not a real job." And more people unemployed is a good thing for these jerks. And turns out many Americans agree as they voted to have Republicans drive the economy into the ditch. (N.B. it wasn't actually about the economy, just a desire to hurt minorities they don't like.) Are we just going to go along with calling computer programmed response “AI” without any pushback at all? I find it amusing that the people who bitch constantly about automated phone trees and “why can’t I ever talk to an actual person?” are enthusiastic about this bullshit. You thought customer service sucked before? 😂 Anyway…I’ll just be over here yelling about kids these days being on my lawn with droopy pants… No posts Ready for more?

Title: Jeremy Siegel: The 2025 Outlook for Stocks and the Economy

A business journal from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania The coming year could see tech stocks cooling off and very modest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, Wharton’s Jeremy Siegel predicts. Jeremy Siegel Shankar Parameshwaran The coming year could see a cooling-off of the stock market from the scorching growth of the past two years, especially for tech stocks, and very modest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, Wharton emeritus professor of finance Jeremy Siegel said in December on the Wharton Business Daily radio show on SiriusXM. (Listen to the podcast.) And while businesses are optimistic about deregulation in President-elect Donald Trump’s second term, top concerns in 2025 include how his policies on immigration and tariffs could play out, he added. Following are key takeaways from the interview: Siegel said he expected the stock market to be less upbeat in the coming year. “We’ve had two really fantastic stock market years. They exceeded my expectation this year with another 20% plus gain on top of what we had in 2023,” he said. “I expect it to be more muted [in 2025]. I see [growth in] equities being zero to 10%,” and a correction — a 10% drop — is certainly a possibility, he added. In particular, Siegel saw the possibility of “some cool off” with tech stocks. He noted that even as AI is trending strong, “there seems to be possibilities of more competition and some slowdown in that area” in 2025, he said. Disappointments on AI could be the top dampener for tech stocks, Siegel said. Specifically, the top worries would be around the speed at which AI adoption occurs, and potential competition for market leader Nvidia and its Blackwell chips, and pushback from China, he added. China recently launched a probe into Nvidia, suspecting violations of its anti-monopoly law. “All this is on top of the big uncertainties of President-elect Trump’s tariffs and immigration policy.” Siegel said his median forecast for the stock market is a bit of a slowdown from the pace of the past two years, and not really a bear market. The “standard error” in estimating stock market returns is 20%, which means that in any given year, it could be up 20%, or zero, up 10%, down 10%, or even more extreme than that,” he said. But at the same time, “it is so hard to predict on a one-year [basis],” he added. He noted that although “valuations … for the entire market [are] on the high side, I don’t think they’re crazy.” “Tech firms, [led by the so-called] Mag Seven, have brought home the bacon,” he said. “They produced earnings growth of 25% to 30%. But they’re one-third of the market. I could see them cooling in 2025, to maybe being flat on the whole.” The Magnificent Seven stocks are Nvidia, Alphabet, Tesla, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and Apple. If the Magnificent Seven give up some space, “that would give the other 493 stocks [in the S&P 500] a chance to shine, selling at a much more reasonable price earnings ratio of 18 to 20,” Siegel continued. The S&P 500 as a whole is priced at 22 times earnings, which is within the range of equilibrium of around 20, he pointed out. The Federal Reserve on December 18 lowered its funds rate by 25 basis points to a range of 4.25%-4.5%, noting positive signs on inflation and unemployment. (Note: This interview with Professor Siegel was conducted before the latest Fed meeting.) “Tech firms, [led by the] Mag Seven, have brought home the bacon…. I could see them cooling in 2025, to maybe being flat on the whole.” — Jeremy Siegel Anticipating that reduction at the Fed’s December meeting, Siegel said that he did not expect another rate cut in January. “My feeling is maybe only a 50 basis points cut next year.” That would put the Fed funds rate at between 3.5%-3.75%, which is “far higher” than the Fed’s own long-term estimate, and higher than its estimate at the September meeting, he added. According to Siegel, the “r star,” or natural rate of interest under 2% inflation is probably between 3.5% and 4%, after taking into account the stimulus to the economy, the deficits, and the uncertainties that loom. The Fed defined the r-star as the real short-term interest rate expected to prevail when an economy is at full strength and inflation is stable. Approaching normalization of the interest rate structure would make room for a “recalibration” of the long-term interest rates, which in non-recessionary times is between 100 and 150 basis points higher than short-term interest rates, Siegel noted. “So, if you can get the Fed funds rate down to 3.5%, we’ll see the 10-year at 4.5% to 5%, or potentially even a little higher.” The 10-year Treasury rate was trending around 4.5% in the third week of December. Small, independent and medium-sized businesses are optimistic about deregulation in Trump’s second term, Siegel said. He pointed to improved sentiment in the latest Small Business Optimism Index put out by the National Federation of Independent Businesses; this sentiment indicator showed its highest reading since June 2021. Recollections of deregulation during Trump’s first term played a role in that sentiment boost, Siegel noted. “People are saying, ‘Hey, you know what? Things were pretty good for those smaller businesses during Trump’s first term.’ And they’re hoping for a repeat in 2025 and 2026.” Trump’s threat to impose higher tariffs on imports from Canada, China, and Mexico is one of the biggest uncertainties for U.S. businesses. Trump will start using the threat of tariffs “as a negotiating tool,” Siegel said. “He loves to come in with a very strong position and negotiate down from there,” he said. At the same time, the president-elect has to be aware of the potential consequences of that approach on inflation and on businesses, he cautioned. He listed Trump’s positions on tariffs and immigration as the “two big uncertainties” for the economy. “It would be surprising to me if [Trump] pursued policies that were highly detrimental to the economy, because that would be reflected right away in the stock market.” — Jeremy Siegel That said, Trump is unlikely to act in ways that would purposely hurt stock market sentiment, Siegel suggested. “He is the most outspokenly pro-stock market President we have ever had,” and one who measures his success as a president on how well the stock market does, he added. “It would be surprising to me if he pursued policies that were highly detrimental to the economy, because that would be reflected right away in the stock market.” Geopolitical concerns weigh heavily on the outlook for 2025, ranging from the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, and around China on multiple fronts. Trump could help ease some of those pressures with his promises of entering into negotiations on Ukraine and the Gaza Strip immediately after taking office, Siegel said. “With what has happened in Syria, it might make the time right for a deal on both those fronts,” he added. “That would take out a lot of uncertainty. It’s far from a done deal, and things could spiral out of control. The markets, by continuing to be strong, are actually hoping for settlements in those two troubled areas.” On the ongoing threat potential of China acting against Taiwan, Trump might try to get together with Xi Jinping, “but that is also very, very uncertain,” Siegel said. “Fortunately, we don’t have a shooting war in Asia yet.” One of the top worries in 2025 will be around cybersecurity, especially from state-sponsored bad actors, Siegel said. “I wouldn’t like to wake up in the morning and try to get access to my bank accounts and brokerage accounts and find they’re all locked out.” That worry is “a nationwide phenomenon that could throw the world into chaos,” he added. According to Siegel, the government ought “to consider cybersecurity as important as our military preparedness and spend a lot of resources to make sure that’s there.” Securing the electricity grids is another priority, he said, noting that the emerging AI sector has high power requirements. “Those are two areas where we certainly need to spend resources if we are to realize the potential gains from artificial intelligence.” A business journal from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania ©2025 Knowledge at Wharton.

The Jeff Bezos-owned paper cuts about 4% of its workforce, with members of its advertising, marketing and information technology teams affected UPDATE: A Washington Post rep told TheWrap no members of its information technology team lost their jobs as part of the cuts, as The New York Times reported. The Washington Post is laying off roughly 100 employees — or about 4% of its workforce — the Jeff Bezos-owned outlet disclosed on Tuesday. The job cuts will affect the business side of the paper, not its newsroom, according to The Wall Street Journal. “Changes across our business functions are all in service of our greater goal to best position The Post for the future,” WaPo said in a statement shared with WSJ. WaPo’s cuts will affect members of its advertising, marketing and information technology teams, according to The New York Times. The paper was hit with 240 job cuts in October 2023. The Washington Post is eliminating just under 100 roles on the business side. Newsroom not impacted at this time. Post statement: “Changes across our business functions are all in service of our greater goal to best position The Post for the future.” The Post’s latest job cuts come after 2024 was a brutal year for the media industry in terms of layoffs. In 2024, nearly 15,000 jobs were eliminated across broadcast, television, film, news and streaming — extending a two-year run in which the news and entertainment businesses were dealt body blows. WaPo’s cuts also come a month after Bezos said the outlet made the “right decision” to not endorse a candidate during the 2024 U.S. election. The Amazon founder spearheaded the decision to not have WaPo’s editorial board endorse Kamala Harris over Donald Trump — marking the first time in 36 years the paper didn’t endorse a presidential candidate. If The Post were to endorse Harris, Bezos noted that the “plusses were small” and that it would add to a “perception of bias.” Their non-endorsement of Harris was skewered by many media reporters and readers, with former executive editor Marty Baron calling it “cowardice.”

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks reversed early gains as cautious investors weighed new economic data in the midst of Nvidia's (NVDA) big AI plans. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell around 0.7% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) lost roughly 1.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped about 0.1%. Early on Tuesday, the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing PMI indicated the manufacturing sector continued to expand last month, although the prices paid index jumped to a nearly two-year high of 64.4, up from the prior 58.2. The surge in prices "is a worry for the Fed as it is consistent with PCE supercore inflation remaining at 3.5% until the middle of next year," wrote Capital Economics North America economist Thomas Ryan. "This serves as a good reminder that the Fed's fight against inflation is not over, particularly going into a year where tariffs and immigration curbs are set to reignite price pressures." Additionally, JOLTS job openings rose more than expected during the month of November. Less hires were also made compared to the previous month while the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, fell to 1.9% from the 2.1% seen in October. The data sets the stage for Friday's all-important December jobs report. In recent days, Fed officials have signaled they would take a more gradual approach to cuts, given resilience in the jobs market and persistent inflation. Investors are now betting with almost certainty that the central bank keeps interest rates unchanged later this month, according to the CME FedWatch tool. In corporates, Nvidia shares reversed gains to fall around 5% after hitting a record high close. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's CES keynote on Monday revealed a new AI superchip among other planned products. Despite Nvidia's declines, other chip stocks extended their rally, with Micron Technology (MU) up about 4% and Asia names making gains. Meanwhile, the watch is on for more clarity around Donald Trump's tariff agenda. The president-elect on Monday denied a Washington Post report that his team is considering more targeted measures — which would be more promising for global growth. Job openings rose more than expected in November as investors continue to dissect the pace of the labor market slowdown amid questions over how much further the Federal Reserve will slash interest rates this year. New data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Tuesday showed that 8.1 million jobs were open at the end of November, an increase from the 7.84 million in October. The October figure was revised higher from the 7.74 million open jobs initially reported. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected Tuesday's report to show 7.74 million openings in November The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) also showed 5.27 million hires were made during the month, down from the 5.39 million made during October. The hiring rate fell to 3.3% from 3.4% in October. Also in Tuesday's report, the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, fell to 1.9% from 2.1% in October. Total quits decreased to 3.07 million from 3.28 million in October. US stocks edged higher on Tuesday, with Nvidia (NVDA) once again lifting market sentiment. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) inched up 0.3%, holding near tech-fueled prior-session gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also rose 0.3%, while those on the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added around 0.2%. Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose as much as 2.5% in premarket trading following CEO Jensen Huang’s keynote at the tech industry’s annual CES trade show in Las Vegas late Monday. Huang's presentation gave a flurry of updates on upcoming Nvidia products that preview what’s next in the burgeoning artificial intelligence market and other emerging technologies. Nvidia shares closed at a record high of $149.43 Monday ahead of Huang’s keynote — eclipsing its prior record close of $148.88 reached back on Nov. 7. Read more here.

With a fixed supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin is immune to inflation in a way that traditional currencies simply can’t match. The financial landscape is evolving, and Bitcoin is at the forefront of this transformation. What started as a niche experiment is now being embraced by major institutions like BlackRock, the U.S. Federal Reserve, and even nations like El Salvador as their required currency. For business owners, the question is no longer if Bitcoin will play a role in the future of finance but how it will benefit their businesses today. Why Bitcoin Matters for Business Owners Bitcoin’s unique appeal lies in its scarcity. With a fixed supply of 21 million coins, it’s immune to inflation in a way that traditional currencies simply can’t match. The US dollar has declined 98% in purchasing power since 1913 and will continue to decline long term. This makes Bitcoin a customer payment option and a strategic asset for businesses looking to meet customers where they’re at and store value. Forward-thinking business owners are already exploring how Bitcoin can: Adopting Bitcoin doesn’t have to be risky or complex. I’ve designed a five-week implementation project specifically for business owners. It starts small—just $100—and focuses on three actionable steps: The goal is simple: to make Bitcoin accessible and practical for businesses of all sizes. To explore this strategy further, watch my video, in which I explain the benefits of Bitcoin and outline the steps to get started. Watch the video here. Navigating the Bitcoin landscape is easier with the proper support. That’s why I’ve created a WhatsApp group exclusively for business owners interested in integrating Bitcoin into their operations. It’s a space to share insights, ask questions, and get practical advice on making Bitcoin work for your business. Join the WhatsApp group here.

Title: The Market Survived The Holidays. Now What?

By Greg Guenthner Posted January 7, 2025 We waited (and waited) for stocks to find a bottom and recover during the December slide. Then, we crossed our fingers for a low-volume melt up in that magical window between Christmas and New Year’s Day. But nothing happened. Santa was a no-show over our little holiday break. We were instead hit with wave after wave of selling as speculators ditched their broken trades and pouted about the lumps of coal filling the pages of their brokerage accounts. Perhaps I suffer from a fair amount of stock market PTSD, because the failed December rally prompted flashbacks of late 2021. If you have a short memory, this was exactly when the market started to show serious signs of cracking lower, which it promptly did as the final stalwart stocks broke through support in January 2022, dragging investors into a grinding bear market that lasted almost the entire calendar year. Fortunately for the bulls, the market stabilized when the calendar flipped to January. So it’s a bit premature to begin leaning on any bearish calls. Not yet, anyway. Today, we’ll dig into what’s ailing this market. I’ll explain what I think is going on since the melt-up stalled in early December, where stocks might be headed in 2025, and the tickers you need to watch to keep up with the snapback moves that are brewing this week. First up: let’s talk about the Santa Rally phenomenon. Technically, the Santa Claus Rally is a period of unusual market strength falling on the final five trading days of the year, and finishing up on the second trading day of the new year. No, stock’s don’t have to go up during this low-volume period. But they tend to do just that as investors and traders “get ahead” of the best plays of the next calendar year. Here’s the thing… When it comes to these little seasonal quirks, we tend to gain more information when they fail to materialize. Everyone was watching and waiting for choice holiday trading conditions. When the big man didn’t show (and stocks continued to drop), speculators started to get worried. Is the market completely broken after Santa failed to show? Not quite! Here’s my best guess to explain what’s going on: First, Trump’s victory emboldened the bulls and pulled much of what would have been the December melt-up gains ahead by about a month. November featured a massive crypto breakout and a stock market run that featured some bubbly groups extending higher. I think it’s fair to say that the market became way too frothy by the time December rolled around. That’s when market breadth began to deteriorate. Fewer and fewer stocks were moving higher, and we once again found ourselves in a market propped up by the mega-caps as crypto pulled back, many of the snapback tech-growth names cooled, and investors started to get more defensive. Yes, there’s still plenty of froth out there. But the market’s sluggish holiday performance caused some ugly numbers to creep into the picture. For starters, the percentage of stocks outperforming the S&P hit an all-time low over the holiday break, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. This adds even more fuel to the arguments about a few big stocks propping up the rest of the market… Next, we witnessed a handful of failed breakouts – small-caps, biotechs, and many of the popular growth stocks are the most prominent names that ripped above resistance, only to get yanked right back down once the market softened. Then there are some not-so-bullish seasonality patterns emerging. Now that it’s January, we’re entering a bit of a soft spot for the market. One of the worst quarters during the four-year Presidential Cycle starts now, Carson Research’s Ryan Detrick reminds us. In year one of the presidential cycle, Q1 is the weakest. The Stock Trader’s Almanac also says that a failed Santa rally can precede bear markets, or at the very least time where stocks can be found at lower prices later in the year. While I don’t think the sky is falling, I do believe we should do our best to keep our heads on straight as we dive deeper into the first quarter. Trading conditions could get more difficult by February. Perhaps we see new highs in the averages, followed by some chop and then the beginning of that elusive 10% pullback that the market has managed to avoid (the last one ended in Oct. 2023). Are conditions about to get a lot more difficult over the next three months? This question continues to run through my mind as stocks continue to recover this week. For now, we’ll see if some of these fresh 2025 bounces stick. If the market continues to recover from here, we might enjoy a little pre-earnings season rally for a couple of weeks. While I’m staying tactically long here, I’m still on alert for any evidence that supports a weakening market. If I do start to see these cracks widen, it will be time to look for some downside plays. Here’s what you should be watching this week to help cut through the noise: Semiconductors: The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) is beginning to break out of a six-month consolidation this week. It’s hard to be bearish if the chip stocks are back on top, and NVIDIA Inc. (NVDA) is back to teasing all-time highs following Monday’s 3.4% rally. Tech-growth: Many of the tech snapback trades fell flat over the holidays. But our tech-hype proxy ARK Innovation (ARKK) is working to get back on track after just barely kissing its 50-day moving average. If these “growthier” tech names can make another run, the market’s likely repairing our late December breadth worries… Crypto: The air came out of Bitcoin just before the holidays as the flagship crypto fell from a high of $108K all the way down into the low 90K range, revisiting support from late November. But crypto started perking up again late last week, and Bitcoin was able to sneak back above the magical $100K level to kick off the trading week. Bitcoin (and the rest of the crypto space) did exactly what the bulls needed. It established a floor without eating too much into its early November rally. It’s safe to assume that with crypto moving higher to kick off 2025, there’s still plenty of speculative firepower left out there. Bottom line: If these charts continue to look healthy, there’s no need to get too bearish over shorter time frames. But if we do see market conditions deteriorate, we’ll discuss ways to prepare (and profit!) in the days and weeks ahead.

Title: IDT Corporation (IDT): A Bull Case Theory

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on IDT Corporation (NYSE:IDT) on Substack by LittleBarnSparrow. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on IDT. IDT Corporation (NYSE:IDT)'s share was trading at $46.87 as of Jan 6th. IDT’s trailing P/E was 16.05 according to Yahoo Finance. A technician inserting a credit card into a point-of-sale machine for identity authentication. IDT Corporation, a diversified holding company, has emerged as a compelling investment opportunity, balancing legacy businesses with high-growth segments. Its portfolio includes three stagnating or declining legacy businesses and three rapidly expanding ventures with significant addressable markets. Recent results underscore IDT's strong operational performance, robust balance sheet, and strategic investments aimed at amplifying profitability through operating leverage. This positions IDT as a well-rounded company with promising near- and long-term growth prospects. The standout performer, National Retail Solutions (NRS), specializes in providing Point-of-Sale (PoS) systems and associated recurring services to small retailers. In the latest quarter, NRS reported a 26.5% revenue increase, with recurring revenues up 29%, driven by improved ARPU and expanding profitability margins. Despite cyclicality in advertising revenue, the company has strategically diversified its revenue streams, now relying more on payment processing and software solutions, which offer higher-quality, non-cyclical growth. NRS is actively broadening its total addressable market by targeting verticals like small restaurants, hotels, and gas stations. With adjusted EBITDA margins now at 25% and a trajectory toward $135 million in revenues by 2025, NRS is on track to deliver approximately $35 million in EBITDA, making it a cornerstone of IDT’s growth story. The Fintech segment, led by BOSS Money, IDT's money remittance business, has shown exceptional performance, with revenues surging 45% year-over-year. Management is prioritizing margin improvement, with adjusted EBITDA jumping to $4 million this quarter. Investments in working capital, particularly for disbursement funding, highlight a strategic commitment to sustaining strong growth in this high-potential area, supported by IDT's cash-rich position—a distinct competitive edge in a working capital-intensive industry. Net2Phone, IDT's cloud communications segment, reported 13% revenue growth despite currency headwinds, with ARPU improvements in premium services like Communication Center as a Service. While its performance is less dynamic than NRS or BOSS Money, it remains a steady contributor with strong growth prospects. Legacy businesses, which still account for a significant portion of revenue, provide a stable financial foundation, even as they lose share to the rapidly growing segments. With management's focus on building NRS into a multi-billion-dollar enterprise and leveraging the momentum of BOSS Money, IDT appears poised for substantial value creation. Despite the CEO's understated communication style, the company’s consistent results and strategic direction inspire confidence. At its current valuation, IDT offers a compelling investment case with significant upside potential fueled by its high-growth segments and operational excellence. IDT Corporation (NYSE:IDT) is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 14 hedge fund portfolios held IDT at the end of the third quarter which was 15 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of IDT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than IDT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

When you buy through links on kottke.org, I may earn an affiliate commission. Thanks for supporting the site! kottke.org. home of fine hypertext products since 1998. 🍔 💀 📸 😭 🕳️ 🤠 🎬 🥔 From The Verge: Meta abandons fact-checking on Facebook and Instagram in favor of Community Notes. Facebook, Instagram, and Threads are ditching third-party fact-checkers in favor of a Community Notes program inspired by X, according to an announcement penned by Meta’s new Trump-friendly policy chief Joel Kaplan. Meta is also moving its trust and safety teams from California to Texas. Here is Mark Zuckerberg’s thread about the announcement: It’s time to get back to our roots around free expression and giving people voice on our platforms. Here’s what we’re going to do: 1/ Replace fact-checkers with Community Notes, starting in the US. 2/ Simplify our content policies and remove restrictions on topics like immigration and gender that are out of touch with mainstream discourse. 3/ Change how we enforce our policies to remove the vast majority of censorship mistakes by focusing our filters on tackling illegal and high-severity violations and requiring higher confidence for our filters to take action. 4/ Bring back civic content. We’re getting feedback that people want to see this content again, so we’ll phase it back into Facebook, Instagram and Threads while working to keep the communities friendly and positive. 5/ Move our trust and safety and content moderation teams out of California, and our US content review to Texas. This will help remove the concern that biased employees are overly censoring content. 6/ Work with President Trump to push back against foreign governments going after American companies to censor more. The US has the strongest constitutional protections for free expression in the world and the best way to defend against the trend of government overreach on censorship is with the support of the US government. It’ll take time to get this all right and these are complex systems so they’ll never be perfect. But this is an important step forward and I’m looking forward to this next chapter! I wildly underestimated how quickly the big media and social media companies were going to kowtow to the incoming president. From The NY Times: Meta’s move is likely to please the administration of President-elect Donald J. Trump and its conservative allies, many of whom have disliked Meta’s practice of adding disclaimers or warnings to questionable or false posts. Mr. Trump has long railed against Mr. Zuckerberg, claiming the fact-checking feature treated posts by conservative users unfairly. Since Mr. Trump won a second term in November, Meta has moved swiftly to try to repair the strained relationships he and his company have with conservatives. Mr. Zuckerberg noted that “recent elections” felt like a “cultural tipping point towards once again prioritizing speech.” In late November, Mr. Zuckerberg dined with Mr. Trump at Mar-a-Lago, where he also met with his secretary of state pick, Marco Rubio. Meta donated $1 million to support Mr. Trump’s inauguration in December. Last week, Mr. Zuckerberg elevated Mr. Kaplan, a longtime conservative and the highest-ranking Meta executive closest to the Republican Party, to the company’s most senior policy role. And on Monday, Mr. Zuckerberg announced that Dana White, the head of the Ultimate Fighting Championship and a close ally of Mr. Trump’s, would join Meta’s board. BTW, Dana White, a violent man who assaulted his wife, got a warm welcome to Meta’s board from Instagram/Threads chief Adam Mosseri: “Excited to have you on board!” Everyone is falling in line. And all those $1 million donations to Trump’s inaugural fund from tech & media companies and CEOs are nothing but racket protection payments. I don’t think this actually has a whole lot to do with Zuckerberg’s or Meta’s commitment to free speech. What Zuckerberg and Meta have realized is the value, demonstrated by Trump, Musk, and MAGA antagonists, of saying that you’re “protecting free speech” and using it as cover for almost anything you want to do. For Meta, that means increasing engagement, decreasing government oversight and interference, and lowering their labor costs (through cutting their workforce and strengthening their bargaining position vs labor) — all things that will make their stock price go up and increase the wealth of their shareholders. Decreasing moderation and allowing more political & hate speech (I don’t now how else to read “remove the vast majority of censorship mistakes by focusing our filters on tackling illegal and high-severity violations” — hate speech is protected speech in the US) will increase engagement overall, any AI bots they want to unleash to spur engagement don’t have to be moderated, TX is more labor- and corporate-friendly than CA (I’m sure this is also part of Meta’ ongoing negotiation with CA about letting them have more leeway or they’ll leave the state), and I think the benefit of rethinking their rules to be more friendly to conservatives is self-explanatory. Sort by: thread — thread . latest . faves now that authoritarian bullies are in charge, Zuck can get rid of the pretense he cares about race-baiting right wing propaganda and hate speech online, and fully pursue mindless engagement chasing under the pretense he's just super interested in free speech and fighting "censorship" The key thing to understand about Meta without guard rails is that, when they allowed their platform to exist without any content controls in Myanmar under an extremist leader, it was used to directly enable a genocide. Zuckerberg knows that its level of threat. https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/asia-and-the-pacific/south-east-asia-and-the-pacific/myanmar/report-myanmar/ Facebook suppressed promotion of political content during a Democratic administration and is restoring it for a Republican one https://bsky.app/profile/brianstelter.bsky.social/post/3lf5muzv3wk2g Let’s be clear—the fact checkers have not “been” politically biased as Zuck suggests, but have been *perceived as such* because of politically motivated efforts to smear them, one that Zuck is now participating in and capitulating to. 1/ https://bsky.app/profile/brianstelter.bsky.social/post/3lf5mthm5m22g This is one of those unstated subtexts that everyone acts on without acknowledging it explicitly, that "free speech" simply applies to being able to conservatives being able to say nasty things about people without those people being able to respond https://bsky.app/profile/owillis.bsky.social/post/3lf5o4bz3g22p Fact-checking wasn’t “biased” against conservatives. Conservatives just shared more false content. If there’s a sportsball game and one team fouls four times as much, it’s not “biased” for the ref to call four times as many fouls against that team. https://bsky.app/profile/dgrand.bsky.social/post/3lf5tbabslk2x NEW: On the same day Mark Zuckerberg announces Meta's new commitment to "Free Expression," internal employee dissent and criticism is being censored https://www.404media.co/facebook-deletes-internal-employee-criticism-of-new-board-member-dana-white/ Reporter: Meta announced they will stop doing fact checks.. Trump: I think they’ve come a long way Reporter: Do you think he’s responding to the threats you’ve made in the past Trump: Probably Meta is facing an antitrust trial in April. The company has lots of other business before the U.S. government. And Trump once threatened to send Zuckerberg to jail. That's just some of the background for today's big Meta changes. There's more in this AM's Reliable Sources newsletter: https://cnn.it/3C7tFDp NEW: Meta changed its Community Guidelines today to permit "allegations of mental illness or abnormality when based on gender or sexual orientation, given political and religious discourse about transgenderism and homosexuality" @knibbs.bsky.social https://www.wired.com/story/meta-immigration-gender-policies-change/ I talked to 10 current and former Meta employees about the company's surrender to the right on speech issues. All were upset. One person called the changes "a precursor to genocide" https://www.platformer.news/meta-fact-checking-free-speech-surrender/ https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:jg7zvku4khzmvyjwbzv4lnly/bafkreigm3en2wq6ei3roervmdz7hkpyqo7k2o23hx5pqw5uqb7r5r66klm@jpeg Meta has repeatedly deleted our articles, including ones about Instagram's censorship and disproportionate moderation against trans people. It put a "fact check" warning on an article we did about hurricane helene AI spam proliferating on the platform https://www.404media.co/facebook-is-censoring-404-media-stories-about-facebooks-censorship/ Hello!

Title: Nvidia Stock May Rise As Its Stealth AI Cloud Rivals Big Customers’

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang holds a Grace Blackwell NVLink72 as he delivers a keynote address at the ... [+] Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada on January 6, 2025. Gadgets, robots and vehicles imbued with artificial intelligence will once again vie for attention at the Consumer Electronics Show, as vendors behind the scenes will seek ways to deal with tariffs threatened by US President-elect Donald Trump. The annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES) opens formally in Las Vegas on January 7, 2025, but preceding days are packed with product announcements. (Photo by Patrick T. Fallon / AFP) (Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images) Updated, Jan. 7, 2025: This post has been adjusted to include numbers from Nvidia's full day of trading. On January 6, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s keynote speech at the 2025 Consumer Electronics Show made a series of what looked to me like relatively small announcements — including products for industries such as robotics, cars, and gaming, according to the Wall Street Journal. Are these mini-announcements a diversion? One analyst thinks the biggest news could be Nvidia’s strategy to compete with cloud services customers — Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet — by building its own AI cloud, noted Investor’s Business Daily. Nvidia — whose shares rose almost 4% in pre-market trading and closed down 9.3% by the end of January 7 — is excited about the opportunity to provide software for robotics developers. "The ChatGPT moment for robotics is coming,” Huang told CES attendees, according to IBD. "Like large language models, world foundation models are fundamental to advancing robot and AV development, yet not all developers have the expertise and resources to train their own. We created Cosmos to democratize physical AI and put general robotics in reach of every developer," he added. An Nvidia spokesperson I contacted declined to comment. If there is one thing I learned in writing my latest book, Brain Rush, it is this: Nvidia’s future depends heavily on collaboration with companies closer to technology end-users. That’s because Nvidia — which designs chips and builds software for developers — can only enjoy rapid growth by motivating companies closer to end-users — such as chip fabricators, cloud services providers, enterprise software companies, and management consultants — to make Nvidia’s products part of a system that businesses and consumers find valuable. Nvidia’s CES product announcements are aimed at strengthening such partnerships. Here are the industries these announcements aim to enhance: While Nvidia did not make an announcement about this at CES, the biggest news from the company could be a strategy to compete with its cloud services customers who account for most of Nvidia’s growth. Indeed one analyst detected Nvidia’s growing appetite for leased data center capacity equipped for AI processing. Such AI data centers would “rent out servers powered by its own chips as well as host its AI software development platform,” noted Investor’s Business Daily. The analyst sees Nvidia’s push into cloud computing as a New Year’s surprise. “We see the potential for Nvidia to accelerate its data center leasing in 2025 as it looks to procure more capacity that can be used for its 'AI cloud,' with the potential for Nvidia to outpace its hyperscale peers in data center leasing in 2025,” noted TD Cowen analyst Michael Elias in a report featured by IBD. In addition to looking for more data center capacity in other deals, Elias noted an “apparent large leasing deal between Nvidia and Digital Realty for data center capacity in Northern Virginia,” IBD reported. Nvidia’s AI Cloud would compete with so-called Neoclouds — AI processing cloud services from the likes of CoreWeave, Lambda, Crusoe, Vultr and Together AI, noted IBD — as well as Nvidia’s biggest AI chip customers Amazon and Microsoft, wrote Elias. By building its own neocloud, Nvidia could take more profit from a fast-growing industry sector. Nvidia — which now distributes its AI software by leasing it through AWS — could boost its profits by operating its own cloud. AI neoclouds are expected to grow at a 100% compound annual rate from $4 billion last year to $32 billion by 2027, according to Pitchbook. Meanwhile, Nvidia’s cloud customers are trying to buy more AI chips from rivals and build their own custom chips. For example, in addition to buying Blackwell chips from Nvidia, hyperscalers are buying AI processors from Broadcom and Marvell Technologies as well as designing their own custom AI accelerators and trying to sell them to OpenAI, Apple and Meta Platforms, IBD reported. Nvidia stock may be heading up. Based on 40 Wall Street analysts offering 12-month price targets, Nvidia stock would need to rise 18.5% to reach the average forecast of $135 per share, noted TipRanks. Here are comments from less- and more-bullish analysts: To me the key questions for investors are: How much revenue could Nvidia's AI cloud generate? Will Nvidia’s hyperscaler clients buy less from Nvidia? My guess is Huang expects Nvidia’s AI cloud service will make the company better off. One Community. Many Voices.

Wall Street was looking at a muted open Tuesday after the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closed higher for a second straight session. Tech stocks, particularly chip names, drove the buying. Nvidia rose nearly 3.5% on Monday to a record close. The Club stock added another 2% early Tuesday, the morning after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's big keynote address at the annual CES conference in Las Vegas. 2. It's hard to grasp all the new AI use cases that Jensen laid out at CES on Monday night. He touted artificial intelligent agents that can complete tasks and advancements in "physical AI" with robotics, including launching a new real-world foundation model called Cosmos. He also unveiled a new video game chip that uses AI to render graphics, which might be the spark the AI PC movement needs to catch on. 3. Jensen also talked up Nvidia's bright future in self-driving cars, which includes a technology partnership with Toyota on its next-generation vehicles. Shares of Toyota, the world's biggest automaker by sales, rose 2% on the news. Autonomous semitruck player Aurora Innovation shares soared more than 35% on its Nvidia collab.

We recently published a list of the 12 Best Canadian Penny Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Galiano Gold Inc. (NYSEAMERICAN:GAU) stands against other best Canadian penny stocks to buy according to analysts. According to a report by the Government of Canada, released on December 16, the country’s economic outlook has been revised upward, as private-sector economists forecast moderate growth of around 2% in the second half of 2025. The report highlights the average of private sector forecasts are used as the basis for economic and fiscal planning in Canada to ensure objectivity and transparency. The Department of Finance surveyed a group of 11 private sector economists in September 2024, who expect the Canadian economy to benefit from robust growth in the US, driven by rising equity markets and increasing confidence among US households and businesses. The economists forecast that the unemployment rate will also stabilize to 6.6% by the end of 2025 compared to 6.9% in the fourth quarter of 2024. The report also states that the government is reducing the federal debt-to-GDP ratio over the medium term. The federal debt-to-GDP ratio in 2023-24 was 42.1% and is forecasted to decline to 41.9% in 2024-25.

In an interview with BNN Bloomberg on January 3, Gavin Graham, Chief Investment Officer and Portfolio Manager at Spire Wealth Management, discussed the investment landscape for 2025, particularly focusing on Canadian stocks. Graham acknowledged that Canada has been a market leader in cutting interest rates which provides them a much better position than their U.S. counterparts, specifically in sectors such as pipelines, utilities, REITs, telecom, and financials, which are interest-rate sensitive industries. In the energy sector, Graham expressed a preference for natural gas companies which have performed well due to low cost structure and the potential for increased demand due to the anticipation of colder weather in the US. Despite the local weather-related volatility in North America, he sees a positive outlook for the sector due to the impact of geopolitical events, such as Ukraine ending its gas imports from Russia, which could further influence natural gas prices. Graham also recommended that investors allocate 5 to 10% of their portfolios to gold, citing the robust performance of gold miners. He noted that while gold itself was up 27% last year, gold miners have underperformed relative to the metal and suggests that major gold miners have the potential to outperform. Gold mining stocks, being a leveraged play on the price of gold, could see significant gains if the gold price continues to rise and can offer attractive dividend yields and a hedge against economic uncertainty. Canada’s economic outlook for 2025 appears optimistic, with moderate growth expectations, a stabilizing unemployment rate, and a declining interest rate along with the favourable federal debt-to-GDP ratio. Investors seeking diversification and high-growth potential should look at opportunities in undervalued sectors within the Canadian market. An aerial view of Asanko Gold Mine in Ghana, West Africa.

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. By all accounts, NVIDIA's CEO Jensen Huang managed to deliver on elevated expectations during his CES keynote address, one that Wedbush's Dan Ives describes as imbued with more of "a rock concert vibe than a tech CEO speech." However, the address did not satiate the ravenous appetites of all listeners, as per the latest commentary from the investment banking firm Benchmark. $NVDA Buy Following CES - Benchmark While Jensen Huang, as expected delivered a broad master-class on the current state and direction of the AI industry, and made several technically interesting announcements that together further extend the company’s hardware and software… — Kaushik (@BigBullCap) January 7, 2025 To wit, while conceding that NVIDIA's Jensen Huang "delivered a broad master-class on the current state and direction of the AI industry, and made several technically interesting announcements," Benchmark believes that "many investors were hoping for more concrete progress updates on the ramp of Blackwell and some input as to the company’s progress with its next generation GPU platform, Rubin." Benchmark did take pains to highlight Huang's declaration that NVIDIA's latest Blackwell platform was in full production phase now, but asserted that most of the content of the keynote address was "already well understood by the market and again there was zero mention of Rubin, although to be fair, this next-generation design is not expected until 2026." For the benefit of those who might not be aware, Huang touched on the following points in his CES keynote address on Monday (the list also includes several material developments that occurred in the immediate aftermath of the address): Coming back, Benchmark does feel that, on the whole, Huang's keynote address provided "a strong kick-off to this year’s CES." The firm, therefore, reiterated its 'Buy' rating for NVIDIA shares, replete with a $190 stock price target, which implies a 25 percent upside potential relative to the current price level.

Title: Taiwan Semiconductor Ramps Up Production in Japan, US, and Germany to Diversify Away from China

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM) is all set for full-capacity production in the U.S. and Germany after commercializing its debut Japanese chip plant in Kikuyo, Kumamoto Prefecture, last December. Nvidia Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) $3 trillion valuation and Taiwan Semiconductor’s 2nm progress testify to AI-driven chip industry growth. Reportedly, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) eyes $80 billion in developing AI data centers in fiscal 2025, marking a big win for the sector. Also Read: Taiwan Semiconductor’s Kaohsiung Expansion To Boost 2-nm Chip Production The contract chipmaker aims to complete production of plants in Arizona in 2025 and Dresden in 2027. Construction of Taiwan Semiconductor’s second Japanese factory will likely begin near the Kikuyo plant, the Japan News reports. Taiwan commanded 67% of the global market share in contracted semiconductor manufacturing and nearly 80% in cutting-edge products in 2023, the Japan News cites TrendForce. Taiwan attempted to shield itself from geopolitical tension by concentrating production on the island. Still, it also remains focused on its geographical diversification to help the world boost its semiconductor base by reducing its dependence on China, whose semiconductor supply chain was disrupted during the 2020 pandemic. Kumamoto Gov. Takashi Kimura shared with Japan Times the country’s hopes to attract Taiwan Semiconductor’s third plant in the prefecture. The new plant, located in Kikuyo, began commercializing 12-28 nm technology last December. It caters to Sony Group Corp (NYSE:SONY), which produces camera sensors for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Taiwan Semiconductor is proficient in making general-purpose chips between 12 and 28 nm. However, chip plants in Japan failed to produce semiconductors thinner than 40 nm, prompting them to tap the Taiwanese chipmaker. Taiwan Semiconductor is building a new plant in Arizona, where commercialization of 4-nm chips will likely begin between January and March. It aims to complete its debut European plant in Dresden in 2027. The plant targets a quadrupolar production plan with principal plants in Taiwan, Japan, the U.S., and Germany. Meanwhile, some concerns loom in the form of President-elect Donald Trump taking charge on January 20. The U.S. posted a significant trade deficit with Taiwan in 2023, prompting Trump to verbally attack the country during his presidential campaigns for allegedly depriving the U.S. of the semiconductor industry. He suggested redemption by slapping tariffs on Taiwan, which can increase the contract chipmaker’s production costs since labor costs in the U.S. are about 30% higher than in Taiwan. Taiwan Semiconductor stock surged over 115% in the last 12 months. Goldman Sachs‘ Bruce Lu projected another year of robust revenue growth for Taiwan Semiconductor in 2025E, 26.8%, following 29.4% revenue growth in 2024E (all in USD terms). Demand in leading-edge nodes, mainly supported by AI, backed this growth. Investors can gain exposure to companies that manufacture semiconductors through ProShares UltraShort Semiconductors (NYSE:SSG) and ProShares UltraShort Semiconductors (NYSE:XSD).

(NASDAQ:UROY) stands against other best Canadian penny stocks to buy according to analysts.

The report highlights the average of private sector forecasts are used as the basis for economic and fiscal planning in Canada to ensure objectivity and transparency. The Department of Finance surveyed a group of 11 private sector economists in September 2024, who expect the Canadian economy to benefit from robust growth in the US, driven by rising equity markets and increasing confidence among US households and businesses. The economists forecast that the unemployment rate will also stabilize to 6.6% by the end of 2025 compared to 6.9% in the fourth quarter of 2024. The report also states that the government is reducing the federal debt-to-GDP ratio over the medium term.

(NASDAQ:UROY) is a Canadian-based company that specializes in acquiring and holding royalties on uranium properties, as well as investing in physical uranium. The company is known as the only pure-play uranium royalty company. Uranium Royalty Corp. (NASDAQ:UROY) has a vast portfolio of royalties on projects in various stages of development, and while these assets may not generate revenue in the short term, they have significant potential for long-term growth. By investing in these projects and working with the operators to bring them into production, Uranium Royalty Corp. (NASDAQ:UROY) aims to create a pipeline of future revenue streams and increase its exposure to the growing demand for uranium. Uranium Royalty Corp. (NASDAQ:UROY) also has a significant interest in producing mines, such as the Cigar Lake Mine, where the company owns a sliding-scale net profit interest royalty. Uranium Royalty Corp. (NASDAQ: UROY) recently acquired an existing royalty on the Millennium and Cree Extension Uranium Projects in Saskatchewan, Canada, from a third-party industrial gas company for $6 million. The acquired royalty is a 10% net profit interest (NPI) on an approximate 20.6955% participating interest in the projects, which are operated by Cameco Corporation Inc. The Millennium Project is an advanced-stage, conventional uranium project with estimated resources of 75.9 million pounds U3O8 in the indicated category and 29.0 million pounds U3O8 in the inferred category, making it one of the largest undeveloped uranium projects globally.

Title: Happy New Year, Bitcoin!

Bitcoin 2025 2024 was a big year for Bitcoin. It was the year of the spot Bitcoin ETF approvals, the beginnings of corporate adoption of Bitcoin, and the first crossing of the hundred-thousand-dollar milestone. Of these, the ETF did the most to bring mass adoption to Bitcoin. Now, any retirement account can have Bitcoin exposure at the click of a button. Though it does not provide true bitcoin ownership in the form of self-custody of private keys, it does act as a gateway drug to get normies interested in Bitcoin. Perhaps the most important person of the year for Bitcoin was Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock. Fink has a low-profile presence in the financial press, but enough clout that his endorsement was enough to give comfort to vast pools of capital to invest in Bitcoin. BlackRock’s stamp of approval was a big win for Bitcoin, and the ETF inflows are likely what led to crossing the $100k threshold. Speaking of which, my favorite Bitcoin video of the year was God Save The Coin by Michael Goldstein of the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute. It runs through all the different criticisms Bitcoin faced since its inception. At the end of the day, Bitcoin doesn't care and marches on. The narratives and criticism around Bitcoin will constantly shift and evolve, yet there is nothing like the market test to prove its value. Looking ahead, 2025 will be the year of corporate adoption of Bitcoin. This is already happening, with MicroStrategy leading the pack and open-sourcing its playbook for companies to convert their cash holdings into bitcoin. Not only have most of the bitcoin miners decided to HODL bitcoin, but so too have over a dozen other assorted companies. I expect a Fortune 500 company to buy bitcoin on its balance sheet this year in 2025, and Michael Saylor to be the most famous/infamous figure for Bitcoin in 2025. I’ll write separately about MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin treasury operations and assess its leverage/risk, but its most fascinating impact is on the corporate bond market, which can now have Bitcoin exposure through convertible debt. And it's not just MicroStrategy, as all the other miners are following suit, with Marathon and Riot leading the pack. The bond markets are larger than the equity markets, and providing this channel for the bond market to have Bitcoin exposure is probably the most unanticipated outcome in Bitcoin thus far, and may have the most significant consequences that no one expected. Finally, I'm optimistic that the new Trump Administration will adopt favorable regulation towards crypto in general, though I do not expect the US government to buy bitcoin the way it holds gold. The new chair of the Council of Economic Advisers is favorable to the idea of the US holding Bitcoin. But he has remarked that the US already holds so much bitcoin because of prior seizures (like the Silk Road). I expect the new administration to simply re-label those holdings as a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, without making any new purchases this year. As for corporate adoption, I expect small companies to continue to convert some of their cash to bitcoin. For the big companies, my Hail Mary bet is that the first major purchase will come from Tesla, Meta, or Dell. Tesla already has some bitcoin on its balance sheet from its purchase a few years ago, and Elon Musk is slowly learning about the problems of inflation while advising President Trump, evidenced by his posting of Milton Friedman videos on X. Mark Zuckerberg is pushing forward open-source AI; the next logical step is open-source money. So I’m optimistic about 2025 for Bitcoin, even though 2024 will be hard to beat! One Community.

Title: The Great Crypto Crash

Trump will usher in a speculative frenzy. Produced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app. “The countdown clock on the next catastrophic crash has already started,” Dennis Kelleher, the president of the nonprofit Better Markets, told me. In the past few weeks, I have heard that sentiment or similar from economists, traders, Hill staffers, and government officials. The incoming Trump administration has promised to pass crypto-friendly regulations, and is likely to loosen strictures on Wall Street institutions as well. This will bring an unheralded era of American prosperity, it argues, maintaining the country’s position as the head of the global capital markets and the heart of the global investment ecosystem. “My vision is for an America that dominates the future,” Donald Trump told a bitcoin conference in July. “I’m laying out my plan to ensure that the United States will be the crypto capital of the planet and the bitcoin superpower of the world.” Annie Lowrey: The three pillars of the bro-economy Financial experts expect something different. First, a boom. A big boom, maybe, with the price of bitcoin, ether, and other cryptocurrencies climbing; financial firms raking in profits; and American investors awash in newfound wealth. Second, a bust. A big bust, maybe, with firms collapsing, the government being called in to steady the markets, and plenty of Americans suffering from foreclosures and bankruptcies. Having written about bitcoin for more than a decade—and having covered the last financial crisis and its long hangover—I have some sense of what might cause that boom and bust. Crypto assets tend to be exceedingly volatile, much more so than real estate, commodities, stocks, and bonds. Egged on by Washington, more Americans will invest in crypto. Prices will go up as cash floods in. Individuals and institutions will get wiped out when prices drop, as they inevitably will. The experts I spoke with did not counter that narrative. But if that’s all that happens, they told me, the United States and the world should count themselves lucky. The danger is not just that crypto-friendly regulation will expose millions of Americans to scams and volatility. The danger is that it will lead to an increase in leverage across the whole of the financial system. It will foster opacity, making it harder for investors to determine the riskiness of and assign prices to financial products. And it will do so at the same time as the Trump administration cuts regulations and regulators. Crypto will become more widespread. And the conventional financial markets will come to look more like the crypto markets—wilder, less transparent, and more unpredictable, with trillion-dollar consequences extending years into the future. “I have this worry that the next three or four years will look pretty good,” Eswar Prasad, an economist at Cornell and a former International Monetary Fund official, told me. “It’s what comes after, when we have to pick up the pieces from all the speculative frenzies that are going to be generated because of this administration’s actions.” For years, Washington has “waged a war on crypto and bitcoin like nobody’s ever seen,” Trump told crypto entrepreneurs this summer. “They target your banks. They choke off your financial services … They block ordinary Americans from transferring money to your exchanges. They slander you as criminals.” He added: “That happened to me too, because I said the election was rigged.” Trump is not wrong that crypto exists in its own parallel financial universe. Many crypto companies cannot or choose not to comply with American financial regulations, making it hard for kitchen-table investors to use their services. (The world’s biggest crypto exchange, Binance, declines even to name which jurisdiction it is based in; it directs American customers to a smallish U.S. offshoot.) Companies such as Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo tend to offer few, if any, crypto products, and tend to make minimal, if any, investments in crypto and crypto-related businesses. It’s not so much that banks haven’t wanted to get in on the fun. It’s that regulations have prevented them from doing so, and regulators have warned them not to. This situation has throttled the amount of money flowing into crypto. But the approach has been a wise one: It has prevented firm failures and crazy price swings from destabilizing the traditional financial system. Crypto lost $2 trillion of its $3 trillion in market capitalization in 2022, Kelleher noted. “If you had that big of a financial crash with any other asset, there would have been contagion. But there wasn’t, because you had parallel systems with almost no interconnection.” Forthcoming regulation will knit the systems together. Granted, nobody knows exactly what laws Congress will pass and Trump will sign. But the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, or FIT21, which passed the House before dying in the Senate last year, is a good guide. The law was the subject of intense lobbying by crypto advocates with billions on the line and cash to spend, including $170 million on the 2024 election. It amounts to an industry wish list. FIT21 makes the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, rather than the Securities and Exchange Commission, the regulator of most crypto assets and firms and requires that the CFTC collect far less information from companies on the structure and trading of crypto products than securities firms give the SEC. Annie Lowrey: The Black investors who were burned by Bitcoin Beyond loose rules, financial experts anticipate loose enforcement. The CFTC predominantly oversees financial products used as hedges by businesses and traded among traders, not ones hawked to individual investors. It has roughly one-fifth the budget of the SEC, and one-seventh the staff. And in general, Washington is expected to loosen the strictures preventing traditional banks from keeping crypto on their books and preventing crypto companies from accessing the country’s financial infrastructure. According to Prasad, this regime would be a “dream” for crypto. Trump and his family are personally invested in crypto, and the president-elect has floated the idea of establishing a “strategic” bitcoin reserve, to preempt Chinese influence. (In reality, this would mean deploying billions of dollars of taxpayer money to soak up speculative assets with no strategic benefit to the United States.) How many Republicans will invest in crypto because Trump does? How many young people will pour money into bitcoin because his son Eric says its price is zooming toward $1 million, or because the secretary of commerce says it is the future? Nothing being considered by Congress or the White House will reduce the inherent risks. Crypto investors will remain vulnerable to hacking, ransomware, and theft. The research group Chainalysis tallied $24.2 billion in illicit transactions in 2023 alone. And if the U.S. government invests in crypto, the incentive for countries such as Iran and North Korea to interfere in the markets would go up exponentially. Imagine China engaging in a 51 percent attack on the bitcoin blockchain, taking it over and controlling each and every transaction. The situation is a security nightmare. Americans will be exposed to more prosaic scams and rip-offs too. The SEC has brought enforcement actions against dozens of Ponzi schemers, charlatans, and cheats, encompassing both the $32 billion sham-exchange FTX and ticky-tacky coin firms. Nobody expects the CFTC to have the muscle to do the same. And FIT21 leaves loopholes open for all kinds of scuzzy profiteering. A crypto firm might be able to run an exchange, buy and sell assets on its own behalf, and execute orders for clients—legally, at the same time, despite the conflicts of interest. Simple volatility is the biggest risk for retail investors. Crypto coins, tokens, and currencies are “purely speculative,” Prasad emphasized. “The only thing anchoring the value is investor sentiment.” At least gold has industrial uses. Or, if you’re betting on the price of tulip bulbs, at least you might end up with a flower. With crypto, you might end up with nothing, or less. A large share of crypto traders borrow money to make bets. When leveraged traders lose money on their investments, their lenders—generally the exchange on which the traders are trading—require them to put up collateral. To do that, investors might have to cash out their 401(k)s. They might have to dump their bitcoin, even in a down market. If they cannot come up with the cash, the firm holding their account might liquidate or seize their assets. A report released last month by the Office of Financial Research, a government think tank, makes clear just how dangerous this could be: Some low-income households are “using crypto gains to take out new mortgages.” When crypto prices go down, those families’ homes are going to be at risk. Many individual investors do not seem to understand these perils. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has had to warn the public that it does not protect crypto assets. The Financial Stability Oversight Council has raised the concern that people do not realize that crypto firms are not subject to the same oversight as banks. But if Trump is invested, how bad could it be? Regulators and economists are not worried primarily about the damage that this new era will do to individual households, however. They are worried about chaos in the crypto markets disrupting the traditional financial system—leading to a collapse in lending and the need for the government to step in, as it did in 2008. Where Wall Street once saw fool’s gold, it now sees a gold mine. Ray Dalio of Bridgewater called crypto a “bubble” a decade ago; now he thinks it is “one hell of an invention.” Larry Fink of BlackRock previously referred to bitcoin as an “index of money laundering”; today he sees it as a “legitimate financial instrument”—one his firm has already begun offering to clients, if indirectly. Early in 2024, the SEC began allowing fund managers to sell certain crypto investments. BlackRock launched a bitcoin exchange-traded fund in November; one public retirement fund has already staked its pensioners’ hard-earned cash. Barclays, Citigroup, JPMorgan, and Goldman Sachs are doing crypto deals too. Billions of traditional-finance money is flowing into the decentralized-finance markets, and billions more will as regulators allow. Charlie Warzel: Crypto’s legacy is finally clear What could go wrong? Nothing, provided that Wall Street firms are properly accounting for the risk of these risky assets. Everything, if they are not. Even the sturdiest-seeming instruments are dangerous. Stablecoins, for example, are crypto assets pegged to the dollar: One stablecoin is worth one dollar, making them useful as a medium of exchange, unlike bitcoin and ether. Stablecoin companies generally maintain their peg by holding one dollar’s worth of super-safe assets, such as cash and Treasury bills, for every stablecoin issued. Supposedly. In the spring of 2022, the widely used stablecoin TerraUSD collapsed, its price falling to just 23 cents. The company had been using an algorithm to keep TerraUSD’s price moored; all it took was enough people pulling their money out for the stablecoin to break the buck. Tether, the world’s most-traded crypto asset, claims to be fully backed by safe deposits. The U.S. government found that it was not, as of 2021; moreover, the Treasury Department is contemplating sanctioning the company behind tether for its role as a cash funnel for the “North Korean nuclear-weapons program, Mexican drug cartels, Russian arms companies, Middle Eastern terrorist groups and Chinese manufacturers of chemicals used to make fentanyl,” The Wall Street Journal has reported. (“To suggest that Tether is somehow involved in aiding criminal actors or sidestepping sanctions is outrageous,” the company responded.) Were tether or another big stablecoin to falter, financial chaos could instantly spread beyond the crypto markets. Worried investors would dump the stablecoin, instigating “a self-fulfilling panic run,” in the words of three academics who modeled this eventuality. The stablecoin issuer would dump Treasury bills and other safe assets to provide redemptions; the falling price of safe assets would affect thousands of non-crypto firms. The economists put the risk of a run on tether at 2.5 percent as of late 2021—not so stable! Other catastrophes are easy to imagine: bank failures, exchange collapses, giant Ponzi schemes faltering. Still, the biggest risk with crypto has little to do with crypto at all. If Congress passes FIT21 or a similar bill, it would invent a novel asset class called “digital commodities”—in essence, any financial asset managed on a decentralized blockchain. Digital commodities would be exempted from SEC oversight, as would “decentralized finance” firms. In the FIT21 bill, any firm or person can self-certify a financial product as a digital commodity, and the SEC would have only 60 days to object. This is a loophole big enough to fit an investment bank through. Already, Wall Street is talking up “tokenization,” meaning putting assets on a programmable digital ledger. The putative justification is capital efficiency: Tokenization could make it easier to move money around. Another justification is regulatory arbitrage: Investments on a blockchain would move out of the SEC’s purview, and likely be subject to fewer disclosure, reporting, accounting, tax, consumer-protection, anti-money-laundering, and capital requirements. Risk would build up in the system; the government would have fewer ways to rein firms in. Crypto regulation could end up undermining the “broader $100 trillion capital markets,” Gary Gensler, the soon-to-be-former head of the SEC and the crypto industry’s enemy No. 1, has argued. “It could encourage noncompliant entities to try to choose what regulatory regimes they wish to be subjected to.” Annie Lowrey: When the Bitcoin scammers came for me We have seen this movie before, not long ago. In 2000, shortly before leaving office, Bill Clinton signed the Commodity Futures Modernization Act. The law put strictures on derivatives traded on an exchange, but left over-the-counter derivatives unregulated. So Wall Street ginned up trillions of dollars of financial products, many backed by the income streams from home loans, and traded them over the counter. It packaged subprime loans with prime loans, obscuring a given financial instrument’s real risk. Then consumers strained under rising interest rates, crummy wage growth, and climbing unemployment. The mortgage-default rate went up. Home prices fell, first in the Sun Belt and then nationwide. Investors panicked. Nobody even knew what was in all of those credit-default swaps and mortgage-backed securities. Nobody was sure what anything was worth. Uncertainty, opacity, leverage, and mispricing spurred the global financial crisis that caused the Great Recession. The crypto market today is primed to become the derivatives market of the future. Were Congress and the Trump administration to do nothing—to leave the SEC as crypto’s primary regulator, to require crypto companies to play by the existing rules—the chaos would remain walled off. There’s no sensible justification for digital assets to be treated differently than securities, anyway. By the simple test the government has used for a century, nearly all crypto assets are securities. But Washington is creating loopholes, not laws. As the crypto boosters like to say, hold on for dear life. “A lot of bankers, they’re dancing in the street,” Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase said at a conference in Peru last year. Maybe they should be. The bankers are never the ones left holding the bag. More Stories The Rise of the Union Right The Health-Care System Isn’t Hopeless

Mark Zuckerberg and Jensen Huang have jointly grown $28 billion richer in just the first three trading days of this year, meaning they're worth $350 billion combined — more than Bank of America. The Meta CEO has gained about $15 billion this year, while the Nvidia CEO's wealth has risen by about $13 billion. Their flying start has made them the biggest wealth gainers on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index so far in 2025, but other big names in tech aren't far behind. Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao was up about $12 billion at Monday's close, followed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos with an $8 billion increase, and Alphabet cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, up about $6 billion each. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk was next on the list at $5 billion in the green. Zuckerberg and Huang's combined gain of $28 billion accounts for nearly half of the net $61 billion increase for the world's 20 richest people in 2025. The pair's wealth jump reflects a nearly 8% advance in Meta stock and an 11% rise for Nvidia this year. Meta shares benefited from Wall Street analysts raising their price targets. Nvidia climbed on signs of strong demand for microchips and anticipation for Huang's keynote speech at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Monday. The Nvidia chief revealed new chips and a $3,000 AI supercomputer named Digits. He also announced partnerships in robotics, self-driving cars, and more independent or "agentic" AI. Zuckerberg and Huang's personal fortunes grew by about $79 billion and $70 billion respectively last year, trailing only Elon Musk's $203 billion gain by Bloomberg's estimates. The world's 20 richest people grew a combined $702 billion wealthier last year, lifting their net worth to above $3 trillion — a figure that rivals Microsoft's market value of $3.2 trillion. Tech leaders including Meta, Nvidia, Tesla, Amazon, and Alphabet have surged in recent years, supercharging the wealth of their biggest shareholders, as investors bet they'll play pivotal roles in the AI revolution and capture a big chunk of the profits generated.

Title: Watch These Nvidia Price Levels as Stock Continues Rising After CEO's Keynote Speech

Shares in artificial Intelligence (AI) favorite Nvidia (NVDA) will remain in the spotlight on Tuesday after CEO Jensen Huang provided several important technology updates last night during his keynote address at the CES 2025 conference in Las Vegas. During the highly anticipated event, Huang unveiled next generation AI-powered gaming chips, introduced technology that speeds up the training of robots, launched the chipmaker’s first desktop computer and announced a deal with Japanese automaker, Toyota (TM). Nvidia is coming off another banner year during which insatiable demand for AI infrastructure helped drive its stock price up about 170%. Those gains followed a more than three-fold increase in 2023. Nvidia shares, which hit a record closing high of $149.43 on Monday, were up another 2.5% in recent premarket trading and poised to hit an all-time intraday high today. Below, we take a closer look at Nvidia’s chart and apply technical analysis to identify key price levels worth watching as investors react to Huang’s CES update. Nvidia shares broke out above the top trendline of a descending channel on Friday, with bullish momentum continuing into Monday’s trading session ahead of Huang’s presentation. While the stock set a record closing high yesterday, the price closed significantly below its intraday peak to form a shooting star, a candlestick pattern that can signal a potential reversal. Looking ahead, investors should watch for increasing trading volume, which would signal conviction behind recent buying. Although share turnover registered its highest level in more than a week on Monday, it remains below longer-term averages, suggesting that larger market participants remain on the sidelines. Let’s identify several key overhead areas to watch on Nvidia's chart and also point out two major support levels that may come into focus during retracements. The first immediate overhead area to watch sits around $150. While the price has traded above this key level on multiple occasion since early November, it has failed to decisively close above it. To project a potential price target above the stock’s all-time high (ATH), we can use the bars pattern tool. This works by extracting the uptrend from April to June last year and repositioning it from last month’s low. Such analysis forecasts a target of around $225, about 50% above Monday’s closing price. We selected the prior trend because it began from the lower trendline of an earlier descending channel on the chart, closely replicating how the current move higher has started. During pullbacks, investors should initially watch the $140 level. Those who prefer not to chase breakouts may look for entry points in this area near the descending channel’s top trendline, which also closely aligns with the stock’s prominent June peak. Finally, the bulls’ inability to defend this area could see Nvidia shares retrace to around $130, a location on the chart where the may find support near the August swing high and December swing low.

Title: Mainstreaming Of Blockchain: Digital Innovations Reshaping Finance

Time Published: 2025-01-07T12:30:49Z
Full Content:
Decentralized Applications Concept - DApp - Autonomous Applications that Run on a Distributed Ledger ... [+] System such as a Blockchain Traditional finance isn't just adopting crypto - it's being rebuilt around it. JPMorgan is launching instant dollar-euro conversions on its rebranded Kinexys blockchain, where transaction volumes have grown tenfold to process over $2 billion daily. Visa's new Tokenized Asset Platform enables banks like BBVA to create and manage digital tokens, with pilot programs starting in 2025. Mastercard's Crypto Credential service operates across 13 countries in Europe and Latin America, simplifying transactions through partnerships with Bit2Me and Mercado Bitcoin. Morgan Stanley's E-Trade is exploring direct crypto trading services, while Goldman Sachs makes bold moves in the digital asset space - spinning off its Digital Assets Platform into a standalone entity, forging strategic partnerships with Tradeweb Markets, holding over $700 million in spot Bitcoin ETFs, and exploring market making in Bitcoin and Ethereum. BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF draws billions in institutional money. The story isn't about disruption anymore - it's about integration, as the world's largest financial institutions systematically blur the lines between traditional and digital finance. Our strategy is to create more utility for crypto holdings, enabling users to connect their balances to Visa credentials and spend in fiat at millions of merchant locations," explained Nikola Plecas. With over 60 crypto platforms now working with Visa, the company is unlocking new use cases beyond trading, including remittances and cross-border payments. This transformation extends beyond payments. Citi's Tony McLaughlin envisions: "In five years, we might have a blockchain or state-machine capability where financial institutions involved in a transaction can look at that common state and use it as a source of truth to update their own balance sheets." These developments signal a fundamental shift toward a more efficient and interconnected global financial infrastructure. The Foundation of Financial Innovation The technology underpinning this financial transformation isn't just an upgrade - it's a complete reimagining of how money moves. While blockchain started with Bitcoin, its impact now reaches far beyond cryptocurrencies. The technology's distributed ledger architecture, smart contracts, and tokenized incentives enable programmable automation while providing new ways to track, verify, and secure digital transactions, transforming sectors from supply chains to healthcare records. In the financial sector, however, its impact has been particularly profound. Traditional trades that once required days and multiple intermediaries can now be executed and settled instantly, marking the most significant upgrade to financial infrastructure in decades. The technology's ability to provide immutable records and transparent transactions has sparked innovation across the entire financial services spectrum. The maturation of crypto markets has spurred the development of sophisticated yet accessible investment infrastructure. ICONOMI exemplifies this trend, allowing users to copy established portfolios or manage their own crypto assets. The platform's Blockchain Index portfolio provides easy access to top crypto assets and simplifies crypto investing for beginners while also offering sophisticated tools for experienced traders. This evolution reflects the industry's movement toward more user-friendly, professional-grade services. ICONOMI's approach helps users navigate the complex crypto landscape with features like dollar-cost-averaging and automated profit-takin The Rise of Tokenization: Unlocking Value in Real-World Assets The tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) represents one of finance's most transformative innovations. By converting ownership rights into digital tokens on a blockchain, this technology bridges traditional finance, real assets, and the decentralized world. Industry analysts project the RWA market could expand dramatically within the next decade, potentially reaching $10-15 trillion. Major institutions are accelerating this transformation. Goldman Sachs, for example, has launched three new tokenization products for institutional clients, focusing on money market funds and real estate assets while also creating marketplaces for these In this tectonic landscape, Liqvid exemplifies this evolution by developing infrastructure for single-transaction purchases of yield baskets comprising tokenized real estate, private credit, and bonds. The founding team's background from marquee institutions like BlackRock and Edge Capital brings extensive industry insight, technical expertise, risk management, and regulatory navigation crucial for innovations and adoption. The platform aims to democratize access to previously exclusive institutional-grade financial instruments, leveraging the transformative potential of the RWA market. AI/Blockchain AI and blockchain are forging a new digital frontier where razor-sharp insights meet unbreakable trust. As artificial intelligence decodes complex data patterns, blockchain anchors these revelations in an immutable ledger, transforming raw information into verifiable, tamper-proof intelligence. This symbiotic dance between predictive analytics and cryptographic security is rewriting the rules of data integrity, enabling a world where insights are not only discovered but permanently validated and transparently shared. VeraViews demonstrates this in digital advertising by integrating blockchain-based Proof of View (PoV) technology with AI-driven fraud detection. This approach helps verify ad impressions and increase transparency, addressing persistent issues like ad fraud and wasted budgets. By using real-time fraud detection and transparent data tracking, VeraViews showcases how emerging technologies can tackle industry-wide challenges, from preventing market manipulation to fostering accountability in digital ecosystems. DeFi -Decentralized Finance. blockchain, decentralized financial system DeFi and Stablecoins: The New Rails of Finance DeFi represents blockchain's most radical innovation yet—a financial system that runs purely on code. Traditional banks use people and paperwork to process loans and trades. DeFi replaces all of that with automated smart contracts. Flash loans, a uniquely DeFi invention, showcase this power—enabling complex borrowing and trading to happen in seconds, something impossible in traditional finance. What makes these innovations particularly significant is their ability to execute complex financial operations without traditional intermediaries - transforming processes that historically took days into near-instantaneous transactions. But it's stablecoins that serve as the critical bridge between DeFi and traditional finance. These digital dollars, maintaining stable value through fiat currency pegs, are becoming the universal adapter between old and new systems. Payment giants like Mastercard and Visa now use them to make cross-border transfers faster and cheaper. Banks are following suit, recognizing that stablecoins could reshape everything from treasury operations to international trade finance. Their ability to enable seamless interaction between conventional and decentralized finance is accelerating mainstream adoption. Cross-Border Payments and Technology Innovation Blockchain is rewiring how money moves across borders. The combination of blockchain networks and stablecoins has created new pathways for cross-border transactions that bypass traditional correspondent banking systems. Raj Dhamodharan, executive vice president of blockchain and digital assets at Mastercard, stated, "Blockchain technology, and public blockchains in particular, are opening up a number of new use cases, one of which is to transfer value — such as remittances — from one country to another." This evolution could have significant implications for the global remittance market, which the World Bank estimated at $630 billion in 2022. To power these cross-border transactions, the ecosystem also requires a robust exchange infrastructure. BestChange has emerged as part of this development, providing a cryptocurrency exchanger directory that aggregates real-time rate comparisons. Such services help users navigate the complex landscape of crypto exchanges and rates, contributing to market efficiency and accessibility. It offers features such as rate notifications, exchange history, and user reviews, catering to crypto enthusiasts, freelancers, and businesses seeking efficient fund transfers between different systems. The Path Forward: Regulation and Growth The regulatory environment has matured significantly, with major jurisdictions introducing comprehensive frameworks that balance innovation with consumer protection. This regulatory clarity has been crucial for institutional adoption, providing the certainty needed for larger financial institutions to invest in blockchain-based solutions. A New Era of Finance The numbers tell the story: $2 billion in daily transactions and $1.5 trillion in notional value since inception on JPMorgan's Kinexys blockchain, $10-15 trillion projected for tokenized real assets, and a $630 billion global remittance market transforming through digital networks. Beyond the statistics, we're seeing concrete infrastructure changes - Visa and Mastercard embedding crypto capabilities across continents, BlackRock moving institutional capital into digital assets, and JPMorgan's blockchain rewiring the fundamental architecture of global finance across five continents. The implications extend beyond the trading floor. Corporate treasurers who once tracked only fiat currencies must now navigate stablecoins and digital tokens. DeFi protocols are automating processes that previously required teams of bankers. Blockchain-AI integration is reshaping everything from fraud detection to market surveillance. This isn't a story of disruption anymore - it's one of integration. Traditional finance isn't fighting the digital revolution; it's actively building it. Those who recognize this shift aren't just adapting to change - they're positioning themselves to shape how value moves in a digital economy.

Title: Vets lodge members in multi-state feud with hotel chain, AZ cops over crank call & judicial error

January 07, 2025 07:30 ET | Source: Veterans Recovery Network Inc. Veterans Recovery Network Inc. PHOENIX, Jan. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- An African American man on the ASD spectrum working at Veterans Recovery Network, a veteran services organization for homeless military veterans, has filed a civil lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Nevada District against The Siegel Select Group, a national property management firm previously investigated by members of Congress for unlawful evictions, and city law enforcement officials at the Casa Grande Police Department for allegedly running unlawful evictions, recklessly interfering with active protection orders issued by an Arizona judge, wanton eviction procedures, and submitting falsified police report information about a physical assault on a Casa Grande woman last February while he was nearly 700 miles away, as court documents infer to evince the cumulative effects involved in this situation. Cary Peterson, who works at a non-governmental organization that supports disabled and homeless military veterans, filed a civil lawsuit against the Siegel Select Group, and local police officers for unlawful eviction and civil rights violation claims. The lawsuit alleges that Siegel Group's management in Arizona interfered with a court order of protection, locked Peterson out of his unit, violated statutory laws on due process rights to tenants, and had been involved in a monetary dispute over a holiday rental property funded by Veterans Recovery Network. Arizona Senator T.J. Shope, a member of the 16th Legislature District, expressed disinterest in the 'undesired lobbying contact' email concerning this legal situation in his backyard involving ASD-disabled Black-Hispanic man and his son who were initially visited with threats of physical harm and racial harassment with death threats prior to filing a lawsuit for a order of restraint, according to Mesa Police Department records and the criminal prosecution that remains pending in the court, and a matter of the public interest at the Arizona Attorney General’s office. Shope, a member of the Arizona legislative committee on public safety, is a member of the 16th Legislature District, which includes Casa Grande and Pinal County. OLD BEEFS In the Summer of 2024, the Veterans Recovery Network had been working with a disabled military veteran in Mesa with his VA benefits. PACT Act Relief Settlement Program advocated administrative complaints filed with the Office of Civil Rights and the Arizona Attorney General when they became aware of the landlord-clients of Hull, Holiday & Holiday Law Office for evictions against members of their veterans organization. These eviction actions all resulted from disabled tenants living on SSDI or VA disability benefits being placed into an housing-assistance programs run by state-mandated nonprofit organizations that were required to pay the majority or all of the disabled tenants’ rent payments. But eviction actions started instead after these community-bridging organizations failed to do so after several months (without the tenant's knowledge). NEW BEEFS December 18, 2024, Siegel Select Group filed a crossover lawsuit against Peterson in the Casa Grande Justice concerning the Arizona rental property controversies raised in Peterson federal lawsuit filed against Siegel’s corporate office and property manager two weeks earlier. Peterson’s federal complaint against Siegel Select Group Nevada, Siegel's Arizona property manager Rebecca Blanford and an unidentified male with her, and police officials in the City of Casa Grande, was followed by Casa Grande Justice Court Justice of Peace John Ellsworth, a military veteran who’s judiciary profile (https://www.pinalcourtsaz.gov/directory.aspx?eid=32) quote reads that ‘all persons should be held accountable for their actions,’ entered a court hearing disposition (an eviction judgment in favor of Siegel) that the respondent, Cary Peterson- ironically being a (retired) Tribal court judge from Silicon Valley- 'failed to appear' in court on December 23, 2024, resulting in a default judgment against him. This 'absentia' judgment erroneously entered by the court occurred despite Peterson typing his name into the Zoom conference of the court hearing, stating that he was 'present' before the court sessions began, which included communication on the official court record with Siegel's attorney and Judge Ellsworth. The court record shows that Peterson filed an appeal with an application order receipt for a 'supersedeas bond' in accordance with the Arizona law before the Pinal County Constable got involved to reclaim the rental property in dispute last week. The same Arizona justice court that stated Peterson 'failed to appear' for the eviction hearing [as well] denied Peterson’s notice of appeal, and supplemental motions requesting the court transcript and ‘designation of record on appeal.’ CONGRESSIONAL FAULT-FINDING In 2021, U.S. Representative Jim Clyburn was the vanguard of a congressional committee report (https://coronavirus-democrats-oversight.house.gov/news/press-releases/clyburn-siegel-invitation-homes-pretium-ventron-pandemic-evictions) against Siegel Select Group. In July 2022, Congressman Clyburn published a report that condemned the Siegel Group for unlawful evictions and civil rights violations of several tenants during the pinnacle of the COVID crisis, their 'misleading' and 'aggressive' tactics to evict tenants "uniquely egregious." According to the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, chaired by Rep. James E. Clyburn, this federal legislative report (https://coronavirus-democrats-oversight.house.gov/news/press-releases/clyburn-siegel-invitation-homes-pretium-ventron-pandemic-evictions) revealed that Siegel Select Group used abusive tactics to 'evict tens of thousands of struggling residents' despite the current eviction laws during the COVID pandemic, while receiving $2 million in forgiven Paycheck Protection Program funds (PPP government loans). EVIDENT ERRORS The (erroneously-issued) 'failure to appear' judicial order is [now] a multi-jurisdictional controversy that now remains a matter of the United States District Court (Peterson v. Siegel Group Nevada Inc., et al., No. Case No. 2:24-cv-02265 (D. Nev. Dec. 6, 2024) derived from more than a handful of related lawsuits between Peterson, a veteran client of Veteran Recovery Recovery Network ('Sternberg'), the Siegel Group, particular Siegel Select Group employees ('Blanford'), Casa Grande City's police officer Timothy Dunham, three unidentified Casa Grande police officials, and the Law Offices of Hull, Holiday & Holiday- a complex legal matter which public records show had a domino-effect of cumulative errors after a simple misinterpretation caused by what Peterson says was a 'crank call' made to the police by an estranged relative in Arizona last February, while Peterson was several hundreds of miles away in California. The erroneous police reporting by the Casa Grande Police Department was followed by irregularities in the Arizona justice system that resulted in the Arizona state court’s communications director telling the Arizona State Bar’s communications director and a news investigator in an email response that he could not find any trace of newly-appointed Maricopa County Superior Court Commissioner Lisa Boddington’s family court docket cases involving Peterson as a party. Last September, in another instance related to Commissioner Boddington’s judicial case load, the judge’s deputy clerk concedes to the court transcriber that the audio recordings from [all three] court hearings related to Peterson’s protection order actions were lost due to ‘human error.’ Court papers disclose that Peterson believes that the erroneous police report information filed by the Casa Grande Police caused the Arizona judges and local community to place him in a bad light, defaming his character and reputation in general. STATUS OF PROCEEDINGS Last Friday, Peterson filed an emergency motion to transfer this case matter to the United States District Court for the Arizona District due to the fact that Nevada does not have jurisdiction to hear civil rights claims against local law enforcement officials under Title 42, Section 1983 of the United States of Code. These court proceedings, assigned to United States District Court Chief Judge Andrew P. Gordon of the Nevada District, remain pending. There are no scheduled hearings at the present time. ﻿News Content By: David De Livera, Alena Moskowitz-Hardley (freelance writers) A photo accompanying this announcement is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/38cf3fd6-0a61-4eb3-9d4d-ad4595978120

US stock futures held steady on Tuesday as cautious investors weighed Nvidia's (NVDA) big AI plans and puzzled over tariff prospects, with fresh jobs data on deck. Contracts on the S&P 500 (ES=F) were up 0.1%, holding near tech-fueled prior-session gains. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) inched higher by 0.2%, while those on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) hovered around the flatline. Buzz around Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's CES keynote is providing a bright spot for markets used to moving tentatively amid uncertainty around policy from the incoming Trump administration. Shares in Nvidia rose over 2% in pre-market, coming off hitting a record high close, after Huang revealed a new AI superchip among other planned products. Chip stocks extended their rally in its wake, with Micron Technology (MU) up over 5% and Asia names making gains. At the same time, the watch is on for more clarity around Donald Trump's tariff agenda. The president-elect on Monday denied a Washington Post report that his team is considering more targeted measures — which would be more promising for global growth. The dollar (DX-Y.NYB) continued to come under pressure, having sunk to one-week lows. An update on JOLTS job openings in November later in the day will feed into the debate over the path of interest rates, as well as setting the stage for Friday's all-important December jobs report. In recent days, Fed officials have signaled they would take a more gradual approach to cuts, given resilience in the jobs market and persistent inflation.

Title: Analysis-Trump's SEC pick likely to give Wall Street easier enforcement ride
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/analysistrumps-sec-pick-likely-to-give-wall-street-easier-enforcement-ride-3799703
Time Published: 2025-01-07T11:22:11Z
Full Content:
By Douglas Gillison and Chris Prentice (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump's SEC pick voted several times against punishing big companies and was extremely critical of the agency's enforcement process when he was a top official there, according to public records and former SEC attorneys, in a possible glimpse of what is to come under his leadership. Paul Atkins voted against at least 10 enforcement actions punishing individuals and companies, including Citigroup (NYSE:C) and IBM (NYSE:IBM), according to a Reuters review of Securities and Exchange Commission records from the final years of his 2002-2008 stint as a commissioner. In doing so, he defied his fellow Republican agency chairs. Atkins was also fastidious, scrutinizing proposed enforcement actions word by word and frequently pushing back on SEC staff who recommended bringing charges, according to three former SEC enforcement staff. At the time, Atkins made no secret of his mistrust of much of the SEC's process for probing and disciplining rule-breakers, arguing that corporate fines unfairly penalize shareholders and that the SEC should focus on individual fraudsters. He became well-known for his industry-friendly views, even as the agency grappled with the fallout from the Enron and WorldCom accounting scandals. But his enforcement dissents, which have not been previously reported in detail, and Reuters' interviews with more than a dozen former SEC officials and academics, provide insight into how deep that skepticism was. They suggest Wall Street is set for a much easier ride after years of aggressive enforcement under Democratic Chair Gary Gensler, whose SEC levied over $20 billion in penalties and other charges. High-profile companies whose SEC cases could be affected by new leadership include electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), crypto exchanges Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN) and Binance, and investment firms BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), Carlyle and TPG. Under Atkins, the SEC will likely focus on misconduct that causes direct investor losses, such as scams, rather than corporate malfeasance where the harm is not always immediately obvious, the sources said. Critics say such an approach is dangerous because big companies can pose systemic risks and are capable of large-scale harm to investors. "His nomination should bring down the stress levels and ambient heart rates for compliance ... staffers," said Tyler Gellasch, a former SEC official who now leads the Healthy Markets Association, which focuses on increasing capital markets transparency and reducing conflicts of interest. Its members include pension funds. Atkins did not respond to requests for comment. He has said little on enforcement in recent years but has continued to argue for light-touch oversight, and has represented companies in regulatory disputes via his consultancy, Patomak Global Partners (NYSE:GLP). Trump transition spokespeople did not respond to a request for comment. 10 DISSENTS SEC leadership comprises five politically-appointed commissioners, including the chair, who vote on rules and enforcement actions. Typically, chairs bring a vote when they have enough support to pass a measure. During Atkins' tenure, commissioners sometimes revealed how they voted on regulatory matters, but neither they nor the agency routinely publicized the outcomes of enforcement votes, obscuring commissioners' overall records from public view. Reuters reviewed online voting records from Atkins' tenure, for which only 28 months during 2006 to 2008 are available. The records relate to administrative enforcement actions brought before the SEC's in-house court but not federal court litigation. With 10 dissents, Atkins disapproved of more than twice as many actions as Democratic commissioner Roel Campos, while Democrat Annette Nazareth and Atkins' fellow Republican Kathleen Casey did not dissent on enforcement matters at all during those months. Campos, Nazareth and Casey did not respond to requests for comment. Even in today's partisan climate where party-line SEC dissents are common, Atkins' willingness to oppose his fellow Republicans on enforcement matters is striking, underscoring how strongly he felt about the issues, said experts. "Atkins is an independent thinker with a clear view about how markets work," said Stanford professor Joseph Grundfest, who was a Democratic commissioner in the 1980s. Jay Clayton, SEC chair during Trump's first term, was similarly skeptical of big corporate fines and focused mostly on small-scale investor frauds. But the agency was still active, notching record penalties in 2020 and surprising some onlookers with landmark charges against Tesla and crypto firm Ripple. While Atkins' 10 dissents were among thousands of votes he would have made, former agency officials said they accurately reflect his exacting approach to enforcement issues. "He put us through our paces," said former SEC assistant enforcement director Gregory Faragasso, who praised Atkins' acumen and expertise. "He would want to get down into the weeds on certain issues ... you'd have to really know your stuff." Two other former officials shared similar observations. One said Atkins would negotiate corporate penalties with staff, often pushing for a focus on fines for individuals over companies. Atkins voted against a $7-million SEC settlement with IBM over accounting and other issues, and opposed a 2008 order against Citigroup over its financial statements. He also dissented on smaller matters, such as censuring unregistered accountants. The documents do not record Atkins' reasoning but, in contemporaneous remarks, he argued that corporate fines only hurt shareholders who had already suffered from the original misconduct. He also argued that enforcers often pursued minor infractions, suggesting in a 2008 speech that they did so to pad enforcement figures, and that enforcers were not transparent about the evidence they had on targets. "Where there are serious violations, enforcement action is necessary, but the goal should be to work with firms to build their internal compliance," he said.

Title: Everything that happened at The Game Awards 2024: Winners, Game of the Year, and every new trailer

All the news from The Game Awards 2024 in one place, reported as it happened. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Like the last several years before it, 2024 has been a year chock-full of exciting game releases and innovative new hits. Now that it's drawing to a close, it's time to commemorate all of those great new titles with The Game Awards 2024. Geoff Keighley once again hosted the annual awards show in Los Angeles' Peacock Theater, and this year's iteration is particularly celebratory since it was the event's 10th anniversary. The gala kicked off on Thursday, December 12 at 4:30 p.m. PT / 7:30 p.m. ET / 12:30 a.m. GMT. Once the show began, the winners of all 30 awards were announced over the course of the next three hours, with trailers, game reveals, and world premieres that showed off what's next in gaming interspersed between these announcements. The team here at Windows Central watched and reported on the event as it unfolded, and you'll find live coverage of every winner and reveal right here (award winners are highlighted in bold below). Hello everyone, and welcome to our live coverage of The Game Awards 2024! The show may still be a day away, but there's already quite a few things to talk about ahead of its scheduled start time. There have been several teases of what to expect from the presentation from The Game Awards and its partners, all of which I'll be covering here shortly. There's quite a bit of stiff competition in this year's nominations, and there's some noteworthy controversy too; many are frustrated with the inclusion of Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree in the running, for example, because it's ultimately still a DLC expansion even if it is the size of a standalone game. As usual, there are also lots of fans who feel their favorite game got snubbed from Game of the Year nominations or other categories (that's me with Helldivers 2, 100%). Still, I'm hoping that it'll be a great event, even if I still have a sour taste in my mouth from how The Game Awards 2023 let down developers and viewers alike by being more about advertisements and trailers than actually celebrating that year's best and brightest titles. Fingers crossed! — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor The Game Awards 2024 began on December 12, with the show being streamed live at 4:30 p.m. PT / 7:30 p.m. ET / 12:30 a.m. GMT. You can use the embedded YouTube livestream link above to watch the full three-hour presentation. The YouTube stream we embedded above is one way to watch this year's The Game Awards show, but it's not the only one. The presentation is being broadcast on a variety of different platforms once it begins on December 12 at 4:30 p.m. PT / 7:30 p.m. ET / 12:30 a.m. GMT, including the following: All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. If you end up having trouble with the stream on one platform, try using one of the others instead and hopefully it'll work better for you. — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor The vast majority of what's being shown at The Game Awards 2024 will remain a mystery until the show itself kicks off, but that doesn't mean we're going into it completely blind. In fact, the opposite is true, as many developers as well as Geoff Keighley himself have publicly teased several of the games, reveals, trailers, and performances that will appear during the event. These include the following: In addition to these, note that several celebrities and developers will be presenting awards throughout the evening, including Bethesda's Todd Howard, actress Isabela Merced from HBO's The Last of Us Season 2, Breaking Bad's Aaron Paul, prolific game voice actor Laura Bailey, Remedy Entertainment's Sam Lake, and none other than Hideo Kojima himself. If we learn anything else about the show before it starts, I'll be sure to post about it here. With that said, I don't expect we will, as it's bound to have plenty of surprises that the showrunners don't want to spoil. — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor what im expecting, without hard spoilers:- not a ton from xbox first party studios, pending xbox's own dev direct in q1. - lots of epic multiplat reveals.- other fun stuff.December 9, 2024 That's a direct quote from none other than Windows Central's very own executive editor and Xbox aficionado Jez Corden. Jez posted that to X (Twitter) a few days ago, clearly having heard about some of what's coming in this year's The Game Awards. He went on to say "without hard spoilers" that he's expecting to see impressive multiplatform announcements and "other fun stuff," though believes that Microsoft and Xbox won't have much to show since it has its own Developer_Direct presentation coming in Q1 2025. Sounds like we're in for a good show this year. — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor With the actual The Game Awards show now under 24 hours away, I thought it would be fun to share what my personal picks for all of this year's 30 award categories are based on what got nominated and what I've gotten around to playing and watching. Here's my list: I begrudgingly voted for Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree for many of these categories, as while I absolutely love the expansion and think it's largely better than the nominees it's up against, I don't think DLCs should be included in The Game Awards unless they're in their own separate category. If it was up to me, Helldivers 2 would be in (and win) the Game of the Year running, and Players' Voice wouldn't have three gacha games nominated (players were encouraged to vote for them with promises of free currency in these games by their developers, which is pretty lame). Alas, it is not up to me, so here I sit. Salty. Still, it's nice to see the presentation and performances in Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 get the recognition they deserve, and I'm hoping Animal Well wins both indie awards since it's pretty mind-blowing a solo developer made such a deep and create Metroidvania. Shoutout to Manor Lords in Best Sim/Strategy, too; it's another excellent solo-developed project. Also, I really need to set a day or two aside to watch Arcane Season 2. Fallout probably wouldn't be my pick for Best Adaptation if I'd done so already, based on what I've heard. — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor Before the nominations were announced, I said that we riot if Balatro wasn't nominated for Game of the Year. Now it has been nominated, we riot if it doesn't win Game of the Year. Balatro isn't my most played game of 2024, but it's far and away my pick to claim that coveted prize. I could talk for hours about it, but I won't. The shortened version is that Balatro embodies everything about what makes a great game. At its core, it's pure fun. It doesn't hide behind complicated narratives, flashy graphics, or endless battle passes. It's just a really good, addictive, well-executed game that I can honestly say anyone I've turned to playing it has totally got why I, and so many others, love it so much. — Richard Devine, Managing Editor For Borderlands fans, The Game Awards is Christmas arriving early. We already know Borderlands 4 exists and is scheduled to drop in 2025, but beyond that, not a whole lot. The Game Awards is going to be the first big look at the "most ambitious Borderlands yet" and it's the thing I'm most excited for. Sure, I want Balatro to win GOTY, but I love Borderlands. The franchise that really kicked off the whole looter shooter genre with a bang, and without it, some of my favorite titles may never have come to be. Plus, Borderlands fits so well with my own ridiculous sense of humor, I have no doubts I'm going to enjoy what I see tonight. Bring it on! — Richard Devine, Managing Editor Hey there! Like the rest of the crew, I'm prepping to cover the winter gaming showca-er, the Game Awards 2024, and I'm excited to see what's in store. As we get closer, I figured I'd also share what my picks were from across all the nominations. Bear in mind, I'm following the rules of what got nominated, so no voting for Frostpunk 2 for Game of the Year, even if it should be a contender. Game of the Year: Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Best Game Direction: Astro Bot Best Narrative: Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 Best Art Direction: Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree Best Score and Music: Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Best Audio Design: Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 Best Performance: Melina Juergens as Senua Innovation in Accessibility: Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Games for Impact: Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 Best Ongoing: Diablo 4 Best Community Support: Helldivers 2 Best Independent Game: Balatro Best Debut Indie Game: Balatro Best Mobile Game: Balatro Best VR/AR: Asgard's Wrath 2 Best Action Game: Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Best Action/Adventure: Astro Bot Best RPG: Dragon's Dogma 2 Best Fighting: Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics Best Family: Astro Bot Best Sim/Strategy: Age of Mythology: Retold Best Sports/Racing: EA Sports FC 25 Best Multiplayer: Helldivers 2 Best Adaptation: Arcane Most Anticipated Game: Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Again, I emphasize that this is only me choosing based off what was available in each category. My real most anticipated game undoubtedly goes to DOOM: The Dark Ages, as I absolutely cannot wait to see what Bethesda and id Software have cooked up with this Medieval-themed prequel focused on the origin of the Slayer's war on demons. — Samuel Tolbert, Gaming Contributor Since it seems to be all the rage here in the Windows Central live hub for all The Game Awards 2024 news and announcements you need, I've decided to also submit my picks for each category. In my humble (and correct) opinion, here are the winners. I omitted the categories I honestly couldn't care less about, and for the most part stuck with games that I've actually played. If you couldn't tell already, my personal game of the year is absolutely Metaphor: ReFantazio, which I reviewed for Windows Central. Metaphor: ReFantazio is a stunning RPG with an intricate, emotional, and powerful narrative in an incredibly beautiful world. When it comes to RPG gameplay, narrative and game direction, and music. Metaphor: ReFantazio would've run away with art direction, too, but I had to give that to Neva, which I also reviewed and chose as the best indie game of the year. Of course, I also had to give plenty of love to Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, another game I reviewed for Windows Central and one of the most impressive accomplishments in art and narrative design in video games. In particular, Hellblade 2's impactful messaging, unbelievable audio design, and the emotionally devastating performance from Melina Juergens. Finally, justice for Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown! Yes, I reviewed that, too. The Lost Crown is still one of my top games of the year, and it deserves at least one award at TGA. — Zachary Boddy, Staff Writer Good morning, everyone! As I type this out, The Game Awards 2024 is now only seven hours away, so it won't be long before we find out which of the nominees in each category are going home with one (or more) of those iconic TGA trophies. We'll also get to see all the new trailers and reveals that developers around the industry have in store for players. Stay tuned with us throughout the day for live coverage before, during, and after the show as we report on and react to all the exciting news. — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor See you @thegameawards Expect to be surprised! #TheGameAwardsDecember 12, 2024 Mere hours before the start of TGA 2024, Sloclap — the studio behind last year's excellent kung fu beat 'em up action game Sifu — has confirmed that it will have a presence at the show. It's also telling its fans to "expect to be surprised," which likely means we'll either get a new game announcement or perhaps a Sifu DLC reveal. Either one sounds great to me, so I'm definitely looking forward to seeing what Sloclap has in store for players. — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor I've been a Call of Duty player for a long time. I'm significantly older than the top players of today, but I've been floating around since the beginning. I took a few years off, though, because the Modern Warfare titles didn't grab me, and I didn't enjoy Vanguard in my limited time with it at all. The latest, Black Ops 6, is up for Best Multiplayer at The Game Awards and I wholeheartedly believe it deserves to win. Not just because it would be a nice catch for the now Microsoft-owned franchise! Ignoring the anticheat woes and the usual community frustrations that you'll always get with a game of this type, Black Ops 6 is a return to form for Call of Duty. The multiplayer is fast and fun, and Omnimovement has made more difference to this than I think a lot would give it credit for. I'm over 230 hours deep already, mostly in multiplayer, which speaks volumes for someone that's avoided almost all PvP games for a few years! Helldivers 2 is also worthy, but I really think Black Ops 6 deserves recognition. — Richard Devine, Managing Editor While plenty of amazing games and talented teams are being recognized during the awards, there's one game that won't be present, and that's Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. This excellent adventure title from MachineGames and Bethesda Softworks launched just a few days ago, well after the cutoff point for when a game needs to launch in order to be recognized and voted on. I do understand this, really. You have to have a cutoff point with lead time in order to allow the jury to reasonably vote, but it's such a shame that Indy won't be eligible this year, because I firmly believe he'd be a frontrunner for many. After all, this is my game of the year, and I wrote in my review of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle that "From the manner in which every line is delivered and scene is shot to the smirk on Indy's face when solving a puzzle, it's clear that everyone at MachineGames just gets what makes Indiana Jones so special. This is a game that can sit next to the original trilogy with pride." — Samuel Tolbert, Gaming Contributor Samuel is absolutely right that Indiana Jones and the Great Circle deserved to be up in The Games Awards' lineup, but it did miss the cutoff date by several weeks. One game that didn't, though, was GSC Game World's highly anticipated survival shooter STALKER 2. The cutoff was originally scheduled for November 22, but it got pushed up with no stated reasoning from The Game Awards; this axed the eligibility of November 20's STALKER 2 at the eleventh hour, which is pretty royally unfair if you ask me. It really should have been up there, as I'd argue it's unquestionably one of this year's best games and an inspiring success story from a beleaguered Ukrainian developer that persisted in the face of Russia's ongoing invasion. Its initial reviews and overall Metacritic scores took a sizable hit from some gnarly performance issues at launch, but GSC quickly patched the game up effectively and have majorly improved the Xbox and Windows PC exclusive. That's allowed its incredibly immersive atmosphere, immensely rewarding open-world exploration, and tense moment-to-moment combat gameplay shine brightly; 84% of its 68,279 user reviews on Steam are positive. In my own review of STALKER 2, I wrote that the shooter "stands tall as one of the most captivating open-world shooters I've ever played, with palpable atmosphere and deeply rewarding exploration that kept me glued to my seat along with addictively intense and dynamic action that kept me on the edge of it." I'd definitely put it (along with Helldivers 2) in Game of the Year in place of Black Myth: Wukong or the Elden Ring DLC if it was eligible, and it should definitely be in the running for Best Action Game and/or Best Action/Adventure, too. The fact it wasn't available as an option to vote for is a real shame. — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor Storming into the live blog to rant about my own injustice in this year's Game Awards, well not mine, Poncle's. From late 2023 and throughout 2024, Vampire Survivors has received a number of either free or ridiculously cheap updates adding an insane amount of content to the game, from the Among Us and Contra crossovers, to the Darkasso update adding a slew of ridiculously powered new Arcanas. Finishing the year with a boom, we got the Ode to Castlevania DLC in October, which for the tiny price of $3.99 added the biggest map yet, 20 new characters and 40 new weapons. Or did it? No, Poncle hid even MORE content past the end credits, and without spoiling it for those who haven't played yet, you are in for your money's worth.I've put *checks notes* 58 hours into the DLC alone on Steam, and when the Game Awards made such a song and dance about DLC being eligible for awards, I really thought Vampire Survivors would get some well deserved recognition. Alas, it hasn't even been acknowledged in the ongoing game. A travesty.Balatro making it into the Game of the Year category is the only thing keeping me from full incandescent rage, that and good old BAFTA Games have longlisted Vampire Survivors in it's own awards, so fingers crossed Poncle will get the recognition they so deserve elsewhere. — Jennifer Young, Gaming Contributor Balatro is absolutely clearing everying else in the Game of the Year category right now. Don't tell me I'm biased! Earlier this week, Cyberpunk 2077 paid homage to the game with a Balatro-inspired mission as a nod to Jimbo. Now, just over an hour ago, Balatro decided to keep the momentum going with a huge surprise—dropping the brand-new Friends of Jimbo 3 Pack 3 DLC on all platforms. This DLC features crossovers with deep breath Divinity: Original Sin 2, Shovel Knight, Potion Craft, Enter The Gungeon, Cult of the Lamb, Don't Starve, 1000xRESIST, and Warframe. The announcement came via an incredible trailer starring none other than Ben Starr, who plays our favorite Joker to perfection. Starr, who was nominated at last year’s Game Awards for his role in Final Fantasy 16, delivers a great performance in the trailer, which totally will not give me nightmares. With Balatro now celebrating 3.5 million copies sold, it’s no wonder it’s cementing its spot as one of the year’s best games. Honestly, it’s my personal Game of the Year winner—and with this level of content and creativity, it’s a title that’s more than well-deserved. — Jennifer Young, Gaming Contributor This year's The Game Awards celebration is fairly unique, as it happens to be the 10th anniversary of the event that showrunner Geoff Keighley first established in 2014. Therefore, while it's commemorating all the amazing games that have released in 2024, it's also something of a ceremony for The Game Awards' success in the last decade as well. Geoff Keighley, executive producer Kimmie Kim, director Richard Preuss, and production designer LeRoy Bennett have all spoken about this year's show in a new Variety interview, with the team discussing The Game Awards' rise in popularity and production quality over time, its similarities and differences compared to other shows like the Oscars and VMAs, and its focus on celebrating recent games while simultaneously giving fans a sneak peek at the future. Notably, Keighley commented in the interview that some of what players will see goes beyond what's coming next year. "This audience really does want to see the future, so we’ll be focused not just on what’s happening in 2025 in gaming, but I think you’ll see some things that are even further out at the show," he said. Overall, it's an enjoyable read, and one worth checking out while we're waiting for the show to start. Only about three and a half hours to go! — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor PRESENTED BY AGGRO CRAB:THE GAME AWARDS BINGO CARD 2024play along with us or just watch the chaos‼️ pic.twitter.com/tkfq2m9geADecember 12, 2024 It's impossible to know exactly what we'll see at The Game Awards, but trying to predict its schedule and then seeing if we're right is always a fun way to enjoy the show. That's the idea with bingo cards, and this one from Aggro Crab — the developer behind this year's excellent underwater Soulslike Another Crab's Treasure — is absolutely hilarious. It's chock full of funny references to controversial elements of this year's show (like the presence of Elden Ring's DLC) as well as jokes about its hosts, presenters, and past events (like Snoop Dogg and marijuana, the discussion about developer clothing last year, and Josef Fares' on-stage antics). I need to see Geoff Keighley bring an actual alligator on-stage to present something for Grand Theft Auto VI (set in a satirical version of Florida), but I'm going to be peeved if I have to cross off that "PLEASE WRAP IT UP" square. By the way, Another Crab's Treasure itself is a delightful indie, and if you play games on Xbox or PC, you can check it out with Xbox Game Pass. If you like Soulslikes, I strongly recommend it. — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor Hey gang, it's that time again. Geoff Keighley is out in force this year for The Game Awards, and the excitement is reaching fever pitch. There are rumors of all shapes and sizes flying around, and I've already posted some expectations on socials, but I want to add here what Xbox and Windows PC gamers can expect from Microsoft and its partners at this year's show. NO SPOILERS, though. From what I'm hearing, there will be at least a couple blockbuster announcements (initially shared by Jason Schrier on KindaFunny). One is a PlayStation exclusive fans should be very excited to see. However, at least one of the other major announcements should indeed represent a full multiplatform release across Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. It should spark a ton of excitement if true — although I'm not sure whether to expect this particular game to launch in the near term. As for Xbox itself, I expect the vast majority, if not every announcement relevant to Xbox to be a multiplatform affair. But there could be at least a couple of fun announcements, at least one could expand the already packed 2025 Xbox first-party slate. For my full The Game Awards predictions list, head over here. — Jez Corden, Executive Editor While we're all looking forward to the different announcements and awards, including seeing who wins Best Performance, it's extremely important to remember that SAG-AFTRA is still on strike. The union is seeking agreements to prevent abuse of AI, a hot topic across the game and tech industries. These actors are a huge reason why some of the biggest games can succeed, so if you've ever appreciated a performance like Maggie Robertson as Lady Dimitrescu or Troy Baker as Indiana Jones, you should be aware of what the concerns are as the strike continues. — Samuel Tolbert, Gaming Contributor There are a lot of games nominated for awards this year, with a ton of genre variety throughout the full list. Even the most dedicated gamers likely haven't played all of them as a result — I haven't gotten around to playing half of the Game of the Year nominees, myself — but if you're looking to catch up on what you missed, you'll want to take advantage of these excellent limited-time deals. Amazon, Microsof (Xbox), and Sony (PS5) are all offering special discounts on The Game Awards 2024 nominees on their respective storefronts, along with price cuts on quality gaming accessories like mice, keyboards, headsets, controllers, and more. The PlayStation sale is the best one since that sale runs until December 16 (Microsoft's ends after the show), but they're all great, and they allow you to save 75% or more on many of this year's best games. Check them out! — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor The Game Awards 2024 is now under one hour away from broadcasting live, so now's the time to get some grub or stretch for a while before settling in for the show. I'm going to eat a quick bite myself, but I'll be back soon to provide you with live coverage of the ceremony. — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor T-minus 5 minutes away from the start of The Game Awards! Enjoy the show if you're watching live, and thanks for sticking with us as we report on all the cool stuff we're about to see. — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor The Game Awards 2024 has kicked off with the announcement of Ninja Gaiden Ragebound, a new platformer in the legendary series headed your way in summer 2025. Hope you like packing (and unpacking). A cozy game about moving called One Move Away is coming in 2025, and it looks very relaxing to play! Last year's incredibly popular indie title Dave the Diver has an "In the Jungle" expansion coming in late 2025, so be ready for that if you're a fan! One of the most interesting games shown so far was Thick as Thieves, a stealth action game that looks heavily inspired by Dishonored. It's coming to Steam, the Epic Games Store, Xbox, and PS5. This new 2D action platformer looks pretty fun, and there's good news: it's coming to all major platforms in 2025! That means Xbox, PC, PS5, and Nintendo Switch. Another adorable cozy game that fans of Lords of the Rings will love is Tales of the Shire. It's headed to Xbox, PC, PS5, and Switch on March 25, 2025, and seems to be a farming/life simulator. Pugstorm, the team behind the critically acclaimed open-world survival crafting game Core Keeper, have announced Kyora — a new title that looks a whole lot like a spiritual successor to Terraria. You can wishlist it on Steam now. Sloclap, the team behind the high-octane action fighting game Sifu, decided they wanted to make a soccer game. And so, we have Rematch. Online soccer action! It's coming to Steam, Xbox, and PlayStation in summer 2025. Solasta 2 is a new tactical turn-based RPG that looks a whole lot like a Baldur's Gate-style tabletop game, and it's hitting Early Access on Steam in 2025. A free demo is coming soon, too! Slay the Spire's sequel has been highly anticipated for quite a while now, and we finally got a detailed new trailer at The Game Awards show. It's coming at some point next year in Early Access. Wow, Harrison Ford at The Game Awards! That's quite a surprise. I suppose it's fitting, with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle proving to be a big hit! It was cool to see him next Troy Baker. What a surprise! CD PROJEKT RED has blown everyone away by revealing The Witcher 4, the long-awaited sequel to one of the best RPGs of all time, with an extended cinematic trailer. We won't be playing as Geralt this time, though; instead, you'll take control of none other than Ciri herself. Oh, nobody expected this! FromSoftware is making Elden Ring: Nightreign, a new co-op adventure game set in the developer's grand fantasy world. It's coming to PC, Xbox, and PlayStation next year! Team Ico, the developer behind Shadow of the Colossus and The Last Guardian, made an appearance at The Game Awards 2024 with a trailer for a mysterious new game. We didn't get a name, but unsurprisingly, it's got huge scale — gigantic robots, specifically. Get hyped! The Outer Worlds 2, the sequel to Obsidian Entertainment's popular 2019 sci-fi RPG, is coming to Xbox, PC, and PS5 in 2025! At The Game Awards, it got an amusing new trailer that confirmed its release date. We've known it's coming for quite a while, but this was the first time we actually got a look at it. It Takes Two developer Hazelight Studios had a big showing at The Game Awards, announcing its next co-op game Split Fiction. Uniquely, the game's levels feature a blend of both sci-fi and fantasy environments, so it should offer quite an interesting gameplay experience to enjoy with a friend. Oh, and it's scheduled to come out March 6! The popular 2014 winter survival game The Long Dark is one of the most atmospheric I've ever played, so I was excited to see that a sequel called The Long Dark 2: Blackfrost got announced during the show. It's expected to enter Early Access in 2026! The Borderlands 4 trailer we knew was coming today got shown, and it looks like it'll offer all the explosive action longtime fans crave. It's coming to Xbox, Steam, and PlayStation in 2025, which was a nice surprise to learn about! Those who have been following the mech action title Mecha BREAK will be happy to know it's officially scheduled to drop next year in spring, and will be available on Xbox and PC. Interestingly, it will have an advanced AI NPC that can answer pretty much any question you ask it. Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, the team behind the beloved Yakuza franchise, announced what looks to be a new action game called Project Century. The dev also briefly went over what looks to be something new for the Virtua Fighter series. Few specific details were given, though! CALLING ALL HELLDIVERS! Helldivers 2 had a HUGE showing at The Game Awards, with a new Omens of Tyranny update going LIVE shortly after a trailer that showed off the arrival of the Illuminate faction, urban city maps, the long-awaited APC vehicle, and more! I know what I'm playing the second I'm done covering this show! A short trailer was shown for Palworld's upcoming Feybreak update during the show, with a December 23 release date revealed. On that day, you'll be able to play on Xbox, PC, and PS5. Fans of Onimusha, a classic Capcom action/adventure franchise, will be happy to hear that we're getting a brand new entry called Way of the Sword in 2026. The cinematic trailer shown didn't include gameplay, but it sure did have plenty of bloody samurai action. It's coming to Xbox, PS5, and Windows PC. Techland's parkour-heavy survival action franchise Dying Light is getting its next entry with Dying Light: The Beast, and today we learned it's scheduled to release on Xbox, PS5, and Windows PC in summer 2025. The news came alongside a sweet new trailer with plenty of zombie-slaying action. Well hey, would you look at that! A Game of Thrones action/adventure game that's coming in 2025, complete with characters from the popular HBO TV show and plenty of medieval-fantasy action. It's platforms haven't been revealed yet, though! Did The Last of Us Part 2 need a remaster? No. Would one make a ton of money? Definitely. Therefore, Sony and Naughty Dog remastered it this year, and are now bringing it to PC next year on April 3, 2025. The new Mafia game, The Old Country, got teased well before The Game Awards itself, and now we finally got to see its debut trailer during it. It's coming in summer 2025, so it's coming soon! Breaking Bad actor Aaron Paul and world-famous video game voice actress Laura Bailey star in a new story adventure game called Dispatch that's coming in 2025. Its stylized art direction looks great, and I'm looking forward to checking it out next year. That's another one we definitely didn't see coming! Okami, Capcom's beloved single player action/adventure game from 2006, is finally getting a sequel. It got announced during an amazing The Game Awards Orchestra performance, and is entering production shortly. Another huge surprise! Naughty Dog showed up with Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, a new PS5 game that's apparently been in development for four years now. Here's a quote from the trailer's description: "Set thousands of years in the future, Intergalactic puts players into the role of Jordan A. Mun, a dangerous bounty hunter who ends up stranded on Sempiria – a distant planet whose communication with the outside universe went dark hundreds of years ago. Jordan will have to use all her skills and wits if she hopes to be the first person in over 600 years to leave its orbit." And Astro Bot takes home the prestigious Game of the Year win! Congratulations to Team ASOBI on its victory, and to all the other games that were nominated. I was definitely expecting Black Myth: Wukong or Metaphor: ReFantazio to win, so this was quite a surprise! The Game Awards 2024 is now officially over, but man, what a show it was — an absolutely colossal three and a half hour ceremony with a crazy amount of new trailers and reveals, including many announcements that blew us away! Below, I've rounded up our in-depth coverage of all the highlights for you to read through if you missed the event... ...and also the trailers that slipped through my rapidly typing fingers due to the event's rapid pace: Thanks for sticking with me for the show! I'll write up more of my full thoughts shortly, but overall, I thought this was easily one of the best The Game Awards shows ever...even if it was extremely long. — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor Coming off of last year's extremely disappointing The Game Awards show that was rife with speeches rushed by "PLEASE WRAP IT UP" signs, tons of annoying advertisements, and zero attempts to raise awareness about the gaming industry's ongoing layoff issues at all, I wasn't exactly feeling optimistic about the 2024 iteration of the event. Yet while it still had a few too many ads for my liking, I have to say that I'm still extremely impressed by what Geoff Keighley and company put together this time around. Not only were there a series of truly wild announcements — the reveal of the dedicated co-op game Elden Ring: Nightreign blew my mind, other huge titles like The Witcher 4 looked fantastic too, and oh my god, that Helldivers 2 Illuminate update shadow drop — but we also got some fantastic musical performances, plenty of great speeches from developers speaking from the heart, and an entire segment dedicated to discussing the layoffs. Put simply, that was one of the best The Game Awards shows Geoff Keighley and his teams have put on yet, and it might even be the best one. I suppose that's only fitting for the event's 10th anniversary! Whether you watched The Game Awards alongside myself and my co-workers live or you used this live blog to keep tabs on all the big announcements and award results, thank you for joining me tonight. Myself and the rest of the Windows Central Gaming team will continue writing up our thoughts, reactions, and maybe even a few spicy hot takes tonight and tomorrow, though, so stay tuned for additional commentary. — Brendan Lowry, Gaming Contributor The Game Awards 2024 have concluded, and I'm honestly pleasantly surprised as a whole. Geoff Keighley seems to have taken feedback from previous years, resulting in a show that's more self-aware, more willing to poke fun at itself, more transparent, and more open to addressing the current events of the video games industry. There were a lot of great game announcements and performances, too, and most of the game award categories felt uncharacteristically reasonable. I was in high spirits (apart from my crushing exhaustion, my gods what a long show) up until the end, when the Game of the Year was announced. In my eyes, only one game truly earned the title in 2024, as the game with the most unyielding narrative impact, memorable art design, worldbuilding, and music, and enrapturing mixed-genre RPG gameplay. Of course, I'm speaking about Metaphor: ReFantazio, which has stood uncontested as my personal GotY since I reviewed it. Don't get me wrong, Astro Bot is a phenomenal 3D platformer with practically zero flaws, and I'm happy The Game Awards took time to recognize Astro Bot in a variety of categories. Smaller, less ambitious games like Astro Bot are often overlooked entirely, so I loved seeing it awarded alongside other brilliant games this year like Neva and Balatro. Despite its excellence, though, I don't believe Astro Bot was the best choice for Game of the Year. While perfectly polished, accessible to players of all ages, and a highlight of PlayStation's first-party output this year (we won't talk about Concord), Astro Bot feels like the safe play for The Game Awards. In contrast, Metaphor: ReFantazio is bold, obviously making zero attempt to appeal to mainstream audiences and instead focusing on delivering the absolute best gameplay, story, world and character building, and art design possible. It succeeds, to the point where I almost began a New Game+ immediately after rolling the credits on my 85-hour playthrough. I almost never feel like that with games, I often begin burning out around the 40-hour mark. Still, while I may disagree... Congratulations to Astro Bot on winning Game of the Year, Best Game Direction (Metaphor: ReFantazio also should've won that, cough cough), Best Action/Adventure Game, and Best Family Game. Of course, congratulations to Atlus and Metaphor: ReFantazio on winning Best Narrative, Best Art Direction, and Best RPG. You should've swept with Best Score and Music, too. — Zachary Boddy, Staff Writer Nothing is ever perfect, but I'll say that this year's show was significantly better than what we saw in 2023. Developers were actually given a bit of time to accept their awards without being hurried along, and even if it wasn't too sharply pointed, we did get some commentary about the awful layoffs that have ravaged the industry over the last two years. Well done to Keighley and crew for accepting at least some of the feedback levied since last year. — Samuel Tolbert, Gaming Contributor Brendan Lowry is a Windows Central writer and Oakland University graduate with a burning passion for video games, of which he's been an avid fan since childhood. He's been writing for Team WC since the summer of 2017, and you'll find him doing news, editorials, reviews, and general coverage on everything gaming, Xbox, and Windows PC. His favorite game of all time is probably NieR: Automata, though Elden Ring, Fallout: New Vegas, and Team Fortress 2 are in the running, too.

Title: Nvidia goes all in on AI agents and humanoid robots at CES
URL: https://qz.com/nvidia-goes-all-in-on-ai-agents-and-humanoid-robots-at-1851733651
Time Published: 2025-01-07T05:22:00Z

As the AI world races toward next-generation breakthroughs, Nvidia (NVDA-0.18%) fortified its position with a flood of new chips, software and services designed to keep the industry plugged into its expanding tech ecosystem. Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang announced a suite of AI tools and updates during the first keynote speech at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) on Monday, focusing on AI agents — systems that can complete tasks autonomously. Huang demonstrated these capabilities through animated versions of himself in different outfits, showing how AI agents could handle roles like customer service, coding, and research assistance. “The IT department of every company is going to be the HR department of AI agents in the future,” Huang said in the keynote. The chipmaker unveiled AI Blueprints, which will help companies build and deploy these AI agents using technology built on Meta’s (META-1.54%) Llama models. These “knowledge robots,” as Nvidia describes them, can analyze large amounts of data, summarize information from videos and PDFs, and take actions based on what they learn. To make this happen, Nvidia partnered with five leading AI companies — CrewAI, Daily, LangChain, LlamaIndex, and Weights & Biases — who will help integrate Nvidia’s technology into usable tools for businesses. “These AI agents act like ‘knowledge robots’ that can reason, plan and take action to quickly analyze large quantities of data, summarize and distill real-time insights from video, PDF and other images,” Justin Boitano, Nvidia’s vice president of enterprise AI software products said in a statement. Nvidia also made a major push into robotics, unveiling new tools to help companies simulate and deploy robot workforces. The centerpiece is “Mega,” a new Omniverse Blueprint that lets companies develop, test, and optimize robot fleets in virtual environments before deploying them in real warehouses and factories. “The ChatGPT moment for general robotics is just around the corner,” Huang said during his keynote. To back this claim, Nvidia announced a collection of robot foundation models, including new capabilities for generating synthetic motion data for training humanoid robots. The company says these pre-trained models were developed using massive amounts of data, including millions of hours of autonomous driving and drone footage. A key part of this effort is the new Isaac GR00T Blueprint, which helps solve a major challenge in robotics: generating the massive amounts of motion data needed to train humanoid robots. Instead of the expensive and time-consuming process of collecting real-world data, developers can use GR00T to generate large synthetic datasets from just a small number of human motions. “Collecting these extensive, high-quality datasets in the real world is tedious, time-consuming, and often prohibitively expensive,” Nvidia said in a press release. With the Isaac GR00T blueprint, developers can generate the large data sets needed to train AI models from a small number of human motions. The new tools are already attracting major industry players. KION Group, a supply chain solutions company, is working with Accenture (ACN+0.24%) to use Nvidia’s Mega blueprint to optimize warehouse operations that involve both human workers and robots. Nvidia’s efforts into the physical world didn’t stop there: it announced the expansion of its automobile partners, including with the world’s largest automaker, which will use its accelerated computing and AI for driving assistance capabilities and autonomous vehicles. Toyota (TM-0.53%) will use Nvidia’s DRIVE AGX Orin system-on-a-chip (SoC) technology for its next-generation vehicles for driving assistance. Meanwhile, the chipmaker said Aurora (AUR-4.11%) and Continental will both use Nvidia’s DRIVE accelerated compute to deploy driverless trucks through a long-term strategic partnership. On the consumer front — it is CES, after all — Huang showed off the next generation of its RTX Blackwell GPUs, with the four versions priced between $549 and $1,999. The popular gaming chips will be released later this month and in February. And to cap off the keynote, Huang lifted the curtain on Project DIGITS, a palm-sized personal AI supercomputer powerful enough to run AI models with up to 200 billion parameters — for comparison, GPT-3 has 175 billion parameters while GPT-4 is rumored to have 1.76 trillion parameters. The device, which will be available starting at $3,000 from Nvidia and its partners in May, aims to put AI development in more hands. “AI will be mainstream in every application for every industry,” Huang said in a statement. “With Project DIGITS, the Grace Blackwell Superchip comes to millions of developers. Placing an AI supercomputer on the desks of every data scientist, AI researcher and student empowers them to engage and shape the age of AI.” Nvidia stock was up 4% before Huang’s CES keynote, with Bank of America (BAC+0.10%) reiterated its “buy” rating on Nvidia in a note on Monday, with an analyst describing CES as a “positive catalyst” for the company. The stock closed at a record high of $149.43. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Like large language models, world foundation models are fundamental to advancing robot and AV development, yet not all developers have the expertise and resources to train their own,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “We created Cosmos to democratize physical AI and put general robotics in reach of every developer.” Open World Foundation Models to Accelerate the Next Wave of AINVIDIA Cosmos’ suite of open models means developers can customize the WFMs with datasets, such as video recordings of AV trips or robots navigating a warehouse, according to the needs of their target application. Cosmos WFMs are purpose-built for physical AI research and development, and can generate physics-based videos from a combination of inputs, like text, image and video, as well as robot sensor or motion data. The models are built for physically based interactions, object permanence, and high-quality generation of simulated industrial environments — like warehouses or factories — and of driving environments, including various road conditions. In his opening keynote at CES, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang showcased ways physical AI developers can use Cosmos models, including for: Advanced World Model Development ToolsBuilding physical AI models requires petabytes of video data and tens of thousands of compute hours to process, curate and label that data. To help save enormous costs in data curation, training and model customization, Cosmos features: World’s Largest Physical AI Industries Adopt Cosmos Pioneers across the physical AI industry are already adopting Cosmos technologies. 1X, an AI and humanoid robot company, launched the 1X World Model Challenge dataset using Cosmos Tokenizer. XPENG will use Cosmos to accelerate the development of its humanoid robot. And Hillbot and Skild AI are using Cosmos to fast-track the development of their general-purpose robots. “Data scarcity and variability are key challenges to successful learning in robot environments,” said Pras Velagapudi, chief technology officer at Agility. “Cosmos’ text-, image- and video-to-world capabilities allow us to generate and augment photorealistic scenarios for a variety of tasks that we can use to train models without needing as much expensive, real-world data capture.” Transportation leaders are also using Cosmos to build physical AI for AVs: “Generative AI will power the future of mobility, requiring both rich data and very powerful compute,” said Dara Khosrowshahi, CEO of Uber. “By working with NVIDIA, we are confident that we can help supercharge the timeline for safe and scalable autonomous driving solutions for the industry.” Developing Open, Safe and Responsible AINVIDIA Cosmos was developed in line with NVIDIA’s trustworthy AI principles, which prioritize privacy, safety, security, transparency and reducing unwanted bias. Trustworthy AI is essential for fostering innovation within the developer community and maintaining user trust. NVIDIA is committed to safe and trustworthy AI, in line with the White House’s voluntary AI commitments and other global AI safety initiatives. The open Cosmos platform includes guardrails designed to mitigate harmful text and images, and features a tool to enhance text prompts for accuracy. Videos generated with Cosmos autoregressive and diffusion models on the NVIDIA API catalog include invisible watermarks to identify AI-generated content, helping reduce the chances of misinformation and misattribution. NVIDIA encourages developers to adopt trustworthy AI practices and further enhance guardrail and watermarking solutions for their applications. Availability Cosmos WFMs are now available under NVIDIA’s open model license on Hugging Face and the NVIDIA NGC catalog. Cosmos models will soon be available as fully optimized NVIDIA NIM microservices. Developers can access NVIDIA NeMo Curator for accelerated video processing and customize their own world models with NVIDIA NeMo. NVIDIA DGX Cloud offers a fast and easy way to deploy these models, with enterprise support available through the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform.

NVIDIA will release a pipeline of NIM microservices for RTX AI PCs from top model developers such as Black Forest Labs, Meta (NASDAQ:META), Mistral and Stability AI. Use cases span large language models (LLMs), vision language models, image generation, speech, embedding models for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), PDF extraction and computer vision. GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs with FP4 compute will unlock a massive range of models that can run on PC, which were previously limited to large data centers, said Robin Rombach, CEO of Black Forest Labs. Making FLUX an NVIDIA NIM microservice increases the rate at which AI can be deployed and experienced by more users, while delivering incredible performance. NVIDIA today also announced the Llama Nemotron family of open models that provide high accuracy on a wide range of agentic tasks. The Llama Nemotron Nano model will be offered as a NIM microservice for RTX AI PCs and workstations, and excels at agentic AI tasks like instruction following, function calling, chat, coding and math. NIM microservices include the key components for running AI on PCs and are optimized for deployment across NVIDIA GPUs ” whether in RTX PCs and workstations or in the cloud. Developers and enthusiasts will be able to quickly download, set up and run these NIM microservices on Windows 11 PCs with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). AI is driving Windows 11 PC innovation at a rapid rate, and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) offers a great cross-platform environment for AI development on Windows 11 alongside Windows Copilot Runtime, said Pavan Davuluri, corporate vice president of Windows at Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). NVIDIA NIM microservices, optimized for Windows PCs, give developers and enthusiasts ready-to-integrate AI models for their Windows apps, further accelerating deployment of AI capabilities to Windows users. The NIM microservices, running on RTX AI PCs, will be compatible with top AI development and agent frameworks, including AI Toolkit for VSCode, AnythingLLM, ComfyUI, CrewAI, Flowise AI, LangChain, Langflow and LM Studio. Developers can connect applications and workflows built on these frameworks to AI models running NIM microservices through industry-standard endpoints, enabling them to use the latest technology with a unified interface across the cloud, data centers, workstations and PCs.

Developers and enthusiasts will be able to quickly download, set up and run these NIM microservices on Windows 11 PCs with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). “AI is driving Windows 11 PC innovation at a rapid rate, and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) offers a great cross-platform environment for AI development on Windows 11 alongside Windows Copilot Runtime,” said Pavan Davuluri, corporate vice president of Windows at Microsoft. “NVIDIA NIM microservices, optimized for Windows PCs, give developers and enthusiasts ready-to-integrate AI models for their Windows apps, further accelerating deployment of AI capabilities to Windows users.” The NIM microservices, running on RTX AI PCs, will be compatible with top AI development and agent frameworks, including AI Toolkit for VSCode, AnythingLLM, ComfyUI, CrewAI, Flowise AI, LangChain, Langflow and LM Studio. Developers can connect applications and workflows built on these frameworks to AI models running NIM microservices through industry-standard endpoints, enabling them to use the latest technology with a unified interface across the cloud, data centers, workstations and PCs. Enthusiasts will also be able to experience a range of NIM microservices using an upcoming release of the NVIDIA ChatRTX tech demo. Putting a Face on Agentic AITo demonstrate how enthusiasts and developers can use NIM to build AI agents and assistants, NVIDIA today previewed Project R2X, a vision-enabled PC avatar that can put information at a user’s fingertips, assist with desktop apps and video conference calls, read and summarize documents, and more. The avatar is rendered using NVIDIA RTX Neural Faces, a new generative AI algorithm that augments traditional rasterization with entirely generated pixels. The face is then animated by a new diffusion-based NVIDIA Audio2Face™-3D model that improves lip and tongue movement. R2X can be connected to cloud AI services such as OpenAI’s GPT4o and xAI’s Grok, and NIM microservices and AI Blueprints, such as PDF retrievers or alternative LLMs, via developer frameworks such as CrewAI, Flowise AI and Langflow. Sign up for Project R2X updates. AI Blueprints Coming to PCNIM microservices are also available to PC users through AI Blueprints — reference AI workflows that can run locally on RTX PCs. With these blueprints, developers can create podcasts from PDF documents, generate stunning images guided by 3D scenes and more. The blueprint for PDF to podcast extracts text, images and tables from a PDF to create a podcast script that can be edited by users. It can also generate a full audio recording from the script using voices available in the blueprint or based on a user’s voice sample. In addition, users can have a real-time conversation with the AI podcast host to learn more about specific topics. The blueprint uses NIM microservices like Mistral-Nemo-12B-Instruct for language, NVIDIA Riva for text-to-speech and automatic speech recognition, and the NeMo Retriever collection of microservices for PDF extraction. The AI Blueprint for 3D-guided generative AI gives artists finer control over image generation. While AI can generate amazing images from simple text prompts, controlling image composition using only words can be challenging. With this blueprint, creators can use simple 3D objects laid out in a 3D renderer like Blender to guide AI image generation. The artist can create 3D assets by hand or generate them using AI, place them in the scene and set the 3D viewport camera. Then, a prepackaged workflow powered by the FLUX NIM microservice will use the current composition to generate high-quality images that match the 3D scene. NVIDIA NIM microservices and AI Blueprints will be available starting in February with initial hardware support for GeForce RTX 50 Series, GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080, and NVIDIA RTX 6000 and 5000 professional GPUs. Additional GPUs will be supported in the future. NIM-ready RTX AI PCs will be available from Acer, ASUS, Dell, GIGABYTE, HP, Lenovo, MSI, Razer and Samsung, and from local system builders Corsair, Falcon Northwest, LDLC, Maingear, Mifcon, Origin PC, PCS and Scan.

January 06, 2025 22:06 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA LAS VEGAS, Jan. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CES -- NVIDIA today unveiled the most advanced consumer GPUs for gamers, creators and developers — the GeForce RTX™ 50 Series Desktop and Laptop GPUs. Powered by the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture, fifth-generation Tensor Cores and fourth-generation RT Cores, the GeForce RTX 50 Series delivers breakthroughs in AI-driven rendering, including neural shaders, digital human technologies, geometry and lighting. “Blackwell, the engine of AI, has arrived for PC gamers, developers and creatives,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Fusing AI-driven neural rendering and ray tracing, Blackwell is the most significant computer graphics innovation since we introduced programmable shading 25 years ago.” The GeForce RTX 5090 GPU — the fastest GeForce RTX GPU to date — features 92 billion transistors, providing over 3,352 trillion AI operations per second (TOPS) of computing power. Blackwell architecture innovations and DLSS 4 mean the GeForce RTX 5090 GPU outperforms the GeForce RTX 4090 GPU by up to 2x. GeForce Blackwell comes to laptops with all the features of desktop models, bringing a considerable upgrade to portable computing, including extraordinary graphics capabilities and remarkable efficiency. The Blackwell generation of NVIDIA Max-Q technology extends battery life by up to 40%, and includes thin and light laptops that maintain their sleek design without sacrificing power or performance. NVIDIA DLSS 4 Boosts Performance by Up to 8xDLSS 4 debuts Multi Frame Generation to boost frame rates by using AI to generate up to three frames per rendered frame. It works in unison with the suite of DLSS technologies to increase performance by up to 8x over traditional rendering, while maintaining responsiveness with NVIDIA Reflex technology. DLSS 4 also introduces the graphics industry’s first real-time application of the transformer model architecture. Transformer-based DLSS Ray Reconstruction and Super Resolution models use 2x more parameters and 4x more compute to provide greater stability, reduced ghosting, higher details and enhanced anti-aliasing in game scenes. DLSS 4 will be supported on GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs in over 75 games and applications the day of launch. NVIDIA Reflex 2 introduces Frame Warp, an innovative technique to reduce latency in games by updating a rendered frame based on the latest mouse input just before it is sent to the display. Reflex 2 can reduce latency by up to 75%. This gives gamers a competitive edge in multiplayer games and makes single-player titles more responsive. Blackwell Brings AI to ShadersTwenty-five years ago, NVIDIA introduced GeForce 3 and programmable shaders, which set the stage for two decades of graphics innovation, from pixel shading to compute shading to real-time ray tracing. Alongside GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs, NVIDIA is introducing RTX Neural Shaders, which brings small AI networks into programmable shaders, unlocking film-quality materials, lighting and more in real-time games. Rendering game characters is one of the most challenging tasks in real-time graphics, as people are prone to notice the smallest errors or artifacts in digital humans. RTX Neural Faces takes a simple rasterized face and 3D pose data as input, and uses generative AI to render a temporally stable, high-quality digital face in real time. RTX Neural Faces is complemented by new RTX technologies for ray-traced hair and skin. Along with the new RTX Mega Geometry, which enables up to 100x more ray-traced triangles in a scene, these advancements are poised to deliver a massive leap in realism for game characters and environments. The power of neural rendering, DLSS 4 and the new DLSS transformer model is showcased on GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs with Zorah, a groundbreaking new technology demo from NVIDIA. Autonomous Game CharactersGeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs bring industry-leading AI TOPS to power autonomous game characters in parallel with game rendering. NVIDIA is introducing a suite of new NVIDIA ACE technologies that enable game characters to perceive, plan and act like human players. ACE-powered autonomous characters are being integrated into KRAFTON’s PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS and InZOI, the publisher’s upcoming life simulation game, as well as Wemade Next’s MIR5. In PUBG, companions powered by NVIDIA ACE plan and execute strategic actions, dynamically working with human players to ensure survival. InZOI features Smart Zoi characters that autonomously adjust behaviors based on life goals and in-game events. In MIR5, large language model (LLM)-driven raid bosses adapt tactics based on player behavior, creating more dynamic, challenging encounters. AI Foundation Models for RTX AI PCsShowcasing how RTX enthusiasts and developers can use NVIDIA NIM microservices to build AI agents and assistants, NVIDIA will release a pipeline of NIM microservices and AI Blueprints for RTX AI PCs from top model developers such as Black Forest Labs, Meta, Mistral and Stability AI. Use cases span LLMs, vision language models, image generation, speech, embedding models for retrieval-augmented generation, PDF extraction and computer vision. The NIM microservices include all the necessary components for running AI on PCs and are optimized for deployment across all NVIDIA GPUs. To demonstrate how enthusiasts and developers can use NIM to build AI agents and assistants, NVIDIA today previewed Project R2X, a vision-enabled PC avatar that can put information at a user’s fingertips, assist with desktop apps and video conference calls, read and summarize documents, and more. AI-Powered Tools for CreatorsThe GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs supercharge creative workflows. RTX 50 Series GPUs are the first consumer GPUs to support FP4 precision, boosting AI image generation performance for models such as FLUX by 2x and enabling generative AI models to run locally in a smaller memory footprint, compared with previous-generation hardware. The NVIDIA Broadcast app gains two AI-powered beta features for livestreamers: Studio Voice, which upgrades microphone audio, and Virtual Key Light, which relights faces for polished streams. Streamlabs is introducing the Intelligent Streaming Assistant, powered by NVIDIA ACE and Inworld AI, which acts as a cohost, producer and technical assistant to enhance livestreams.

Blackrock Clinic Blackrock Clinic has secured the planning green light for a new cardiology department, an eye centre and additional in-patient bedrooms at its south Dublin site. The planned new facilities are the first phase of a 16-year masterplan for the hospital, which will also include the construction of a second hospital building on site. Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has given the first phase planning permission after concluding that the planned two-storey extension to the side of the main hospital building is acceptable. Planning documents lodged with the application reveal that the Larry Goodman Trust-owned hospital is proceeding with the masterplan “for the overall site following the acquisition of several neighbour sites adjoining the campus”. McGill Planning states that some of the main elements of the expansion “will include the provision of a dedicated cancer centre, a new specialised women’s health centre, additional theatre capacity, and additional high-tech interventional cardiology laboratories”. It says Blackrock Clinic admitted 52,185 in-patient and daycare patients in 2023 and this figure is expected to grow to 78,000 by 2033, which is around a 50pc increase over the next decade. “Blackrock Clinic is currently operating at full capacity,” it states. “In order to meet future growth in demand for medical services, the hospital will need to significantly expand its capacity and invest in the construction of major new medical facilities on the hospital campus.” The McGill Planning report lodged with the application states that the hospital’s capacity has doubled since 2008. The existing St Catherine’s site will host the second hospital building and deliver additional theatres; additional cath-lab capacity to meet growing demand in existing services; the development of a new cancer centre and the addition of new in-patient bed capacity. McGill Planning says Henry J Lyons Architects and Urban Designers were appointed in September 2023 to develop a masterplan following a competitive tender. It adds that this proposed two-storey extension application “is the first of several planning applications” that will be submitted to the council to enable the delivery of the plan. The two-floor extension will also provide 14 single-occupancy bedrooms. Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Geoff Bennett: Staff at The Washington Post are bracing for a wave of layoffs that are expected to be announced this week. It's the latest hit for The Post, coming just days after a longtime editorial cartoonist, Ann Telnaes, resigned in protest. Her editor rejected her latest cartoon, which depicted Post owner Jeff Bezos and other media leaders on bended knee before president-elect Trump. The Post said the cartoon was rejected because it had been repetitive of a recent column and another that was set to be published. Her editor in the statement said, in part: "Not every editorial judgment is a reflection of a malign force." To many observers, though, it's the latest in a series of events that are raising questions about Bezos and the leadership of The Post, including a series of high-profile staff departures and a wave of reader backlash. For more on that, we're joined now by Kara Swisher, multiplatform journalist, entrepreneur, and author of "Burn Book: A Tech Love Story." Thanks so much for being with us. Kara Swisher, Author, "Burn Book: A Tech Love Story": Thank you for having me. Geoff Bennett: And we should mention that you are putting together an investor group to buy The Washington Post. Jeff Bezos has… Kara Swisher: I'm thinking about it, yes. Geoff Bennett: Thinking about it. Kara Swisher: Yes, I have been talking — I'm talking to a lot of people because I'm just disturbed by what's happening there. I'm sure other people are too. The question is if he wants to sell it. He hasn't indicated any interest whatsoever, but I wanted to raise the idea because I think it needs new leadership and new management. Geoff Bennett: And — right, I was going to say he's given no indication that he intends to sell it. Kara Swisher: Yes. Geoff Bennett: But what's the vision? Why are you in the hunt? Kara Swisher: Well, I started off at The Washington Post in the newsroom — in the mailroom. Excuse me. That's where I started my career when I was at college at Georgetown University. And so that was my first job. And I worked there for many years. I started covering the Internet there, which is my big area. I went on to work at The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times and did a whole bunch of different things, including a very famous tech conference that was pretty good. And so I have been watching what's happening at The Post for a long time. And I was quite heartened when the Grahams, family which had owned it for so many years, sold it to Jeff Bezos. And in the initial years, he did a very good job. He got it for a very low amount of money, by the way. But he was doing a very good job. And it's just recently that his business interests are not aligned with The Post. And everything he's done so far over the past, I don't know, year or so has been pretty questionable, I would say, not because necessarily it's malign. I don't — I mean, bringing in malign forces, it sort of takes it to a new level. I think he has business interests that are not aligned with The Post. And some of his selections have been bad, including pulling the endorsement of Kamala Harris at the last minute. There's always some excuse. He didn't see it. He didn't read it. It doesn't really matter. He's involving himself in ways that are aren't working for The Post, which is also in distress as a business at this moment. Geoff Bennett: Well, on that point, I mean, strong journalistic ethics prioritize independence. Kara Swisher: Sure. Geoff Bennett: And Jeff Bezos obviously isn't a journalist. He's a businessman. Kara Swisher: No, of course. Geoff Bennett: And you can make the argument that he has a fiduciary responsibility to minimize any scrutiny or retaliation that could affect The Post or his broader media empire. Kara Swisher: Yes. Geoff Bennett: I mean, what do you say to that argument? Kara Swisher: Well, there's only one shareholder here, and that's Jeff Bezos. So he can do whatever he wants. So it's not like it's a public company, and there's other things. But other public companies have been very explicit that they're going to do fair and accountability coverage of the things. And I think some of the actions he's taken, including with Ann, who's an amazing Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist, I don't think Jeff had anything to do with this decision. I think it was done by David Shipley. But it's in this mood of not poking the bear, I think, the bear being Trump or Jeff Bezos. I don't know which one they're not trying to poke. But what happened to The Post was, Jeff bought it in 2013 and did a lot of stuff that improved it, but they never really figured out what to do post the first Trump era, which gave a bump to a lot of people. And so, in many ways, it's his fault of where it is. And now he's doing things that are making it worse. And I'm not sure why, right? I'm not sure what's happening with him. And I think he's — again, he's been a very good owner until recently, I would say. And now he just doesn't — I'd like to know why he wants to own it, what his plans are. The plans that they have outlined seem preposterous, really. I don't know what else to say. He's a very good businessperson, but a lot of these ideas are really an antithesis of what an independent newspaper should be. And I don't mean to stay in the past. And The Post has a storied history. I'm a journalist who's blown up a lot of things. I believe in changing and shifting. But you have to come up with something that preserves the integrity of The Post and at the same time makes it into a pretty good business. Geoff Bennett: Are there lessons The Post could learn from The New York Times' multimedia diversification… Kara Swisher: Yes. Geoff Bennett: … or from the rise of digital native outlets like Axios or Substack or Semafor? The list goes on. Kara Swisher: Well, I don't mean to be rude, but I did the first one, which was called AllThingsD at The Wall Street… Geoff Bennett: That's right. Yes. Kara Swisher: We — Walt and I — Walt Mossberg were the O.G. of all this stuff. It's funny when it's like, oh, this is new. I'm like, no, we did it a long time ago, because we did see what was coming and the importance of digitization of media and how the consumer had changed really drastically. And we also supplemented it by having a conference that was highly lucrative that could pay the bills too, because news is hard. Advertising is tougher. Some people have done subscriptions really well. Like, The Information does great journalism and does subscriptions. Other things rely on advertising, like we did at AllThingsD, or sponsorship like we did at the Code Conferences. There's all kinds of things you could look at, and The New York Times is one way of doing it. They do everything, they cook everything internally, right? But they did an important diversification. News is not the driver of the growth of The New York Times right now. It's Wordle. It's cooking. It's sports. It's all kinds of things. And that's important, for a news organization to have multiple revenue streams around it, especially as people, especially young people, go off and get things from TikTok or Instagram or wherever they happen — or YouTube, for example, has become critically important in the TV watching space. And so The Post hasn't really done anything. They don't have a podcast division to speak of. Other companies have done a really good job at that, and it can be very lucrative. I have some ideas, which I will outline if I get a meeting with Jeff. I have known him for — I knew — I met Jeff before he was a billionaire, when he first started Amazon. He's a wonderful entrepreneur. And I think he has to understand that maybe where he is today is not where he was and that he may not be the correct owner for this thing. That's all. I just want to talk to you about it and understand why he wants to own it if he continues to do these things that are causing a huge amount of people to leave, very — a huge amount of talent. And that's not — that's hard to get back. So I have some ideas of different structures, financial structures, the way you could do it, and I'm sure other people do. Geoff Bennett: Well, if you could redesign the current media ecosystem to better serve the public in this polarized… Kara Swisher: Yes. Geoff Bennett: … fractured and fast-paced era, what would you prioritize, especially since, after this last election, we learned to the degree to which legacy media has limited reach and limited influence? Kara Swisher: Yes. Well, that's been happening for a long time. It's something I warned of in my book and many — for years and years, I wrote this column. I'm like, everything that — the thing I said over and over again is, everything that can be digitized will be digitized and it was, right? This was at the beginning of my career. And I think one of the things they have to recognize is, where is the audience? The audience has taken control of the media. And it's not giving it back any time soon. So you go where they are going, you try to create things they want to consume. It doesn't have to be light. It doesn't have to — there's a terrible word in media, make it snackable. I think that's the worst thing I have ever heard in my life. But make it interesting. I mean, I have a million ideas of what you can do and how you could structure it so it's more protected. But being at the mercy and kindness of billionaires, good luck with that. I'm sorry. It's — maybe a lot of billionaires, so none of them have control, but a single billionaire? I don't care how you slice it. And I don't know how nice that billionaire is. It's never going to end well. It just isn't. Geoff Bennett: Kara Swisher, thanks for joining us. We deeply appreciate it.

Title: Quest Pro Is Now Officially Discontinued
URL: https://www.uploadvr.com/quest-pro-officially-discontinued/
Time Published: 2025-01-06T23:18:33Z
Full Content:
Quest Pro is no longer available to buy from Meta, though stock is still available at some retailers. Meta announced the retirement of both Quest 2 and Quest Pro at its Connect conference back in September, saying that the two headsets will no longer be available when stock runs out or at the end of the year, whichever comes first. For Quest 2, stock ran out within a few weeks of Connect. For Quest Pro, it appears the other clause applied. With the arrival of the new year, the headset's page on Meta's website has been replaced with a "Meta Quest Pro is no longer available" notice, alongside an image and price of Quest 3, Meta's new highest-end offering. With Quest 2, Quest Pro, and the 128GB model of Quest 3 gone, Meta's headset lineup has been simplified to: After Quest 2 became the first mainstream VR headset, Meta hoped it could build on this success by introducing a high-end Quest to serve enthusiasts and businesses. Quest Pro launched in late 2022 at $1500. It featured Meta's first pancake lenses, QD-LCD displays with Mini-LED local dimming, eye tracking, face tracking, a curved battery in the rear of the strap, and the ringless self-tracking Touch Pro controllers. In many ways Quest Pro was a pioneering headset. But in others it was severely lacking, given its price. By the time Quest Pro launched, leaks of a Quest 3 arriving a year later with a twice as powerful GPU at half the price had already emerged, severely dampening the headset's value proposition. Further, Quest Pro's underwhelming resolution, grainy passthrough, lack of ability to generate a scene mesh for mixed reality, and Meta’s cartoonish avatars not being detailed enough to do the face tracking sensors justice led to mixed-at-best reviews. Just four months after Quest Pro launched Meta cut its price from $1500 to $1000. This kind of price cut so soon after launch was unprecedented, and strongly suggests the headset vastly missed its launch sales targets. By around a year after launch Meta was giving away Quest Pro headsets to Roblox creators, when giving them a Quest 2 would have been perfectly fine. And last year Meta removed the whiteboard, which was designed around the pressure-sensitive stylus tips of Quest Pro's controllers, from Horizon Workrooms. Multiple developers have told UploadVR they see only a tiny fraction of their user base on Quest Pro. As such, almost no Quest game developers took the time to add support for its eye-tracked foveated rendering. With Quest Pro off the market, Meta no longer sells any headsets with eye tracking or face tracking. It's possible one of its Horizon OS partners, such as ASUS or Lenovo, will release a headset with these features some time later this year, and we'll keep a close eye on those companies for any signs of that happening.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The artificial intelligence theme has gripped the market for some time now, with many stocks benefiting nicely from the mania and providing big gains for investors. And in 2025, the theme is looking to be powerful yet again given the increasing adoption and red-hot demand we’ve heard about from companies in their quarterly updates. Several stocks, including Palantir PLTR, Broadcom AVGO, and, of course, Nvidia NVDA, look to have a strong year on the back of their AI-related offerings and services. Let’s take a closer look at each. Broadcom has quickly risen to the top concerning AI players, with its latest set of quarterly results fully confirming robust demand. Its FY24 has just ended, with annual revenue of $51.6 billion reflecting a new record and growing 44% year-over-year on the back of strong demand for its solutions. Impressively, record annual semiconductor revenue of $30.1 billion in FY24 was driven by its leading AI XPUs, with AI revenue overall growing 220% year-over-year. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s sales on a quarterly basis. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Broadcom’s earnings outlook has also shifted positively across the board following the latest set of results, landing the stock into a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Its next quarterly results are scheduled for March, with early consensus expectations alluding to 36% EPS growth on 22% higher sales. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Palantir’s robust share performance has been fueled by the AI frenzy, with the company’s latest set of quarterly results pleasing investors in a big way. The strong results and favorable commentary have caused analysts to raise their earnings expectations, with the stock sporting a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The company’s sales have snowballed thanks to strong AI demand, with sales of $726 million throughout its latest period growing 30% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. As shown below, PLTR’s sales have consistently grown sequentially over the years. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Investor-favorite Nvidia continues to fire on all cylinders, with its Data Center results regularly blowing away expectations and posting big year-over-year growth. Like those above, its earnings outlook has brightened nicely over recent months, with positive revisions regularly hitting the tape following quarterly prints. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research As shown below, the Data Center results have been notably bullish, with the most recent beat totaling a sizable $1.8 billion amid another period of scorching-hot demand. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Jensen Huang, CEO, wrapped up the latest set of quarterly results with a bullish statement: “The age of AI is in full steam, propelling a global shift to NVIDIA computing. Demand for Hopper and anticipation for Blackwell — in full production — are incredible as foundation model makers scale pretraining, post-training and inference.” Bottom Line The AI-frenzy isn’t going anywhere anytime soon, with demand expected to remain red-hot as more increasingly adopt the technology. And for those looking for exposure in 2025, all three stocks above – Palantir PLTR, Broadcom AVGO, and, of course, Nvidia NVDA – are prime selections, with each sporting a positive earnings outlook.

Title: Sierra Space CEO leaves, as $5 billion company pushes to launch space plane

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Sierra Space CEO Tom Vice has left the company, CNBC confirmed Monday. In a statement, Sierra Space said Vice retired Dec. 31. Chairman Fatih Ozmen will serve as interim CEO, with Eren Ozmen as president. “After three and half years in the role, Tom Vice has retired as Sierra Space CEO as of the end of 2024 — we thank him for his leadership and wish him well in his retirement,” a Sierra Space spokesperson said in a statement. Spun out of aerospace contractor Sierra Nevada Corporation, or SNC, in 2021, Sierra is one of the most valuable private U.S. companies in the burgeoning space sector, most recently valued at more than $5 billion. But Sierra Space has struggled to launch the first mission of its reusable cargo space plane called Dream Chaser, which is key to the company establishing itself as a major player in the industry. Vice was named CEO of Sierra Space in 2021, a few months after SNC owners Fatih and Eren Ozmen spun out the company — with investors including General Atlantic, Coatue, BlackRock and AE Industrial Partners. Vice was previously the CEO of Aerion Supersonic, a startup that planned to build high-speed business jets and that shut down in April 2021. The first Dream Chaser vehicle was supposed to debut by 2021. But even in 2024, the space plane, named Tenacity, was not ready when United Launch Alliance’s Vulcan rocket, its ride to space, needed to launch. Dream Chaser has won NASA contracts to fly seven cargo missions to and from the International Space Station. Sierra Space said Tenacity is targeting a launch no earlier than May. The company has continued to develop its inflatable space station technology, as well as expand into a product line of satellite buses after winning a high-profile $740 million Pentagon contract last year. Sierra Space saw layoffs during Vice’s tenure, as well as turnover in a number of senior executive roles. But in 2024, Vice spoke repeatedly of Sierra Space’s plan to go public, outlining a tentative path to IPO as soon as late 2025. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: Why Is Geron Corporation (GERN) the Best Long-Term Penny Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 12 Best Long-Term Penny Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Geron Corporation (NASDAQ:GERN) stands against the other best long-term penny stocks to buy. On December 3rd, Bob Kaynor, CFA, Head of US Small & Midcap Equities at Schroders, provided a comprehensive outlook for small-cap stocks in 2025, emphasizing their potential as a cost-effective investment in the robust US economy. He mentioned that the economy has shown resilience post-pandemic, bolstered by fiscal stimulus from the Biden Administration through significant legislation like the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). This recovery is primarily driven by strong consumer spending and a favorable labor market. In this robust environment while large-cap equities may appear expensive and have likely priced in much of the anticipated growth, small and mid-cap stocks remain relatively undervalued. This presents an opportunity for investors to gain exposure to domestic economic strength without incurring high costs. Kaynor identified several trends, which he believes could enhance the performance of small and mid-cap stocks in 2025. He pointed out that following a downturn in 2022 and 2023 due to recession fears and high valuations, M&A activity is now rebounding. This resurgence is expected to benefit small-cap stocks as they often become acquisition targets. Additionally, increased IPO activity can generate interest and optimism in the small-cap sector. Moreover, the ongoing and anticipated decline in interest rates starting late 2024 is expected to reduce borrowing costs for small-cap companies, which typically rely on short-term financing. This environment is historically favorable for small caps, particularly when inflation stabilizes between 1% and 3%. Kaynor also noted that the service sector of the market is expanding. The services sector not only forms a significant portion of the GDP but also favors small-cap companies primarily those operating within this space. Moreover, trends like reshoring are enabling small firms to become reliable suppliers for larger corporations. He expects that increased CapEx driven by automation and government support in sectors like semiconductors will likely correlate with revenue growth for small caps, further enhancing their investment appeal next year. Kaynor noted that Wall Street analysts predict a substantial rebound in earnings for small caps beginning in late 2024, with expectations that their growth will outpace large caps throughout most of 2025. A close-up of a laboratory technician in a laboratory, measuring a newly developed biopharmaceutical drug. To curate the list of the 12 best long-term penny stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we used the Finviz stock screener and Seeking Alpha. Using the screener we got an initial list of penny stocks (trading under $5) with more than 20% 5-year sales growth. Next, we cross-checked each stock for 5-year sales growth from Seeking Alpha. Lastly, we ranked these stocks based on the number of hedge fund holders sourced from Insider Monkey’s Q3 2024 hedge funds database. Please note that the stock prices were recorded on December 31, 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Stock Price: $3.54 5-Year Sales Growth: 113.54% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29 Geron Corporation (NASDAQ:GERN) is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing innovative treatments for blood cancers. Its flagship product, RYTELO, is a first-in-class telomerase inhibitor that has received FDA approval for treating certain adult patients suffering from lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (LR-MDS) with transfusion-dependent anemia. This approval marks it as the only company with an oligonucleotide telomerase inhibitor available in the United States. During the fiscal third quarter of 2024, Geron Corporation (NASDAQ:GERN) reported a net product revenue of $28.2 million from RYTELO, marking a successful first full quarter since its launch. As another important highlight for the quarter, management completed financing transactions to bolster its cash position. This included a synthetic royalty agreement with Royalty Pharma, providing $125 million in exchange for tiered royalty payments, and a 5-year senior term loan agreement with Pharmakon for up to $250 million. After its successful launch in the US, management is waiting for the review of RYTELO's MAA in lower-risk MDS by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). If the regulatory approval is granted it plans to launch RYTELO in select EU markets starting in 2026. Overall, GERN ranks first on our list of best long-term penny stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of GERN to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GERN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

In a statement, Sierra Space said Vice retired Dec. 31. Chairman Fatih Ozmen will serve as interim CEO, with Eren Ozmen as president. "After three and half years in the role, Tom Vice has retired as Sierra Space CEO as of the end of 2024 — we thank him for his leadership and wish him well in his retirement," a Sierra Space spokesperson said in a statement. Spun out of aerospace contractor Sierra Nevada Corporation, or SNC, in 2021, Sierra is one of the most valuable private U.S. companies in the burgeoning space sector, most recently valued at more than $5 billion. But Sierra Space has struggled to launch the first mission of its reusable cargo space plane called Dream Chaser, which is key to the company establishing itself as a major player in the industry. Vice was named CEO of Sierra Space in 2021, a few months after SNC owners Fatih and Eren Ozmen spun out the company — with investors including General Atlantic, Coatue, BlackRock and AE Industrial Partners. Vice was previously the CEO of Aerion Supersonic, a startup that planned to build high-speed business jets and that shut down in April 2021. The first Dream Chaser vehicle was supposed to debut by 2021. But even in 2024, the space plane, named Tenacity, was not ready when United Launch Alliance's Vulcan rocket, its ride to space, needed to launch. Dream Chaser has won NASA contracts to fly seven cargo missions to and from the International Space Station. Sierra Space said Tenacity is targeting a launch no earlier than May. The company has continued to develop its inflatable space station technology, as well as expand into a product line of satellite buses after winning a high-profile $740 million Pentagon contract last year. Sierra Space saw layoffs during Vice's tenure, as well as turnover in a number of senior executive roles. But in 2024, Vice spoke repeatedly of Sierra Space's plan to go public, outlining a tentative path to IPO as soon as late 2025. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: Nvidia Stock Pops 4%—On Track For Record Close Ahead Of Jensen Huang CES Keynote

Nvidia added some $140 billion in market value Monday ahead of a key speech from its centibillionaire CEO Jensen Huang, briefly reclaiming the mantle as the most valuable company on earth for the unquestioned leader of the generative artificial intelligence wave. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivers a speech last June. Shares of Nvidia climbed 3.4% to $149.43 per share, besting their previous record close of $148.88 set Nov. 7. The Monday surge sent Nvidia’s market capitalization to as high as $3.73 trillion, briefly eclipsing the market cap of Apple before the iPhone maker narrowly took back its title later in the afternoon — Nvidia is less than $40 billion away from its first market close as the world’s highest valued company since Nov. 25, according to YCharts data. The Nvidia rally came amid a broader rally in U.S. technology stocks — the tech-heavy Nasdaq rose more than 1% to a 2025 high — and a global spike in share prices of other players in the semiconductor chip industry, as shares of Netherlands-based ASML, Taiwan-based TSMC and UK-based Arm Holdings gained at least 4% apiece. Semiconductor stocks received a boost from record fourth quarter revenue data from the Taiwanese manufacturer Foxconn, a bullish signal for to-be-reported Q4 data for Nvidia and other AI companies. Also helping Nvidia and its peers was the Washington Post reporting President-elect Donald Trump’s tariffs will initially target sectors other than semiconductors, good news for an industry heavily reliant on the global supply chain for designing and manufacturing the chips powering technology from iPhones to ChatGPT, OpenAI’s generative AI chatbot (Trump denied the report). Huang will deliver Monday’s keynote address at the CES 2025 technology conference beginning at approximately 6:30 p.m. EST. The speech should include “reassuring updates” on the company’s Blackwell and Rubin graphics processing unit systems, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya wrote in a recent note to clients, predicting Huang’s speech will be a “positive catalyst” for the stock. Rosenblatt analysts Kevin Cassidy and Hans Mosesmann concurred they expect to see a “bullish Jensen Huang” on Monday, laying out a case for Nvidia’s competitive advantage in addressing the full-stack of technology needed to power AI. Nvidia designs a majority of the custom semiconductor chips powering generative AI systems, and its notable clientele includes Amazon, Meta, OpenAI and Elon Musk’s xAI. Founded in 1993 by Huang and two other engineers, Nvidia spent much of its existence best known for its video games graphics business before rising to fame as the face of the 2020s AI boom. No company has ever achieved a $4 trillion valuation, though Apple and Nvidia are both within 10% of hitting the milestone. 786%. That’s how much Nvidia’s share price has risen since Nov. 30, 2022, the launch of ChatGPT. An $1,000 investment in Nvidia at that time is now worth nearly $9,000. Huang’s net worth rose by about $5 billion Monday, the third most of any billionaire, according to our real-time net worth tracker. Huang’s $131 billion fortune makes him the ninth-richest person on the planet, rising more than twentyfold over the last five years. Most of Huang’s net worth comes from his 3.5% stake in Nvidia, the largest of any individual. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Travel Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB)) stands against other best travel stocks to buy right now. According to a report by UN Tourism published on September 19, international tourism revived back 96% of the pre-pandemic levels during the first seven months of 2024. Around 790 million tourists were traveling around the globe during the said time, which is 11% greater than that in 2023 but still 4% less than in 2019. As per the report, the key drivers of this growth have been a strong demand for travel in Europe and also the re-opening of markets in the Asia Pacific region. The Secretary-General of UN Tourism, Zurab Pololikashvili noted that the growth in international tourism has been in line with the projections made by the department. He mentioned that the sector is on its way to achieving full recovery from the biggest crises in history and that too in an environment of economic and geopolitical challenges. Pololikashvili suggested that the recovery highlights the growing demand for international tourism planning and managing companies to cater to the revival in a way that benefits the communities through inclusive and sustainable policies. In addition, to an increase in tourism, the air connections have also improved along with an easing in visa restrictions. READ ALSO: 10 Best Entertainment Stocks To Buy According to Analysts and 11 Best Computer Hardware Stocks to Invest in Right Now. The report also highlighted that increased air connectivity and visa facilitation have supported the recovery. Data collected by the UN World Tourism Barometer showed that the Middle East remained the strongest region relative to others as it surpassed the 2019 levels by 26% during the first seven months of 2024. Moreover, Africa also remained strong and hosted 7% more tourists than in 2019. On the other hand, Europe and the Americas which host the most tourists combined recovered 99% and 97%, respectively. Despite the robust growth, certain challenges remain unaddressed including geopolitical challenges, extreme climate conditions, and high inflation in certain regions of the world. Regardless, the report anticipates continued recovery and expects strong revenue from international tourism to persist for a long period. To compile the list of the 10 best travel stocks to buy right now, we used the Finviz stock screener. Using the screener we aggregated a list of travel services stocks sorted by market capitalization. Next, we ranked these stocks based on the number of hedge fund holders as per Insider Monkey’s third-quarter 2024 database. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A vacation home luxury bedroom setup with stunning decor showing a desired getaway experience. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 54 Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) is an international online platform that connects people looking for places to stay with those who have space to rent out. Guests can browse host listings and book a place to stay directly through the Airbnb website or app. Unlike traditional hotels, the company offers a wide variety of accommodations, catering to different preferences and budgets. This includes everything from private rooms in someone’s home to entire houses. The company has been actively upgrading its platform to streamline the process of listing and booking, thereby enhancing the overall user experience. Over the past three years, Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) has launched more than 535 new features to improve user experience. Recent upgrades include personalized app features and enhanced listing quality, with over 300,000 low-quality listings removed to ensure better guest experiences. Moreover, the company has rolled out more than 50 upgrades in 2024 alone. These efforts have turned out to be fruitful as during the fiscal third quarter of 2024, the company witnessed an increase in bookings through the Airbnb app, which now accounts for 58% of total nights booked, up from 53% last year. The company generated $3.7 billion in revenue, marking a 10% increase compared to the same quarter last year. This growth was attributed to a steady rise in nights and experiences booked, which totaled 123 million for the quarter. Management noted that it is experiencing a rise in first-time bookers, particularly among young travelers. Looking ahead to Q4, Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) anticipates continued growth in bookings despite potential challenges from tougher year-over-year comparisons. The company plans to introduce more features aimed at enhancing user experience and expanding its market presence globally. Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) declined in the period on concerns around a weaker demand outlook for the quarter as well as increasing marketing spend planned for the second half of 2024, pressuring near-term margins. Given the company’s exposure to the health of the consumer and related willingness to spend on leisure travel, we believe it’s important to take a step back to see the larger picture. Global accommodations have been and will likely continue to be a mid-single-digit growth market. Still, as private rentals become increasingly mainstream and the dependability of those private listings improves, we would expect private rentals to continue to gain market share. We continue to see Airbnb as a likely double-digit revenue grower over the next five years, and with modest margin expansion, we could expect mid-to-high-teens earnings growth.” Overall, ABNB ranks 3rd on our list of best travel stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of ABNB to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ABNB but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Looking ahead, Carnival is optimistic about 2025, predicting continued growth with yield increases expected to surpass historical rates. Management is enhancing its destination strategy to attract more guests and increase global awareness of cruise travel.

Title: AST SpaceMobile Acquires Radio Spectrum for Cellular Satellite Service
URL: https://me.pcmag.com/en/networking/27730/ast-spacemobile-acquires-radio-spectrum-for-cellular-satellite-service

AST SpaceMobile, a rival to SpaceX's cellular Starlink business, has reached a deal to access its own slice of radio spectrum to power satellite communications for phones. AST SpaceMobile secured the radio spectrum from Ligado Networks, which is also working on cellular satellite services with partners such as Viasat and Skylo. But on Monday, Ligado filed for bankruptcy and entered into a spectrum deal with AST for about $113 million in stock. In return, AST gains the spectrum rights to a 45MHz block of Ligado’s L-band spectrum in the US and Canadian markets for 80+ years. The company is hailing the announcement as a win since it promises to bolster AST’s ability to beam satellite data to phones through the additional radio bands. It also means AST can offer its cellular satellite services independently, without always relying on its carrier partners. In the US, AST has reached deals with AT&T and Verizon to one day beam satellite connectivity to customer phones, but through their own licensed radio spectrum. AST didn’t go into details, but it expects the Ligado deal to help it increase its capacity “while enabling peak data transmission speeds up to 120Mbps to everyday smartphones everywhere in the continental United States.” On the downside, AST may need to redesign its BlueBird satellites to harness the L-band spectrum, according to satellite industry analyst Tim Farrar, who added that older phones typically don’t support L-band reception. AST launched its first batch of BlueBird satellites into Earth’s orbit in September. But the company still needs to launch dozens of additional satellites before it can begin offering full coverage to US customers. In addition, AST still needs to receive regulatory approval to both test and commercially operate such services in the US. In the meantime, the company’s deal with Ligado is expected to close during the first half of 2025. AST also notes Ligado could receive $550 million from the deal, depending on certain closing conditions. In addition, AST SpaceMobile would pay about $80 million per year for spectrum usage rights and “provide Ligado with long-term net revenue sharing rights.” I've been working as a journalist for over 15 years—I got my start as a schools and cities reporter in Kansas City and joined PCMag in 2017.

Title: Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ): Harnessing 5G and AI Innovation for Enterprise Solutions

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks Under $50 According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) stands against the other AI stocks under $50. Franklin Mutual's Katrina Dudley appeared on CNBC on December 31 to discuss whether the sectors that powered the market's gains in 2024 will continue to lead the way in 2025, particularly AI within the tech and communications sectors. Companies in these sectors, especially the MAG7 stocks, have experienced remarkable performance over the past year. She pointed out that alongside traditional tech stocks, companies providing essential infrastructure are crucial for supporting the rapid expansion of AI technologies. She expressed strong optimism about AI's continued influence, stating that it represents a secular theme likely to propel the tech sector forward in the coming year. When addressing concerns about market valuations, Dudley reiterated that high valuations, such as the S&P 500 trading at ~22 times earnings, should not deter investors. Instead, she argued that these valuations reflect robust earnings growth among technology companies, distinguishing this phase from past market bubbles. The network effects inherent in AI-driven companies contribute to their returns, suggesting that if these firms can exceed earnings expectations, their valuations could become more favorable over time. However, she cautioned that consistent performance is critical. Any failure to deliver on earnings growth could pose risks in a high-valuation environment. Turning her attention to lagging sectors, Dudley discussed healthcare as an area ripe for AI-driven transformation. She noted that while healthcare has significant upside potential due to demographic trends, some healthcare service providers faced challenges in 2024 due to rising costs and consumer pushback against high pricing. The increased focus on transparency in healthcare pricing may benefit consumers but could complicate profitability for companies. She suggested that advancements in AI technology are enhancing productivity within pharmaceutical research and development. Although immediate benefits may not be visible, she believes that AI's long-term impact on productivity will make healthcare an increasingly attractive sector for investment. Dudley's insights underscore the transformative potential of AI across both tech and healthcare sectors. Methodology We first sifted through internet lists to compile a list of the top AI stocks under $50. We then selected the 12 stocks with high analysts' upside potential and that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of analysts' upside potential (at least 10%), as of January 2. We've also added the hedge fund sentiment for each stock which was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Although Sinéad de Valera, who died 50 years ago on January 7th, is probably mainly remembered as the wife of Eamon de Valera, she was an Irish-language activist for many years, a highly respected teacher for the Gaelic League, and proved a prolific author of children’s books in later life. She was also an actor and even considered a career on the stage at one time. She was born Jane (usually called Jennie) Flanagan on June 1st, 1878, in Balbriggan, Co Dublin, one of four children of Laurence Flanagan, a carpenter, and Margaret Byrne. The family moved to Phibsborough in Dublin when she was seven as her father was made clerk of works for the building of St Peter’s Church there. Following local schooling, she attended Baggot Street Teacher Training College from where she graduated as a national-school teacher. Her teaching career began in Edenderry, Co Offaly, and continued at Francis Xavier School, Lower Dorset Street, which she had herself attended. She developed a great interest in the Irish language, joining the Gaelic League, adopting Sinéad Ní Fhlannagáin as her name and frequently visiting the Mayo Gaeltacht. As a member of the Gaelic League and of Maud Gonne’s Inghinidhe na hÉireann, she became involved in amateur dramatics. A play she performed in was The Tinker and the Fairy by Douglas Hyde. According to Frances Clarke, who wrote the entry on her in the Dictionary of Irish Biography, she asked George Moore, in whose garden on Ely Place the play had been performed, if she should consider a career in acting but he advised her against it. Becoming fluent in Irish, she gave language classes at the Gaelic League college on Parnell Square. One of her pupils was Eamon de Valera, then a teacher of maths. In the summer of 1909, they attended the Irish college at Tourmakeady, Co Mayo, and were married the following January in St Paul’s Church on Arran Quay; he was 28 and she 32. She gave up her career to look after their family of five sons and two daughters. In February 1936, their son Brian, then aged 20, was killed in a riding accident in the Phoenix Park. After the Easter Rising, with her husband jailed and with no financial income, she moved back to her family home with some of her children (the others were sent to her sister in Balbriggan) and cared for her invalid sister, who died in August, and her mother, who died the following January. When circumstances improved, the de Valera family settled in Greystones, Co Wicklow, but she saw little of her husband in the 1917-23 period as he was on the run, in prison or fundraising in America. Michael Collins frequently visited her in Greystones and provided money and support for her and her family. Although she wanted to avoid public life, she was persuaded by Harry Boland to join de Valera in America in 1920, travelling there on a false passport provided by Collins. She spent six weeks there but saw little of her husband because of his busy schedule and was relieved to return home. She was rumoured to be pro-Treaty, according to Frances Clarke, but never spoke publicly about political events. The break with Collins was said to have aggrieved her particularly, as he had been so good to her during her husband’s absences. When her family were reared, she turned to writing and produced no fewer than 31 books in Irish and in English. She adapted old stories and folktales from Irish, translated European fairytales into Irish and wrote plays and poems for children. Among her works were Coinneal na Nodlag agus Sgéalta Eile (1944), Áilleacht agus an Beithideach (1946), The Emerald Ring and Other Irish Fairy Stories (1951), The Stolen Child and Other Stories (1961), The Four-Leafed Shamrock (1964) and The Miser’s Gold (1970). She maintained her interest in Irish and attended Gaelic League functions and children’s drama competitions. A quiet, shy and retiring person, she shunned the limelight and during the years of her husband’s presidency (1959-73), she made few public appearances and her youngest son, Terry, who wrote a memoir, said she did not enjoy living in Áras an Uachtaráin. After the end of the presidency, they both moved into Linden Convalescent Home in Blackrock, where she died aged 96 on the day before what would have been their 65th wedding anniversary. Her husband died a little under eight months later and they are buried with their son Brian in Glasnevin Cemetery. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks on Investors’ Radar In January 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks on investors’ radar in January 2025. Drew Pettit, U.S. equity strategist at Citi Research, said in a latest program on CNBC that he believes the AI growth story is still intact moving ahead in 2025. However, the analyst believes a lot of positive news is already “priced in.” He also mentioned the key areas that can benefit this year. “I think the fundamental stories, at least for the pick-and-shovels names, continue. But where we think the trade is actually going to broaden out, and honestly, it has since mid-year, is into some of the users of AI. So, think about car companies that do autonomous driving or software companies putting that into their programs themselves, and even to some of the more cyclical names that, on the back end, can get some more productivity gains. So yes, the picks-and-shovels, the enablers of the trade, were attractive for the most part in 2024. We think AI continues to broaden out.” The analyst said he has done some “reverse DCF work” and believes there are many companies that are mispriced and many that have the good news around them already priced in. READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we picked 10 AI stocks that analysts are talking about this month. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 158 Andy Swan from LikeFolio‬ explained during a latest program on Schwab Network why he believes Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) had a strong holiday shopping season: “Once we saw the September keynote and the reaction that consumers had to that keynote event, we knew that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was setting up for a really good holiday season. And so far, you know, everything that we’re seeing points to that being true. Web visits for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are up year-over-year by a pretty decent margin, but when we break it down by product category and look, you know, at the overall demand for each of these types of products, you really get the sense that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), going into the Christmas holiday gift-giving season, just really has something for everyone on your list. If you want to spend $499, you can get an iPad Mini that is extraordinarily popular. The pencil looks like it’s getting added on at a tremendous clip, which is a high-margin item for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). You know, if you want to spend $129, you can get AirPods for your friend or for your niece or whatever it is, and people are doing so in droves. You know, iPad searches up 26%, AirPods and iPhone up 15-16%. The only real whiff we see on the list is the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) Watch.” Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is desperately in need of new catalysts. The company’s revenue in China fell 8% in fiscal year 2024, following a 2% decline the previous year. The Chinese market accounts for about 15% of Apple’s total revenue, so this downtrend cannot be ignored. Investors had hopes from the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, but so far its performance has been weak. Vision Pro faces tough competition from Meta’s $500 Quest and the more affordable Quest 3S, making it hard to justify its $3,500 price tag. The failure of Apple’s HomePod, unable to compete with Amazon’s and Google’s lower-priced offerings, further highlights the challenges in this market. Apple’s iPhone 16 has not shown promising growth prospects yet and investors are still in a wait-and-see mode on the AI platform. While the company is projected to achieve 9.5% EPS growth this fiscal year and 12.3% growth in the next, much of this growth is already priced in, as the stock trades at nearly 30 times the expected EPS for the fiscal year ending September 2026. Parnassus Growth Equity Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares rose during the quarter, making our underweight position a relative detractor. Investors reacted positively to the new iPhone 16 lineup and its advanced features, including generative artificial intelligence, greater durability and increased processing power.” Overall, AAPL ranks 4th on our list of AI stocks on investors’ radar in January 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Stock market data on a laptop screen. Photo by Alesia Kozik Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 60 Bryn Talkington from Requisite Capital Management explained on CNBC why she likes Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) stock. “Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL), to me, as a story, is more the parts are greater than the sum. For next quarter earnings, which are February of 2025, the Street’s looking for 10% and 14% revenue and earnings growth. But underneath the hood, their infrastructure solutions group is where people are buying Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL)—that is their networking, their servers, and that’s where they’re getting data center growth. They had 38% growth. So, when I look at this company, you’re going to continue to see that ISG group be a larger and larger part of the earnings. Right now, it’s about 40%.” In the most recently reported quarter, Dell posted mixed results with revenue missing expectations. What stands out is Dell’s Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG), which posted an impressive 34% year-over-year growth, reaching $11.4 billion in revenue. The server business rose a whopping 58% increase YoY to $7.4 billion. Dell Tech Inc (NYSE:DELL) experienced a shift in AI server demand toward the next-generation Blackwell architecture. Dell Tech Inc (NYSE:DELL)’s management highlighted that there was a dramatic shift in orders toward Nvidia’s (NVDA) Blackwell-based systems during Q3, which impacted short-term shipments as these products ramp up production. This shift shows Dell Tech Inc (NYSE:DELL)’s competitive position, as customers are willing to wait for the latest tech solutions. Dell secured $3.6 billion in AI server orders this quarter, an 11% increase from the previous quarter. Dell Tech Inc (NYSE:DELL) also signed over 2,000 enterprise customers for their AI solutions. Carillon Scout Mid Cap Fund stated the following regarding Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) was a top contributor despite reporting disappointing first-quarter earnings results, because investors looked through the near-term disappointment and expected strong growth from AI-related servers and personal computers. We expect Dell to participate in the growth of artificial intelligence hardware, especially as enterprises invest more aggressively. We like the company’s depth and breadth of products and services, as well as its focus on keeping costs low.” Overall, DELL ranks 9th on our list of AI stocks on investors’ radar in January 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of DELL, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Farm Laws Reborn: “Dismantling Food Security”. Toxic Platter for India’s Farmers and Consumers
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/farm-laws-reborn-toxic-platter-india-farmers-consumers/5876540
Time Published: 2025-01-06T18:42:10Z
Full Content:
India could see an authoritarian central government with subordinate state governments under the control of corporate interests and international finance capital. So says the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), a coalition of 40+ farmers’ unions. It contends that the Union Government of India is proposing to undermine the federal rights of state governments by surrendering India’s food security and compromising its national sovereignty under the slogan ‘One Nation. One Market’. In a December 2024 press release, the All India Kisan Sabha (All India Farmers Union, AIKS) called for nationwide protests against attempts to bring back the three repealed farm laws. The AIKS said that the government has opted not to address any of the serious demands raised by the farmers’ movement, including legalising the minimum support price (MSP), increasing public investment in agriculture and boosting pro-farmer credit facilities. Like the SKM, the AIKS says there is an agenda to dismantle the power of the state governments. Proposed reforms to the agrifood sector seek to encroach upon the rights of state governments over agriculture, land, industry and markets — areas that fall under individual states as per the Constitution of India. Pivotal to this plan is the newly introduced draft National Policy Framework on Agriculture Marketing (NPFAM). The SKM states that the NPFAM, if implemented, will erode the federal rights of the state governments and ignore the interests of farmers, agricultural workers, petty producers and small traders since there is no provision to ensure an MSP and minimum wage to farmers and workers. The NPFAM essentially marks the return of the three farm laws that were repealed in late 2021 due to a year-long mass protest by farmers. The SKM states that the farmers’ movement sees through the plan to withdraw government support from agriculture and hand over farming and public food distribution to corporations led by Adani, Ambani, Tata, Cargill, Pepsi, Walmart, Bayer, Amazon and others. The main proposal of the NPFAM is a fundamental restructuring of the existing agricultural marketing system, proposing its transformation into a Unified National Market linked to a Value Chain Centric Infrastructure. The objective is the entry of corporate agribusiness and the conversion and integration (or eradication) of registered state-managed wholesale markets (mandis, overseen by state-regulated Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees, APMCs) and Grameen Haats (rural markets) with Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI). Reforms suggested in the NPFAM draft include the establishment of private wholesale markets, direct farm gate purchases by corporate processors and exporters, replacement of traditional market yards with corporate-controlled warehouses and silos and introducing a unified national market fee and trading license system. The draft proposes that big corporations can purchase produce directly from farmers, bypassing APMC market yards. Additionally, handing over storage infrastructure to private corporations eliminates a critical safety net for farmers during price volatility and may pave the way for corporate exploitation by denying farmers any space for bargaining prices. The NPFAM aims to integrate agricultural production and marketing in a way that prioritises corporate interests. It will integrate both the private and public sectors through advanced technologies, such as DPI and blockchain. NPFAM reforms propose deregulation, effectively allowing the private sector — specifically, corporate agribusinesses — to establish dominance over production, processing and marketing. We could see farmers produce raw materials that enter markets controlled by processing industries, trade houses and exporters, who in turn dictate the prices. The NPFAM fails to address provisions that would hold these corporate forces accountable. There is no mention of ensuring an MSP for farmers, which was a central recommendation of the National Commission on Farmers chaired by the late M S Swaminathan and currently a key issue in the national political discourse. That is no surprise because the corporate strategy is to procure produce at the cheapest rate and market it to ensure exorbitant profits. The stranglehold of big business houses is also evident in the suggestions for deepening financialisation via futures and option markets. This will also permit corporations and international finance capital to dominate and control the domestic food industry. The AIKS says that central government is creating a conducive atmosphere for the corporate loot of agriculture. It adds that it will fight tooth and nail the efforts by the government to hand Indian agriculture on a platter to transnational corporations. It demands that the government withdraw the NPFAM and engage in meaningful dialogue with farmers’ organisations and state governments. The three repealed farm laws would have facilitated neoliberal shock therapy to India’s agrifood sector. If it succeeds, the NPFAM will bring about what the laws intended to do. But first, state-supported infrastructure must be dismantled. As things currently stand, mandis are state-regulated marketplaces where farmers sell their produce, facilitating direct transactions with buyers and ensuring fair prices through auctions. Managed by the APMCs, mandis play a crucial role in connecting farmers to larger markets and providing essential infrastructure for agricultural trade. The Public Distribution System (PDS) is a government initiative aimed at ensuring food security for the underprivileged by distributing essential commodities at subsidised rates. Operated jointly by central and state governments, the PDS includes the Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS), ensuring focused assistance for those in need. The Food Corporation of India (FCI) is responsible for implementing food policies, including the procurement, storage, transport and distribution of food grains. By procuring grains at an MSP and maintaining a vast network of depots and Fair Price Shops, the FCI plays a vital role in maintaining food security and nutritional support across the country. Together, mandis, the PDS and the FCI form a comprehensive state-backed framework for supporting India’s agricultural economy and addressing food insecurity. However, the aim is for the state to withdraw from these areas and to let private interests capture the space left open. Indian agriculture has witnessed gross underinvestment over the years, whereby it is now wrongly depicted as a basket case and underperforming and ripe for a sell off to those very interests who had a stake in its underinvestment. The aim is to restructure India’s agri-food sector for the needs of global supply chains and markets. As independent cultivators are bankrupted, the goal is that land will eventually be amalgamated to facilitate large-scale industrial cultivation. Those who remain in farming will be absorbed into corporate supply chains and squeezed as they work on contracts dictated by large agribusiness and chain retailers. The FCI has historically been a stabilising force in India’s food procurement and distribution system, ensuring that (some) farmers receive fair prices through MSP while maintaining strategic food stocks. Once its role is diminished, the Indian government may find itself purchasing essential commodities from volatile (manipulated) international markets using its foreign exchange reserves; food sourced from the very corporations that have replaced the FCI (see chapters 4–7 of Food, Dependency and Dispossession: Resisting the New World Order). Companies like Bayer attempt to depict these developments as ‘modernising’ Indian agriculture and portray the sector as ‘backward’. However, such corporations cynically exploit notions of backwardness and modernisation to promote their financially lucrative agricultural practices and technologies in a bid to secure control of the sector. Prominent agricultural scientist M S Swaminathan (referred to earlier) highlighted that farmers’ incomes are declining due to inadequate pricing mechanisms and market access, rather than a lack of technological advancements. He advocated for a an MSP that is at least 50% above the cost of production to ensure farmers can sustain their livelihoods. The failure to implement this has contributed significantly to the ongoing agrarian crisis. This situation has led to widespread farmer distress and suicides, which he attributed largely to economic pressures rather than technological shortcomings. And this failure is a deliberate policy decision. Instead of ensuring that all farmers have reliable access to markets where they can sell their produce at fair prices, improving access to timely and affordable credit to prevent farmers from falling into debt traps and strengthening procurement policies and expanding the mandi, MSP and public distribution systems, we are witnessing a reversal. Farmers are being displaced through policies that intentionally render farming financially unviable. We also see policies aimed at facilitating the sale and consolidation of land for industrial agriculture and the undermining of rural communities and traditional farming practices. Additionally, there is a concerning rise in health issues as traditional, nutritious diets are increasingly replaced by unhealthy, ultra-processed foods or less nutrient-dense alternatives. If consumers want to see what the future may bring, look no further than countries reliant on the Western agrifood model. From cultivation to retail, a disease-causing system promoted and protected by corporate lobby groups like the International Life Sciences Institute and CropLife embedded in decision-making processes (both are already firmly established in India). A system that sees international finance firms like BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street, Fidelity and Capital Group investing in the global food giants that sicken and also in the pharmaceuticals sector that supposedly ‘cure’. A system handed over to agricultural land speculators, toxic agrochemical manufacturers and their proprietary hybridised seeds, global commodity traders and purveyors of junk food. India is on course to be a subsidiary of global capital at the expense of its local agricultural communities and farmers, its ecosystems, its food security, its (limited) democracy and the overall wellbeing of the population. Alternatively, MSPs via state procurement of essential crops and commodities could be extended to the likes of maize, cotton, oilseed and pulses. This would not only boost the nation’s health but also increase farmers’ incomes. At the moment, only farmers in certain states who produce rice and wheat are the main beneficiaries of government procurement at MSP. Instead of rolling back the role of the public sector and surrendering the system to foreign corporations, there is a need to further expand official procurement and public distribution. That would cost around 20% of the handouts (‘incentives’) from the public purse received by corporations and their super-rich owners (based on 2020-21 figures). During the 2020-21 farmers protest, a video that appeared on social media showed Ayush Sinha, a top government official, encouraging officers to “smash the heads of farmers” if they broke through the barricades placed on a highway. Since the farmers renewed their protest in early 2024, tear gas and water cannons have been used against farmers to break up protests and prevent them marching to Delhi. The authorities must show international finance and agri-capital that they are being tough on farmers. They need to demonstrate that they remain steadfast in defeating the farmers movement in order to attract FDI (maintain ‘market confidence’) and pave the way for a corporate-financial takeover of the sector. In late 2021, Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait stated that around 750 protesters had died during the year-long struggle. In summing up the situation, we may paraphrase renowned campaigner and environmentalist Aruna Rodrigues: It is a detailed horror tale in the making for India, handing over Indian sovereignty and food security to big business. There will come a time pretty soon — not something out there but imminent, unfolding even now — when we will pay the Cargills, Ambanis, Bill Gates, Walmarts (in the absence of national buffer food stocks) to send us food. We will finance borrowing from international markets to do it. A policy change to cash crops and the end to small-scale farmers, pushed aside by contract farming and GM crops. What is at stake is the integrity of India’s federal governance structure, its food security, the wellbeing of its farmers and farming communities and the overall health of the population. Meanwhile, the future remains uncertain for what has become a more fragmented farmers’ movement. Its capacity to regain momentum and draw in greater support from consumers and consumer groups against the neocolonial ambitions of global finance and foreign agricultural capital remains in question. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: Report -- 'The Cuts Will Be Deep': Washington Post to Lay Off Dozens of Staffers

The Washington Post will reportedly lay off dozens of its staffers in the next few days, the news coming after the publication caught flak for not endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris (D) during the presidential election that Donald Trump won in November. In his article published on Status, Oliver Darcy wrote Sunday that “the layoffs are slated to hit the Jeff Bezos-owned and Will Lewis-led newspaper’s business division, I’m told. One person familiar with the matter said that the cuts will be deep, impacting many dozens of employees.” Bezos has reportedly been shaking up the Post after it decided not to endorse Harris, according to Breitbart News. Darcy continued: The layoffs will surely deplete morale further inside the beleaguered newspaper, which has suffered a talent exodus over the last several weeks. As I reported earlier, star reporter Josh Dawsey will exit The Post for a job at The Wall Street Journal. His departure comes on the heels of other top staffers fleeing, including Matea Gold, Ashely Parker, Michael Scherer, Charles Lane, Tyler Pager, and Amanda Katz. The newspaper has been struggling financially and the issues were “exacerbated when Bezos blocked The Post’s planned endorsement of Kamala Harris ahead of the November election, a move that led to more than 250,000 readers canceling their subscriptions,” he added. In November, the Post‘s senior politics editor claimed the newspaper removed him, per Breitbart News. After his decision not to endorse Harris, Bezos offered Trump a “big congratulations” on his “extraordinary political comeback and decisive victory.” According to Breitbart News, Bezos, who founded Amazon, has large contracts with the U.S. government. Meanwhile, Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Ann Telnaes resigned from the Post and accused her editor of killing a drafted cartoon due to its mocking depiction of Bezos and Trump, Breitbart News reported Sunday: “I’ve worked for the Washington Post since 2008 as an editorial cartoonist. I have had editorial feedback and productive conversations — and some differences — about cartoons I have submitted for publication, but in all that time I’ve never had a cartoon killed because of who or what I chose to aim my pen at. Until now,” Telnaes said. Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting. Copyright © 2025 Breitbart

Stock prices for Snapchat and Instagram’s parent companies have jumped as chief competitor TikTok approaches its ban date Snapchat parent Snap Inc. and Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, saw their recent Wall Street hot streak continue Monday, as tech companies including Google-owned YouTube stand to benefit the most from TikTok’s looming ban set for Jan. 19. By midday Monday, Snap’s stock was up 3.4% to $12.38 per share. Those gains added to Snap’s recent run, with the company, led by CEO Evan Spiegel, seeing its stock price jump 15% in the past week. Snap’s stock was given a “buy” rating by Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris on Friday, with Morris projecting Snapchat added 8 million daily users between October and December. Those user gains would push Snapchat to 451 million daily users by the end of Q4. Snap is expected to share its Q4 report in early February. Meta, meanwhile, has enjoyed more modest gains — its stock price is up 2.7% on Monday, hitting $619.31 per share, and has increased 5.2% in the past week. And Alphabet, the parent company of Google and YouTube, has made similar gains. Alphabet’s stock is up 3% on Monday to $198.93 per share, and its share price is up about 4.5% in the past week. The recent gains for those tech giants indicates investors could be looking to put their money into platforms that would benefit from TikTok being booted from the U.S. The popular app, owned by Beijing-based Bytedance, is set to be banned from the States on Jan. 19 — one day before president-elect Donald Trump takes office. The TikTok ban was initially floated during Trump’s first administration, before ultimately being passed by Congress and signed into law by President Joe Biden in April. The chief concern U.S. lawmakers have with TikTok is that it doubles as a spyware app for the Chinese government; TikTok, according to Chinese law, is required to share user data with China’s communist government, if it is asked to do so. Trump has since changed his tune on supporting a TikTok ban, saying last year that he’d like to “save” the app. And last month, Trump reiterated he would like to keep TikTok in the U.S. He said he’d “take a look” at saving TikTok, noting he had a “warm spot” in his heart for it because it helped get young people to vote for him. TikTok has been scrambling to find a legal remedy to keep its app in the U.S. as its ban date approaches. In mid-December, The U.S. Supreme Court said it would listen to arguments from TikTok on why it should block the law behind the ban. That crucial hearing is set for Friday.

Nvidia stock surged 5% on Monday and was edging close to record highs as investors awaited CEO Jensen Huang's keynote speech. at the Consumer Electronics Show. Shares of Nvidia hit an intra-day high of $152.16, just shy of its record high of $152.89. Huang is scheduled to kick off CES with an opening speech on Monday at 6:30 p.m. PST in Las Vegas. Bank of America noted that Nvidia stock tends to surge around Jensen Huang's CES remarks. The stock jumped 6.4% on the day of Huang's CES speech in 2024, which was followed by an extended surge in the two days following his speech. "It was a monstrous Monday, with NVDA being the most notable move," Bank of America said in a recent note. "NVDA had been extremely range bound for the 4-5 months heading into it, and the buyside was obsessed with the inevitable cloud capex cliff." The bank alluded to the fact that Nvidia is facing a similar setup heading into this year's trade show as investors continue to worry about the possibility of an end to the AI capex boom. Meanwhile, Nvidia stock has traded in a sideways range for about six months. For Huang's upcoming CES speech, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya said the integration of AI into robotics could be a big topic of discussion. "We look for updates on Robotics strategy from silicon to software and emergence of 'physical AI' theme," Arya said, adding that he expects Nvidia to make "a strong push" into robotics. Other areas Arya is watching include Nvidia's launch of new PC gaming cards that will be variants of its next-generation AI chip architecture, Blackwell, and the potential for Nvidia to enter the PC market via an AI PC that would likely be made via a partnership but could also be a standalone Nvidia product. Arya is also looking for an update on Nvidia's data center business, specifically surrounding the ongoing ramp of Nvidia's Blackwell chips and upgraded variants expected to launch in the second half of the year, including the GB300 and B300. Finally, Arya said he expects a teaser from Nvidia on its Rubin AI GPU, which is scheduled to succeed the Blackwell chip in 2026. "While the big themes have already been mentioned in the media ahead of the event, we still see CES as a positive catalyst, re-asserting NVDA's platform dominance/opportunity in high-growth markets," Arya said. Analysts at Citi also have Nvidia stock on "positive catalyst watch" during this week's CES event. Arya rates Nvidia at "Buy" and calls it a "top pick" with a $190 price target, representing upside of 26% from current levels. Indices Commodities Currencies Stocks

Nvidia’s (NVDA-0.18%) shares climbed by close to 5% on Monday in anticipation of chief executive Jensen Huang’s keynote at the Consumer Electronics Show. The chipmaker is expected to make major artificial intelligence-focused product announcements at the annual Las Vegas trade show. Bank of America (BAC+0.10%) reiterated its “buy” rating on Nvidia in a note on Monday outlining its expectations for CES. “[W]e still see CES as a positive catalyst, re-asserting NVDA’s platform dominance/opportunity in high-growth markets,” Vivek Arya, a research analyst at Bank of America Global Research, said in the note. Arya said the bank is expecting updates on Nvidia’s robotics strategy, such as its Jetson Thor robot computer, which would leverage its silicon and software capabilities for physical AI. “The challenge in our view is however making the products reliable enough, cheap enough and pervasive enough to spawn credible business models,” Arya said, adding that robotics could be seen as “cool but niche,” similar to the metaverse and autonomous cars. “[W]hile we don’t doubt NVDA’s capabilities, we are unsure as to when and how fast they can influence NVDA’s financials,” Arya said. Bank of America is also looking for Nvidia to announce the launch of its RTX 50-series GPUs, “[p]otential entry into” the AI PC market through a partnership or on its own, and updates to its data center business, including on its current-generation Blackwell platform. The chipmaker’s shares stalled toward the end of last year after reaching record highs driven by the AI boom. Production and shipping of the highly anticipated Blackwell chips were delayed due to a now-fixed design flaw that sent its shares falling. The company also saw its shares tumble after the Chinese government announced an investigation into the chipmaker for possibly violating anti-monopoly laws. In June, Huang announced the Blackwell Ultra chip for this year and a next-generation AI chip platform called Rubin coming in 2026. Arya said announcements on “timeline acceleration” for Rubin could help the chipmaker “regain control of the (overstated) narrative around custom-chips from cloud vendors overtaking/reducing need to buy NVDA’s merchant silicon.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Nova Measuring, other semiconductor equipment names gain following upgrades

Investing.com -- Shares of semiconductor equipment companies, including Nova Measuring (NASDAQ:NVMI) Instruments (NASDAQ: NVMI), Veeco Instruments (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:VECO), MKS Instruments (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:MKSI), Advanced Energy Industries (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:AEIS), and FormFactor (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:FORM), have witnessed a significant uptick in today's trading session. Nova Measuring Instruments' stock rose 7%, Veeco Instruments' and MKS Instruments' shares also jumped 7%, while Advanced Energy Industries and FormFactor saw increases of 3.5% and 5%, respectively. The upward movement in these stocks follows a series of upgrades by analysts at Citi. The companies have been facing a challenging environment due to a combination of factors, including a correction in the second half of 2024, weaker consumer memory demand, and additional U.S. restrictions impacting China's domestic spending. Despite these headwinds, analysts believe that the risk-reward is now skewed to the upside, with the stocks trading closer to historically attractive price-to-earnings levels and at a discount to broader market indices. "We go all in and upgrade NVMI, VECO, MKSI, AEIS, and FORM," stated analyst Atif Malik, indicating a positive shift in sentiment towards these companies. This bullish stance is supported by the expectation that key performance indicators such as estimate revisions and memory pricing momentum are likely to bottom out in the first half of 2025. Furthermore, continued investments in AI are expected to provide tailwinds for the sector. The broader outlook for the semiconductor equipment industry remains cautious, with expectations for the capital expenditures (capex) in the industry to decline by 5% year-over-year (YoY) in 2025. Analysts anticipate that leading-edge AI investments will be fully offset by weaker demand in mature logic industrial and automotive sectors, as well as a decline in China's domestic spending. For memory, a decrease in DRAM spending by 23% is expected, counterbalanced by investments in High Bandwidth (NASDAQ:BAND) Memory (HBM), while NAND spending is projected to remain flat due to delayed technology migrations. Looking ahead, analysts expect semiconductor equipment makers to lower their previous growth expectations for the industry in January, following a warning from Micron (NASDAQ:MU) about cuts in NAND capex. This recalibration is seen as a clearing event for the sector, with the replenishment of PC DRAM inventory and the bottoming out of DRAM prices in the second quarter of 2025 as the next major catalysts. Among the smaller to mid-sized companies, Nova Measuring Instruments is favored for its broad metrology products portfolio and diversified exposure across leading foundry, logic, and HBM customers. Veeco Instruments is recognized for its share gains in laser and nanosecond annealing, positioning these companies well for potential growth opportunities in 2025.

Advertising revenue goes some way to support our mission, but this year it has not been enough. If you've seen value in our reporting, please contribute what you can, so we can continue to produce accurate and meaningful journalism. For everyone who needs it. THE BLACKROCK CLINIC has secured the planning green light for a new cardiology department, an eye centre and additional in-patient bedrooms at its south Dublin site. The planned new facilities are the first phase of a 16-year masterplan for the hospital which will also include the construction of a second hospital building on site. Dún-Laoghaire Rathdown County Council has given planning permission after concluding that the two-storey extension to the side of the main hospital is acceptable. Planning documents lodged with the application show that the private hospital is proceeding with the masterplan for the overall site following the acquisition of several neighbour sites adjoining the campus. Advertisement Documents also state that the main elements of the extension will include a new, dedicated cancer centre, a specialised women’s health centre, an additional therapy centre and a high-tech interventional cardiology labs. McGill Planning say that Blackrock Clinic admitted 52,185 inpatient and daycare patients in 2023 and this figure is expected to grow to 78,000 by 2033, which is around 50% increase over the next decade. It adds that the private clinic is currently operating at full capacity and the clinic will need to expand its capacity, significantly, in order to meet future growth. The application states that the hospital’s capacity has doubled since 2008. An existing site will host a second building, and deliver additional theatres and lab capacity to meet demand in its existing services. Henry J. Lyons Architects and Urban Designers were appointed in September 2023 to develop the plan, following competitive tender. The two-storey extension application is the first of several applications that will be submitted to the local authority.

Title: Warner Bros. Discovery the Big Loser in Disney?s Fubo Sports Move
URL: https://www.streamingmedia.com/Articles/ReadArticle.aspx?ArticleID=167442
Time Published: 2025-01-06T17:00:00Z

Perhaps this was David Gandler’s plan all along. The CEO and co-founder of sports-centric streamer Fubo has executed a play that not only appears to consign proposed mega-rival Venu Sports permanently to the sidelines but gives his company a chance to grow with the almighty backing of Disney. The agreement to merge Disney's Hulu + Live TV with FuboTV will not only see Fubo dropping its anti-trust lawsuit against Venu but appears to cast Venu’s other main partner, Warner Bros Discovery, out in the cold. After the deal announced today receives shareholder confirmation, Disney will hold a 70% stake in Fubo with Gandler continuing to lead the company, offering consumers the existing services of both FuboTV and Hulu + Live TV as both combined and separate products. A combined service would unite FuboTV’s 1.6 million U.S customers with the 4.5 million of Hulu + Live TV to create the second largest live TV streaming service on the market, behind only YouTube TV which amassed over 8 million subscribers early in 2024. Significantly, the deal also includes a new carriage agreement which will enable Fubo to launch a Sports & Broadcast service featuring Disney's top sports and broadcast networks, reportedly to include ESPN+. Fubo already carries packages including MLB Network, NBA TV, NFL Network, NFL RedZone, NHL Network, and beIN Sports while Disney’s other premier sports and broadcast networks including ABC, ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU, SECN, and ESPNEWS. About the only missing major sport is NBA which until recently was a lock-in for WBD’s TNT Sports. However, the new 11-year $77bn deal signed by the league until 2035-36 locks-out WBD in favor of Amazon, Comcast’s Peacock, and Disney. With a new Disney-led Sports & Broadcast service and with NBA already covered, what need would Disney have now to ally with WBD to launch Venu? As part of the settlement, Disney, Fox, and WBD will collectively pay Fubo $220 million while Fubo agrees to end litigation that would have dragged on for months, and may well have resulted in a win for Fubo. When Venu was proposed last February, Fubo immediately slapped the venture with an antitrust suit which was upheld by a New York judge in August. At the time Gandler argued that Disney, WBD, and Fox aimed to “monopolize the market, stifle any form of competition, create higher pricing for subscribers and cheat consumers from deserved choice. Simply put, this sports cartel blocked our playbook for many years and now they are effectively stealing it for themselves,” he added. Now, in a joint release with Disney, Gandler says, “We are thrilled to collaborate with Disney to create a consumer-first streaming company that combines the strengths of the Fubo and Hulu + Live TV brands. This combination enables us to deliver on our promise to provide consumers with greater choice and flexibility. Additionally, this agreement allows us to scale effectively, strengthens Fubo’s balance sheet and positions us for positive cash flow. It’s a win for consumers, our shareholders, and the entire streaming industry.” For Disney, Justin Warbrooke, EVP and Head of Corporate Development, added, “We have confidence in the Fubo management team and their ability to grow the business, delivering high-quality offerings that serve subscribers with the content they want and offering great value.” Disney’s major move in sports is the fall launch of a standalone SVOD, informally called ESPN Flagship. The new DTC, with no publicly announced price, could mark a spinoff of the cable giant. The company laid the groundwork to lasso new viewers by offering ESPN content as part of larger Disney entertainment bundle. New York-based FuboTV was founded in January 2015 by Gandler, Alberto Horihuela, and Sung Ho Choi. The platform operates in the US, Canada, and Spain and aggregates over 300 live sports, news, and entertainment networks. Before the deal, FuboTV’s major shareholders included BlackRock, Vanguard Group and State Street Corp. Gandler owned 0.9%, according to a diligent report at Business Strategy Hub which also noted that the company is not yet profitable but posted a 28% year-over-year increase in revenue growth and a 9% surge in subscribers in 2023. FuboTV, the leading sports-first live TV streaming platform, announced the availability of four new interactive CTV ad formats to further drive audience ad engagement. The personalized and dynamic experiences, including transactional and gamified ad formats, are part of Fubo's ongoing commitment to ad innovation and overall strategy to connect, interact with and convert premium audiences. Warner Bros. Discovery is the latest media titan to consign linear to the bench. In a move reminiscent of Comcast's divisional spinoff last month, WBD will split its lucrative but declining cable networks business from its lucrative and growing streaming and studios businesses. Every few weeks we hear about the next extraordinary sum a streaming platform has paid for exclusive rights to stream a premium sports event. But as Media Universe Cartographer Evan Shapiro says, "Everybody has an NFL game now," so is it worth it? Are streamers really gaining or retaining enough subscriptions by licensing these events to justify what they're paying for them? Shapiro and Hub Entertainment Research Principal Jon Giegengack debate the value of sports vs. scripted content and other subscriber plays in this clip from Streaming Media Connect 2024. As the prices paid for top-tier sports streaming rights continue to reach astronomical levels, and the potential disruption created by the blockbuster ESPN/Fox/Warner Bros. joint venture (popularly termed "Spulu") teased in February, what sports licensing will look like as 2024 rolls on and who will be able to afford it is anybody's guess. Will it play out differently in the U.S. and Europe? And as costs are passed on to users, why wouldn't sports fans just stick with cable? Find out what top analysts like ESHAP's Evan Shapiro, Erickson's Paul Erickson, Dataxis' Ophelie Boucaud, and TVREV's Alan Wolk, say in this clip from Streaming Media Connect 2024. Ian Greenblatt of JD Power discusses the rise of ESPN, its entrenchment as a cable TV subscription must for any sports fan, and why it is now poised to unravel cable bundles with the launch of a possible full standalone streaming platform.

Title: Analysis-Exodus by Wall Street banks from climate group worries advocates

By Simon Jessop, Iain Withers and Saeed Azhar LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. lenders have been rushing in recent weeks to leave one of the world's top banking sector climate coalitions, drawing scorn from campaigners who worry the industry is losing resolve to take action on fossil fuels. Goldman Sachs broke ranks to announce on Dec. 6 it was leaving the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) and was soon followed by Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), Citi, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS). The exit of some of the world's biggest lenders means the NZBA, whose members aim to align their financing with the global climate fight, now includes just JPMorgan among the Big Six U.S. banks. The exodus ended unhappy marriages for most after Republican politicians warned that membership in the group, particularly if it led to reduced financing for fossil fuel companies, could breach antitrust rules. Banks that have pulled out may now reduce their commitments to climate-friendly policies, said Patrick McCully, senior analyst for energy transition at Reclaim Finance. "The key thing to watch will be weakening of their existing targets and policies," said McCully, noting some banks had ambitious targets for decreasing emissions. Still, he did not expect banks to announce publicly any such changes. While the NZBA had sought at various times to tailor its rules to keep the large and systemically important banks onboard, most recently last year, the efforts were ultimately not enough. Jeanne Martin, head of banking programme at advocacy group ShareAction, said those leaving were sending a signal to the market that climate change has become even less of a priority for them. "This is concerning when they are among the world's largest providers of financing to fossil fuels," she said. A spokesperson for JPMorgan, the last remaining major U.S. bank in the alliance, said it regularly evaluates its memberships of such groups, without commenting on whether it plans to join the exodus. The other U.S. members are smaller: Amalgamated Bank (NASDAQ:AMAL), Areti Bank and Climate First Bank (NASDAQ:FRBA). While none cited it as a factor, hanging over the exits was a two-year-long U.S. backlash against environment, social and governance investing. A group of Republican politicians, many of them state attorneys general, have accused members of potential breaches of antitrust rules. Such pressure stepped up after a Republican clean sweep in November's U.S. elections heralded the return of Donald Trump as president, with investors including BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) recently facing legal challenges over their climate efforts. For their part, the banks largely avoided giving a direct reason for needing to leave the NZBA, instead saying they remained committed to helping clients transition to a low-carbon economy and disclosing their actions. Analysis of December syndication fee income from loan and bond issuance by financial think tank the Anthropocene Fixed Income Institute showed each of the U.S. leavers earned more from fossil fuel than green energy. "As a first cut, some of these banks ... can pretty easily say 'nothing has changed' as they are still in a make-more-money-from-fossil-fuel mode," said AFII Chief Executive Ulf Erlandsson. A study entitled 'Banking on Climate Chaos' from 2024 suggested the six biggest U.S. banks were all among the top-20 global lenders to fossil fuel companies. Despite the exits, the largest U.S. banks had all made "strong climate commitments" through the NZBA and investors would continue to push for more information about their efforts, said Mindy Lubber, chief executive of non-profit Ceres. "Ceres will continue supporting banks as they set and achieve targets and implement transition plans. Banks are key to supporting the global goal of net zero emissions and to the economic opportunities that are arising from the transition." Following the mass exit by U.S. lenders, the NZBA still has 142 members from 44 countries with $64 trillion in assets, with 80 European banks accounting for the largest share of the dollar figure. Banks remaining in the coalition include HSBC, Barclays (LON:BARC) and BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY). A spokesperson for the NZBA was not immediately available for comment. Given previous tussles over where to set the bar for NZBA membership, the exit of the U.S. banks offered an opportunity for those who want to be more ambitious, McCully said. "European banks have complained that they'd love the NZBA guidelines to be stronger but the U.S. members just won't let it happen - so (it is) now time for the Europeans to step up and show that they weren't just using U.S. obstructionism as an excuse for foot-dragging," he said on LinkedIn.

Boost SEO results with powerful keyword research Written by Michael Ofei Want to know the most effective ecommerce growth strategy? I studied successful online stores to find out what works best. While every store’s path is unique, clear patterns emerged. Here are some examples: Whether your goal is to do $1M or $100M, it comes from executing the fundamentals. I’ve distilled this guide to the five most impactful growth strategies, including: Let’s start with the most important one. Most ecommerce failures share one root cause: creating products nobody wants. Or products that are okay but never really get traction. You follow trends. Copy competitors. Trust your gut. Then invest thousands in inventory and marketing, hoping customers will buy. The solution? Talk to your customers. One honest conversation today could prevent massive product failures tomorrow. These chats reveal opportunities like: Conversations also build relationships. They turn customers into fans who drive growth through word-of-mouth. By talking to customers, founders Aaron Spivak and Lior Ohayon turned $4,000 into $48M in 48 months. For example, when summer sales dropped, they scheduled customer calls. The feedback was clear: “We love the blanket, but we’re sweating. It’s in storage until winter.” – Aaron Spivak That single insight led to their breakthrough “ice fabric” technology, which: The entrepreneurs continued talking to customers to inform product development. “When people ask what our marketing hack is or which agency we worked with, they miss the point. We had 3,000 people on the phone tell us exactly what they wanted. That’s the real secret.” – Aaron Spivak It’s easy to overthink product research. But Hush proved that you just need to begin talking to customers. Here’s a simple process to get started: The goal is to build such deep customer understanding that product failures become nearly impossible. When we consume 6 hours of content daily, attention is the most valuable currency in business. Storytelling is how you earn it. Why? Stories stick. You may not remember product specs, but you likely recall Sara Blakely cutting the feet off her pantyhose to create Spanx. Or Patagonia’s founder testing gear on mountain expeditions. Most brands miss by showing only the highlight reel—the wins, the perfect moments, and the polished content. Telling raw, relatable stories is how you build a lasting brand. In 2018, Jake Karls and his co-founders launched Mid Day Squares with a radical commitment to transparency. They documented everything about building the company—from production line disasters to legal battles to funding negotiations. Mid Day Sqaures unconventional approach involved: “When people ask what’s our marketing hack or which agency we worked with, they’re missing the point. Building in public and sharing our authentic story turned customers into fans who felt like they were buying from friends.” – Jake Karls Mid Day Squares grew to over $20 million in revenue. And Jake attributes much of their success to creative content. But brand storytelling isn’t just for founder-led content. When Rachel Wilde started TBH Skincare, she took a different approach to content marketing. In addition to founder stories, she created content on real customer experiences. It focused on honest education about acne treatment. “I always say start with the customer. Understand what they want, and hit them with the right with the right message in the right place at the right time.” – Rachel Wilde This customer-first storytelling shaped every aspect of their content, including: They allocated 80% of the marketing budget to content creation. It built a storytelling engine that helped customers see themselves in the products. And it worked. TBH Skincare grew to $14M ($22M AUD) in four years. Before investing in content, identify what makes your brand relatable. Here are some best practices to get started: Read more: What is Content Marketing? Complete Beginners Guide When you nail your brand’s narrative, you create compelling organic content. But that’s just the beginning. You’re also building marketing assets that drive results across every channel. Your content becomes fuel for: “Most brands create different content for each marketing channel. We just document our journey and then adapt those stories for different platforms. It’s more authentic and way more efficient.” – Jake Karls The TBH Skincare team has found authentic stories outperform traditional ads across every channel. “When you have a piece of content that really resonates with people, you can use it everywhere. Our best-performing ads weren’t planned campaigns—they were real moments we captured and then amplified.” – Rachel Wilde The lesson? View storytelling as the key to better marketing. It’ll boost all your other channels. Every day, billions of people tell Google exactly what they want to buy. Capturing this traffic isn’t cheap or easy—but it’s steady. Paid search gives instant traffic but needs constant investment. Organic search is free but takes time to build up. Together, they drive consistent sales. Read more: SEO vs. SEM: What’s the Difference? When MX Store, Australia’s largest online motorcycle parts retailer, first tried Google Ads, their approach was typical. Broad keywords. Generic ads. Homepage traffic. Like throwing spaghetti at a wall and hoping something sticks. So they shifted their approach—led by marketing director Dan Turner. “The key is perfect alignment. Your keyword matches the intent, your ad matches the keyword, and your landing page matches the ad. No disconnects.” – Dan Turner Here’s exactly what they changed: The result? A consistent 10x return on ad spend (ROAS). Before you spend a dollar on ads, understand your profit. Then, analyzing your competitors and keyword research follows. Work out how much you can spend to get a customer while making a profit. Without this calculation, you risk burning your ad budget on dud campaigns. To avoid this mistake, note three metrics: Here’s an example of the math: The maximum CAC calculation is $50 profit ÷ 3 = $16.67 maximum ad spend per customer. With a 2% conversion rate, you can’t spend over $16.67 to acquire a customer while keeping campaigns profitable. Keyword research answers a simple question: are people searching for what you’re selling? Start by Googling your products to see what ads are displaying. For example, here’s what the ads look like for “pendulum lights.” There are lots of ads, which implies they’re working. You could theoretically follow this simple process of Googling, observing, and copying. But, to reduce wasted budget, use a tool like Semrush. It’ll help you understand the demand and cost for profitable keywords. Bonus: Here’s a link to a 14-day trial on a Semrush Pro subscription. That should give you enough time to plan your search marketing campaigns. The first thing to do is check the keyword data. Semrush’s Keyword Overview tool shows that pendulum lights are searched 320 times a month. And the CPC is $0.77. This is enough data to test a campaign. But if you want even more validation, spy on your competitor’s ads. Following the breadcrumbs of how your competitors do ads can save you months of time and money. Staying with the lighting example, Lumens is a competitor. According to Semrush’s Advertising Research tool, Lumens is attracting over 27k monthly users from ads. This tells us that they’re investing pretty aggressively in Google Ads. And they’ve likely done the work of testing and failing. To validate this, you can check Lumens ads history. For instance, they’ve been bidding on “outdoor wall lighting” for seven months straight. Meaning: they’re seeing enough sales to continue the campaign. You can see what the ad looks like in Semrush. And Lumens has been tweaking their copy each month. Using this data drastically increases your chances of successful ads.

In other words, start getting your foundations right today. Here are two priority areas to focus on: Your product and category pages are your money-makers. So you want to maximize their SEO potential. For product pages: Further reading: 20 Effective Product Page Examples For category pages: For inspiration, check out Ruggable’s “clean rugs” category page. You don’t need to address every technical detail. Start with: Speed is especially important for ecommerce. In 2019, eBay did a sitewide initiative to improve performance. Every 100-millisecond improvement led to a 0.5% increase in “Add to Cart.” Further reading: Ecommerce SEO: 6 Proven Strategies to Rank Higher Begin with: Test everything. Double down on what works. Cut what doesn’t. Every dollar should drive immediate sales (paid) or build long-term assets (organic). The top brands drive 30-50% of their revenue through email marketing. These email programs succeed by connecting three foundations we’ve covered: But there’s a fourth element that ties everything together: systematic execution. Let’s explore how to build an email program that turns subscribers into customers—and customers into repeat buyers. Note: The best practices I’m about to share are inspired by Boyuan Zhao, an email and SMS consultant for Shopify brands. I recommend checking out his free four-hour training on YouTube. It’s some of the best content I’ve seen on email marketing. Your email list isn’t just a number. “Most brands obsess over list size. But I’ve found that smaller, engaged lists consistently outperform massive, unengaged ones.” – Boyuan Zhao Large lists built through aggressive tactics (giveaways, lead magnets, etc.) often convert at 1-2%. Meanwhile, carefully grown lists using targeted pop-ups and organic signups can hit 8-15% conversion rates. The math is simple: Plus, better engagement means higher deliverability. Which means more of your emails actually reach inboxes. Start by optimizing your signup forms: Further reading: Email Marketing: The Definitive Guide You likely have a decent welcome series, abandoned cart emails, and a newsletter. But to hit 50% attributed revenue to email, you need to think differently. There are two shifts you need to make this happen. “The brands consistently driving 50% of revenue through email aren’t doing anything revolutionary. They’re just incredibly systematic about execution.” – Boyuan Zhao This means: The results compound over time. How many emails are in your sequences? Probably too many. “I’ve found that a well-executed 3-email sequence often outperforms complex 10-email flows. It’s not about the number of touchpoints. It’s about delivering the right message at the right time.” – Boyuan Zhao Instead of building complex automations, focus on the fundamentals: Weave authentic brand storytelling into your automations and relentlessly test, test, test. Do this, and you’re well on your way to more sales. Even if you have winning products and amazing marketing, you can fail if your operations suck. In 2023, founders Raquel and Adam Bouris of fragrance brand Who Is Elijah learned two expensive lessons about business. First, their discovery set promotion seemed like a slam dunk: sell fragrance samples for $1 plus shipping. They sold 6,000 sets in 24 hours. “Sales looked great because thousands and thousands a week were going out.” – Adam Bouris But the math told a different story. Customers paid $1 plus $10 shipping. The actual shipping cost was $7-12 per unit. Add production, logistics, and overhead costs. The result? A 60% loss on every order. Ouch. “We would’ve been better off turning the website off.” – Adam Bouris Meanwhile, their team had grown from 28 to 44 people, but profits weren’t following. Their initial approach followed conventional wisdom: Despite growing revenue, operational costs were suffocating the business. “One of the biggest problems founders make is they worry about the now instead of what’s on the other side of that decision. We were hiring people to fix problems six months away. That’s so stupid.” – Adam Bouris Who Is Elijah made a complete operational reset, including two critical changes: Profitability improved. They also became more agile and innovative. “I learned how to be a CFO the hard way, but I’m glad that I went through the pain.” – Adam Bouris You can build efficient operations without an MBA or years of corporate experience. It starts with digging into four areas. To understand your profitability create a system for tracking your unit economics. Start with the three numbers that matter most: 1. Revenue per order 2. Direct costs per order 3. Operating costs per order This is a starting point. The rest of your numbers (tools, complex calculations, etc.) can come later. Pro tip: Use a tool like Cin7 to automate this tracking. The investment pays for itself by identifying profit leaks. When problems arise, the tendency is to: Instead, step back and design systems that prevent future issues. Start with your three most time-consuming processes, e.g., order fulfillment, customer services, and inventory management. For each process: Your supply chain impacts everything: cash flow, customer satisfaction, and profitability. Here’s how to optimize it: First, map your current supply chain: Then, negotiate better terms. Here’s an email template: Hi [Name], We’ve been working together for [X months/years] and have purchased [$ amount] of inventory during this time. I’d like to discuss ways we can grow our partnership. Specifically, I’d like to explore: 1. Volume-based discounts 2. Extended payment terms (Net-30 or Net-60) 3. Priority shipping/fulfillment Could we schedule a quick call next week? Best, [Your name] Before adding employees, see what tasks you can automate. Here are some processes to tackle first: You don’t need to do everything at once. Start by answering these questions: Pick the area that needs the most work. Focus there first.

Title: Blackrock Clinic gets go ahead for expansion plans

The Blackrock Clinic has secured planning permission for a new cardiology department, so-called eye centre and additional inpatient bedrooms at its south Dublin site. The planned new facilities are the first phase of a 16-year master plan which will also includes a second hospital building on site. Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown Council Council has given the first-phase planning permission after concluding that the planned two-storey extension to the side of the main hospital building is acceptable. Planning documents lodged with the application show the Larry Goodman Trust-owned hospital is proceeding with the master plan “for the overall site following the acquisition of several neighbour sites adjoining the campus”. McGill Planning states that some of the main elements of the expansion “will include the provision of a dedicated cancer centre, a new specialised women’s health centre, additional theatre capacity and additional high-tech interventional cardiology laboratories”. The clinic admitted 52,185 inpatient and day-care patients in 2023 and this figure is expected to grow to 78,000 by 2033, which is about a 50 per cent increase over the next decade, they add. “Blackrock Clinic is currently operating at full capacity. In order to meet future growth in demand for medical services, the hospital will need to significantly expand its capacity and invest in the construction of major new medical facilities on the hospital campus,” McGill said. [ Blackrock Clinic takes court challenge over BusConnects corridor and compulsory land purchaseOpens in new window ] McGill Planning revealed that the existing St Catherine’s site will host the second hospital building and deliver additional theatres; additional cath lab capacity to meet growing demand in existing services; the development of a new cancer centre; and the addition of new inpatient bed capacity. McGill Planning state that Henry J Lyons architects and urban designers were appointed in September 2023 to develop a master plan following competitive tender. McGill Planning points out that this proposed two-storey extension application “is the first of several planning applications that will be submitted to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to enable the delivery of the master plan”. On the need for the additional beds at Blackrock Clinic, McGill Planning states an increase in demand for emergency care “means the hospital’s inpatient beds are operating at full capacity. This two-floor extension will increase this capacity and provide 14 single-occupancy inpatient bedrooms to ensure acutely unwell patients can be admitted in a timely manner to receive emergency medical treatment”.

Title: Why Is Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) Among the Best FTSE Dividend Stocks to Buy Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best FTSE Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) stands against the other FTSE dividend stocks. Goldman Sachs Research predicts moderate growth for the UK economy in 2025, with GDP rising 1.2%. That is slightly below the Bank of England's (BoE) 1.5% projection and the 1.3% consensus among economists. Moreover, growth is expected to slow as the year goes on, driven by trade uncertainties, tighter budgets, and changes in housing policies. However, inflation is likely to ease through 2025, which could lead to bigger interest rate cuts than the market expects. While most think the BoE will stop cutting rates at 4%, Goldman Sachs sees rates dropping further to 3.25% by mid-2026. Building on this cautious economic outlook, fiscal policies are also expected to play a significant role in shaping growth. The UK’s autumn budget provided a near-term boost to demand but points to a consolidation in 2025, likely slowing growth later in the year. Inflationary pressures from public sector pay deals and higher taxes on services are expected to persist in the short term but should ease as wage growth slows and labor market tightness lessens. Amid these broader economic challenges, UK investors may find some optimism in corporate dividends. AJ Bell's latest Dividend Dashboard paints a positive picture for FTSE 100 dividends. Analysts expect payouts to grow by 1% in 2024 to £78.6 billion, followed by a 7% bump in 2025 to £83.9 billion, though still just shy of the 2018 record of £85.2 billion. This strong performance in dividends highlights a contrast to the broader economic challenges, offering a silver lining for investors. Share buybacks remain strong, with £49.9 billion already planned for 2024, on top of £52 billion last year. Combined with £11 billion in expected dividends from the FTSE 250 and £47.2 billion in takeovers, the FTSE 350 is set to deliver a whopping £189.7 billion in total cash returns. That works out to a cash yield of 7.7%, comfortably beating the Bank of England’s 5% base rate, the 3.92% 10-year gilt yield, and the 2.2% inflation rate. Nevertheless, domestic companies are still grappling with significant headwinds, such as rising costs like National Insurance and minimum wage, all while operating in a sluggish economy. Investors are still favoring the US market, but falling interest rates could nudge some back toward UK stocks. Meanwhile, rising bond yields and pension plans shifting to UK equities might help stocks but could drive up government borrowing costs by reducing demand for gilts. Our Methodology For this article, we used the iShares Core FTSE 100 UCITS ETF. The fund aims to replicate the performance of an index comprising the 100 largest companies in the UK. From this fund, we focused on picking prominent stocks with stable yields and strong dividend policies. The list below is ranked in the ascending order of dividend yield as of January 3. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Dividend Yield as of January 3: 4.27% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48 Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) ranks 1st on our list of the best FTSE dividend stocks. The London-based global energy and petrochemical giant has five business segments – Integrated Gas, Upstream, Marketing, Chemicals and Products, and Renewables and Energy Solutions. The company explores, extracts, and markets oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids, while also producing fuels, petrochemicals, and low-carbon products. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) is ramping up its investments in low-carbon energy, focusing on projects like expanding its e-mobility network across the EU, acquiring Nature Energy – Europe’s biggest biogas producer – and building two massive renewable hydrogen plants – a 100 MW facility in Germany and a 200 MW plant in the Netherlands. The company is also backing Northern Lights, the world’s first open-source carbon capture and storage (CCS) project under the North Sea. Between 2023 and 2025, Shell is planning to invest $10 to $15 billion in low-carbon solutions. On December 19, Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) distributed a quarterly dividend of $0.344 per share and $0.688 per American Depositary Share (ADS). The company intends to raise its annual dividend by about 4%, pending board approval and plans to allocate 30-40% of its cash flow to shareholders via dividends and share repurchase programs. Fisher Asset Management, Eagle Capital Management, and Orbis Investment Management are leading shareholders in the company. Insider Monkey’s database indicates that 48 hedge funds were bullish on Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), compared to 49 in the prior quarter. Overall SHEL ranks 1st on our list of the best FTSE dividend stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of SHEL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SHEL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

The future of renewable energy projects appears to be less likely to receive the level of government ... [+] support from the incoming Trump administration, making the biggest successes in the sector more diversified energy companies and organizations offering new, innovative solutions. (Photo by Wolfgang Kaehler/LightRocket via Getty Images) As the global energy landscape evolves, investors must assess the stability of traditional fossil fuels against the growth potential of renewable energy and advanced nuclear technologies. Some experts highlight a rising global backlash against renewables, as increasing evidence in Europe and elsewhere raises questions about long-term profitability and sustainability without government largesse. Others argue that addressing climate change is non-negotiable, making renewables a safe investment. This article also reflects the expected revival of the nuclear industry. Though national governments typically influence energy policy with input from international organizations such as the International Energy Agency, private enterprise drives energy industry innovation and development. Energy companies have the unique task of balancing public input, global diplomacy, and international frameworks with economic advantage. Companies without a clear, politically informed global outlook and communications and public affairs strategy cannot succeed in the energy sector. We looked at a mix of large, medium, and small-cap companies. Share prices quoted are the adjusted closing prices listed on January 2, 2024, and December 31, 2024, per Yahoo Finance historical lookups. The author has no direct interest in any of the companies highlighted here. Finally, past performance is no prediction of future results. Hydrocarbons – Best Performers TPL (Texas Pacific Land Corporation): TPL is a major landowner in Texas, with extensive holdings in the Permian Basin, home to one of North America’s largest oil and gas deposits. TPL seeks to partner in facilitating every aspect of developing the Basin’s resources through its Land and Resource Management and Water Services and Operations divisions. TPL’s stock increased by 111%, from $524.15 to $1105.96. TPL joined the S&P 500 in November 2024, replacing Marathon Oil. Its royalty-based model includes exposure to U.S. shale production, which is expected to grow under the Trump administration without significant capital expenditures. TRGP (Targa Resources): Targa Resources provides midstream infrastructure for supply of natural gas and natural gas liquids, or NGLs (ethane, propane, butane, etc.) for the domestic and global markets. It is the largest gatherer and processor in the Permian, with pipeline transport, fractionation, and shipping capacities. Its integrated systems and strategic positioning create steady revenue streams amidst strong North American production. After experiencing a remarkable 111% growth from $84.51 to $178.50 in 2024, the stock is set to keep climbing, supported by the company’s infrastructure investments. WMB (The Williams Companies): The Williams Companies provides transport, storage and delivery for natural gas, handling approximately one-third of the U.S. natural gas supply. Assets include pipelines and gathering and processing operations. Its fee-based contracts help maintain stable earnings, support long-term growth, resist shocks, and provide investors with dependable returns. During 2024, the stock grew steadily by 59%, from $34.00 to $54.12, and stands to continue growing in an environment more supportive of natural gas infrastructure.

[+] elect and its role in transporting these resources to countries wanting to buy from the U.S. (Photo by Rebecca DROKE / AFP) (Photo by REBECCA DROKE/AFP via Getty Images) Hydrocarbons – Worst Performers KOS (Kosmos Energy): Kosmos Energy is focused on deepwater exploration and production in offshore Ghana, Equatorial Guinea, and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico as well as Mauritania and Senegal. The company is carrying significant debt, which may have contributed to Kosmos stepping back from preliminary plans to acquire London-based Tullow Oil in December 2024, though both companies are involved in developing the Jubilee field in Ghana (Kosmos has a 38.6% stake; Tullow a 38.9% stake). KOS shares drifted down during 2024, starting at $6.73 and ending at $3.42 for a 49% decrease. TLW.L (Tullow Oil): Tullow Oil, which trades on the London Stock Exchange, operates mainly in Africa and encountered operational challenges, including tax disputes. These issues contributed to underperformance and inconsistent shareholder returns. The stock plummeted 44% from £38.28 at the start of the year to £21.44 by year-end. With the potential Kosmos Energy takeover having fallen through, and with reduced but still significant debt, the stock’s future remains uncertain, with CEO Rahul Dhir having announced his intent to resign in 2025. APA (APA Corporation): A well-established firm in the field, in the near term APA Corporation faces potential cost overruns and project delays as well as possible damage to its reputation through a planned pullout from North Sea production by 2029 necessitated by UK emission regulations. Despite its geographical diversity, it has not yet achieved consistent profitability from its international projects. Operations in Egypt are only just recovering from a production slump, and uncertainty remains regarding the start of production for its Suriname project. This mixed picture led to a 33.9% decrease from $34.91 to $23.09 in 2024. Renewable and Clean(er) Energy – Best Performers VGAS (Verde Clean Fuels, Inc.): A development-stage company, Verde converts natural gas and biomass into gasoline or methanol and is also developing technology to mitigate gas flaring during oil production, using it instead to produce “30% less carbon intensive gas from gasoline”. While this technology-based approach is still proving its worth, the confidence fueled by consistent reductions in losses by 44.9% per year and a recent investment from Cottonmouth Ventures continued to drive the stock’s momentum. In 2024, the stock price increased by 75.76%, rising from $2.31 to $4.06. GEV (GE Vernova): American legacy giant GE finalized the spinoff of the energy company GE Vernova on April 1, 2024, and changed its own name to GE Aerospace, keeping the original GE ticker symbol, with GEV shares closing at an adjusted $141.91. On December 31, 2024, the adjusted close was $328.93, a 131.78% increase. With an established record as a global player in the electrification and power generation fields, areas of concentration include energy (gas, hydro, nuclear and steam), wind (offshore and onshore), Electrification (grid solutions, solar storage, etc.), and Accelerators (including R&D projects). WAVE (Eco Wave Power): Eco Wave Power utilizes tidal power, harnessing ocean waves for electricity generation. This technology broadens the renewable mix beyond intermittent sources like wind and solar and allows for power generation where infrastructure could not typically be constructed, offering additional clean power sources. As a novel technology, with a tiny market cap ($64M), Eco Wave saw more explosive growth than its renewable counterparts, rising an extreme 628.48% from $1.51 to $11.00 in 2024. Renewable Energy – Worst Performers ENPH (Enphase Energy): Enphase Energy, a leader in solar microinverters, faced declining revenue, workforce restructuring, and competitive pressures from Inflation Reduction Act tax credits, resulting in weaker financial performance and a significant 47.6% drop in its stock value from $131.24 to $68.68. NEP (NextEra Energy Partners): NextEra Energy Partners focuses on renewable energy projects, had suspension of distribution growth and a change in its growth drivers, moving from acquisitions toward repowering wind turbines, leading to declining investor confidence despite a strong 2Q 2024 report and significant stock underperformance, represented by a 33.6% price drop from $26.81 to $17.80. BEP (Brookfield Renewable Partners): Brookfield Renewable Partners, a global leader in renewable energy, experienced underperformance due to fluctuations in currency values between USD and CAD, along with regulatory uncertainties as the Trump administration is set to take office. This situation affected investor confidence and hindered its stock performance during 2024. The stock’s price dropped a modest 8% overall, starting at $24.92 and ending at $22.79. Nuclear Stocks – Best Performers NNE (NANO Nuclear Energy): Nano Nuclear Energy, a developer of advanced microreactor technologies like the ZEUS reactor, saw strong stock growth driven by technological advancements, strategic partnerships to secure access to enriched uranium, and increased visibility within the nuclear energy sector. Since its May 8, 2024, IPO, closing at $5.19, the stock’s price has grown 379.77% to $24.90. SMR (NuScale Power Corporation): NuScale Power, an emerging leader in small modular reactors, has seen strong stock growth fueled by technological innovation, global strategic partnerships, and regulatory support for clean energy solutions in the nuclear sector through measures like the ADVANCE Act, which appear to remain consistent with the incoming Trump administration. This rapid demand growth and regulatory backing resulted in an explosive increase of 471 % as the stock price surged from $3.14 to $17.93 this year. CEG (Constellation Energy): Albeit using natural gas, not just renewables, Constellation Energy excels in clean energy, bolstered by strategic partnerships, a 20-year power purchasing agreement with Microsoft, and rising demand for nuclear power, driving strong performance and growth in the energy sector. This translated into a price growth of $115.25 to $223.71 for Constellation, a 94.11% increase. Data centers and the growth of AI are driving demand for nuclear energy. The Three Mile Island ... [+] plant, shown here, is set to be recommissioned by Constellation Energy, bolstered by a purchasing agreement with Microsoft.

Despite a major roadblock that had stopped its Madagascar operations from moving forward since 2019 being finally resolved, the stock experienced weakness throughout the year, with a 25.87% drop in stock price from $6.92 to $5.13. CCJ (Cameco Corporation) Nuclear fuel products and services provider Cameco only saw modest growth despite high demand for nuclear generation, only rising 22% from $42.04 to $51.39, underperforming S&P 500. This is likely due to the stock coming off of a sharp price increase in uranium in 2023 driven by geopolitical factors to a more stable price in 2024. LEU (Centrus Energy Corporation) Centrus Energy, a supplier of nuclear fuel components and services for the nuclear fuel industry, “only” grew by 26%, increasing from $52.85 to $66.61, following a weak Q3 and skepticism regarding nuclear growth after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rejected a deal between Amazon and Talen Energy in November 2024.

Title: Here’s Why Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:LXRX) Is Among the Best Diabetes Stocks to Buy Under $10

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Diabetes Stocks To Buy Under $10. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:LXRX) stands against the other diabetes stocks. About 422 million people worldwide have diabetes, according to the WHO, and most of them live in low- or middle-income nations. Every year, diabetes directly causes 1.5 million deaths on average. Both the number of cases and the prevalence of diabetes have steadily increased during the last several decades. However, according to the International Diabetes Federation, there are currently 500 million people with diabetes globally, and that number is expected to rise by 25% by 2030 and 51% by 2045. The continuous glucose monitor (CGM) is one type of medical equipment used to help manage diabetes, including type 1 and type 2. It is now a rapidly growing segment of diabetic care devices, and the market has increased significantly in recent years. According to GlobalData, the demand for sophisticated diabetes care products, such as insulin pumps, pens, and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices, was projected to be valued at $21.8 billion in 2023. According to GlobalData's forecasts, the market will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.34% to reach revenues of $33.4 billion by 2030. There are now 97 goods in the CGM category, according to the GlobalData marketed products database. Only a small number of these devices are implantable sensors; the majority are conventional CGMs. The GlobalData pipeline products database indicates that 133 goods are either approved or in the development stage. According to the data, this market niche is growing rapidly and is a center for cutting-edge new technologies such as implantable CGMs. AI is now being included in CGM technology. For instance, Roche unveiled Accu-Chek SmartGuide, a revolutionary predictive AI-powered CGM device. Roche Diabetes Care Chief Medical Officer Julien Boisdron described it as “a solution more than a CGM” at the introduction. He explained how the system, which includes a sensor and two algorithms, helps with prediction and data visualization. The management of diabetes and its related complications has entered a new era of opportunity. The combined issues of diabetes and obesity can be effectively treated with these innovative approaches. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists are a class of medications used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity. The GLP-1 market, which is driven equally by diabetes and obesity, is predicted to reach $100 billion by 2030. By this time, there could be 30 million GLP-1 users or around 9% of the US population. According to the most recent KFF Health Tracking survey, 12% of adult Americans say they have used a GLP-1 medication at some point. In the past five years, 43% of GLP-1 prescription users had diabetes, and 22% of patients with obesity or overweight diagnoses also took the medication. Over the course of the past year, the percentage of adults who have heard "a little" or "a lot" about these medicines has climbed from 70% to 82%, while the percentage of adults who have heard "a lot" or "a lot" about them has increased from 19% to 32%. However, the rising demand for these weight-loss and diabetes drugs has created challenges. The National Pharmacy Association (NPA) warned of a possible "explosion in the unlicensed sale of medication online." Semaglutides, marketed under the name Ozempic, assist people with type 2 diabetes in controlling their blood sugar levels. However, they are also frequently used to aid in weight loss in certain nations, such as the US, where they are marketed under the name Wegovy. NPA chairman Nick Kaye stated: “Pharmacists remain deeply concerned that the current medicine shortages crisis could lead to an explosion in the unlicensed sale of medication online.” Our methodology involved identifying healthcare companies focused on diabetes treatment using a stock screener. From the resultant dataset, we selected those with stock prices under $10 and ranked them based on their share price as of the close of December 26. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A laboratory researcher in a white coat, closely examining a microscope. Share Price as of the Close of December 26: $0.78 Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:LXRX) is a biopharmaceutical company leveraging advanced genetic research to develop transformative medicines, particularly for diabetes and related conditions. Its flagship drug, INPEFA (sotagliflozin), is an oral therapy targeting heart failure, type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular risks. In Q3 2024, Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:LXRX) reported $1.7 million in net sales for INPEFA (sotagliflozin), with year-to-date sales reaching $4.5 million. Growth was driven by increased prescribing, despite a reduced sales force. The company focuses on advancing ZYNQUISTA (sotagliflozin) for type 1 diabetes (T1D) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). An FDA advisory committee recently reviewed its application, expressing significant support for its use in patients aged 60-90, with a PDUFA goal date of December 20, 2024. If approved, ZYNQUISTA would be the first adjunct to insulin for glycemic control in T1D. Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:LXRX) has entered an exclusive licensing agreement with Viatris for sotagliflozin outside the U.S. and Europe, involving a $25 million upfront payment and up to $197 million in regulatory and sales milestones. The LX9211 program for diabetic neuropathic pain has completed enrollment screening for its Phase 2b PROGRESS study, with topline data expected in Q1 2025. Additionally, the corporation is advancing the SONATA HCM Phase 3 trial and developing LX9851 for obesity, diversifying its pipeline beyond INPEFA and addressing unmet medical needs in diabetes and related conditions. Analysts have given the stock a consensus rating of "Strong Buy," with an average price target of $4.30. Forecasts range from a low of $1.20 to a high of $10.00, reflecting a potential 501.65% increase from its most recent price of $0.78. Overall LXRX ranks 2nd on our list of the best diabetes stocks to buy under $10. While we acknowledge the potential of LXRX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than LXRX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Applied Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:APLT) reported $122,000 in revenue for Q3 2024 which is a significant decrease from $10.66 million in the same period of 2023 due to a one-time licensing agreement. R&D expenses rose to $14.8 million which was driven by increased personnel costs and data storage for commercialization. G&A expenses increased to $15.0 million due to higher headcount. The net loss for Q3 was $68.6 million, compared to $42.4 million in Q3 2023, largely due to higher expenses and changes in warrant liabilities. As of September 30, 2024, the company had $98.9 million in cash, with a runway expected to last until 2026. Applied Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:APLT) is awaiting critical regulatory decisions, including the FDA's Priority Review for govorestat in Classic Galactosemia, with a PDUFA date of November 28, 2024, and an EMA decision expected in Q1 2025.

Title: US Bitcoin ETFs see $903 million inflow as 2024 confirmed $44.2 billion gain globally

Bitcoin products kicked off the year with $666 million net inflow as investors remain bullish. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Crypto-related products recorded a remarkable $44.2 billion in inflows last year—almost four times higher than the previous all-time high of $10.5 billion set in 2021. According to CoinShares’ latest report, this record-breaking performance is attributed to the introduction of US spot-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which significantly influenced global investments. Bitcoin dominated the scene, drawing $38 billion in inflows and accounting for 29% of the total assets under management (AuM). This significant inflow also resulted in a notable increase in Bitcoin ETFs’ holdings, which surpassed one million BTC in less than a year of their launch. Leading products like BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC attracted the most interest. Notably, IBIT became the most successful ETF launch in the past decade by outperforming nearly 3,000 other ETFs. On the other hand, Grayscale’s GBTC saw the most outflows last year as investors withdrew more than $21 billion from the fund for cheaper alternatives. Nevertheless, the ETF products’ positive flows resulted in the US leading global inflows, as it attracted almost all of the $44.4 billion, followed by Switzerland with $630 million. However, significant outflows from Canada and Sweden—totaling $707 million and $682 million, respectively—partially offset these gains. James Butterfill, CoinShares head of research, pointed out that the outflows suggest a shift in investments from these regions to US-based products, underscoring the growing appeal of the American crypto market. He also noted that Bitcoin climb to a new all-time high of more than $100,000 last year resulted in short BTC products seeing inflows of $116 million. Ethereum also stood out for its performance, especially for its resurgence in the latter part of the year. The digital asset secured $4.8 billion in inflows as its ETH spot-based ETFs ended the year strongly. This inflow represented 26% of its AuM, which is 2.4 times higher than its 2021 total and vastly exceeds its 2023 performance. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s gains outpaced its eternal rival Solana, which managed $69 million in inflows, representing just 4% of its AuM. Other large-cap alternative coins, such as Polkadot, Cardano, XRP, and others, collectively attracted $813 million, accounting for 18% of their AuM. Meanwhile, this year has started on a positive note for Bitcoin investment products in the US, with inflows reaching $666 million in the first two trading days. However, according to Farside data, Jan. 3 saw a $908 million inflow in a single day, with Fidelity leading at $357 million, just ahead of BlackRock and Ark Invest at $253 million and $222 million, respectively.

Title: Nvidia and TSMC rise as Foxconn's record quarter boosts chip stocks
URL: https://qz.com/nvidia-tsmc-stock-foxconn-q4-revenue-semiconductors-1851732906
Time Published: 2025-01-06T13:18:00Z

Semiconductor chip stocks rose on Monday after electronics giant Foxconn (HNHPF-0.70%) reported record-breaking revenue for its fourth quarter, as the artificial intelligence boom continues into 2025. Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, on Sunday reported revenue of $2.13 trillion in New Taiwan dollars ($65 billion) for the October to December period. Despite revenue falling month-over-month in November and December, the world’s largest electronics maker recorded growth in each month compared to a year earlier. That gave the company a 15% year-over-year increase, a record for the major Apple supplier. In a statement, Foxconn cited “strong demand” for AI servers, new computing products, and growth in its automotive-related business. Foxconn has started developing its own business around electric vehicles and has plans for a major campus in Zhengzhou, China, also known as “iPhone City. Its computing products division also showed “strong growth” driven by demand for new products, while its smart consumer electronics division slightly declined due to production issues. “In the first quarter of 2025, overall operations have gradually entered the traditional off-season,” Foxconn said. The company added that the quarter should show “significant growth” compared to the same time in 2024. Shares of semiconductor companies across the world rose on the news of Foxconn’s revenue and first-quarter forecast, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which produces about 90% of the world’s chips. TSMC (TSM-2.06%) stock rose almost 5% in pre-market trading in New York, adding to its major rally in 2024. Nvidia stock was up more than 2% in early trading, building on its own supersized gains in 2024. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD-4.84%) stock rose by almost 3%, while Intel (INTC-1.02%) shares ticked up slightly by 1% and Synopsys (SNPS+2.69%) shares climbed 2% in pre-market trading. The Netherlands-based ASML’s (ASML-2.16%) stock was up almost 6%, while Switzerland’s STMicroelectronics (STM-4.64%) saw its shares climb by almost 7%. Other European companies, including ASMI (ASMIY-1.34%) and Infineon (IFNNY-4.09%), also saw gains. Shares in South Korean’s SK Hynix (HXSCL) and Samsung rose by almost 10% and 3%, respectively.

Title: Is DOGE Real? - For Government Services Companies, Very Much So

WASHINGTON, DC - The dome of the U.S. Capitol is seen beyond a snow man on the national mall on ... [+] January 16, 2024. (Photo by Kent Nishimura/Getty Images) Much ink (or in today’s world, electrons and pixels), has been expended discussing the “Department of Government Efficiency” to be formed in the incoming Presidential administration. Popularly known as “DOGE” and headed by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, the moniker is a not so subtle reference to a cryptocurrency supported by Musk. The Doge was also, in medieval times, the chief magistrate of city-states such as Venice and Genoa, and acted as a judge to decide questions brought before a court of justice. DOGE will not be a department, but actually an advisory commission, of which there are many serving various Departments of the US government. (Most of these, doubtlessly, will be targets for elimination by the commission). To be an actual Department, such as Defense or Treasury, would require an act of Congress. However, House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY) announced plans in November of last year to form a Subcommittee to work with DOGE to achieve its goals. This Subcommittee will be chaired by Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA). The two tech billionaires leading DOGE have at various times announced multiple goals and actions. Musk has put forth the expectation that the Federal budget would be reduced by $2 Trillion. Ramaswamy has stated that entire Departments might be eliminated and as much as three quarters of the Federal workforce could be let go. Musk has proposed eliminating over 300 of the 400 plus Federal agencies. It is not hard to determine how the $2 Trillion reduction goal was set. The 2024 Federal budget was roughly $6.8 Trillion in overall spending while revenues (derived primarily from personal and corporate income taxes, payroll taxes, custom duties and sales/excise taxes) was only $4.9 Trillion, yielding a $1.9 Trillion annual budget deficit. And that deficit is expected to grow, according to the Congressional Budget Office, to $2.6 Trillion by 2034. In other words, if DOGE could achieve its goals, the budget would be balanced, something that has not occurred since 2001, regardless of the political party in power. Pres. Ronald Reagan walking & giving thumbs up gesture on S. Lawn after returning from MA. (Photo ... [+] by Cynthia Johnson/Getty Images) Despite the aggressive pronouncements, the reality of reducing government spending through blue-ribbon advisory commissions dates back to Theodore Roosevelt, with little sustained impact. Most notable in the recent past was Ronald Reagan’s Grace Commission, led by industrial CEO Peter Grace. In 1982, Reagan coined the phrase “Drain the Swamp” and encouraged the Commission to “Be bold... work like tireless bloodhounds... Don’t leave any stone unturned in your search to root out inefficiency.” The Grace Commission produced a 47 volume report that, if implemented, promised a reduction of Federal spending of nearly half a trillion dollars in three years and a paring of the national debt by over $10 Trillion over the next sixteen years. At the end of last year, that debt now sits at $36.22 Trillion. Most of the findings were never enacted due to policy disputes or bureaucratic resistance. Although past commissions might not have achieved their aims, the financial markets are betting otherwise. From the date of the election, November 5, 2024, through December 31, 2024, the stock price of government services providers has slid by as much as 31%. These companies, such as Booz Allen Hamilton, Amentum, CACI, SAIC, Leidos, V2X, Parsons and KBR perform a variety of technical, engineering, or IT services to perform projects in support of Departmental goals. Many of them provide qualified manpower to work on classified projects, having the necessary security clearances. Their revenue is often highly correlated with their qualified employees, and are referred to as “butts in seats” enterprises. HELMAND PROVINCE, AFGHANISTAN - JULY 21: KBR (UK) employees work at a manufacturing plant at the ... [+] Camp Bastion Water Bottling Plant on July 21, 2008. (Photo by Marco Di Lauro/Getty Images) And the falloff in enterprise value has induced second order effects. In late December it was revealed that KBR was a target of an activist investor, Irenic Capital, which had accumulated over 1% of the company’s shares and was advocating for a split of the government services unit from the private sector services unit due to the slower expected growth rate of the former. Irenic estimated that shareholder value could be improved by 50% through such a separation. It is understandable that these companies could experience a drastic slowdown in their revenues. They are engaged on projects which can be delayed or cancelled perhaps more easily and rapidly than cutting Federal employees. When Musk took over Twitter (now renamed X) in 2022, he took the workforce from 8,000 to 1,500, according to statements he made in 2023, or a reduction of roughly 80%. Despite fears that the company’s systems would crash, they continued to function albeit in a reduced form (a subject of continuing controversy), and that realization set off a chain reaction in Silicon Valley. Almost instantly, the tech CEO mindset changed from one of scarcity and competition for talent (providing housing, transportation, in-office amenities such as food, coffee baristas and kombucha on tap) to attract qualified software engineers, to one of surplus and excess. Companies such as Meta, Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple slashed over 165,000 jobs in 2022, 263,000 in 2023 and 151,000 in 2024, according to layoffs.fyi. However successful the cost cutting was, X’s market value has now dropped to $9.4 Billion (according to Fidelity Investments) versus the $44 Billion Musk paid for it, due to dissatisfaction with its policies and performance and defections of advertisers and users to other social media platforms. And this is the conundrum that every would be drainer of swamps must face. The “excess” cost that must be eliminated has a sponsor or recipient of its value - many of whom sit in a Congress that has razor slim majorities in its parties. DOGE may not achieve any or all of its goals in reality. The means by which the $2 Trillion reduction is measured is not specified (annually? over time? inflation adjusted?) and it is unclear whether other spending will be needed to offset backlash from affected parties (the Twitter/X problem). But for now the specter of reduced government spending is having a material impact in the expectations of the financial markets for the providers of government services. One Community. Many Voices.

Plus: How Jay Graber Is Making Sure Social Media Upstart Bluesky Never Turns Into Elon Musk’s X Good morning, Tesla isn’t the only EV maker experiencing a post-election rally. Shares of California-based Rivian rallied to one of their best days ever on Friday, surging 24%. The upward trajectory defies initial Wall Street concerns about President-elect Donald Trump’s reported intention to cut a federal subsidy for electric vehicles. But last week the automaker revealed slightly better fourth-quarter car deliveries than analysts expected. Rivian’s stock is up 54% since election day, outperforming every other stock besides Tesla and Palantir. The purchase of most Rivian vehicles qualifies for a $3,750 federal tax credit, but if Trump repeals such a subsidy, it could hurt EV demand and effectively increase the sticker price. A FedEx Corp. cargo jet sits parked in the snow at Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport on January 5, 2025 in Louisville, Kentucky. Winter Storm Blair swept across the U.S. Central Plains and Midwest Sunday and toward Washington, D.C. Monday, disrupting more than 10,000 flights and counting as heavy snow, ice and wind have made for hazardous travel conditions. Tens of millions across the mid-Atlantic are under winter weather warnings through Tuesday morning. Official merchandise themed for Donald Trump's inauguration may do more than celebrate his second presidency—the funds from such swag could be used to cover Trump’s personal expenses, including legal fees, based on fine print displayed at the bottom of checkout pages. It’s an unusual diversion, campaign finance experts told Forbes. Bitcoin reached an all-time high in 2024, capturing the attention of the world and of one old-school value investor. Here's why Taesik Yoon, a longtime Forbes editor, says he’s bullish on the volatile cryptocurrency, and that continued adoption is key. Ed Stack, executive chairman of Dick's Sporting Goods, in the Dick's "House of Sport" in Pittsburgh's Ross Park Mall. Dick’s Sporting Goods owner Ed Stack turned his father’s small business into a juggernaut with a market capitalization of more than $18 billion. He attributes his business success to a series of lessons learned along the way, including to always keep score, study great leaders, pursue a passion and stick to your principles. Billionaire Fernando De Leon’s conglomerate Leon Capital Group is estimated to be worth nearly $3 billion, but growing up, he lived in poverty in Mexico and crossed the U.S. border daily to go to school in Texas. “I’m what Donald Trump calls an ‘anchor baby,’” he says, “but a high tax-paying anchor baby.” Roughly a quarter of De Leon’s estimated $2.8 billion fortune is now in residential and industrial real estate, mostly in growing Sun Belt cities. London-based payments unicorn Checkout was once the most valuable startup in Europe, with a $40 billion valuation, but its revenues have slumped after cutting its contract with Binance over money laundering concerns. The troubled crypto exchange at one point was Checkout’s largest customer, and corporate filings reveal the London-based fintech’s revenues dropped 16% to $212 million. The House voted Friday to reelect Rep. Mike Johnson (R-La.) as their Speaker after a tight contest following pushback from a small but influential group of Republicans. President-elect Donald Trump endorsed Johnson earlier in the week and reportedly spoke to several members who wound up changing their votes. Trump’s guilty verdict on 34 felony counts in New York will stand after a judge ruled against throwing out the verdict, keeping one of the only remaining criminal cases against Trump alive. Judge Juan Merchan set the sentencing for just 10 days before Trump’s inauguration, but made clear he does not plan to sentence Trump to any prison time. The president-elect criticized the decision on social media over the weekend, saying no president had ever been treated “so evilly and illegally,” and denouncing the New York judicial system. President-elect Donald Trump indicated his continued support for TikTok last week, but his incoming administration’s ability to stop or even pause the federal ban is limited. The Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments in the TikTok case this Friday, and it’s expected they’ll issue a quick ruling on whether or not the law should be upheld by the time it’s due to take effect January 19. After much back and forth, the Corporate Transparency Act could be headed to the Supreme Court after the Department of Justice filed an application to overturn a preliminary injunction temporarily barring the government from enforcing beneficial ownership information reporting. It’s meant a lot of whiplash for business owners and advisors about whether or not they need to report, and if so, when—but the status quo for now continues to be wait-and-see. Kimberly White/Stringer/Getty Images TOPLINE Since Elon Musk torpedoed Twitter, its rival Bluesky has seen a stunning surge. Bluesky began as an open source research project at Twitter helmed by open internet evangelist Jay Graber. Graber’s mandate was to build a protocol, a shared language that computers could use to talk to each other, designed specifically for social media. But after Elon Musk bought Twitter, it became clear that Bluesky was no longer on its roadmap. The platform began to transform, facing an advertiser boycott, exodus of users, and eventually a name change to X. So the team that made the protocol spun up a quick app, just to show how it might be used. They launched it as an invite-only social network in 2023. Since its launch, Bluesky has seen unusual success: It raised a modest $15 million Series A round in October, when it had 13 million users, and since then, its user base has nearly doubled to more than 25 million. The app has panicked Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, whose own Twitter competitor, Threads, has rushed to copy many of its features. But Bluesky is a company with investors who want to make money. And that could someday clash with Graber’s user-first approach to social media: To put the people using Bluesky in control of its central features. In giving power to the people, Bluesky has so far eschewed the strategy that other social platforms have used to make billions of dollars: collecting troves of intimate data about their users, and then letting advertisers target them based on that data. At least today, Bluesky is fully public, and its user data is available to people outside the company, so there’s no secret sauce for advertisers to pay for. WHY IT MATTERS “If Bluesky’s model is successful and other companies adopt Graber's protocol, it could change the future of social media,” says Forbes senior writer Richard Nieva. “Elon Musk’s takeover of Twitter illustrated how fragile the social media ecosystem can be. Decentralizing it can be a form of ‘billionaire-proofing’ the medium, as Graber puts it, for the long term.” MORE How Elon Musk Muzzled Government Employees From Talking About xAI’s New Supercomputer Shares of alcohol makers and distributors fell Friday after Surgeon General Vivek Murthy called on Congress to update warning labels on alcoholic beverages to include cancer risks. Alcohol is the third-leading preventable cause of cancer behind tobacco and obesity, according to Murthy: Around $450 million: The amount of market capitalization that the producer of Modelo and Corona beers lost after the announcement Only 45%: The share of American adults who know of the possible cancer risks of alcohol 100,000: The estimated number of annual alcohol-related cancer cases in the U.S. The job market is at a crossroads, and it’s critical for workers to be resilient and adaptable. A few key labor market trends to watch out for in 2025 include the increasing adoption of artificial intelligence, a full return to the office at some companies and the growing practice of skills-based hiring. There is also more demand for skilled trades, which is opening up new opportunities and challenging long-held assumptions about career success.

Title: How I Keep our Big Family Grocery Budget Low

Heavenly Homemakers Encouraging women in homemaking, healthy eating and parenting January 6, 2025 by Laura 1 Comment This is how I keep our big family grocery budget low… Perhaps when you see our large grocery budget number, you don’t see it as a low number. It’s all relative, right? It is large for a regular-sized family. But for our big family? I think we do a pretty good job of keeping it as low as we can. Aww, a look at our beloved 19: We are so grateful to live close to Asa, Eva, and Arrow and Justus, Kelsey, and Little Sweetheart! Our budget for 2024 was $1,400/month. You can see the total numbers here sharing what each month looked like. You might notice if you divide my total 2024 spending amount by 12 months that I actually averaged a bit lower per-month amount than I budgeted. As I look ahead to 2025, I’m looking at how it worked to maintain that budget plus I’m considering these… I still plan to keep our grocery budget at $1,400/month right now and see how long that works for us. I will make adjustments during the year if this doesn’t work or if it is causing stress. Our energy and mental space needs to be used to care for our family and others – not for crunching numbers and worrying over nickels and dimes. I’ve been thinking about all that is working for me as I try to stick to a healthy grocery budget for our household and I came up with a lot of details to share! After settling into our new Lincoln home and finding my way with new-to-me grocery stores and a new shopping system that works for our needs, this is what I’ve found that works to feed 13 of us with a $1,400/month budget. 1. I always look for meat markdowns. Buying discounted meat is probably what saves our family the most money on groceries. I settled on this price point for meat, and I am determined to almost never go over. See the exception here. But with this in mind, I have found that if I look for meat that has been marked down for quick sale – specifically at Aldi, Walmart, or Sam’s – I can almost always buy meat for our family marked down to $2.50/pound or less. This is even less than my price point, and the savings are huge! These yellow stickers are my favorite! And I’ve found that if I shop in the mornings, that’s when there are the most yellow stickers as the stores clear out their packages of meat that are nearing the “best by” date. I grab them up and freeze them to use as needed. HUGE SAVINGS. The best mark down I’ve found: for two years in a row, we’ve scored $0.50/pound ham after Christmas. We fill our freezers. One ham goes a long way, even for a large family! Every once in a while, other stores in town (that I don’t frequent regularly) will offer a big meat sale. If the deals are good, I find it worth it to make an extra stop to take advantage. 2. We shop in bulk. Having a Sam’s or Costco membership may not pay for itself for some families. But for us? The savings are big and very worth it. I now know which items are priced best at Sam’s, which are best at Costco, and which are better at other stores. Buying large quantities of many of our staples cuts down our cost and is also helpful for my planning needs. It takes a lot of mental pressure off my brain if I know that I have twelve of something in my pantry ready to grab as needed. It usually takes two carts to get everything we need at Costco or Sam’s each month. 3. I have learned what items are cheapest at which stores. After living in Lincoln for a year-and-a-half, I’ve learned which prices are best at which store for the products we use and need. My favorite places to shop are Sam’s, Costco, and Aldi with a little Walmart thrown in for those awesome meat markdowns! Typically, I keep running lists on my phone of what I need at each store. I shop once each week, but go to a different store each time. So usually we hit Costco and Sam’s just once in a month, Aldi twice and Walmart twice. This works well for our budget and plans! 4. We eat as many fruits and veggies as we can. People don’t believe me when I say that fruits and veggies save money because everyone thinks “healthy food is expensive.” I disagree when it comes to fruits and veggies. Where we shop, apples, bananas, carrots, pears, grapes, fresh spinach, mixed greens, and potatoes are all consistently low in price per pound. Frozen fruits and veggies cost the same all year round. And we buy everything else in season when their prices are the lowest and featured in a sale. Kids need something to hold them over until lunch? Here’s an apple: Also, I’ve found that it’s easiest to feed a large crowd of people (which for us is 13 to 30 or more people per meal) when I set out the main dish and a variety of fruit and/or veggie side dish options. This stretches the meal to feed a lot of people, plus offers variety, gives people choices, and overall saves money. 5. I say yes to offers of free food that would otherwise go to waste. Say what? Well, we stand out as a large family with “a lot of mouths to feed.” Therefore, people often think of us when there is extra food that will get thrown away after an event at church or at people’s places of work. Our neighbor is often stopping by with something from his work’s break room that is perfectly good to eat but is about to get tossed because no one wants it. “Wait! I’ll take it to the Coppingers!” says he, and he does. After a potluck or church event? People hand us leftovers. “Here, use this for your next Sunday lunch,” they’ll say. Or, “Will your family eat this? We hate to throw it away.” YEP. We say yes to most offers like this because we don’t like food going in the trash and because I can make a meal with just about anything if I get creative. In addition, we bring home food from the Food Distribution site where we volunteer each week. All the food there is donated by grocery stores and restaurants if it is an item close to its expiration date or otherwise unable to be sold. This food is going to be thrown away if not given to the community! I can’t tell you how grateful we are that Lincoln has the FoodNet program to cut down on food waste and to provide for the community instead. Typically each week at the location where we serve, over 100 families go through the line to get food. We, as volunteers, get to pick out some of the food too if there is enough. And at the end of the hour when all of the clients have gone through the line, if there is anything left, volunteers can go through the line again. We bring home a random assortment of food each week – sometimes just a little and sometimes several bags worth. I usually need to find ways to use up this food or freeze it pretty quickly because it’s food that is on its last leg. But it was free and it’s fun and it didn’t go into a grocery store dumpster. Worth noting: sometimes I say yes to food handouts even if I know our family won’t eat it because I know people who will eat it. We regularly buy extra or stockpile food we’ve been given to take to our church’s Little Free Pantry. It’s so good for our kids to be a part of the ministry of caring for others and loving people in our neighborhood. Almost every time we are at the pantry filling it up, we meet up with someone who is coming there to check for food to use for their next meal. It’s amazing and we love visiting with these new friends. 6. WIC Our three youngest kids qualify for WIC through their adoption subsidy (and will until they turn five). This gives them fresh produce, cheese, eggs, milk, rice/pasta/bread, and beans and totals around $150/month in benefits. This is a lovely resource we are thankful to enjoy for our kids. 7. I only buy organic if it fits into the budget. I used to overthink this and feel guilty. But God has taken this guilt away though because He’s taught me that loving people is much more important than obsessing over food. Yes, I want to take good care of our bodies. I absolutely try to fill us all with nourishing foods every day. But my focus is more on meeting our kids’ emotional needs than worrying over an organic label on our food. We also want to continue to fill our home and tables with dear friends who join us for meals frequently. We want to feed our guests well, but spending extra to be sure everything is organic would not work for our budget. I won’t trade an organic label for inviting people into our home to share our food. I’m thankful that many organic foods DON’T cost more – like apples, spinach, mixed greens, salsa, pasta sauce, and carrots. I get them regularly and other organic items if I can. But if I buy pears that aren’t organic, I’m no longer worried. We’re still eating pears. Pears are healthy. God takes care of the rest. 8. We always eat at home or pack food if we’re on the road. Buying restaurant food is not an option for us right now, and we are very ok with that. ( Think eating out would double our grocery budget. Plus can you imagine taking this many high-need kids into a restaurant? Phew.) Instead, we’ve found all kinds of other ways to make food fun, to offer all of us treats, and to even pretend we are having fast food. (Bulk bags of chicken nuggets and fries from Costco are crazy cheap compared to feeding 13 people at Wendy’s – and they taste better too.) I’ve found so many ways to make food prep simple that I never feel like I want to order take-out. If I ever need a night off from cooking (which, of course, I do), we bake Costco frozen pizzas. They are super cheap compared to ordering pizza and we love how they taste. Costco or Sam’s $5 Rotisserie Chicken is also a great fast food option that goes a long way! Exception to never eating out: There are a few times each year that we find ourselves on the road with the need to stop and get a bunch of McDonald’s nuggets or something like this. We aren’t legalistic about not eating out. We just choose not to most of the time and enjoy coming up with all kinds of other fun options to eat or pack instead! 9. We eat leftovers. I mentioned above that we don’t like it when food goes to waste. Therefore, we put all of our leftovers from meals into our fridge to warm up another time. Matt and I are stay at home /work from home parents, and we almost always warm up leftovers for our lunch. Elias often packs leftovers to take to work for lunch. And whenever our fridge starts to get over full, instead of cooking something new, we have a meal in which we pull out all the leftovers and warm them up for people to help themselves to whatever sounds good. I’ve also found creative ways to turn leftover food into a brand new meal: like turning a Taco Bar into a casserole or a bunch of burritos for the freezer, taking leftover ham to make Ham and Potato Casserole or Breakfast Casserole. It’s pretty easy to turn leftovers into something new. 10. I make good use of our freezers. If there’s a good sale (or a good deal on meat, as if I haven’t talked about that enough, ha), I stock up and fill the freezer. If I’m making one casserole or batch of muffins, I often make two or three while I’m at it to get more meals prepped for the same amount of work. I put the extras into the freezer for a convenient fast food another day. Frozen casseroles/muffins/breads also give me the option of providing others with meals if I find out of a need – a sick friend, a new mama, or a hurting friend. 11. I use credit for Azure Standard purchases. This is only worth a tiny mention as it doesn’t affect our budget much. But I do accrue a small amount of referral credit to Azure Standard when any of you sign up for an account and/or take advantage of what Azure has to offer. About twice a year, the credit number adds up to enough for me to put in an order that is mostly covered by the credit. Their food is great and some of it I can only find through Azure, so these are the items I stock up on when I can! Stay tuned for our weekly posts to see what we’re eating and who we’re feeding. And watch for our monthly posts sharing what we buy and how much we spend. We’ll see if our monthly $1,400/month budget holds! What are the best ways you’ve found to save money at the grocery stores where you live? Filed Under: Big Family Food, Feeding the Family Tagged With: frugal budget, grocery budget, large family food, saving money on groceries Amber says January 7, 2025 at 5:45 pm That is a very good budget for the amount of people you feed. Do you use a separate budget for nonfood household items and needs or is it included. I have a family of 7 children (3 teens) and two adults. I am working keeping ours down and having more fruits and vegetables. My younger children tend to go through fruit in one day it seems like a bag of mandarins for instance. We are also a neurodivergent family. God Bless! Your email address will not be published.

Title: Meta Officially Discontinues Quest Pro, Its First (and most expensive) Mixed Reality Headset

Full Content:
Meta has officially discontinued Quest Pro, the company’s first mixed reality headset. Meta announced back in September that it was winding down Quest 2 and Quest Pro sales. At the time, the company said remaining stock would be sold through the end of the year or until they ran out, whichever came first. Now, in place of the Quest Pro order page, Meta is suggesting users to buy Quest 3 “for the ultimate mixed reality experience and premium comfort.” You can still buy Quest Pro’s ‘Touch Pro’ controllers however, as they support Quest 2 and above. Released in 2022 at the eye-water price of $1,500, Meta hoped to use the headset to kickstart its mixed reality ambitions among consumers, as it was the first to offer color-passthrough, pancake lenses, and both face and eye-tracking—coming in strong contrast to the company’s other offering at the time, Quest 2. Nearly a year after launch, it was apparent the Pro-level headset wasn’t appealing to users nearly to the degree Meta had initially hoped, prompting the company to knock Quest Pro down to $1,000. To complicate matters, high initial pricing of Quest Pro put a strain on developers, which resulted in very few compelling MR experiences out of the gate. It was clear what was needed was a more accessible headset. In October 2023, Meta released Quest 3, which housed much of the tech seen in Quest Pro—minus face and eye-tracking, and at the starting price of $499. Clamping down yet further on price-performance, Meta released Quest 3S a year later, which houses the same Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chipset as Quest 3, although including the same cost-saving Fresnel lenses and displays as Quest 2—marking the company’s most energetic push to capitalize on its mixed reality ambitions. While Meta’s strategy to capture the console price-point with Quest has been a winning strategy thus far, what’s uncertain is whether the company will head back into the ‘Pro’ pricing structure anytime soon. The Information reported earlier last year that Meta was cancelling a potential Quest Pro follow-up, however Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth partically refuted those claims, noting that “there might be a Quest Pro 2, there might not be. I’m not really telling you, but I will say don’t believe everything you read about what’s been stopped or started.” This article may contain affiliate links.

To complicate matters, high initial pricing of Quest Pro put a strain on developers, which resulted in very few compelling MR experiences out of the gate. Of course. I don't understand why XR companies continue to learn the lesson the hard way. With Quest Pro, you could say that the device was not good enough. But now the Vision Pro, as good a device as you can get with today's tech, faces the same problem. PSVR2 almost died prematurely because of the same thing. "Make it desirable before it is affordable" has always been a stupid strategy. Meta's bottom-up approach is the only way. The reason is simple. Hardware need software to be "desirable" in the first place. And software development has adopted the business model of selling cheap copies to a large number of users. That means hardware designers don't really have a choice. The first question they need to ask is can we sell tens of millions of units. They stopped drinking the the Apple Kool Aid and escaped Apple's reality distortion field but now are really Jonesing that they didn't get some of that sexy eye-tracking! (Consumer) technology that was successful with a rather high price at the beginning, only affordable for a minority, but then used the money from that initial small, but lucrative market to improve tech and lower cost through both larger numbers and production cost reductions: PCs, laptops, telefones, mobile phones, smartphones, CD players, washing maschines, LED lighting, cars, power drills, tape recorder, VHS recorder, refrigerators, Walkman, laser printers, harddisks, SSD, beamer, microwave ovens… (Consumer) technology that became successful by pumping billions into it for more than a decade to push it into households without even making back a fraction of the investment:… And no, gaming consoles were sold with at least some profit for most of their existence, Nintendo never sold at a loss and Sony stopped doing so after the extremely expensive to produce PS3. I believe in XR, because I think that it is genuinely useful and will make people's lives better. But that is also the key to its mass adaption: it first has to become useful/usable (for some, then slowly) for the masses, like all the successful technologies listed above. Claiming that one billionaire's incredible expensive long term bet for more market control and money, enabled by his 60% of Meta's voting shares, would be the only viable approach, is completely ignoring how technology got established so far, blatently ignores the very limited active user numbers the highly subsidized USD 300 Quest collected for those billions, and replaces economic reasoning with wishful thinking. Palmer Luckey wrote a famous blog entry in 2018 titled "Free isn't cheap enough" about VR acceptance by most users. And it wasn't an opinion piece, but based on Oculus research that most people wouldn't use a VR HMD even if they got everything for free. With Quest we saw a ~40% retention rate, so 60% won't use a VR HMD they already paid for. Price is not the primary issue. USD 1500 would have been completely fine for a business oriented Quest Pro, if it had proven to be (sufficiently) useful for its official target audience. It just utterly failed to do so. All the items you mention to prove your point have one thing the Pro never had, enough consumers that wanted the product. That plus the price destroyed it. Only compounded by those low sales not encouraging devs to risk anything on making a killer app. Many of the products I listed could have only dreamt of the est. 50-100K unit sales during their first year that the Quest Pro generated. And there is a decent chance that Meta sold much more Quest Pro than Bigscreen sold Beyond or HTC sold Vive Focus 3. And that's fine, because these serve a niche audience with matching price calculations. But apparently not good enough for Meta. The Quest Pro's problem was that the concept was to create a professional HMD, but the only large enough use case they found was VR conferencing. And while the hardware was okay for that, the software wasn't anywhere near ready to make it actually useful. So almost nobody bought it for business use, and Meta tried to instead also sell it to gamers, where it offered very bad value. Had they clearly stated that gamers should wait for Quest 3, and also given the Pro the time and support that HTC gives their Pro HMDs, it might have found its niche, and established Quest for professional use, where service and reliability outweigh specs and price. But instead Meta dumped it once it didn't immediately deliver success/large numbers, like they did with several Go/Quest business programs before. Sometimes tech simply needs time to establish itself and then grow and mature from an initialy small use case snd user base, and trying to force it to grow faster will just fail. None of your examples are applicable. It is the symbiotic relationship between software and hardware that makes gaming consoles different from any "consumer electronics". The value of phones, PCs and laptops were clear even in the early days when there were just a few apps. On the other hand, the most common question you hear about the Vison Pro is "what do I do with it". A gaming console — in order to realize its entertainment value — needs a constant supply of games that are very expensive to develop but only have limited value for an individual. "Crowd funding" is the only viable business strategy. I am not saying you have to sell the consoles at a loss. Just do whatever you can to get them into as many hands as possible. Whenever I post whole lists of counter examples to show that your "we must force it into the market now" theories are not how technology is actually established, all I get is that none of them are applicable for unspecified reasons, because VR is somehow special, so known economic rules can't be applied. Also always ignoring that PCs and mobile phones started in the 70s, laptop in the 80s, with initially miniscule use cases and user numbers. Most people saw no practical use in buying one at all for literally decades. And people absolutely have an idea what to do with AVP, and be it only for watching movies. Just not at that weight and that price. How about you come up with examples where any company sucessfully established a technology that most customers at that time/state simply didn't care about, by just ruthlessly burning money for a decade? XR will succeed once it offers enough use for enough people, and until then it will do fine as a niche technology. The example is right in front of your eyes. It's called Quest 3S. It's sold more than PS5 and Xbox combined this holiday season. The kickstart process has completed. The Quest platform is now on a self-sustainable path. The reason Meta hasn't stopped pouring money is because it has bigger prizes in its sight. I don’t know if the path is self-sustainable, though. No one’s arguing that the Quest is the dominant VR platform. Given how much money Meta has put into it, it would be weird if it weren’t. But it’s not clear to me that Meta’s place in the market is so solid that they can’t be dethroned if they turn off the money hose. I have a large library of games on their store thanks to a referral system that I and others frankly abused for hundreds of dollars in free games, but if someone released a better headset and store, it wouldn’t stop me from switching. I might hang onto the Quest until I was bored with those games, but I would still switch. The real driver of sustainable XR adoption in the future is going to be everyday AR, and I’m not convinced that Meta is going to win that battle, or that their $100B investment into the opening act of gaming-focused VR is going to pay off. They’ve been very good at hardware design and aggressive pricing, but their leadership decisions (like the Quest Pro) show a lack of vision, and Meta’s AR efforts are tied to Microsoft, whose software efforts haven’t exactly covered themselves in glory lately. I don't know if Meta will be the eventual winner, but that's a different question. VR gaming is here to stay regardless because a large number of studios have found their footing in this industry thanks mostly to the Meta platform. Whether Meta will cede this ground to another company in the future or not, those developer will still be here with their accumulated knowledge and established reputation. The 2024 Quest 3S may have outsold the four year old PS5 in North America (Xbox sales are way lower, esp. internationally), but the PS5 reached 68mn in lifetime sales by 2024-11, leaving Quest 1/2/3S/3/Pro combined far behind, with much higher retention and follow-up game sales. And while Quest 3S sold better than Quest 3/Pro before (SUCCESS!!!), it sold less than its aging 2020 predecessor sold on Amazon during the 2023 holiday season. I'm fully aware why Meta keeps pouring money into XR, and what bigger prizes they are eying for. It's just very obvious that all their effort so far hasn't gotten them anywhere near to where their platform might be considered a potential threat to the Apple/Google mobile duopoly that those players will inevitably try to extend into XR by leveraging their huge user bases. And time is mostly working against Meta. It's been a threat to Apple and Google enough that they both decided they could not sit on the sidelines anymore. Pretty sure that AndroidXR is mostly a reaction to visionOS, and AVP mostly Tim Cook's decade long attempt to proof that he too can come up with revolutionary products, so his legacy won't be limited to "the great accountant that turned Apple into the first trillion dollar company." Doubt that Meta had a lot to do with it, if anything the lacking mass market acceptance of Quest showed them they didn't need to hurry. Yes but even apple who usually have a good sense and is able to create new trends, sort of didn't met it's usual standards. It seems the potential that enthousiasts see in VR isn't translating well to mortals yet. Sort of like how only nerds, scientists and army could see the point of the first computers. But the actual reality is maybe that it's not even sure that you could jump start a VR market right now by giving headsets away for free and releasing a HL Alyx type of game every month. The issue seems more and more a slow human paradigm shift to vr, than technical or financial reasons. Just think how many of us refused to use cell phones. I could have stayed without one for a long time if there was no sign I was about to be excluded naturaly of social activities. Is there something similar that is forcing people to VR yet ? No, not yet, but I think in maybe 10 or 20 years, something similair will start to happen probably. Well, if you believe human inertia is the main issue, then we can't just wait for this to happen right? Someone has to jumpstart the process. I tried to give my first gen headset to a gamer friend and he didn't want it, for what I consider bullshit reasons. This litteraly put in my face that it's not even guaranted that giving away headsets for free could jumpstart VR. I think John Carmack said something similar that even giving away 20000$ vr light glasses prototypes might not even be enough to jumpstart vr in the way the hype expected it 8 years ago. Because VR already started and is not going away, it just seems that consumer usage rate will increase slower than what we hoped or expected. That’s much different than a niche entertainment device. You are talking about a whole technology, computers as we know it. Not fitness goggles Computers were used for much much more than beat saber All of what your describe are slow evolutions of things that started 50 or 100 years ago. For instance, between the gramophone and the CD player, there isn't that much evolution in how it's used. Same between an oven and a microwave oven. Between regular screen, and VR there is a huge paradigm shift, probably even bigger than between books and text on a screen. TL;DR: VR came the same long path as any other technology, and is based on very similar usage patterns, people just don't realize because they forget/don't know/ignore its long winded history. What's special about VR is the high level of immersion thanks to using a display type with head tracking, most of the rest is reusing tech/content from somewhere else. The first head mounted display was shown 1968 by Ivan Sutherland, and that one is literally why we call VR headsets HMD. So that's 56 years ago, and there were stereoscopic multimedia displays before, like the 1962 Sensorama (lacking head tracking) now considered early VR devices. And VR continuously crept forward, first only experimental, then for military, than as business and research tool since the 90's. Only consumer VR is still less than 15 years old, and it was 100% an evolutionary technology enabled by hires phone displays and GPUs running predistortion shaders that allowed using much cheaper lenses that previous HMDs. And the "paradigm shift" is head tracking, which allows for a 360° FoV incl. head turns, which massively increases immersion thanks to being in the world rather than looking at it through a small window. Stereoscopy only matters at close range. We already had 3D games you could run and look around in for more than a quarter of a century, where you turned the camera with the mouse instead of you head. RE4/8 on PSVR2 can be played both flat or in VR, there is no fundamental difference like between fixed text on paper vs changeable text on a screen that allows for many more and different use cases than a book. There is a new generation drawn to VR by viral Gorilla Tag videos on TikTok showing a fun way to spend time with friends, but even they will immediarely realize that this is basically just another type of video game played on a new type of display you strap to your head, which allows for the extra immersion only VR can provide. Everything else is mostly an evolution of previous tech, recycled once again. For example the 2006 Nintendo Wiimote was already an inside-out 5DoF controller, and by adding a second (controller/camera), you could do 6DoF tracking a decade before the Oculus Touch controllers appeared. I have good reasons why I compare the evolution of VR with other consumer electronics, and why I seriously doubt that Meta's pay-to-win strategy of endless subsidizing has a chance to still succeed, let alone would make sense for any other company. A decade after buying Oculus they are short USD ~100bn for less than 1% of Apple's/Google's active user base, with the Quest 3S selling less on Amazon during the last holiday season than the Quest 2 the year before. At this point Meta's best bet seem to be their Ray-Ban smart glasses, with many companies showing similar glasses with integrated displays at CES 2025. Simply because people actually like and buy these, because they consider them useful, without the need to massivey subsidize them. Just like with other technology before. Since we talk about commerical stuff, what matters is when the paradigm shift was made available to consumers more than when it was invented. In this regard, there is 90 years between the gramophone available to consumers and the cd. I can say I had the Razer Hydra, and had first taste of 1:1 tracking, and also toyed with wiimote as a trackir, or that famous paralax track ir video, that make you understand that paralax can have a pop out effect similar to stereoscopy, and also played with the cardboard. Despite all that and knowing the VR is reusing existing technologies, like you could say for all tech by the way, I consider the VR as a paradigm shift made available for consumers, only happened in 2016, with the Vive and Rift. So to me, 8 years is nothing at a human society level for something that changes so much how we interact with virtuality, wich we mostly did only by looking at flast screens until now. So I agree that technically it's just the viewport on the virtual world that is different, this is clear and simple to me as it is to you that it's not a huge technological leap. But psychologically this seems to be huge leap to many people. Either because it's too much virtual intensity, or change too much how they got used to enjoy videogames, or that it seems to nerdy. You could pour billions in that, you couldn't change this type of perception prejudices and inertia in less than 1 human generation probably. I am not beeing negative, and wish it was different, but I am starting to think this is the only rational explanation to how slow it feels it's developping, for something that maybe us tech geeks who always dreamed about that, do not feel it changes that much the paradigm. That's why I think the CD compared to tapes, or smartphone compared to dumb phone, is a bad comparison, because the paradigm shift timeline isn't comparable yet. I've been waiting for VR since the 90's, and when usable HMDs finally appeared a few years ago, I was sure it would take the world by storm, because this was obviously the medium of the future I had been dreaming about for decades. And then I was completely baffled when that didn't happen, and the world just didn't care. I must have demoed VR to hundreds of people, all of which were wowed, but almost none ever got a HMD themselves. Very few even asked later if they could try it again. Instead mobile games, the probably least immersive form of video games with the most simplified input played on a display covering ~6° of the horizontal FoV took over more than 50% of all gaming revenue within a few years, and much more of the total play time. So something didn't work out. I am actually very disappointed that those few who care about VR are mostly interested in games, while for me VR was always primarily a brain enhancement tool. But at some point I realized that the enourmous potential of VR I still have in my head is only loosely related to what is currently possible, or to what most people are looking for from any technology, which is mostly help with practical use cases, and convenience without requiring a lot of effort. I think VR is great because of what I expect it (one day) could do, while most people only look at what it currently actually does, which (unless you value immersion way more than most) isn't a lot besides a wow effect that quickly wears of with miserable ergonomics. So my own positive view includes a lot of projection not really based on the current state of the technology. Which is why I don't see a paradigm shift or even (un-)typical inertia when adapting something new: people have always embraced new technology once it became good enough to improve their lives, and all the technologies listed above were established that way, first by a few willing to go the extra mile, and only later by the masses, once all the rough edges were gone and the use both obvious and effortless. And VR simply isn't there yet, or anywhere close go it. It's still mostly a fancy toy for the more nerdy part of the population with seemingly endless potential, but currently only very limited practical use. The big mistake we inside the VR bubble make is insisting that the already available benefits are enough, when in reality they only matter for a rather small group of future oriented enthusiasts. For the vast majority VR simply doesn't offer enough yet to be worth the hassle. IMHO we are the anomaly, the rest of the world that can't be bothered with VR so far are the ones doing a more realistic cost/benefit evaluation based on their own priorities. We are still in the gramophone phase with a total of ten records availabe that tend to break after a few uses despite the required huge investment in money, effort and space. Still a huge improvement over the wax covered cylinders used in phonographs, but not yet as user friendly as vinyl records with electric amplifiers with speakers, idiot proof as CDs or as convenient as iPods. And for a lot of people VR will only become interesting once it becomes lile Spotify: its just there and works everywhere without ever having to worry what's going on in the background. It took 50 years for consoles phones and PCs and other regular screen based devices to get were they are. VR could be just small light glasses with low price, it wouldn't change that it will take time for people to integrate this in their life. If you think about flat panels, many people didn't want one because Yes, it'll take time for VR to be as popular as phones and TVs, but it doesn't mean it can't exist in a meaningful way and bring value to millions of people today. However, someone needs to jumpstart the process, which is exactly what Meta did. You can still buy Quest Pro’s ‘Touch Pro’ controllers however, as they support Quest 2 and above. Thank god. Those were what convinced me as someone coming from PC VR headset with none insight out tracked controllers (Rift CV1 and Valve Index) to even consider a Quest 3. Meta, discontinuing those controllers in the future or even with your next headset would be a big mistake. Just release a Quest 3 premium or Quest 4 with oled screen ASAP… That’s all what matters Quest Pro isn't OLED The price of the Quest Pro is proof that meta cannot sell headsets at the actual cost, $1k should be the price of the Quest 3S while the Quest Pro should be $2k or so. Meta can only sell garbage because customers are not willing to pay the actual costs due to the garbage performance and garbage graphics the headset delivers. This is why Meta loses BILLIONS per month. they just reported record profit, where do you get your information from? If you go to upload VR and see meta-reality-labs-q3-2024-revenue-rebound-continues You will find that Meta's VR division has lost about $50 billion since its 2020 creation. You do understand the difference between revenue and profit/income? You realize that all Meta's VR efforts are just to get to AR right? Ray Bans with full phone capability is the end goal, take Samsung, Apple, Google market share in hardware via AR. Yes, 100% that Meta wants to enslave its users both capturing everything you see and here and simultaneiously blocking what you see and here depending on their censorship algorithms in the real world. They will also debank you as the ultimate weapon against thought crime. I am also glad you agree that meta VR has lost $50 billion since its inception of 2020 and is continuing to lose BILLIONS per month in order to sell people garbage hardware. VR Industry would be pretty much nothing without that Meta cash infusion. Yes of course they want to make money eventually, that is their reason for existence. I too am not in favor of our tech overlords, and yet I still want it. I suppose that you eschew the use of all non ethical VR systems? The VR industry is composed mostly of garbageware games that have retarded what VR was since 2020. Meta has done nothing but drag the entire industry down. If you look at any full time VR Youtuber, they will admit like Mateo that graphics have become retarded in VR. They just accept the retardation of the industry otherwise they couldn't stay in VR and be saine. VR Content creators for the most part are chearleading garbageware to keep the views and their sanity. I would like an ethical approach to Reviewing VR content. Garbage Mobile VR should be labeled separately even if this garbage is ported to steam/psvr2. Unless the ports are outstandig like Star Wars Tailes from the Galaxy's Edge Enhaced Edition on PSVR2, all mobile garbage ware should get a tag. When people review discuss mobile ports, they should indidcate that their judgement and scale is based on mobile garbage hardware and is not a comparison against Modern Hardware (Console/PC). That would help with transparency. It would also educate people who simply believe Meta Mobile Garbage is what all VR is like. IT IS NOT. We need to break meta mobile garbage hardware's hold on the market. The only way is education because Meta is already losing billions per month trying to capture the public. You seem pretty negative, what are some things you think aren’t garbage? There are some very great experiences available for console/pc vr. "Gran Turismo 7" (Paid) & "My First Gran Turismo" (Free) are the pinnacle of VR on PS5. Of course "Horizon Call of the Mountain" is awesome. The demo is a great entryway to show people what VR is like (the boat ride scene allows people to adjust). "Until You Fall" is probably the best VR Melee combat game on the market (avaiable on all platforms). The graphics on PC/PSVR2 are good. I don't believe it is a work out game, it is simply a result of good physics. "Star Wars Tails from the Galaxy's Edge" is a really great experience that provides many different VR interactions coupled with adequate progression. I also enjoyed embodying several different unique characters from the SW universe. I also enjoyed "Arizona Sunshine 2", that was when the studio was still PC focused. Veritgo Games is now focused on Mobile Garbage hardware and it shows with how terrible metro is when compared to their fairly old Arizona Sunshine 2. For awesome graphics and a great puzzle game, Red Matter 2 is it. I don’t do consoles although I did like Gran Turismo 2 on an emulator in prep for driving my FD3S on Laguna Seca. Of course just using the headset as a display etc results in better quality graphics, Meta nor anybody else has 4090 quality on a headset. I guess you are just not a fan of any standalone VR. The best melee in Battle Talent in MR mode, it’s really good. Still haven’t found a better fighting sim than Thrill of the Fight despite the terrible graphics. Without Dynamic Foveated Rendering (DFR), the nvidia rtx 4090 is simply not good enough. The next rtx5090 won't be good enough either. Eye tracking is that important to graphics and Meta has proven they really don't care about eye tracking because their goal isn't making great gaming VR headsets. It is as you pointed out, making garbage hardware they can push onto the masses. It is really a big loss for PSVR2 on PC to not have implemented Eye Tracking. I can understand that Sony maybe didn't want to pay Tobii licensing fees on the PC for the eye tracking software – that is my suspecision of why eye tracking is not on PC for PSVR2. DFR is what allows GT7 to look so good on the PSVR2. Without eye tracking, the graphics would be much worse. Even on garbage hardware like Quest 3, eye tracking COULD allow for higher graphics rendering. But meta doesn't care about that. They care about TEXT and hand tracking. They don't care about VR gaming. I’ve never had the opportunity to try eye tracking. Hand tracking still isn’t great, it feels awkward to me. I’d rather have full body tracking. I mean, Meta put eye tracking on Quest Pro, seems maybe it cost too much to do it on the Quest 3. No. He is a known elitist troll and the opposite of Virgin. He will shit on any standalone VR because he couldn't accept that PCVR will never be main stream by itself. Aw look who's been watching Black Mirror. I really enjoyed watching Black Mirror – it is almost as if they are telling us their play book ahead of time. Michael (incel) Speth: Garbage graphics etc. Yup. Just blocked him. Not worth reading any of his content. Quest pro should never have been released, the fact that it did shows a poor working culture inside meta

AP Photo/Lauren Victoria Burke Staffers at The Washington Post are braced for a wave of layoffs that could reshape the paper’s future, with cuts expected to be announced this week, according to a new report from Oliver Darcy. Darcy’s Status newsletter reported Sunday that one source said that the layoffs will focus on the newspaper’s “business division” and impact “dozens of employees.” “One person familiar with the matter said that the cuts will be deep, impacting many dozens of employees,” Darcy wrote. These anticipated layoffs follow an exodus of prominent talent after the newspaper, owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, recently lost a number of big names, including managing editor Matea Gold, Ashley Parker, Michael Scherer, Charles Lane, Tyler Pager, and Amanda Katz – several of which were poached by The Atlantic. The news comes just after Darcy broke the news that reporter Josh Dawsey was set to leave The Post to join the Wall Street Journal. According to Status, The Post’s struggles are partly attributed to finances that have seen better days. Those familiar with internal discussions say that top management has not kept these challenges under wraps. “Those financial problems were exacerbated when Bezos blocked The Post’s planned endorsement of Kamala Harris ahead of the November election, a move that led to more than 250,000 readers canceling their subscriptions,” Darcy noted. A spokesperson for The Post declined to offer immediate comment to Status on the revelation. Have a tip or story idea? Email us. Or to keep it anonymous, click here.

Title: Intel's rise and fall: A timeline of what went wrong

Time Published: 2025-01-06T09:15:00Z

Getty Images Intel has been a dominant player for much of the modern computing age. Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce founded Intel in 1968. The company's name comes from the phrase "integrated electronics." In the 1980s, Intel established the x86 CPU architecture, which became the standard in consumer and many business applications for several decades. Intel's hardware portfolio spans consumer and enterprise CPUs, memory, storage and networking technologies. The company also develops software that supports its hardware and contributes to open source software development. In recent years, Intel has faced increasing competition, leading the company to fall from grace. Rival x86 chipmaker AMD has been aggressively challenging Intel's share with its performance gains. Alternative chip architectures, including Arm, have become increasingly popular leading to further erosion of Intel's dominance. GPU maker Nvidia has outpaced Intel in the AI space leading to even further losses. The market challenges have hit Intel hard. Intel's stock has been steadily declining, dropping by over 50% in 2024 alone. In November 2024, Intel was removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average and replaced with Nvidia because S&P Global representatives said Nvidia was more representative of the semiconductor industry and Nvidia's share price was higher than Intel's. Then in December 2024, CEO Pat Gelsinger was forced to retire as the company's board of directors looked to reset the ailing company's direction. Intel was not an instant success. Intel's rise was achieved over decades of milestones and innovations that helped the company to succeed. 1971. Intel created its first CPU, the 4004. However, the company was initially more successful with its SRAM and DRAM memory chips. 1981. The biggest early win for Intel came in 1981 when IBM selected Intel's 8088 processor for its PCs. 1982. The 80286 -- commonly referred to as just the '286' -- processor debuted, introducing separate data buses and memory management capabilities. 1985. The 80386, or 386, debuted marking Intel's first production 32-bit architecture chip, with support of 4GB of memory. 1989. The 80486, or i486. was released further advancing Intel's CPU performance. With its integrated features and on-chip cache, it was the first x86 processor to have more than 1 million transistors. 1991. Intel launched its Intel Inside marketing campaign for PCs with its chips, and television commercials became a cultural phenomenon. The public's understanding of CPUs and what was inside a PC was lacking prior to that campaign. 1993. Intel rebranded its processors under the Pentium name. 1998. Intel debuts the Xeon process line for servers. 1999. Intel and Windows maker Microsoft -- commonly referred to as Wintel -- are added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average. 2005. Apple transitions its Macintosh computers from Motorola's PowerPC to Intel's x86 processors, leading to a 15-year partnership. While Intel gained early success in the PC market, its decline was marked by the company's failure to quickly recognize growth and potential new markets. In the early 2000s, with the early era of mobile computing, Intel had a golden opportunity to get in on the ground floor. Apple asked Intel to help supply chips to power the iPhone in 2007. Then Intel CEO Paul Otellini declined the deal, on the premise that he didn't think the iPhone was going to be a high-volume business. Apple ended up going with an Arm-based chip, and today, Arm dominates the mobile space. Intel's decline is also a testament to the intense competition in the market. Rival chip makers have been actively aiming at Intel on multiple fronts. In 2017, AMD introduced its Ryzen processors, providing comparable or superior performance to the equivalent Intel chips of the day, albeit at a lower price point. Chip fabrication has also been an area of weakness for Intel as the company struggled to transition to smaller, more efficient chip designs. This allowed competitors, such as TSMC and Samsung, to effectively challenge Intel in silicon manufacturing capabilities. Intel's decline is also directly related to how it missed out on properly developing competitive GPU technology and taking part in the AI revolution. GPUs have become an essential technology in AI accelerators which are the foundation of generative AI. In the early era of GPUs during the late 1990s, Nvidia as well as ATI -- acquired by AMD in 2006 -- led the market. Intel tried unsuccessfully to build its own GPU technology including the i740 which ultimately was abandoned. Instead, Intel focused on developing integrated graphics capabilities for its processors, which never attracted much attention from gamers who rely on GPUs. In 2019, Intel acquired Habana Labs for $2 billion to enter the AI accelerator market. The Habana Guadi processors have not kept pace with Nvidia. For example, the Gaudi 3 chip announced in April 2024 did not compare favorably against the leading edge of Nvidia's portfolio. In November 2024, Intel admitted during an earnings call that the Gaudi processor was going to miss the company's revenue targets. Intel has made other mistakes and missed opportunities that have hurt the company's position. Itanium was a processor family that debuted in 2001. It developed through a partnership between Intel and Hewlett-Packard and derived from HP's PA-RISC architecture. The original goal was to create a new server architecture that would have positioned Intel for server dominance. The chips, however, did not offer proper x86 compatibility and were ultimately surpassed in the market by x86-64 architecture originally developed by AMD. Intel released the final Itanium processor in 2017. Intel's acquisition strategy also includes a series of expensive missteps. Despite paying $7.7 billion to acquire security vendor McAfee in 2010, Intel could not successfully integrate the business into Intel in a way that would have benefited the entire organization. Intel spun McAfee out into a separate company in 2016. In 2017, Intel acquired Mobileye for $15 billion and failed to fully benefit from the technology of mobile innovations into Intel's core technology platform. Mobileye was spun out as its own company in 2022. Intel's struggles extended to its product development and quality control. In 2024, Intel faced multiple class-action lawsuits over instability issues with its 13th and 14th-generation Raptor Lake processors. One of the biggest missed opportunities was in 2017 when Intel was offered and declined to invest in OpenAI. This deal would have required the AI pioneer to use Intel hardware. Though Intel faces multiple challenges it is still a strong technology vendor with options. Analysts contacted by Informa TechTarget provided their thoughts on what Intel should do to survive. The Intel 18A is an underdevelopment initiative from Intel for the next generation of semiconductor technology. The 18A refers to the size of transistors at 1.8 angstroms, or Å, and this smaller transistor size offers more computing performance packed into a chip. The Intel 18A strategy also includes the development of a new architecture known as RibbonFET, or Ribbon Field Effect Transistor, which Intel claims offers more performance per watt than prior chip architecture designs. "Intel doesn't have any quick and easy solutions," said Raj Joshi, senior vice president of Moody's Ratings. "It needs to execute its Intel 18A process node technology plan and demonstrate it can produce high volumes of wafers cost-effectively on that node. It also needs to execute its product design plans more effectively." Patrick Moorhead, CEO and chief analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy, believes that Intel needs to get back to leadership with PCs, data center CPUs and data center GPUs. "Intel made strides in PC and data center CPU designs but is still losing market share," Moorhead stated. Moorhead believes Intel has the right idea with Gaudi in AI data centers, but the hyperscalers have built their own. Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and Google all have their own accelerators. Moorhead noted that for training and inference, the entire market wants high-performance, low-precision bit-rate GPUs. Beyond technology innovation, Moorhead suggests that Intel needs to be more efficient overall. "It's not just about cutting headcount. It's changing how work gets done," Moorhead said. "Intel needs to beware of cutting too much in sales and marketing or they're going to invite AMD, Qualcomm and Nvidia to take market share." Olivier Blanchard, practice lead at Futurum's Devices, said Intel's path forward shouldn't focus on correcting past mistakes. "Unfortunately, Intel can't climb into a time machine and erase any of the decisions that created the challenges it faces today," Blanchard said. For instance, he added that Intel couldn't reboot its GPU business quickly enough to compensate for a decade of misses and failures. According to Blanchard, Intel needs to create as many paths to revenue growth as possible -- including its fabrication business -- which Intel has the chance to achieve with support from the CHIPS and Science Act funding. "I also expect that Intel's importance to U.S. national security and broad economic interests will continue to give it access to a wide set of onshoring and chip fab repatriation opportunities," Blanchard said. "Execution is a whole different story, but the opportunity is there." Forrester Research analyst Alvin Nguyen says that Intel needs a new CEO to lead the company in the right direction. In Nguyen's view, Intel needs their new CEO to do the following: Sean Michael Kerner is an IT consultant, technology enthusiast and tinkerer. He has pulled Token Ring, configured NetWare and been known to compile his own Linux kernel. He consults with industry and media organizations on technology issues.

Getty Images Intel has been a dominant player for much of the modern computing age. Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce founded Intel in 1968. The company's name comes from the phrase "integrated electronics." In the 1980s, Intel established the x86 CPU architecture, which became the standard in consumer and many business applications for several decades. Intel's hardware portfolio spans consumer and enterprise CPUs, memory, storage and networking technologies. The company also develops software that supports its hardware and contributes to open source software development. In recent years, Intel has faced increasing competition, leading the company to fall from grace. Rival x86 chipmaker AMD has been aggressively challenging Intel's share with its performance gains. Alternative chip architectures, including Arm, have become increasingly popular leading to further erosion of Intel's dominance. GPU maker Nvidia has outpaced Intel in the AI space leading to even further losses. The market challenges have hit Intel hard. Intel's stock has been steadily declining, dropping by over 50% in 2024 alone. In November 2024, Intel was removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average and replaced with Nvidia because S&P Global representatives said Nvidia was more representative of the semiconductor industry and Nvidia's share price was higher than Intel's. Then in December 2024, CEO Pat Gelsinger was forced to retire as the company's board of directors looked to reset the ailing company's direction. Intel was not an instant success.

Title: Live Pillar Leads Gains as CE 100 Index Bucks Broader Markets

Time Published: 2025-01-06T09:00:12Z
Full Content:
The CE 100 Index ended the last few days of 2024 and the first few days of the new year with a slight gain, adding 0.3%, while broader markets fell across the board. The Live Pillar pulled ahead by 2.3%, buoyed by iRobot, a volatile name that was up more than 24% through the week, though without any company-specific news, by Porch Group, which gained 7.5% and by Zillow, up 2.1%. The Eat segment was 2.2% higher; restaurant tech Olo advanced by 6.3% and DoorDash was 3.3% higher. Olo shares moved on the news, as reported by Yahoo Finance, that RBC Capital analyst Matthew Hedberg increased the sell-side firm’s price target on Olo to $9 from $8, while maintaining an “outperform” rating on the name. But the Work segment countered those gains, sliding 2.2%. Xerox gave up 9.6%, giving back some of the gains that had been seen after the company struck a deal to buy Lexmark for $1.5 billion. Workday’s stock was off by 5%. In a December announcement, Workday and Guardian Life Insurance Company of America announced an expanded partnership, with the insurance firm becoming one of its strategic Workday Wellness partners. According to the announcement, Workday Wellness, an AI-powered solution, will give Guardian customers real-time insights into how their employees are using their benefits, leading to tailored benefits programs within Workday and improved overall employee experience. Guardian will introduce new application programming interface (API) connections with Workday as part of the expanded pact. Apple’s stock slipped 4.8%. As reported this past week, the tech juggernaut has agreed to pay $95 million to settle a privacy lawsuit centered on its voice assistant, Siri. The plaintiffs had argued that when Siri was activated unintentionally, the voice-activated assistant shared private discussions it overheard, and Apple allegedly shared those discussions with third parties — whereupon ads were sent to plaintiffs after mentioning various products. A preliminary settlement was filed on Dec. 31 but must be approved by a U.S. district judge. The proposed settlement requires Apple to address alleged privacy violations outlined in the lawsuit by confirming it has permanently deleted Siri audio recordings obtained before October 2019. FedEx’s shares gave up 2.2%, helping lead the Move pillar down by 0.2%. The shares lost ground as the company noted toward the end of December that its latest quarterly results saw revenues slip by 1% to $22 billion and it is streamlining operations by focusing on its DRIVE program and separating FedEx Freight into a standalone, publicly traded company. This move aims to unlock value for shareholders while allowing the two businesses to remain strategically aligned, management said during the call with analysts to discuss results. Management also noted during the call the challenges faced by FedEx during the quarter included a soft global industrial economy and competitive pricing pressures. Also within the Move segment, Tesla’s stock was 4.9% lower. Data from Tesla’s latest delivery report noted that the company had delivered a bit more than 495,900 vehicles on a global basis, up from 484,500 last year but below consensus analyst estimates on Wall Street of around 510,000 vehicles. For the year, the 1.78 million vehicles delivered marked a slight decline from 2023 levels — the first annual decline for Tesla. The company has stated in the past that growth rates might be lower than had been seen in 2023, as the firm set its sights on its next generation vehicles, as detailed by sites such as Yahoo Finance. Microsoft said that it plans to invest $80 billion to build data centers in fiscal 2025, aiming to use them to power the development and use of artificial intelligence (AI). The company is doing so amid a “golden opportunity for American AI,” Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith wrote in a blog post that debuted on Friday. More than half of this investment in AI infrastructure will be deployed in the United States, according to the post. Microsoft plans to train 2.5 million Americans with AI skills. “AI, like all new technologies, will disrupt the economy and displace some jobs,” Smith wrote. “But as we’ve working on skilling initiatives during the past few years, our confidence has grown that AI will create new opportunities that will outweigh many of the challenges ahead.” The company’s stock was down 1.7% through the week, though the overall Enablers vertical, as tracked by PYMNTS, was 0.7% higher. In other AI related-news, Meta is looking toward a future where AI characters generate content on its social media platforms Instagram and Facebook. These AI characters will exist alongside existing accounts on the platforms, Connor Hayes, vice president of product for generative AI at Meta, told the Financial Times. Meta shares gained 0.8%, which helped the overall performance of the Enablers. “They’ll have bios and profile pictures and be able to generate and share content powered by AI on the platform … that’s where we see all of this going,” Hayes said. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Significantly high institutional ownership implies Taylor Wimpey's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions A total of 21 investors have a majority stake in the company with 51% ownership Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a business To get a sense of who is truly in control of Taylor Wimpey plc (LON:TW.), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 79% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk). Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait. In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Taylor Wimpey. View our latest analysis for Taylor Wimpey Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Taylor Wimpey. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Taylor Wimpey's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Taylor Wimpey is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that BlackRock, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 13% of shares outstanding. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 4.9% of common stock, and UBS Asset Management AG holds about 3.5% of the company stock. Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 21 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership. While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily. While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it. I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions. Our information suggests that Taylor Wimpey plc insiders own under 1% of the company. It's a big company, so even a small proportional interest can create alignment between the board and shareholders. In this case insiders own UK£3.5m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. The general public-- including retail investors -- own 19% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should learn about the 3 warning signs we've spotted with Taylor Wimpey (including 1 which makes us a bit uncomfortable) . If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.

Super Micro Computer (SMCI) shares are likely to remain in the spotlight to start the week after jumping more than 10% Friday to snap a five-session losing streak and log their best one-day performance since early December. Supermicro is looking to move past a volatile 2024 in which accounting and corporate governance issues led to several delayed financial reports. However, CEO Charles Liang said last month that postponed filings will be completed by a Feb. 25 deadline issued by the Nasdaq, easing concerns about a potential delisting. Sentiment may have also received a boost after Microsoft (MSFT) announced Friday that it plans to spend about $80 billion this fiscal year on data centers that power artificial intelligence (AI), a move that could benefit the server maker through increased partnerships and hardware sales. Supermicro shares ended last year with a 7% gain, but surged more than four-fold between January and March before slumping as much as 85% from their record high. Below, we break down the technicals on Supermicro’s chart and identify key price levels worth watching out for. Since mid-July, Supermicro shares have oscillated within an orderly descending broadening formation, with the stock tagging both the pattern’s upper and lower trendline on several occasions since that time. More recently, the price has traded in a narrow range since mid-December but closed above the 50-day moving average (MA) on Friday on the highest trading volume in over a week. Let’s take a closer look at key support and resistance levels on Supermicro’s chart that investors may be eyeing. The bulls' inability to hold the 50-day MA could initially lead to a retest of the $26 level. Investors may look for entry points in this location near the high of a brief countertrend rally in early November. A decisive breakdown below this level may see Supermicro shares drop to around $18, an area about 46% below Friday's closing price where they would likely encounter significant support near the prominent November swing low. Follow-through buying this week could propel a move up to the $39 level, an area currently just below the broadening formation’s upper trendline. The shares may run into selling pressure in this region near two key troughs that formed on the chart in September. Further upside could see the shares climb to around $50, where they may encounter resistance near a trendline that connects a range of comparable price points on the chart from the early-August trough to December peak. Finally, a more bullish move could drive a move to the $63 level. Investors who have purchased the stock at lower prices may look for profit-taking opportunities around the August swing high, which currently sits in close proximity to the downward sloping 200-day MA.

Delta Air Lines (DAL) is set to report earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 before markets open Friday, with analysts expecting increases in revenue and adjusted profit. Analysts are bullish on the airline, with all 13 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha maintaining a "buy" rating on Delta stock. The analysts have an average price target of $76.85 for the stock, which would be a gain of 30% from its closing level of $59 Friday. The airline is projected to report $14.87 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter, up about 4.6% from the same time last year. Net income, however, is expected to decline 45% to $1.12 billion from $2.04 billion a year earlier. Delta's fourth-quarter 2023 net income was boosted by a positive adjustment to the value of the carrier's investments, as its stake in the Wheels Up (UP) private air travel service became more valuable thanks to an jump in the company's share price in that quarter. After accounting for the value change, Delta's adjusted net income came in at $826 million a year ago, and is expected to have risen to $1.15 billion. At the airline's investor day in November, Delta said rising demand for travel across generational lines made the company confident that it will continue to see revenue growth for its premium seating products. Delta said it expects revenue and earnings per share (EPS) to rise in the coming years as its premium products expand and its profit margins improve. The airline is also still in the midst of its legal fight with CrowdStrike (CRWD) after filing a lawsuit late last year seeking damages for last summer's Windows outage caused by a CrowdStrike update that led to thousands of Delta flights being canceled and $500 million in costs. CrowdStrike has said it is not responsible for Delta's handling of the outage, and has sought the dismissal of the lawsuit by citing a liability and damages cap clause in their contract, CNBC reported last month. The airline's stock has risen nearly 50% over the past 12 months.

By Dade Hayes Business Editor In addition to its main purpose as a showcase for the latest gadgets, CES has long been a meeting ground for entertainment players. This year’s edition, getting under way Monday in Las Vegas, will be no exception and is unfolding amid an elevated sense of urgency for traditional media companies to get right with the lords of technology. With theatrical box office and linear television in decline and layoffs continuing to thin the industry’s ranks, tech provides in some ways a welcome source of optimism despite its many complications and a culture still distinct from Hollywood’s. Related Stories News Disney Says It Has Averaged 157M Global Monthly Streaming Users (And 112M Domestic) Over Past Six Months News NBCU, Fox, WBD, DirecTV & Comcast Execs Say Their Unusual Ad Collaboration Can Help Close The Gap With Big Tech On top of CES mainstays like Sony, Panasonic and other hardware firms holding court again with massive booths, Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery and SAG-AFTRA are among those with a presence. NBCUniversal, Amazon, Roku and Fox Corp. are among many making announcements and having execs on panels. Two of the confab’s handful of keynote speeches are by the CEOs of SiriusXM and Nvidia. Watch on Deadline The latter company, which has had a meteoric rise to a $3.5 trillion market cap, is more than 30 years old but until recent years hasn’t been thought of as particularly connected with Hollywood. Its AI chips and technology are now central to animation, special effects and many other parts of the industry. Jeffrey Katzenberg, who took one of history’s biggest swings at CES by unveiling the venture-funded (and ultimately short-lived) streaming startup Quibi there in 2020, is returning to help kick off OpenAP’s Audience Summit. The industry consortium’s half-day event will feature high-level execs (Amazon’s Krishan Bhatia, Fox Corp.’s Jeff Collins and TelevisaUnivision’s Donna Speciale among them) discussing the challenges and opportunities of streaming. Michael Kassan, former head of MediaLink, will once again preside as a panel moderator and connector via his new company, 3C Ventures. The exec had a bitter and public breakup with UTA, which acquired MediaLink and then fell out with Kassan. The two have exchanged lawsuits. UTA and MediaLink, for their part, are also making the scene in Las Vegas, hosting a party with a musical performance by Meghan Trainor. Advertising has become a key theme at CES as dollars continue to shift from traditional buckets into digital and streaming. “It’s like a kickoff to the upfronts,” NBCU head of advertising and partnerships Mark Marshall told Deadline in an interview. “We really start our upfront conversations at CES, so it has been a priority for us.” NBCU is looking to build interest across a number of major tentpoles heading toward the company’s 100th anniversary in fall 2026. “We’re really looking at ’25 and ’26 as one thing,” Marshall said. A new edition of BravoCon, golf’s Ryder Cup, the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics, the 60th Super Bowl, the NBA’s return; the FIFA World Cup on Telemundo – “All of those things were not on NBC in this upfront,” he noted, meaning the next one “will be a massive one for us.” Disney, similarly, has positioned its prelude to the upfronts, the Global Tech + Data Showcase, as an annual live CES presentation, delivered by livestream to those not in Las Vegas. “We have really invested, over the last decade, in technology that differentiates us from all of our traditional competitors,” Disney President of Global Advertising Rita Ferro explained in a recent in-house interview. “We can also compete with any of the new technology platforms, and what sets us apart across all of those is truly our scale. The ability to have the amount of content that we have across sports, which is a hugely popular marketplace right now in terms of advertisers and where they’re spending their dollars, is also a differentiator.” WBD, meanwhile, has also been ramping up its brand efforts on Max, deploying sponsor integrations and targeted advertising. The third season of HBO’s White Lotus, which will premiere in mid-February, is the focus of a “Taste of Thailand” party at CES, complete with a synergistic cooking demonstration by a Food Network chef preparing the cuisine of this season’s setting. Analysts looking at the intersection of entertainment and technology continue to see upside for the companies that manage to make the most of shifting consumer habit. Tim Nollen of Macquarie last month took note of a study by the Association of National Advertisers showing year-over-year improvements in the ad value chain. “Ad tech is becoming more efficient,” Nollen wrote, with figures in the report that “seem to point to an ad tech market that is growing up, with scaled players accruing benefits.” Technology has undeniable allure, but it is also a complex force for creative stakeholders in film, TV and streaming. SAG-AFTRA, which seized on AI as a key issue in its 2023 strike against studios and streamers, is back at CES for its annual LIT Conference, short for “labor innovation and technology.” Duncan Crabtree, SAG-AFTRA’s National Executive Director & Chief Negotiator, will speak at the event, as will DGA National Executive Director Russell Hollander and senior officials from the WGA, IATSE and other guilds.

Cover image: Bags of chilli outside a wholesaler in the George Town area of Chennai in 2024 by the author. Emblematic of Chennai’s role as a major spice trading hub. Spices have been a cornerstone of South Indian commerce for centuries, and Chennai, with its strategic port location, has long been a key player in this trade. The prominence of chilli highlights its significance in South Indian cuisine and culture. While modern supermarkets and online platforms are changing consumer habits, wholesale markets like those in George Town continue to serve an essential function in the supply chain. Colin Todhunter is an independent researcher and writer and has spent many years in India. He is a research associate of the Centre for Research on Globalisation (Montreal) and writes on food, agriculture and development issues. In 2018, in recognition of his writing, he was named a Living Peace and Justice Leader and Model by Engaging Peace Inc. 𝐂𝐨𝐥𝐢𝐧 𝐓𝐨𝐝𝐡𝐮𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫 – Academia.edu Aruna Rodrigues, lead petitioner in the GMO mustard Public Interest Litigation in the Supreme Court of India, stated the following about the author’s 2022 e-book Food, Dispossession and Dependency. Resisting the New World Order: “Colin Todhunter at his best: this is graphic, a detailed horror tale in the making for India, an exposé on what is planned, via the farm laws, to hand over Indian sovereignty and food security to big business. There will come a time pretty soon — (not something out there but imminent, unfolding even now), when we will pay the Cargills, Ambanis, Bill Gates, Walmarts — in the absence of national buffer food stocks (an agri policy change to cash crops, the end to small-scale farmers, pushed aside by contract farming and GM crops) — we will pay them to send us food and finance borrowing from international markets to do it.” Frederic Mousseau, Policy Director at the Oakland Institute, says the following about the author’s work: “It takes a book to break down the dynamics that are pushing agro-chemical agriculture to farmers and consumers around the world and to reveal the strength of the diverse movement of people and organizations who stand in the way of these destructive and predatory forces. “Colin Todhunter takes readers on a world tour that makes a compelling case against the fallacy of the food scarcity and Green Revolution arguments advanced by the mainstream media and international institutions on behalf of powerful financial interests such as Blackrock, Vanguard, or Gates. Todhunter makes it obvious that a key factor of world hunger and of the environmental crisis we are facing is a capitalist system that ‘requires constant growth, expanding markets and sufficient demand.’ “Uplifting rather than depressing, after this lucid diagnosis, he highlights some of the countless people-led initiatives and movements, from Cuba, Ethiopia to India, that fight back against destruction and predation with agroecology and farmers-led practices, respectful of the people and the planet. By debunking the “artificial scarcity” myth that is constantly fed to us, Todhunter demonstrates that it is actually not complicated to change course. Readers will just have to join the movement.” This ebook provides insight into aspects of the global food system, including the micronutrient crisis, contested climate emergency rhetoric and its use in implementing the rollout of controlling technologies, the emergence and influence of digital platforms in shaping agricultural practices and the increasing corporate capture of Indian agriculture. The book is the third installment in a trilogy of ebooks by the author exploring the global food system. It evolved from a series of articles originally published by various media outlets and written by the author and follows the February 2022 publication of Food, Dependency and Dispossession: Resisting the New World Order and the December 2023 release of Sickening Profits: The Global Food System’s Poisoned Food and Toxic Wealth. When read together, the three books provide an overarching critique of contemporary food systems and possible solutions. For instance, the first book presents a more in-depth discussion of agroecology, the role of the Gates Foundation, the impact of pesticides, the state of agriculture in India, including the 2020-21 farmers protest, and the issue of development. The second book touches on some of those issues but broadens the debate to look at ecomodernism, food-related ill health, the role of big finance in the food system and the post-Covid food crisis. While readers do not have to read the first two books, it might help in providing added context and insights. This new book draws on and develops many of the themes presented in the first two. In particular, it returns to India to explore what has happened over the last 22 months (since the publication of the first book). More generally, it looks at the intertwining of political centralisation and corporate consolidation that is undermining democratic processes, economic diversity and local autonomy. This unholy alliance is creating a self-reinforcing, technocratic dystopia that concentrates power in the hands of a super-wealthy elite, which increasingly depicts anyone who challenges it as the ‘enemy within’. In this respect, the book weds the topic of food to the wider dynamics of power in society, which is becoming increasingly concentrated, resulting in the domination of both resources and populations and seeking to shape the very fabric of our lives and beliefs about who we are and what we could or should be. Such an analysis is integral to gaining a deeper understanding of the food system and the influence of global agribusiness and the tech giants that are increasingly moving into the food and agriculture sector. The following discussion is driven by a conviction in the transformative power of re-localising food systems, revitalising traditional ecological wisdom and rekindling our connection to the land that nourishes us. At its core, it challenges us to question our understanding of human progress and development. By focusing on the nature of power and certain challenges and issues that we face, this introductory chapter establishes a foundational framework for what appears in the subsequent chapters. We live in a world that sees political power becoming increasingly centralised. In turn, this creates an environment ripe for corporate influence. Large corporations, with their vast resources, can more easily focus their lobbying efforts and capture policymaking bodies at national and international levels than at a more fragmented local or regional level, leading to regulations and laws that favour big business over small enterprises and the needs and rights of ordinary people. This results in a landscape dominated by a handful of corporate giants, each wielding enormous economic and political clout. This consolidation of corporate power further reinforces political centralisation, as wealthy corporations (for example, think big pharma and big agribusiness) can effectively dictate policy through campaign contributions, lobbying efforts and the revolving door between government and industry. The voice of the average citizen is drowned out by the influence of corporate power. As a result of this corporate monopolisation, local markets and small businesses, once the backbone of communities, are being systematically crushed under the weight of centralised state-corporate power. Unable to compete with the economies of scale and political influence of large corporations, they are forced to close their doors or sell out to larger entities. This not only reduces choice and drives up prices but also strips communities of their unique character and economic self-determination. The global interests served by this system are at odds with local needs and values. Decisions made in distant boardrooms and government offices fail to account for the nuanced realities of diverse communities. Environmental concerns are brushed aside in favour of short-term profits, while cultural traditions are homogenised to fit corporate needs. Democratic processes, designed to give voice to the many, are subverted to serve the interests of the few. Real power resides in the hands of those who control the purse strings, and public discourse is shaped by the corporate media (often part of larger conglomerates), limiting the range of ideas and stifling dissent. At the same time, when decision-making is concentrated in a few hands, the potential for catastrophic errors increases. Over-centralised, corporate-dominated supply chains are vulnerable to disruptions, leading to shortages of essential goods that can ripple across the globe. The consolidation of corporate power in key sectors like agriculture creates dangerous monopolies that can manipulate markets, exploit farmers and ignore environmental safeguards with impunity. The struggle against the intertwining of political centralisation and corporate consolidation is a battle for a future where power is distributed equitably, where local voices matter and where the interests of communities and the environment take precedence over corporate profits. The stakes could not be higher. If we fail to check the runaway consolidation of political and corporate power, we risk sliding into a form of corporate feudalism or techno-feudalism, where the vast majority of people are reduced to serfs in service of a powerful elite. More specifically, the consolidation of corporate power in food and agriculture has far-reaching and deeply concerning implications for farmers, ordinary people and the environment. This concentration of control in the hands of a few transnational corporations has created a system that prioritises profit over ecological sustainability, health and food sovereignty. For farmers, the consequences are dire. The consolidation of the agriculture industry has led to a dramatic reduction in the number of small farms. The shift towards large-scale industrial farming has not only pushed many small farmers out of business but also trapped those who remain in a cycle of dependency on a handful of corporations for seeds, chemicals and market access. This loss of autonomy leaves farmers vulnerable to exploitative practices and reduces their ability to make decisions based on local needs and conditions. The impact on the wider population is equally troubling. While the illusion of choice persists in grocery stores, the reality is that a small number of corporations control the majority of food products. This concentration of power allows these companies to manipulate prices via aggressive discounting to destroy competition or to engage in profiteering through unnecessary price increases. Moreover, the focus on highly profitable, low-cost-ingredient processed foods high in fats, sugars and salt has contributed to a global health crisis, with rising rates of obesity and diet-related chronic diseases. Environmentally, the consequences of this corporate-controlled system are catastrophic. The industrial agricultural model promoted by these large corporations relies heavily on chemical inputs, monoculture farming and practices that degrade soil health, waterways and biodiversity. The centralisation of food production and distribution has also created a dangerously fragile system. As the COVID event demonstrated, disruptions in this highly consolidated supply chain can quickly lead to food shortages and price spikes. This lack of resilience poses a serious threat to global food security, particularly in times of crisis. Perhaps most alarmingly, this consolidated system is eroding food sovereignty — the right of peoples to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through ecologically sound and sustainable methods and their right to define their own food and agriculture systems. As global corporations increasingly control what is grown and how it is distributed, local communities lose the ability to make decisions about their food systems. The adverse implications of corporate consolidation in our food and agriculture system are profound and far-reaching. They threaten not only our current food security and public health but also the long-term sustainability of the planet’s food production capacity. Addressing this issue is not just about changing our food system; it’s about reclaiming democratic rights and ensuring a just and sustainable future for all. In India, as will be shown, the trends outlined above have concerning implications. These trends, driven by neoliberal policies and the growing influence of transnational corporations, are reshaping the landscape of Indian agriculture in ways that threaten traditional farming practices, food security and rural livelihoods. One of the most significant impacts is on small and marginal farmers, who make up about 85 per cent of India’s farming community (the importance of small farms will be discussed later). As corporate entities gain more control over various stages of the agricultural chain, these farmers face increasing pressure and vulnerability. They often find themselves at a disadvantage when negotiating prices or accessing markets, leading to reduced incomes and increased debt. The consolidation of power in the hands of a few large corporations also poses a threat to India’s food sovereignty. As these companies gain control over seeds, inputs and distribution channels, we could see a further reduction in crop diversity and a shift towards monoculture (contract) farming. This may also exacerbate the overuse of money-spinning proprietary chemical inputs, the degradation of soil and human health and the depletion of water resources, which are already major concerns in the country. The environmental costs of this approach are significant and could have long-lasting impacts on India’s agricultural productivity and food security. Furthermore, the corporatisation of agriculture threatens to erode traditional farming knowledge and practices that have been developed over generations. These practices, often more suited to local ecological conditions and more sustainable in the long term, risk being lost as standardised, corporate-driven farming ends up commodifying knowledge and practices (this will become clear later). The impact on rural communities extends beyond just the economic sphere. As the corporatisation of agriculture takes hold, there’s a risk of further rural-urban migration, as small farmers are pushed off their land. This can lead to the breakdown of rural social structures and exacerbate urban poverty and unemployment. The influence of corporate interests on agricultural research and policy is also a matter of concern. When private sector funding becomes more dominant in agricultural research, there is a risk that research priorities become skewed towards corporate interests rather than the needs of small farmers or ecological sustainability. Across the globe, an insidious corporatisation is reshaping agriculture. The consequences of this shift are far-reaching and deeply troubling, touching every aspect of the food system and, by extension, the very fabric of our societies. These corporations tell us that such a process goes hand in hand with the modernisation of the sector. The narrative of the need to ‘modernise agriculture’ pushed by corporations like Bayer, Corteva and Syngenta is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to secure control of the agricultural sector and ensure corporate dependency. Their vision of ‘development’ entails decision-making centralised in the hands of government and corporate entities, systematically weakening traditional local governance structures, and pushing top-down policies that favour large-scale industrial farming at the expense of small-scale, diversified agriculture. Ultimately, the struggle against corporate consolidation in agriculture is not just about changing our food system. It’s about recognising that food is not just a commodity but a fundamental human right and a cornerstone of our cultures and communities. There is a battle for the soul of our food system, for the future of our rural communities, for the health of our ecosystems and for the very nature of our societies. It’s a fight we cannot afford to lose. We must stand united to reclaim our food sovereignty and build a food system that nourishes not just our bodies but our communities. A fundamental restructuring of our food and agriculture systems is required. This should include antitrust enforcement to break up corporate monopolies, policies that support small and medium-sized farms and investment in research for agroecological farming methods. We must also work to shorten supply chains, promoting local food systems and territorial markets that are more resilient and responsive to community needs. The path ahead is challenging, but the alternative of a world where our food system is controlled by a handful of corporations, where biodiversity is decimated, where farmers are reduced to serfs on their own land and where our health is sacrificed for corporate profits is simply unacceptable. The world is experiencing a micronutrient food and health crisis. Micronutrient deficiency now affects billions of people. Micronutrients are key vitamins and minerals and deficiencies can cause severe health conditions. They are important for various functions, including blood clotting, brain development, the immune system, energy production and bone health, and play a critical role in disease prevention. The root of the crisis is due to an increased reliance on ultra processed foods (‘junk food’) and the way that modern food crops are grown in terms of the seeds used, the plants produced, the synthetic inputs required (fertilisers, pesticides etc.) and the effects on soil. In 2007, nutritional therapist David Thomas noted a precipitous change in the USA towards convenience and pre-prepared foods often devoid of vital micronutrients yet packed with a cocktail of chemical additives, including colourings, flavourings and preservatives. He noted that between 1940 and 2002 the character, growing methods, preparation, source and ultimate presentation of basic staples had changed significantly to the extent that trace elements and micronutrient contents have been severely depleted. Thomas added that ongoing research clearly demonstrates a significant relationship between deficiencies in micronutrients and physical and mental ill health. Prior to the Green Revolution, many of the older crops that were displaced carried dramatically higher counts of nutrients per calorie. For instance, the iron content of millet is four times that of rice, and oats carry four times more zinc than wheat. As a result, between 1961 and 2011, the protein, zinc and iron contents of the world’s directly consumed cereals declined by 4 per cent, 5 per cent and 19 per cent, respectively. The authors of a 2010 paper in the International Journal of Environmental and Rural Development state that cropping systems promoted by the Green Revolution have resulted in reduced food-crop diversity and decreased availability of micronutrients. They note that micronutrient malnutrition is causing increased rates of cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes and osteoporosis in many lower income nations. They add that soils are increasingly affected by micronutrient disorders. In 2016, India’s Central Soil Water Conservation Research and Training Institute reported that the country was losing 5,334 million tonnes of soil every year due to soil erosion because of indiscreet and excessive use of fertilisers, insecticides and pesticides over the years. On average, 16.4 tonnes of fertile soil is lost every year per hectare. It concluded that the non-judicious use of synthetic fertilisers had led to the deterioration of soil fertility causing loss of micro and macronutrients leading to poor soils and low yields. The high-input, chemical-intensive Green Revolution with its hybrid seeds and synthetic fertilisers and pesticides helped the drive towards greater monocropping and has resulted in less diverse diets and less nutritious foods. Its long-term impact has led to soil degradation and mineral imbalances, which, in turn, have adversely affected human health. But micronutrient depletion is not just due to a displacement of nutrient-dense staples in the diet or unhealthy soils. Take wheat, for example. Rothamsted Research in the UK has evaluated the mineral concentration of archived wheat grain and soil samples from the Broadbalk Wheat Experiment. The experiment began in 1843, and the findings show significant decreasing trends in the concentrations of zinc, copper, iron and magnesium in wheat grain since the 1960s. The researchers say that the concentrations of these four minerals remained stable between 1845 and the mid 1960s but have since decreased significantly by 20-30 per cent. This coincided with the introduction of Green Revolution semi-dwarf, high-yielding cultivars. They noted that the concentrations in soil used in the experiment have either increased or remained stable. So, in this case, soil is not the issue. A 2021 paper that appeared in the journal of Environmental and Experimental Botany reported that the large increase in the proportion of the global population suffering from zinc and iron deficiency over the last four decades has occurred since the Green Revolution and the introduction of its cultivars. Reflecting the findings of Rothamsted Research in the UK, a recent study led by Indian Council of Agricultural Research scientists found the grains eaten in India have lost food value. They conclude that many of today’s crops fail to absorb sufficient nutrients even when soil is healthy. The January 2024 article Indians consuming rice and wheat low in food value, high in toxins on the Down to Earth website reported on a study that found that rice and wheat, which meet over 50 per cent of the daily energy requirements of people in India, have lost up to 45 per cent of their food value in the past 50 years or so. The concentration of essential nutrients like zinc and iron has decreased by 33 per cent and 27 per cent in rice and by 30 per cent and 19 per cent in wheat, respectively. At the same time, the concentration of arsenic, a toxic element, in rice has increased by 1,493 per cent. Down to Earth also cites research by the Indian Council of Medical Research that indicates a 25 per cent rise in non-communicable diseases among the Indian population from 1990 to 2016. India is home to one-third of the two billion global population suffering from micronutrient deficiency. This is partly because modern-bred cultivars of rice and wheat are less efficient in sequestering zinc and iron, regardless of their abundance in soils. Plants have lost their capacity to take up nutrients from the soil. Increasing prevalence of diabetes, childhood leukaemia, childhood obesity, cardiovascular disorders, infertility, osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis, mental illnesses and so on have all been shown to have some direct relationship to diet and specifically micronutrient deficiency. The large increase in the proportion of the global population suffering from zinc and iron deficiency over the last four decades has coincided with the global expansion of high-yielding, input-responsive cereal cultivars released in the post-Green Revolution era. Agriculture and policy analyst Devinder Sharma says that high yield is inversely proportionate to plant nutrition: the drop in nutrition levels is so much that the high-yielding new wheat varieties have seen a steep fall in copper content, an essential trace mineral, by as much as 80 per cent, and some nutritionists ascribe this to a rise in cholesterol-related incidences across the world. India is self-sufficient in various staples, but many of these foodstuffs are high calorie-low nutrient and have led to the displacement of more nutritionally diverse cropping systems and more nutrient-dense crops. The importance of agronomist William Albrecht should not be overlooked here and his work on healthy soils and healthy people. In his experiments, he found that cows fed on less nutrient-dense crops ate more while cows that ate nutrient-rich grass stopped eating once their nutritional intake was satisfied. This may be one reason why we see rising rates of obesity at a time of micronutrient food insecurity. It is interesting that, given the above discussion on the Green Revolution’s adverse impacts on nutrition, the paper New Histories of the Green Revolution (2019) by Prof. Glenn Stone debunks the claim that the Green Revolution boosted productivity: it merely put more (nutrient-deficient) wheat into the Indian diet at the expense of other food crops. Stone argues that food productivity per capita showed no increase or even actually decreased. . . With this in mind, the table below makes for interesting reading. The data is provided by the National Productivity Council India (an autonomous body of the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, Ministry of Commerce and Industry). As mentioned earlier with reference to Albrecht, obesity has become a concern worldwide, including in India. This problem is multi-dimensional and, as alluded to, excess calorific intake and nutrient-poor food is a factor, leading to the consumption of sugary, fat-laden ultra processed food in an attempt to fill the nutritional gap. But there is also considerable evidence linking human exposure to agrochemicals with obesity. The September 2020 paper Agrochemicals and Obesity in the journal Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology summarises human epidemiological evidence and experimental animal studies supporting the association between agrochemical exposure and obesity and outlines possible mechanistic underpinnings for this link. Numerous other studies have also noted that exposure to pesticides has been associated with obesity and diabetes. For example, a 2022 paper in the journal Endocrine reports that first contact with environmental pesticides occurs during critical phases of life, such as gestation and lactation, which can lead to damage in central and peripheral tissues, subsequently programming disorders early and later in life. A 2013 paper in the journal Entropy on pathways to modern diseases reported that glyphosate (the active ingredient in Bayer-Monsanto’s Roundup), the most popular herbicide used worldwide, enhances the damaging effects of other food borne chemical residues and environmental toxins. The negative impact is insidious and manifests slowly over time as inflammation damages cellular systems throughout the body, resulting in conditions associated with a Western diet, which include gastrointestinal disorders, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, depression, autism, infertility, cancer and Alzheimer’s disease. Despite these findings, campaigner Rosemary Mason has drawn attention to how official government and industry narratives try to divert attention from the role of glyphosate in obesity (and other conditions) by urging the public to exercise and cut down on “biscuits”. In a January 2024 article, Kit Knightly, on the OffGuardian website, notes how big pharma is attempting to individualise obesity and make millions by pushing its ‘medical cures’ and drugs for the condition. To deal with micronutrient deficiencies, other money-spinning initiatives for industry are being pushed, not least biofortification of foodstuffs and plants and genetic engineering. Industry narratives have nothing to say about the food system itself in terms of food being regarded as just another commodity to be rinsed for profit regardless of the impacts on human health or the environment. We simply witness more techno-fix ‘solutions’ being rolled out to supposedly address the impacts of previous ‘innovations’ and policy decisions that benefitted the bottom line of Western agribusiness (and big pharma, which profits from the rising rates of disease and conditions). Quick techno-fixes do not offer genuine solutions to the problems outlined above. Such solutions involve challenging corporate power that shapes narratives and policies to suit its agenda. Healthy food, healthy people and healthy societies are not created at some ever-sprawling life sciences park that specialises in manipulating food and the human body (for corporate gain) under the banner of ‘innovation’ and ‘health’ while leaving intact the power relations that underpin bad food and ill health. A radical overhaul of the food system is required, from how food is grown to how society should be organised. This involves creating food sovereignty, encouraging localism, local markets and short supply chains, rejecting neoliberal globalisation, supporting smallholder agriculture and land reform while incentivising agroecological practices that build soil fertility, use and develop high-productive landraces and a focus on nutrition per acre rather than increased grain size, ‘yield’ and ‘output’. That’s how you create healthy food, healthy people and healthy societies. The relationship between financial investment and the commodification of farmland is increasingly significant for understanding the dynamics of modern agriculture and its implications for food systems. Financial institutions, including pension funds and investment firms, have turned farmland into a lucrative asset class, helping to fuel a paradigm shift in agricultural practices. This financialisation of farmland not only affects the economic landscape, opening up fresh investment opportunities, but also perpetuates an industrial agricultural model that prioritises profit over sustainability, sound agricultural practices and public health. The commodification of farmland involves transforming land into a tradable commodity, which is driven by the interests of big financial entities seeking high returns on their investments. This financial pressure leads to the aggregation of land into larger, industrial-scale farms owned by corporations or investment funds, which tend to employ input-intensive farming practices that degrade soil health and reduce biodiversity. The influx of capital into farmland has further fuelled an industrial agricultural model characterised by monocultures, heavy reliance on chemical inputs and a focus on maximising yields at the expense of human health, ecological balance and a systems approach (more on this later). The shift towards large-scale intensive farming operations has also diminished the role of smallholder farmers, who have traditionally played a major role in local food security and rural economies, thereby undermining community resilience and exacerbating food insecurity. Between 2008 and 2022, land prices nearly doubled throughout the world and tripled in Central-Eastern Europe. In the UK, an influx of investment from pension funds and private wealth contributed to a doubling of farmland prices from 2010-2015. Land prices in the US agricultural heartlands of Iowa quadrupled between 2002 and 2020. . A wheat field in Essex (Licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0) . Agricultural investment funds rose ten-fold between 2005 and 2018 and now regularly include farmland as a stand-alone asset class, with US investors having doubled their stakes in farmland since 2020. Meanwhile, agricultural commodity traders are speculating on farmland through their own private equity subsidiaries, while new financial derivatives are allowing speculators to accrue land parcels and lease them back to struggling farmers, driving steep and sustained land price inflation. Moreover, top-down ‘green grabs’ now account for 20 per cent of large-scale land deals. Government pledges for land-based carbon removals alone add up to almost 1.2 billion hectares, equivalent to total global cropland. Carbon offset markets are expected to quadruple in the next seven years. These are some of the findings published in the report ‘Land Squeeze’ (May 2024) by the International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food Systems (IPES), a non-profit thinktank headquartered in Brussels. The report says that agricultural land is increasingly being turned into a financial asset at the expense of small- and medium-scale farming, leading to land price inflation. Furthermore, the COVID-19 event and the conflict in Ukraine helped promote the ‘feed the world’ panic narrative, prompting agribusiness and investors to secure land for export commodity production and urging governments to deregulate land markets and adopt pro-investor policies. However, despite sky-rocketing food prices, there was, according to the IPES in 2022, sufficient food and no risk of global food supply shortages. The increased food prices were due to speculation on food commodities, corporate profiteering and a heavy reliance on food imports. But the self-serving narrative pushed by big agribusiness and land investors prevailed. At the same time, carbon and biodiversity offset markets are facilitating massive land transactions, bringing major polluters into land markets. The IPES notes that Shell has set aside more than $450 million for carbon offsetting projects. Land is also being appropriated for biofuels and green energy production, including water-intensive ‘green hydrogen’ projects that pose risks to local food cultivation. In addition, much-needed agricultural land is being repurposed for extractive industries and mega-developments. For example, urbanisation and mega-infrastructure developments in Asia and Africa are claiming prime farmland. According to the IPES, between 2000 and 2030, up to 3.3 million hectares of the world’s farmland will have been swallowed up by expanding megacities. Some 80 per cent of land loss to urbanisation is occurring in Asia and Africa. In India, 1.5 million hectares are estimated to have been lost to urban growth between 1955 and1985, a further 800,000 hectares lost between 1985 and 2000, with steady ongoing losses to this day. In a December 2016 paper on urban land expansion, it was projected that by 2030, globally, urban areas will have tripled in size, expanding into cropland. Around 60 per cent of the world’s cropland lies on the outskirts of cities, and this land is, on average, twice as productive as land elsewhere on the globe. This means that, as cities expand, millions of small-scale farmers are being displaced. These farmers produce the majority of food in lower income countries and are key to global food security. In their place, as their land is concreted over, we are seeing the aggregation of remaining agricultural land into large-scale farms, land buy ups and further land investments and the spread of industrial agriculture and all it brings, including poor food and diets, illness, environmental devastation and the destruction of rural communities. Investment funds have no real interest in farming or ensuring food security. They tend to invest for between only 10 and 15 years and can leave a trail of long-term environmental and social devastation and serve to undermine local and regional food security. Short- to medium-term returns on investments trump any notions of healthy food or human need. The IPES notes that, globally, just 1 per cent of the world’s largest farms now control 70 per cent of the world’s farmland. These tend to be input-intensive, industrial-scale farms that are straining resources, rapidly degrading farmland and further squeezing out smallholders. Additionally, agribusiness giants are pursuing monopolistic practices that drive up costs for farmers. These dynamics are creating systematic economic precarity for farmers, effectively forcing them to ‘get big or get out’. Factor in land degradation, much of which is attributable to modern chemical-intensive farming practices, and we have a recipe for global food insecurity. In India, more than 70 per cent of its arable land is affected by one or more forms of land degradation. Also consider that the Indian government has sanctioned 50 solar parks, covering one million hectares in seven states. More than 74 per cent of solar is on land of agricultural (67 per cent) or natural ecosystem value (7 per cent), causing potential food security and biodiversity conflicts. The IPES report notes that since 2017 there have been more than 15 instances of conflict in India linked with these projects. What is the impact of all this on farming and what might the future hold? Nettie Wiebe, from the IPES, explains: “Imagine trying to start a farm when 70 per cent of farmland is already controlled by just 1 per cent of the largest farms — and when land prices have risen for 20 years in a row, like in North America. That’s the stark reality young farmers face today. Farmland is increasingly owned not by farmers but by speculators, pension funds and big agribusinesses looking to cash in. Land prices have skyrocketed so high it’s becoming impossible to make a living from farming. This is reaching a tipping point — small and medium scale farming is simply being squeezed out.” Susan Chomba, also from the IPES, says that soaring land prices and land grabs are driving an unprecedented ‘land squeeze’, accelerating inequality and threatening food production. Moreover, the rush for dubious carbon projects, tree planting schemes, clean fuels and speculative buying is displacing not only small-scale farmers but also indigenous peoples. Huge swathes of farmland are being acquired by governments and corporations for these ‘green grabs’, despite little evidence of climate benefits. This issue is particularly affecting Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa. The IPES notes that some 25 million hectares of land have been snapped up for carbon projects by a single ‘environmental asset creation’ firm, UAE-based ‘Blue Carbon’, through agreements with the governments of Kenya, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Zambia and Liberia. According to the IPES, the ‘land squeeze’ is leading to farmer revolts, rural exodus, rural poverty and food insecurity. With global farmland prices having doubled in 15 years, farmers, peasants, and indigenous peoples are losing their land (or forced to downsize), while young farmers face significant barriers in accessing land to farm. The IPES calls for action to halt green grabs and remove speculative investment from land markets and establish integrated governance for land, environment and food systems to ensure a just transition. It also calls for support for collective ownership of farms and innovative financing for farmers to access land and wants a new deal for farmers and rural areas, and that includes a new generation of land and agrarian reforms. Capital accumulation based on the financialisation of farmland accelerated after the 2008 financial crisis. However, financialisation of the economy in general goes back to the 1970s and 1980s when we witnessed a deceleration of economic growth based on industrial production. The response was to compensate via financial capitalism and financial intermediation. Professor John Bellamy Foster, writing in 2010, not long after the 2008 crisis, stated: “Lacking an outlet in production, capital took refuge in speculation in debt-leveraged finance (a bewildering array of options, futures, derivatives, swaps etc.).” The neoliberal agenda was the political expression of capital’s response to the stagnation and included the raiding and sacking of public budgets, the expansion of credit to consumers and governments to sustain spending and consumption and frenzied financial speculation. With the engine of capital accumulation via production no longer firing on all cylinders, the emergency backup of financial expansion took over. We have seen a shift from real capital formation in many Western economies, which increases overall economic output, towards the appreciation of financial assets, which increases wealth claims but not output. Farmland is being transformed from a resource supporting food production and rural stability to a financial asset and speculative commodity. An asset class where wealthy investors can park their capital to further profit from inflated asset prices. The net-zero green agenda also has to be seen in this context: when capital struggles to make sufficient profit, productive wealth (capital) over accumulates and depreciates; to avoid crisis, constant growth and, in this case, the creation of fresh ‘green’ investment opportunities is required. The IPES report notes that nearly 45 per cent of all farmland investments in 2018, worth roughly $15 billion, came from pension funds and insurance companies. Based on workers’ contributions, pension fund investments in farmland are promoting land speculation, industrial agriculture and the interests of big agribusiness at the expense of smallholder farmers. Workers’ futures are tied to pension funds, which are supporting the growth and power of global finance and the degradation of other workers (in this case, cultivators). Sofía Monsalve Suárez, from the IPES, states: “It’s time decision-makers stop shirking their responsibility and start to tackle rural decline. The financialisation and liberalisation of land markets is ruining livelihoods and threatening the right to food. Instead of opening the floodgates to speculative capital, governments need to take concrete steps to halt bogus ‘green grabs’ and invest in rural development, sustainable farming and community-led conservation.” With pensions tied to an increasingly commodified food system, ordinary people have become deeply incorporated into a capitalist economy that requires private profit at the expense of public well-being. The links between big finance, the food system, illness and big pharma were described in Sickening Profits: The Global Food System’s Poisoned Food and Toxic Wealth. That book highlighted a cyclical relationship where financial institutions like BlackRock benefit from both their investments in the global food system and their investments in pharmaceuticals. At the same time, the relationship between ordinary people’s pensions and investments and the commodification of farmland further illustrates a complex interplay between finance and agriculture. Addressing these challenges requires a critical examination of how financial interests shape agricultural practices and a concerted effort towards more sustainable food systems that prioritise ecological integrity and community well-being over mere profitability. Earlier in this chapter, it was stated that the influx of capital into farmland has further fuelled an industrial agricultural model characterised by monocultures, heavy reliance on chemical inputs and a focus on maximising yields at the expense of ecological balance and a systems approach. But what is a systems approach? It involves understanding agriculture as part of a broader ecological and social system. It acknowledges that agricultural practices affect and are affected by environmental health, community well-being and economic viability. However, industrial agriculture often overlooks these interconnections, leading to detrimental outcomes such as soil degradation, polluted waterways, loss of biodiversity, the destruction of rural communities, small-scale farms and local economies and negative health impacts. By contrast, a systems approach promotes agroecological principles that prioritise local food security, sustainable practices and the resilience of farming communities. Agroecology serves as a primary framework within this systems approach. It integrates scientific research with traditional knowledge and grassroots participation, fostering practices that enhance ecological balance while ensuring farmers’ livelihoods. This method encourages diverse cropping systems, natural pest management and sustainable resource use, which collectively contribute to more resilient agricultural ecosystems. Agroecology not only addresses immediate agricultural challenges but also engages with broader political and economic issues affecting food systems. Moreover, a systems approach prioritises diverse nutrition production per acre, which contrasts sharply with conventional, reductionist agricultural models that focus predominantly on maximising yields of a single crop. Agroecological methods, which are foundational to this systems perspective, can lead to improved nutritional outcomes: by cultivating a wider variety of crops, farmers can enhance the nutritional quality of food produced on each acre, thereby addressing issues of malnutrition and food insecurity more effectively. Localised food systems and the primacy of small farms are critical to a systems approach. By reducing dependency on global supply chains dominated by big finance and large agribusiness, localised systems can enhance food sovereignty and empower communities. This shift not only mitigates vulnerability to global market fluctuations and supply chain crises but also fosters self-sufficiency and resilience against environmental changes. A systems approach thus advocates for policies that support smallholder farmers and promote sustainable practices tailored to local conditions. (For further insight into agroecology and its feasibility, successes and scaling up, there is an entire chapter on agroecology in Food, Dependency and Dispossession: Resisting the New World Order.) Throughout the world, from the Netherlands to India, farmers are protesting. The protests might appear to have little in common. But they do. Farmers are increasingly finding it difficult to make a living, whether, for instance, because of neoliberal trade policies that lead to the import of produce that undermines domestic production and undercuts prices, the withdrawal of state support or the implementation of net-zero emissions policies that set unrealistic targets. The common thread is that, by one way or another, farming is deliberately being made impossible or financially non-viable. The aim is to drive most farmers off the land and ram through an agenda that by its very nature seems likely to produce shortages and undermine food security. . Farmers’ protest in The Hague 1 October 2019. (Licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0) . A ‘one world agriculture’ global agenda is being promoted by the likes of the Gates Foundation and the World Economic Forum. It involves a vision of food and farming that sees companies such as Bayer, Corteva, Syngenta and Cargill working with Microsoft, Google and the big-tech giants to facilitate AI-driven farmerless farms, laboratory-engineered ‘food’ and retail dominated by the likes of Amazon and Walmart. A cartel of data owners, proprietary input suppliers and e-commerce platforms at the commanding heights of the economy. The agenda is the brainchild of a digital-corporate-financial complex that wants to transform and control all aspects of life and human behaviour. This complex forms part of an authoritarian global elite that has the ability to coordinate its agenda globally via the United Nations, the World Economic Forum, the World Trade Organization (WTO), the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and other supranational organisations, including influential think tanks and foundations (Gates, Rockefeller etc.). Its agenda for food and farming is euphemistically called a ‘food transition’. Big agribusiness and ‘philanthropic’ foundations position themselves as the saviours of humanity due to their much-promoted plans to ‘feed the world’ with high-tech ‘precision’ farming’, ‘data-driven’ agriculture and ‘green’ (net-zero) production — with a warped notion of ‘sustainability’ being the mantra. A much talked about ‘food transition’ goes hand in hand with an energy transition, net-zero ideology, programmable central bank digital currencies, the censorship of free speech and clampdowns on protest. To properly understand these processes, we need to first locate what is essentially a social and economic reset within the context of a collapsing financial system. Writer Ted Reece notes that the general rate of profit has trended downwards from an estimated 43 per cent in the 1870s to 17 per cent in the 2000s. By late 2019, many companies could not generate enough profit. Falling turnover, squeezed margins, limited cashflows and highly leveraged balance sheets were prevalent. Professor Fabio Vighi of Cardiff University has described how closing down the global economy in early 2020 under the guise of fighting a supposedly new and novel pathogen allowed the US Federal Reserve to flood collapsing financial markets (COVID relief) with freshly printed money without causing hyperinflation. Lockdowns curtailed economic activity, thereby removing demand for the newly printed money (credit) in the physical economy and preventing ‘contagion’. According to investigative journalist Michael Byrant, €1.5 trillion was needed to deal with the crisis in Europe alone. The financial collapse staring European central bankers in the face came to a head in 2019. The appearance of a ‘novel virus’ provided a convenient cover story. The European Central Bank agreed to a €1.31 trillion bailout of banks followed by the EU agreeing to a €750 billion recovery fund for European states and corporations. This package of long-term, ultra-cheap credit to hundreds of banks was sold to the public as a necessary programme to cushion the impact of the ‘pandemic’ on businesses and workers. In response to a collapsing neoliberalism, we are now seeing the rollout of an authoritarian great reset — an agenda that intends to reshape the economy and change how we live. The new economy is to be dominated by a handful of tech giants, global conglomerates and e-commerce platforms, and new markets will also be created through the financialisation of nature, which is to be colonised, commodified and traded under the notion of protecting the environment. In recent years, we have witnessed an overaccumulation of capital, and the creation of such markets will provide fresh investment opportunities (including dodgy carbon offsetting Ponzi schemes) for the super-rich to park their wealth and prosper. This great reset envisages a transformation of Western societies, resulting in permanent restrictions on fundamental liberties and mass surveillance. Being rolled out under the benign term of a ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution’, the World Economic Forum (WEF) says the public will eventually ‘rent’ everything they require (remember the WEF video ‘you will own nothing and be happy’?): stripping the right of ownership under the guise of a ‘green economy’ and underpinned by the rhetoric of ‘sustainable consumption’ and ‘climate emergency’. . Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates – World Economic Forum Annual Meeting Davos 2008 (Copyright World Economic Forum by Remy Steinegger) . Climate alarmism and the mantra of sustainability are about promoting money-making schemes. But they also serve another purpose: social control. Neoliberalism has run its course, resulting in the impoverishment of large sections of the population. But to dampen dissent and lower expectations, the levels of personal freedom we have been used to will not be tolerated. This means that the wider population will be subjected to the discipline of an emerging surveillance state. To push back against any dissent, ordinary people are being told that they must sacrifice personal liberty in order to protect public health, societal security (those terrible Russians, Islamic extremists or that Sunak-designated bogeyman George Galloway) or the climate; in the case of the climate, this means, for instance, travelling less and eating synthetic ‘meat’. Unlike in the old normal of neoliberalism, an ideological shift is occurring whereby personal freedoms are increasingly depicted as being dangerous because they run counter to the collective good. A main reason for this ideological shift is to ensure that the masses get used to lower living standards and accept them. Consider, for instance, the Bank of England’s chief economist Huw Pill saying that people should ‘accept’ being poorer. And then there is Rob Kapito of the world’s biggest asset management firm BlackRock, who says that a “very entitled” generation must deal with scarcity for the first time in their lives. At the same time, to muddy the waters, the message is that lower living standards are the result of the conflict in Ukraine and supply shocks that both the war and ‘the virus’ have caused. The net-zero carbon emissions agenda will help legitimise lower living standards (reducing your carbon footprint) while reinforcing the notion that our rights must be sacrificed for the greater good. You will own nothing, not because the rich and their neoliberal agenda made you poor but because you will be instructed to stop being irresponsible and must act to protect the planet. But what of this shift towards net-zero greenhouse gas emissions and the plan to slash our carbon footprints? Is it even feasible or necessary? Gordon Hughes, a former World Bank economist and current professor of economics at the University of Edinburgh, says in a 2024 report that current UK and European net-zero policies will likely lead to further economic ruin. Apparently, the only viable way to raise the cash for sufficient new capital expenditure (on wind and solar infrastructure) would be a two decades-long reduction in private consumption of up to 10 per cent. Such a shock has never occurred in the last century outside war; even then, never for more than a decade. But this agenda will also cause serious environmental degradation. So says Andrew Nikiforuk in the article The Rising Chorus of Renewable Energy Skeptics, which outlines how the green techno-dream is vastly destructive. He lists the devastating environmental impacts of an even more mineral-intensive system based on renewables and warns: “The whole process of replacing a declining system with a more complex mining-based enterprise is now supposed to take place with a fragile banking system, dysfunctional democracies, broken supply chains, critical mineral shortages and hostile geopolitics.” All of this assumes that global warming is real and anthropogenic. Not everyone agrees. In the article Global warming and the confrontation between the West and the rest of the world, journalist Thierry Meyssan argues that net zero is based on political ideology rather than science. But to state such things has become heresy in the Western countries and shouted down with accusations of ‘climate science denial’. Regardless of such concerns, the march towards net zero continues, and key to this is the United Nations Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development Goals. . A proposal to visualize the 17 SDGs in a thematic pyramid (Licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0) . Today, almost every business or corporate report, website or brochure includes a multitude of references to ‘carbon footprints’, ‘sustainability’, ‘net zero’ or ‘climate neutrality’ and how a company or organisation intends to achieve its sustainability targets. Green profiling, green bonds and green investments go hand in hand with displaying ‘green’ credentials and ambitions wherever and whenever possible. It seems anyone and everyone in business is planting their corporate flag on the summit of sustainability. Take Sainsbury’s, for instance. It is one of the ‘big six’ food retail supermarkets in the UK and has a vision for the future of food that it published in 2019 that dovetails with the so-called food transition and the interrelated net-zero agenda — you must change your eating habits and eat synthetic food to save the planet! Here’s a quote from it: “Personalised Optimisation is a trend that could see people chipped and connected like never before. A significant step on from wearable tech used today, the advent of personal microchips and neural laces has the potential to see all of our genetic, health and situational data recorded, stored and analysed by algorithms which could work out exactly what we need to support us at a particular time in our life. Retailers, such as Sainsbury’s could play a critical role to support this, arranging delivery of the needed food within thirty minutes — perhaps by drone.” Tracked, traced and chipped — for your own benefit. Corporations accessing all of our personal data, right down to our DNA. The report is littered with references to sustainability and the climate or environment, and it is difficult not to get the impression that it is written so as to leave the reader awestruck by the technological possibilities. We shall return to this report in the next chapter. The report appears to be part of a paradigm that promotes a brave new world of technological innovation but has nothing to say about power — who determines policies that have led to massive inequalities, poverty, malnutrition, food insecurity and hunger and who is responsible for the degradation of the environment in the first place — is nothing new. The essence of power is conveniently glossed over, not least because those involved in the prevailing food regime are also shaping the techno-utopian fairytale where everyone lives happily ever after eating synthetic food while living in a digital panopticon. The type of ‘green’ agenda being pushed is not just about social engineering and behavioural change; it is also a multi-trillion market opportunity for lining the pockets of rich investors and subsidy-sucking green infrastructure firms. It is, furthermore, a type of green that plans to cover much of the countryside with wind farms and solar panels with most farmers no longer farming. A recipe for food insecurity. Those investing in the ‘green’ agenda care first and foremost about profit. The supremely influential BlackRock is not only promoting this agenda; it also invests in the current food system and the corporations responsible for polluted waterways, degraded soils, the displacement of smallholder farmers, a spiralling public health crisis, malnutrition and much more. It also invests in healthcare — an industry that thrives on the illnesses and conditions created by eating the substandard food that the current system produces. Did Larry Fink, the top man at BlackRock, suddenly develop a conscience and become an environmentalist who cares about the planet and ordinary people? Of course not. He smells ever more profit in ‘climate-friendly’, ‘precision’ agriculture, genetic engineering and facilitating a new technocratic fake-green normal. Any serious deliberations on the future of food would surely consider issues like food sovereignty, the role of agroecology and the strengthening of family farms — the backbone of current global food production. The aforementioned article by Andrew Nikiforuk concludes that, if we are really serious about our impacts on the environment, we must scale back our needs and simplify society. In terms of food, the solution rests on a low-input approach that strengthens rural communities and local markets and prioritises smallholder farms and small independent enterprises and retailers, localised democratic food systems and a concept of food sovereignty based on self-sufficiency, agroecological principles and regenerative agriculture. It would involve facilitating the right to culturally appropriate food that is nutritionally dense due to diverse cropping patterns and free from toxic chemicals while ensuring local ownership and stewardship of common resources like land, water, soil and seeds. That’s where genuine environmentalism, ‘sustainability’, social justice and the future of food begins. But there’s no profit or role in that for Fink or the big agribusiness and tech giants that despise such approaches. Sainsbury’s Future of Food report (2019), mentioned in the previous chapter, is not merely a misguided attempt at forecasting future trends and habits; it reads more like a manifesto for corporate control and technocratic tyranny disguised as ‘progress’. This document epitomises everything wrong with the industrial food system’s vision for our future. It represents a dystopian roadmap to a world where our most fundamental connection to nature and culture — our food — is hijacked by corporate interests and mediated through a maze of unnecessary and potentially harmful technologies. . Illustration by Margarita Mitrovic / Screenshot from Sainsbury’s Report . The wild predictions and technological ‘solutions’ presented in the report reveal a profound disconnection from the lived experiences of ordinary people and the real challenges facing our food systems. Its claim (in 2019) that a quarter of Britons will be vegetarian by 2025 seems way off the mark. But it fits a narrative that seeks to reshape our diets and food culture. Once you convince the reader that things are going to be a certain way in the future, it is easier to pave the way for normalising what appears elsewhere in the report: lab-grown meat, 3D-printed foods and space farming. Of course, the underlying assumption is that giant corporations — and supermarkets like Sainsbury’s — will be controlling everything and rolling out marvellous ‘innovations’ under the guise of ‘feeding the world’ or ‘saving the planet’. There is no concern expressed in the report about the consolidation of corporate-technocratic control over the food system. By promoting high-tech solutions, the report seemingly advocates for a future where our food supply is entirely dependent on complex technologies controlled by a handful of corporations. The report talks of ‘artisan factories’ run by robots. Is this meant to get ordinary people to buy into Sainsbury’s vision of the future? Possibly, if the intention is to further alienate people from their food sources, making them ever more dependent on corporate-controlled, ultra-processed products. It’s a future where the art of cooking, the joy of growing food and the cultural significance of traditional dishes are replaced by sterile, automated processes devoid of human touch and cultural meaning. This erosion of food culture and skills is not an unintended consequence — it’s a core feature of the corporate food system’s strategy to create a captive market of consumers unable to feed themselves without corporate intervention. The report’s enthusiasm for personalised nutrition driven by AI and biometric data is akin to an Orwellian scenario that would give corporations unprecedented control over our dietary choices, turning the most fundamental human need into a data-mined, algorithm-driven commodity. The privacy implications are staggering, as is the potential for new forms of discrimination and social control based on eating habits. Imagine a world where your insurance premiums are tied to your adherence to a corporate-prescribed diet or where your employment prospects are influenced by your ‘Food ID’. The possible dystopian reality lurking behind Sainsbury’s glossy predictions. The report’s fixation on exotic ingredients like jellyfish and lichen draws attention away from the real issues affecting our food systems — corporate concentration, environmental degradation and the systematic destruction of local food cultures and economies. It would be better to address the root causes of food insecurity and malnutrition, which are fundamentally issues of poverty and inequality, not a lack of novel food sources. Nothing is mentioned about the vital role of agroecology, traditional farming knowledge and food sovereignty in creating truly sustainable and just food systems. Instead, what we see is a future where every aspect of our diet is mediated by technology and corporate interests, from gene-edited crops to synthetic biology-derived foods. A direct assault on the principles of food sovereignty, which assert the right of peoples to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through ecologically sound and sustainable methods. The report’s emphasis on lab-grown meat and other high-tech protein sources is particularly troubling. These technologies, far from being the environmental saviours they are promoted as, risk increasing energy use and further centralising food production in the hands of a few tech giants. The massive energy requirements for large-scale cultured meat production are conveniently glossed over, as are the potential health risks of consuming these novel foods without long-term safety studies. This push for synthetic foods is not about sustainability or animal welfare — it’s about creating new, patentable food sources that can be controlled and monetised by corporations. Moreover, the push for synthetic foods and ‘precision fermentation’ threatens to destroy the livelihoods of millions of small farmers and pastoralists worldwide, replacing them with a handful of high-tech facilities controlled by multinational corporations. Is this meant to be ‘progress’? It’s more like a boardroom recipe for increased food insecurity, rural poverty and corporate monopolisation. The destruction of traditional farming communities and practices would not only be an economic disaster but a cultural catastrophe, erasing millennia of accumulated knowledge and wisdom about sustainable food production. The report’s casual mention of ‘sin taxes’ on meat signals a future where our dietary choices are increasingly policed and penalised by the state, likely at the behest of corporate interests. However, on the issue of the need to reduce meat consumption and replace meat with laboratory-manufactured items in order to reduce carbon emissions, it must be stated that the dramatic increase in the amount of meat consumed post-1945 was not necessarily the result of consumer preference; it had more to do with political policy, the mechanisation of agriculture and Green Revolution practices. That much was made clear by Laila Kassam, who, in her 2017 article What’s grain got to do with it? How the problem of surplus grain was solved by increasing ‘meat’ consumption in post-WWII US, asked: “Have you ever wondered how ‘meat’ became such a central part of the Western diet? Or how the industrialisation of ‘animal agriculture’ came about? It might seem like the natural outcome of the ‘free market’ meeting demand for more ‘meat’. But from what I have learned from Nibert (2002) and Winders and Nibert (2004), the story of how ‘meat’ consumption increased so much in the post-World War II period is anything but natural. They argue it is largely due to a decision in the 1940s by the US government to deal with the problem of surplus grain by increasing the production of ‘meat’.” Kassam notes: “In the second half of the 20th century, global ‘meat’ production increased by nearly 5 times. The amount of ‘meat’ eaten per person doubled. By 2050 ‘meat’ consumption is estimated to increase by 160 percent (The World Counts, 2017). While global per capita ‘meat’ consumption is currently 43 kg/year, it is nearly double in the UK (82 kg/year) and almost triple in the US (118 kg/year).” Kassam notes that habits and desires are manipulated by elite groups for their own interests. Propaganda, advertising and ‘public relations’ are used to manufacture demand for products. Agribusiness corporations and the state have used these techniques to encourage ‘meat’ consumption, leading to the slaughter and untold misery of billions of creatures, as Kassam makes clear. People were manipulated to buy into ‘meat culture’. Now they are being manipulated to buy out, again by elite groups. But ‘sin taxes’ and Orwellian-type controls on individual behaviour are not the way to go about reducing meat consumption. So, what is the answer? Kassam says that one way to do this is to support grassroots organisations and movements which are working to resist the power of global agribusiness and reclaim our food systems. Movements for food justice and food sovereignty which promote sustainable, agroecological production systems. At least then people will be free from corporate manipulation and better placed to make their own food choices. As Kassam says: “From what I have learned so far, our oppression of other animals is not just a result of individual choices. It is underpinned by a state supported economic system driven by profit.” Meanwhile, Sainsbury’s vision of food production in space and on other planets is perhaps the most egregious example of misplaced priorities. While around a billion struggle with hunger and malnutrition and many more with micronutrient deficiencies, corporate futurists are fantasising about growing food on Mars. Is this supposed to be visionary thinking? It’s a perfect encapsulation of the technocratic mindset that believes every problem can be solved with more technology, no matter how impractical or divorced from reality. Moreover, by promoting a future dependent on complex, centralised technologies, we become increasingly vulnerable to system failures and corporate monopolies. A truly resilient food system should be decentralised, diverse and rooted in local knowledge and resources. The report’s emphasis on nutrient delivery through implants, patches and intravenous methods is particularly disturbing. This represents the ultimate commodification of nutrition, reducing food to mere fuel and stripping away all cultural, social and sensory aspects of eating. It’s a vision that treats the human body as a machine to be optimised, rather than a living being with complex needs and experiences. The idea of ‘grow-your-own’ ingredients for cultured meat and other synthetic foods at home is another example of how this technocratic vision co-opts and perverts concepts of self-sufficiency and local food production. Instead of encouraging people to grow real, whole foods, it proposes a dystopian parody of home food production that still keeps consumers dependent on corporate-supplied technologies and inputs. A clever marketing ploy to make synthetic foods seem more natural and acceptable. The report’s predictions about AI-driven personal nutrition advisors and highly customised diets based on individual ‘Food IDs’ raise serious privacy concerns and threaten to further medicalise our relationship with food. While personalised nutrition could offer some benefits, the level of data collection and analysis required for such systems could lead to unprecedented corporate control over our dietary choices. Furthermore, the emphasis on ‘artisan’ factories run by robots completely misunderstands the nature of artisanal food production. True artisanal foods are the product of human skill, creativity and cultural knowledge passed down through generations. It’s a perfect example of how the technocratic mindset reduces everything to mere processes that can be automated, ignoring the human and cultural elements that give food its true value. The report’s vision of meat ‘assembled’ on 3D printing belts is another disturbing example of the ultra-processed future being proposed. This approach to food production treats nutrition as a mere assembly of nutrients, ignoring the complex interactions between whole foods and the human body. It’s a continuation of the reductionist thinking that has led to the current epidemic of diet-related diseases. Sainsbury’s is essentially advocating for a future where our diets are even further removed from natural, whole foods. The concept of ‘farms’ cultivating plants to make growth serum for cells is yet another step towards the complete artificialisation of the food supply. This approach further distances food production from natural processes. It’s a vision of farming that has more in common with pharmaceutical production than traditional agriculture, and it threatens to complete the transformation of food from a natural resource into an industrial product. Sainsbury’s apparent enthusiasm for gene-edited and synthetic biology-derived foods is also concerning. These technologies’ rapid adoption without thorough long-term safety studies and public debate could lead to unforeseen health and environmental impacts. The history of agricultural biotechnology is rife with examples of unintended consequences, from the development of herbicide-resistant superweeds to the contamination of non-GM crops. Is Sainsbury’s uncritically promoting these technologies, disregarding the precautionary principle? Issues like food insecurity, malnutrition and environmental degradation are not primarily technical problems — they are the result of inequitable distribution of resources, exploitative economic systems and misguided policies. By framing these issues as purely technological challenges, Sainsbury’s is diverting attention from the need for systemic change and social justice in the food system. The high-tech solutions proposed are likely to be accessible only to the wealthy, at least initially, creating a two-tiered food system where the rich have access to ‘optimized’ nutrition while the poor are left with increasingly degraded and processed options. But the report’s apparent disregard for the cultural and social aspects of food is perhaps its most fundamental flaw. Food is not merely fuel for our bodies; it’s a central part of our cultural identities, social relationships and connection to the natural world. By reducing food to a series of nutrients to be optimised and delivered in the most efficient manner possible, Sainsbury’s is proposing a future that is not only less healthy but less human. While Sainsbury’s Future of Food report can be regarded as a roadmap to a better future, it is really a corporate wish list, representing a dangerous consolidation of power in the hands of agribusiness giants and tech companies at the expense of farmers, consumers and the environment. The report is symptomatic of a wider ideology that seeks to legitimise total corporate control over our food supply. And the result? A homogenised, tech-driven dystopia. A technocratic nightmare that gives no regard for implementing food systems that are truly democratic, ecologically sound and rooted in the needs and knowledge of local communities. The real future of food lies not in corporate labs and AI algorithms, but in the fields of agroecological farmers, the kitchens of home cooks and the markets of local food producers. The path forward is not through more technology and corporate control but through a return to the principles of agroecology, food sovereignty and cultural diversity. “A total demolition of the previous forms of existence is underway: how one comes into the world, biological sex, education, relationships, the family, even the diet that is about to become synthetic.” — Silvia Guerini, radical ecologist, in From the ‘Neutral’ Body to the Posthuman Cyborg (2023) We are currently seeing an acceleration of the corporate consolidation of the entire global agri-food chain. The big data conglomerates, including Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook and Google, have joined traditional agribusiness giants, such as Corteva, Bayer, Cargill and Syngenta, in a quest to impose their model of food and agriculture on the world. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and big financial institutions, like BlackRock and Vanguard, are also involved, whether through buying up huge tracts of farmland, pushing biosynthetic (fake) food and genetic engineering technologies or more generally facilitating and financing the aims of the mega agri-food corporations. The billionaire interests behind this try to portray their techno-solutionism as some kind of humanitarian endeavour: saving the planet with ‘climate-friendly solutions’, ‘helping farmers’ or ‘feeding the world’. But what it really amounts to is repackaging and greenwashing the dispossessive strategies of imperialism. It involves a shift towards a ‘one world agriculture’ under the control of agritech and the data giants, which is to be based on genetically-engineered seeds, laboratory-created products that resemble food, ‘precision’ and ‘data-driven’ agriculture and farming without farmers, with the entire agrifood chain, from field (or lab) to retail, being governed by monopolistic e-commerce platforms determined by artificial intelligence systems and algorithms. Those who are pushing this agenda have a vision not only for farmers but also for humanity in general. The elites through their military-digital-financial (Pentagon/Silicon Valley/Big Finance) complex want to use their technologies to reshape the world and redefine what it means to be human. They regard humans, their cultures and their practices, like nature itself, as a problem and deficient. Farmers are to be displaced and replaced with drones, machines and cloud-based computing. Food is to be redefined, and people are to be fed synthetic, genetically-engineered products. Cultures are to be eradicated, and humanity is to be fully urbanised, subservient and disconnected from the natural world. What it means to be human is to be radically transformed. But what has it meant to be human until now or at least prior to the (relatively recent) Industrial Revolution and associated mass urbanisation? To answer this question, we need to discuss our connection to nature and what most of humanity was involved in prior to industrialisation — cultivating food. Many of the ancient rituals and celebrations of our forebears were built around stories, myths and rituals that helped them come to terms with some of the most fundamental issues of existence, from death to rebirth and fertility. These culturally-embedded beliefs and practices served to sanctify people’s practical relationship with nature and its role in sustaining human life. As agriculture became key to human survival, the planting and harvesting of crops and other seasonal activities associated with food production were central to these customs. Humans celebrated nature and the life it gave birth to. Ancient beliefs and rituals were imbued with hope and renewal and people had a necessary and immediate relationship with the sun, seeds, animals, wind, fire, soil and rain and the changing seasons that nourished and brought life. Our cultural and social relationships with agrarian production and associated deities had a sound practical base. People’s lives have been tied to planting, harvesting, seeds, soil and the seasons for thousands of years. Silvia Guerini, whose quote introduces this chapter, notes the importance of deep-rooted relationships and the rituals that re-affirm them. She says that through rituals a community recognises itself and its place in the world. They create the spirit of a rooted community by contributing to rooting and making a single existence endure in a time, in a territory, in a community. Professor Robert W Nicholls explains that the cults of Woden and Thor were superimposed on far older and better-rooted beliefs related to the sun and the earth, the crops and the animals and the rotation of the seasons between the light and warmth of summer and the cold and dark of winter. Humanity’s relationship with farming and food and our connections to land, nature and community has for millennia defined what it means to be human. Take India, for example. Environmental scientist Viva Kermani says that Hinduism is the world’s largest nature-based religion that: “… recognises and seeks the Divine in nature and acknowledges everything as sacred. It views the earth as our Mother and hence advocates that it should not be exploited. A loss of this understanding that earth is our mother, or rather a deliberate ignorance of this, has resulted in the abuse and the exploitation of the earth and its resources.” Kermani notes that ancient scriptures instructed people that the animals and plants found in India are sacred and, therefore, all aspects of nature are to be revered. She adds that this understanding of and reverence towards the environment is common to all Indic religious and spiritual systems: Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. According to Kermani, the Vedic deities have deep symbolism and many layers of existence. One such association is with ecology. Surya is associated with the sun, the source of heat and light that nourishes everyone; Indra is associated with rain, crops, and abundance; and Agni is the deity of fire and transformation and controls all changes. She notes that the Vrikshayurveda, an ancient Sanskrit text on the science of plants and trees, contains details about soil conservation, planting, sowing, treatment, propagating, how to deal with pests and diseases and a lot more. Like Nicholls, Kermani provides insight into some of the profound cultural, philosophical and practical aspects of humanity’s connection to nature and food production. This connection resonates with agrarianism, a philosophy based on cooperative labour and fellowship, which stands in stark contrast to the values and impacts of urban life, capitalism and technology that are too often detrimental to independence and dignity. Agrarianism, too, emphasises a spiritual dimension as well as the value of rural society, small farms, widespread property ownership and political decentralisation. The poet and prominent proponent of agrarianism Wendell Berry says: “The revolution which began with machines and chemicals now continues with automation, computers and biotechnology.” For Berry, agrarianism is not a sentimental longing for a time past. Colonial attitudes, domestic, foreign and now global, have resisted true agrarianism almost from the beginning — there has never been fully sustainable, stable, locally adapted, land-based economies. However, Berry provides many examples of small (and larger) farms that have similar output as industrial agriculture with one third of the energy. In his poem ‘A Spiritual Journey’, Berry writes the following: “And the world cannot be discovered by a journey of miles, no matter how long, but only by a spiritual journey, a journey of one inch, very arduous and humbling and joyful, by which we arrive at the ground at our feet, and learn to be at home.” Agrarianism, while advocating for a return to small-scale farming and community-oriented living, is often critiqued for its idealisation of rural life and agricultural work. Critics argue that it mistakenly elevates farming above other forms of labour, suggesting that agricultural work inherently fosters moral virtues and a closer relationship with nature. It might appear to be naive, not least because, it overlooks the complexities and ethical dilemmas present in agrarian communities, which can be just as susceptible to corruption and environmental degradation as urban settings. This raises the question: are solutions based on agrarianism utopian and disconnected from modern societal needs? Not really. Agrarianism offers a necessary critique of industrial agriculture and the accelerated urbanisation we see across the world, emphasising the importance of local communities and sustainable practices. It promotes the idea that close relationships with the land can foster not only environmental stewardship but also social cohesion and moral integrity among community members. By advocating for small-scale farming and local food systems, agrarianism seeks to empower individuals and families, encouraging self-sufficiency and resilience against the negative impacts of globalisation and corporate control in agriculture. As a philosophy, agrarianism highlights the value of traditional knowledge and practices in addressing contemporary issues such as climate challenges, food security and social inequality. We shall return to Wendell Berry in the final chapter. But in the cold, centralised, technocratic dystopia that is planned, humanity’s spiritual connection to the countryside, food and agrarian production are to be cast into the dustbin of history. What we are seeing is an agenda based on a different set of values rooted in a lust for power and money and the total subjugation of ordinary people. Silvia Guerini says: “The past becomes something to be erased in order to break the thread that binds us to a history, to a tradition, to a belonging, for the transition towards a new uprooted humanity, without past, without memory… a new humanity dehumanised in its essence, totally in the hands of the manipulators of reality and truth”. This dehumanised humanity severed from the past is part of the wider agenda of transhumanism. For instance, we are not just seeing a push towards a world without farmers and everything that has connected us to the soil but, according to Guerini, also a world without mothers. She argues that those behind test-tube babies and surrogate motherhood now have their sights on genetic engineering and artificial wombs, which would cut women out of the reproductive process. Guerini predicts that artificial wombs could eventually be demanded, or rather marketed, as a right for everyone, including transgender people. It is interesting that the language around pregnancy is already contested with the omission of ‘women’ from statements like ‘persons who can get pregnant’. Of course, there has long been a blurring of lines between biotechnology, eugenics and genetic engineering. Genetically engineered crops, gene drives and gene editing are now a reality, but the ultimate goal is marrying artificial intelligence, bionanotechnology and genetic engineering to produce the one-world transhuman. This is being pushed by powerful interests, who, according to Guerini, are using a rainbow, transgenic left and LGBTQ+ organisations to promote a new synthetic identity and claim to new rights. She says this is an attack on life, on nature, on “what is born, as opposed to artificial” and adds that all ties to the real, natural world must be severed. It is interesting that in its report Future of Food, the UK supermarket giant Sainsbury’s celebrates a future where we are microchipped and tracked and neural laces have the potential to see all of our genetic, health and situational data recorded, stored and analysed by algorithms that could work out exactly what food (delivered by drone) we need to support us at a particular time in our life. All sold as ‘personal optimisation’. Moreover, it is likely, according to the report, that we will be getting key nutrients through implants. Part of these nutrients will come in the form of lab-grown food and insects. A neural lace is an ultra-thin mesh that can be implanted in the skull, forming a collection of electrodes capable of monitoring brain function. It creates an interface between the brain and the machine. Sainsbury’s does a pretty good job of trying to promote a dystopian future where AI has taken your job, but, according to the report, you have lots of time to celebrate the wonderful, warped world of ‘food culture’ created by the supermarket and your digital overlords. Technofeudalism meets transhumanism — all for your convenience, of course. Imagine, as you sit all day unemployed in your high-rise, your ‘food’ will be delivered via an online platform bought courtesy of your programmable universal basic income digital money. Food courtesy of Gates-promoted farms manned by driverless machines, monitored by drones and doused with chemicals to produce crops from patented genetically modified seeds for industrial ‘biomatter’ to be engineered, processed and constituted into something resembling food. Enjoy and be happy eating your fake food, stripped of satisfying productive endeavour and genuine self-fulfilment. But really, it will not be a problem. You can sit all day and exist virtually in Zuckerberg’s fantasy metaverse. Property-less and happy in your open prison of state dependency, track and chip surveillance passports and financial exclusion via programmable currency. A world also in which bodily integrity no longer exists courtesy of a mandatory vaccination agenda linked to emerging digital-biopharmaceutical technologies. But none of this will happen overnight. And whether the technology will deliver remains to be seen. Those who are promoting this brave new world might have overplayed their hand but will spend the following decades trying to drive their vision forward. But arrogance is their Achilles heel. There is still time to educate, to organise, to resist and to agitate against this hubris, not least by challenging the industrial food giants and the system that sustains them and by advocating for and creating grass-root food movements and local economies that strengthen food sovereignty. Max Weber (1864-1920) was a prominent German sociologist who developed influential theories on rationality and authority. He examined the different types of rationality that underpinned systems of authority. He argued that modern Western societies were based on legal-rational authority and had moved away from systems that were based on traditional authority and charismatic authority. Traditional authority derives its power from long-standing customs and traditions, while charismatic authority is based on the exceptional personal qualities or charisma of a leader. According to Weber, the legal-rational authority that characterises Western capitalist industrial society is based on instrumental rationality that focuses on the most efficient means to achieve given ends. This type of rationality manifests in bureaucratic power. Weber contrasted this with another form of rationality: value rationality that is based on conscious beliefs in the inherent value of certain behaviour. While Weber saw the benefits of instrumental rationality in terms of increased efficiency, he feared that this could lead to a stifling “iron cage” of a rule-based order and rule following (instrumental rationality) as an end in itself. The result would be humanity’s “polar night of icy darkness.” Today, technological change is sweeping across the planet and presents many challenges. The danger is of a technological iron cage in the hands of an elite that uses technology for malevolent purposes. Lewis Coyne of Exeter University says: “We do not — or should not — want to become a society in which things of deeper significance are appreciated only for any instrumental value. The challenge, therefore, is to delimit instrumental rationality and the technologies that embody it by protecting that which we value intrinsically, above and beyond mere utility.” He adds that we must decide which technologies we are for, to what ends, and how they can be democratically managed, with a view to the kind of society we wish to be. A major change that we have seen in recent years is the increasing dominance of cloud-based services and platforms. In the food and agriculture sector, we are seeing the rollout of these phenomena tied to a techno solutionist ‘data-driven’ or ‘precision’ agriculture legitimised by ‘humanitarian’ notions of ‘helping farmers’, ‘saving the planet’ and ‘feeding the world’ in the face of some kind of impending Malthusian catastrophe. A part-fear mongering, part-self-aggrandisement narrative promoted by those who have fuelled ecological devastation, corporate dependency, land dispossession, food insecurity and farmer indebtedness as a result of the global food regime that they helped to create and profited from. Now, with a highly profitable but flawed carbon credit trading scheme and a greenwashed technology-driven eco-modernism, they are supposedly going to save humanity from itself. In the agrifood sector, we are seeing the rollout of data-driven or precision approaches to agriculture by the likes of Microsoft, Syngenta, Bayer and Amazon centred on cloud-based data information services. Data-driven agriculture mines data to be exploited by the agribusiness/big tech giants to instruct farmers what and how much to produce and what type of proprietary inputs they must purchase and from whom. Data owners (Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet etc.), input suppliers (Bayer, Corteva, Syngenta, Cargill etc.) and retail concerns (Amazon, Walmart etc) aim to secure the commanding heights of the global agrifood economy through their monopolistic platforms. But what does this model of agriculture look like in practice? Let us use Bayer’s digital platform Climate FieldView as an example. It collects data from satellites and sensors in fields and on tractors and then uses algorithms to advise farmers on their farming practices: when and what to plant, how much pesticide to spray, how much fertiliser to apply etc. To be part of Bayer’s Carbon Program, farmers have to be enrolled in FieldView. Bayer then uses the FieldView app to instruct farmers on the implementation of just two practices that are said to sequester carbon in the soils: reduced tillage or no-till farming and the planting of cover crops. Through the app, the company monitors these two practices and estimates the amount of carbon that the participating farmers have sequestered. Farmers are then supposed to be paid according to Bayer’s calculations, and Bayer uses that information to claim carbon credits and sell these in carbon markets. Bayer also has a programme in the US called ForGround. Upstream companies can use the platform to advertise and offer discounts for equipment, seeds and other inputs. For example, getting more farmers to use reduced tillage or no-till is of huge benefit to Bayer (sold on the basis of it being ‘climate friendly’ as it keeps carbon in the soil). The kind of reduced tillage or no-till promoted by Bayer requires dousing fields with its RoundUp (toxic glyphosate) or some other toxic herbicide and planting seeds of its genetically engineered herbicide tolerant soybeans or hybrid maize. And what of the cover crops referred to above? Bayer also intends to profit from the promotion of cover crops. It has taken majority ownership of a seed company developing a gene-edited cover crop, called CoverCress. Seeds of CoverCress will be sold to farmers who are enrolled in ForGround and the crop will be sold as a biofuel. But Bayer’s big target is the downstream food companies which can use the platform to claim emissions reductions in their supply chains. Agribusiness corporations and the big tech companies are jointly developing carbon farming platforms to influence farmers on their choice of inputs and farming practices (big tech companies, like Microsoft and IBM, are major buyers of carbon credits). The non-profit GRAIN says (see the article The corporate agenda behind carbon farming) that Bayer is gaining increasing control over farmers in various countries, dictating exactly how they farm and what inputs they use through its Carbon Program. GRAIN argues that, for corporations, carbon farming is all about increasing their control within the food system and is certainly not about sequestering carbon. Digital platforms are intended to be one-stop shops for carbon credits, seeds, pesticides and fertilisers and agronomic advice, all supplied by the company, which gets the added benefit of control over the data harvested from the participating farms. Yanis Varoufakis, former finance minister of Greece, argues that what we are seeing is a shift from capitalism to techno-feudalism. He argues that tech giants like Apple, Meta and Amazon act as modern-day feudal lords. Users of digital platforms (such as companies or farmers) essentially become ‘cloud serfs’, and ‘rent’ (fees, data etc) is extracted from them for being on a platform. In feudalism (land) rent drives the system. In capitalism, profits drive the system. Varoufakis says that markets are being replaced by algorithmic ‘digital fiefdoms’. Although digital platforms require some form of capitalist production, as companies like Amazon or Bayer need manufacturers or farmers to produce goods for their platforms, the new system represents a significant shift in power dynamics, favouring those who own and control the platforms. Whether this system is technofeudalism, hypercapitalism or something else is open to debate. But we should at least be able to agree on one thing: the changes we are seeing are having profound impacts on economies as well as producers and populations that are increasingly surveilled as they are compelled to shift their activities and lives online. The very corporations that are responsible for the problems of the prevailing food system merely offer more of the same, this time packaged in an app-friendly, genetically engineered, ecomodernist, fake-green, carbon-trading wrapping. Elected officials are facilitating this by putting the needs of monopolistic global interests ahead of ordinary people’s personal freedoms and workers’ rights, as well as the needs of independent local producers, enterprises and markets. For instance, the Indian government has in recent times signed memoranda of understanding (MoU) with Amazon, Bayer, Microsoft and Syngenta to rollout data-driven, precision agriculture. Integral to A standardised ‘one world agriculture’ under the control of these companies based on genetically engineered seeds, laboratory created products that resemble food and farming without farmers, with the entire agrifood chain, from field (or lab) to retail in their hands. In response, a ‘citizen letter’ (July 2024) was sent to the government. It stated that it is not clear what the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) will learn from Bayer that the well-paid public sector scientists of the institution cannot develop themselves. The letter says entities that have been responsible for causing an economic and environmental crisis in Indian agriculture are being partnered by ICAR. The letter raises some key concerns. Where is the democratic debate on carbon credit markets? Is the ICAR ensuring that the farmers get the best rather than biased advice that boosts the further rollout of proprietary products? Is there a system in place for the ICAR to develop research and education agendas from the farmers it is supposed to serve as opposed to being led by the whims and business ideas of corporations? The authors of the letter note that copies of the MoUs are not being shared proactively in the public domain by the ICAR. The letter asks that the ICAR suspends the signed MoUs, shares all details in the public domain and desists from signing any more such MoUs without necessary public debate. As will be made clear in the following chapters, this is part of a broader geopolitical strategy to ensure India’s food dependence on foreign corporations and eradicate any semblance of food democracy (or indeed national sovereignty). In a October 2024 report, GRAIN.org sheds some light: “Jayachandra Sharma, a farmer leader from India’s Karnataka Rajya Ryot Sangha farmer union, sees these developments and the digitalisation of agriculture as part of a broader strategy to push millions of farmers out of agriculture and make India’s food supply dependent on global finance and foreign corporations. Given how companies like Microsoft, Syngenta, Amazon and JD.com are expanding, he could well be right.” Genuine approaches to addressing the challenges humanity faces are being ignored by policymakers or cynically attacked by corporate lobbyists. These solutions involve systemic shifts in agricultural, food and economic systems with a focus on low-consumption (energy) lifestyles, localisation and an ecologically sustainable agroecology. As activist John Wilson says, this is based on creative solutions, a connection to nature and the land, nurturing people, peaceful transformation and solidarity. Co-operative labour, fellowship and our long-standing spiritual connection to the land should inform how as a society we should live. This stands in stark contrast to the values and impacts of capitalism and technology based on instrumental rationality and too often fuelled by revenue streams and the goal to control populations. When we hear talk of a ‘spiritual connection’, what is meant by ‘spiritual’? In a broad sense it can be regarded as a concept that refers to thoughts, beliefs and feelings about the meaning of life, rather than just physical existence. A sense of connection to something greater than ourselves. Something akin to Weber’s concept of value rationality. The spiritual, the diverse and the local are juxtaposed with the selfishness of modern urban society, the increasing homogeneity of thought and practice and an instrumental rationality which becomes an end in itself. Having a direct link with nature/the land is fundamental to developing an appreciation of a type of ‘being’ and an ‘understanding’ that results in a reality worth living in. However, what we are seeing is an agenda based on a different set of values rooted in a lust for power and money and the total subjugation of ordinary people (and farmers) being rammed through under the false promise of techno solutionism (think neural laces to detect moods implanted in the skull, programmable digital money, track and trace technology etc.) and some distant notion of a techno utopia that leave malevolent power relations intact and unchallenged. Is this then to be humanity’s never-ending “polar night of icy darkness”? Hopefully not. This vision is being imposed from above. Ordinary people (whether, for example, farmers in India or those being beaten down through austerity policies) find themselves on the receiving end of a class war being waged against them by a mega rich elite. Indeed, in 1941, Herbert Marcuse stated that technology could be used as an instrument for control and domination. Precisely the agenda of the likes of Bayer, the Gates Foundation, BlackRock and the World Bank, which are trying to eradicate genuine diversity and impose a one-size-fits-all model of thinking and behaviour. A final thought courtesy of civil rights campaigner Frederick Douglass in a speech from 1857: “Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will. Find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have found out the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them, and these will continue till they are resisted with either words or blows, or with both. The limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress.” In October 2024, Indian journalist Bharat Dogra noted the following trend in agriculture: “Small farmers are being displaced and family farms are disappearing as those who are truly dedicated to farming have to say tearful farewells to their farms, while billionaires and richest corporations acquire millions of acres of farmland. While small scale food processors too are being pushed out and possibilities of direct contacts between farmers and consumers to promote sustainable livelihoods based on making available healthy food to all are diminishing, giant multinational companies are taking up food production, trade and processing in ways that are harmful for both consumers and farmers.” It might be an inconvenient truth for big agribusiness, land investors and agritech concerns that prefer large-scale industrial agriculture, but small-scale farmers and peasants feed most of the world. That means the types of farms Dogra refers to. What is more, small farms are more productive than their larger counterparts, which is why they are essential for food security. However, the trend noted by Dogra is apparent across the world. And it is something that, as yet, is still in the early stages in India. But have no doubt, this is the plan for India too, where small-scale farmers make up 85 per cent of the farming community. In late 2021, the Indian government announced that three important farm laws, which would have introduced neoliberal shock therapy to the agricultural sector, would be repealed after a one-year farmers’ mobilisation against the legislation (although discussed below, for more in-depth insight into the issues that sparked the protest, see the relevant chapters in Food, Dependency and Dispossession: Resisting the New World Order). The repeal of the three laws was little more than a tactical manoeuvre given that state elections were upcoming in key rural heartlands in 2022. The powerful global interests behind the legislation have not gone away and farmers’ concerns remain highly relevant. These interests have been behind a decades-long agenda to displace the prevailing agri-food system in India. The laws might have been struck down, but the goal to capture and radically restructure the sector remains. The farmers’ struggle in India is not over. The repeal of the controversial farm laws in India may have been seen as a victory for protesting farmers, but it seems the government is pursuing alternative strategies to achieve similar agricultural reforms. These new approaches, while less direct, could potentially implement many of the changes originally proposed in the repealed legislation. The government seems to be gradually introducing smaller, incremental changes to agricultural policies that align with some of the original goals of the farm laws. For instance, an increased focus on digitalisation and technological solutions in agriculture could indirectly achieve some of the aims of the laws, and encouraging private investment and partnerships in the agricultural sector through other means could still lead to increased corporatisation. This chapter and the following three chapters will address this and will discuss the implications of a number of agreements between the Indian government and the likes of Amazon, Bayer and Syngenta that had little to no democratic oversight. But we will begin by looking at the claim that the BJP-led government was seeking to extract revenge for the humiliating defeat it suffered at the hands of the farmers. This claim was made during a press conference that took place in Delhi in October 2023 held by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) (United Farmers Front). The SKM was formed in November 2020 as a coalition of more than 40 Indian farmers’ unions to coordinate non-violent resistance against the three farm acts initiated two months before. Asserting that the laws violated the constitution and were anti-farmer and pro big business, the SKM announced renewed agitation and expressed grave concern about a crackdown by the government against the online media platform NewsClick, which supported the farmers throughout their one-year struggle. Those present heard that there has been “baseless dishonest and false allegations in the Newsclick FIR against the historic farmers’ struggle” and that the “FIR accuses the farmers’ movement as anti-national, funded by foreign and terrorist forces.” An FIR is a ‘first information report’: a document prepared by police in India when they receive information about the commission of a “cognisable” (serious) offence. Delhi Police issued an FIR against NewsClick founder Prabir Purkayastha and the human resources head Amit Chakravarty, which infers that the farmers’ movement was aimed at stopping the supply of essential goods for citizens and creating law and order issues. An article on The Hindu newspaper’s Frontline portal describes the nature of the FIR, which goes far beyond the farmers’ issue, and concludes police actions along with the FIR marks a major low point for media freedom in India. According to Frontline, the police raids on the offices of NewsClick and the residences of virtually anyone associated with it; the indiscriminate seizure of the electronic devices of journalists and other employees; the sealing of the news portal’s main office; the arrest of its founder-editor and its administrative officer on terrorism-related charges; and the searches conducted at the premises of NewsClick and the home of its founder-editor mark the lowest point for media freedom in India since the Emergency of 1975-1977. The withdrawal of the FIR against Newsclick was called for during the press conference. There was also a demand for the immediate release of NewsClick journalists. The SKM said that farmers across the country would burn copies of the FIR on 6 November 2023 after a sustained campaign at village level against the government’s pro-corporate policies from 1-5 November. The farmers’ coalition also pledged to campaign in five poll-going states with the slogan “Oppose Corporate, Punish BJP, Save Country.” It was also announced that a 72-hour sit-in would take place in front of the Raj Bhawans (official residences of state governors) in state capitals between 26 and 28 November. On November 13, 2024, the Supreme Court of India declared Purkayastha’s arrest and subsequent remand as invalid, emphasising that he and his legal counsel were not provided with the grounds for his arrest prior to his remand hearing. The court criticised the police for circumventing due process and noted that the lack of communication regarding the grounds of arrest severely hindered Purkayastha’s ability to defend himself. The Supreme Court’s ruling mandated his release upon fulfilling bail bond requirements set by the trial court. The case highlights ongoing concerns regarding press freedom in India, particularly in relation to government actions against journalists and media outlets perceived as critical of state policies. The SKM stated that the farmers’ movement was committed and patriotic and saw through the “nefarious plan” of the three farm laws to withdraw government support from agriculture and hand over farming, mandis (state-run wholesale agricultural markets) and public food distribution to corporations led by Adani, Ambani, Tata, Cargill, Pepsi, Walmart, Bayer, Amazon and others. It added that the farmers exposed the corporate-backed plan of depriving the people of India of food security, pauperising farmers, changing cropping patterns to suit corporations and allowing the free penetration of foreign corporations into India’s food processing market. Those in attendance also heard about the hardships experienced by farmers during the one-year agitation: “In the process, the farmers braved water cannons, teargas shelling, roadblocks with huge containers, deep road cuts, lathi charge, cold and hot weather. Over 13 months, they sacrificed 732 martyrs… This was a patriotic movement of the highest quality in the face of repression by a fascist government serving interests of Imperialist exploiters.” State investment in agriculture infrastructure was called for, along with the promotion of profitable farming, the facilitation and securing of modern food processing, marketing and consumer networks under the collective ownership and control of peasant-worker cooperatives. Accusing the government of acting on behalf of corporate interests, one speaker said that it had targeted Newsclick because it only did what a genuine news media should have been doing — reporting on the truth, the problems of farmers and the nature of the struggle. It was claimed that: “The BJP Government is using the farcical FIR to spread a canard that the farmers’ movement was anti-people, anti-national and backed by terrorist funding routed through Newsclick. This is factually wrong and mischievously inserted to portray the movement in bad light and seeking to extract revenge for the humiliating defeat they suffered at the hands of the farmers of our country.” The farmers’ coalition argued that the government is moving to falsely charge the farmers movement of being foreign funded and sponsored by terrorist forces, while it is “promoting FDI, Foreign MNCs, big corporations into agriculture.” The coalition said it remains committed to saving the rural economy, preventing foreign looting and rejuvenating the village economy in order to build a strong India. In 2024, farmers were still protesting. Facilitation of the neoliberal corporatisation of farming that sparked the previous protest remains on the board and farmers’ demands have not been met. The World Bank, the WTO, global agribusiness and financial capital are working to corporatise India’s agriculture sector. This plan goes back to the early 1990s and India’s foreign exchange crisis, which was used (and manipulated) to set this plan in motion. This debt-trap ‘structural adjustment’ policy and process involves displacing the current food production system with contract farming and an industrial model of agriculture and food retail that serves the above interests. The aim is to reduce the role of the public sector in agriculture to a facilitator of private capital, which requires industrial commodity-crop farming. The beneficiaries will include Cargill, Archer Daniels Midlands, Louis Dreyfus, Bunge and India’s retail and agribusiness giants as well as the global agritech, seed and agrochemical corporations and the big tech companies with their ‘data-driven agriculture’. The plan is to displace the peasantry, create a land market and amalgamate landholdings to form larger farms that are more suited to international land investors and industrial farming. As a result, there has been an ongoing strategy to make farming non-viable for many of India’s smallholder farmers and force hundreds of millions out of farming and into urban centres that have already sprawled to form peri-urban areas, which often tend to contain the most agriculturally fertile land. The loss of such land should be a concern in itself. It is not as though farmers want to leave farming. It tends to be in their blood. But if the are unable to cover the costs of production and make a decent living due to the lack of guaranteed prices and the issues laid out below, they will flock to the cities to try to gain a foothold in urban economies. And what will those hundreds of millions do? Driven to the cities because of deliberate impoverishment, they will serve as cheap labour or, more likely, an unemployed or underemployed reserve army of labour for global capital — labour which is being replaced with automation. They will be in search of jobs that are increasingly hard to come by the (World Bank reports that there is more than 23 per cent youth unemployment in India). The impoverishment of farmers results from rising input costs, the withdrawal of government assistance, debt and debt repayments and the impacts of cheap, subsidised imports, which depress farmers’ incomes. While corporations in India receive massive handouts and have loans written off, the lack of a secure income, exposure to volatile and manipulated international market prices and cheap imports contribute to farmers’ misery of not being able to cover the costs of production and secure a decent standard of living. The pressure from the richer nations for the Indian government to further reduce support given to farmers and open up to imports and export-oriented ‘free market’ trade is based on nothing but hypocrisy. For instance, policy analyst Devinder Sharma comments that subsidies provided to US wheat and rice farmers are more than the market worth of these two crops. He also notes that, per day, each cow in Europe receives a subsidy worth more than an Indian farmer’s daily income. The World Bank, the WTO, global institutional investors and transnational agribusiness giants require corporate-dictated contract farming and full-scale neoliberal marketisation for the sale and procurement of produce. They demand that India sacrifice its farmers and its own food security for the benefit of a handful of billionaires. Farmers are merely regarded as producers of raw materials (crops) to be fleeced by suppliers of chemical and biotech inputs and the food processing and retail conglomerates. The more farmers can be squeezed, the greater the profits these corporations can extract. This entails creating farmer dependency on costly external inputs and corporate-dominated markets and supply chains. Global agrifood corporations have cleverly and cynically weaved a narrative that equates eradicating food sovereignty and creating dependency with ‘food security’. In 2018, a charter was released by the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (an umbrella group of around 250 farmers’ organisations). The farmers were concerned about the deepening penetration of predatory corporations and the unbearable burden of indebtedness and the widening disparities between farmers and other sectors. They wanted the government to take measures to bring down the input costs of farming, while making purchases of farm produce below the minimum support price (MSP) both illegal and punishable. The charter also called for a special discussion on the universalisation of the public distribution system (PDS), the withdrawal of pesticides that have been banned elsewhere and the non-approval of genetically engineered seeds without a comprehensive need and impact assessment. Other demands included no foreign direct investment in agriculture and food processing, the protection of farmers from corporate plunder in the name of contract farming, investment in farmers’ collectives to create farmer producer organisations and peasant cooperatives and the promotion of agroecology based on suitable cropping patterns and local seed diversity revival. These demands remain relevant today due to government inaction. In fact, the three farm laws that were repealed aimed to do precisely the opposite. They were intended to expose Indian agriculture to a massive dose of neoliberal marketisation and shock therapy. Although the laws were struck down, the corporate interests behind them never went away and are adamant that the Indian government implements the policies they require. This would mean India reducing the state procurement and distribution of essential foodstuffs and eradicating its food buffer stocks — so vital to national food security — and purchasing the nation’s needs with its foreign exchange reserves on manipulated global commodity markets. This would make the country wholly dependent on attracting foreign investment and international finance. To ensure food sovereignty and national food security, the Mumbai-based Research Unit for Political Economy (RUPE) says that MSPs, through government procurement of essential crops and commodities, should be extended to many major cops such as maize, cotton, oilseed and pulses. At the moment, only farmers in certain states who produce rice and wheat are the main beneficiaries of government procurement at the MSP. Since per capita protein consumption in India is abysmally low and has fallen further during the liberalisation era, the provision of pulses in the PDS is long overdue and desperately needed. The PDS works with central government, via the Food Corporation of India, being responsible for buying food grains from farmers at MSPs at state-run market yards or mandis. It then allocates the grains to each state. State governments then deliver to ‘ration shops’. In 2024, farm union leaders were still seeking guarantees for a minimum purchase price for crops. Although the government announces support prices for more than 20 crops each year, government agencies buy only rice and wheat at the support level and, even then, in only some states. State agencies buy the two staples at government-fixed minimum support prices to build reserves to run the world’s biggest food welfare programme that entitles more than 800 million Indians to free rice and wheat. Currently, that’s more than half the population who per household will receive five kilos per month of these essential foodstuffs for at least the next four years, which would be denied to them by the ‘free market’. As we have seen throughout the world, corporate plunder under the guise of neoliberal marketisation is no friend of the poor and those in need who rely on state support to exist. If public procurement of a wider range of crops at the MSP were to occur — and MSPs were guaranteed for rice and wheat across all states — it would help address hunger and malnutrition, encourage crop diversification and ease farmer distress. By helping hundreds of millions involved in farming this way, it would give a massive boost to rural spending power and the economy in general. Instead of rolling back the role of the public sector and surrendering the system to what constitutes a transnational billionaire class and its corporations, there is a need to further expand official procurement and public distribution. The RUPE notes, it would cost around 20 per cent of the current handouts (‘incentives’) received by corporations and their super-rich owners, which do not benefit the bulk of the wider population in any way. It is also worth considering that the loans provided to just five large corporations in India were in 2016 equal to the entire farm debt. However, it is clear that the existence of the MSP, the public distribution system and publicly held buffer stocks are an impediment to global agribusiness interests. In the meantime, the current administration is keen to demonstrate to international finance capital and agricapital that it is being tough on farmers and remains steadfast in its willingness to facilitate the pro-corporate agenda. In 2024, after the breakdown in talks between government and farmers’ representatives, the farmers decided to peacefully march to and demonstrate in Delhi. But at the Delhi border, farmers were met with barricades, tear gas and state violence. However, to date, current farmers’ resistance lacks the momentum of the 2020-21 protests. Furthermore, by one means or another, as the following chapters indicate, the central government continues to ignore the key demands of farmers and hand over the sector to global agribusiness and other corporate interests Farmers produce humanities’ most essential need and are not the ‘enemy within’. The spotlight should fall on the ‘enemy beyond’. Instead of depicting farmers as ‘anti-national’, as sections of the media and prominent commentators in India try to, the focus needs to be on challenging those interests that seek to gain from undermining India’s food security and sovereignty and the impoverishment of farmers. The citizens of India have a problem. In what the media like to call ‘the world’s biggest democracy’, there is a serious, proven conflict of interest among officials in the areas of science, agriculture and agricultural research that results in privileging the needs of powerful private interests ahead of farmers and ordinary people. This has been a longstanding concern. In 2013, for instance, prominent campaigner and environmentalist Aruna Rodrigues said: “The Ministry of Agriculture has handed Monsanto and the industry access to our agri-research public institutions, placing them in a position to seriously influence agri-policy in India. You cannot have a conflict of interest larger or more alarming than this one.” In 2020, Kavitha Kuruganti (Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture) stated that the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee had acted more like a servant for Monsanto: there is an ongoing revolving door between crop developers (even patent holders) and regulators, with developers-cum-lobbyists sitting on regulatory bodies. However, the capture of public policymaking space by the private sector is set to accelerate due to a recent spate of memorandums of understanding between state institutions and influential private corporations involved in agriculture and agricultural services, including Bayer and Amazon. As part of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and Amazon (June 2023), farmers will produce for Amazon Fresh stores in India as part of a ‘farm to fork’ supply chain. It will see “critical inputs” in agriculture and “season-based crop plans” in collaboration with Amazon based on “technologies, capacity building and transfer of new knowledge.” This corporate jargon ties in with the much-publicised notion of ‘data-driven agriculture’ centred on cloud-based data information services (which Amazon also offers). In this model, data is to be accessed and controlled by corporates and the farmer will be told how much production is expected, how much rain is anticipated, what type of soil quality there is, what must be produced and what type of genetically engineered seeds and inputs they must purchase and from whom. This amounts to a recolonisation of Indian agriculture, which will eventually involve a handful of data owners (Microsoft, Amazon etc.), input suppliers (Bayer, Corteva, Syngenta etc.) and retail concerns (Amazon and Walmart-Flipkart — both firms already control 60 per cent of India’s e-commerce market) at the heights of the agrifood economy, determining the nature of agriculture and peddling industrial food. Farmers who remain in this AI-driven system (a stated aim is farmerless farms) will be reduced to exploitable labour at the mercy of global conglomerates. This is part of a broader strategy to shift hundreds of millions out of agriculture, ensure India’s food dependence on global finance and foreign corporations and eradicate any semblance of food democracy (or national sovereignty). In addition to the MoU with Amazon, an MoU was signed between the ICAR and Bayer in September 2023. Bayer (it bought Monsanto in 2018), which profits from various environmentally harmful and disease-causing chemicals like glyphosate, signed the MoU to help “develop resource-efficient, climate-resilient solutions for crops, varieties, crop protection, weed and mechanization”, according to the ICAR website. The ICAR is responsible for co-ordinating agricultural education and research in India, and Bayer seems likely to exploit the ICAR’s vast infrastructure and networks to pursue its own commercial plans, including boosting sales of toxic proprietary products. But that’s not all. According to the non-profit GRAIN in its article ‘The corporate agenda behind carbon farming’, Bayer is gaining increasing control over farmers in various countries, dictating exactly how they farm and what inputs they use through its Carbon Program. GRAIN says: “You can see in the evolution of Bayer’s programmes that, for corporations, carbon farming is all about increasing their control within the food system. It’s certainly not about sequestering carbon.” Given the seriousness of what is laid out by GRAIN in its article, India’s citizens and farmers should take heed, especially as the ICAR website states that a focus of the MoU with Bayer will be on developing carbon credit markets. In a letter (July 2004) to Rabindra Padaria, principal scientist at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), and Himanshu Pathak, director-general of the ICAR, Aruna Rodrigues says: “Inking in ICAR’s formal partnership with Bayer (Monsanto) quite simply confirms straightforwardly that the ICAR protects its interest, which is the same as those of Bayer-Monsanto, large chemical/herbicide corporates… the ICAR has ditched its mandate to Indian farmers and farming, which is to promote farmer interests as a priority in an unbiased and objective assessment of what is right and good for Indian farming and food… “ A separate citizens’ letter was also sent to Pathak on the various MoUs that the Indian government has signed with influential private orporations. Hundreds of scientists, farmer leaders, farmers and ordinary citizens signed the letter. It states: “Bayer is a company notorious for its anti-people, anti-nature business products and operations in itself and, furthermore, after its takeover of Monsanto. Its deadly poisons have violated basic human rights of peoples across the world, and it is a company that has always prioritised profits over people and planet.” It goes on to say that it is not clear what the ICAR will learn from Bayer that the well-paid public sector scientists of the institution cannot develop themselves. The letter says entities that have been responsible for causing an economic and environmental crisis in Indian agriculture are being partnered by ICAR for so-called solutions when these entities are only interested in their profits and not sustainability (or any other nomenclature they use). The letter asks that the ICAR suspends the signed MoUs, shares all details in the public domain and desists from signing any more such MoUs without necessary public debate. However, on 19 July 2024, there were reports that the ICAR had signed another MoU, this time with Syngenta for promoting climate resilient agriculture and training programmes. In response, the authors of the letter state that the ICAR has (again) partnered with a corporation that has a track record of anti-nature and anti-people activities, selling toxic products like paraquat, class action suits against its corn seeds and anti-competitive behaviour. It is becoming clear who the ICAR actually serves. Let us return to Aruna Rodrigues and her letter to Rabindra Padaria (IARI) and Himanshu Pathak (ICAR) for additional insight. Rodrigues’ letter focuses on the commercial cultivation of basmati rice varieties tolerant to imazethapyr-based, non-selective herbicides. These chemicals can be liberally sprayed on herbicide tolerant (HT) crops because the crops have been manipulated to withstand the toxic impacts of spraying. The HT varieties of rice have undergone some form of mutagenesis rather than genetic engineering. Mutagenesis has traditionally involved subjecting plant cells to chemical or physical agents (for example, radiation) that cause mutations to the DNA in the hope that a resulting mutation may produce a desirable effect in the plant. This kind of mutation breeding has been used for decades but only affects a minority of the plants on the market. Industry watchdog GMWatch says this risky technology (mutagenesis breeding) in the past managed to escape regulation. So, this HT crop by the mutagenesis route is not defined as ‘genetic engineering’ (the method usually used to create HT crops) and therefore falls outside the purview of current regulations on genetically modified organisms. Although the Supreme Court-appointed Technical Expert Committee (TEC) bars HT crops (a) for being an HT crop and (b) on account of contamination of crops in a centre of genetic diversity, it has been a long-standing aim of biotech companies like Bayer (Monsanto) to get HT crops cultivated in India. Rodrigues asks: “Is it a deliberate decision of the ICAR to use the mutagenesis route to produce HT rice varieties (tolerant to imazethapyr) with the explicit objective to bypass the formal regulation of GE crops/GMOs?” Rodrigues accuses the ICAR of effectively ditching its mandate to Indian farmers, many of whom regard organic farming as their competitive advantage. This step is also a potential threat to India’s export markets, which are based on organic standards, along with the necessary co-surety that India’s foods and farms are not contaminated by herbicides, a consequence of using HT crops. By adding a trait for herbicide tolerance, the ICAR is informed: “ICAR’s action directly impacts this vital issue of contaminating our germ plasm in rice and contravenes a Supreme Court Order of “No Contamination”. Furthermore, our export markets for basmati are in excess of US $5 billion in 2023-24. Your action will also directly impact India’s exports and thereby, impact farmer export potential, incomes and income opportunities that premium prices provide.” Moreover, Rodrigues asserts that the entire mutagenesis process for HT rice must be elaborated, especially when the mutant variety is for the purpose of human consumption. The ICAR is duty-bound to provide, for example, whether a physical or a chemical mutagen was used, the range of doses used and the toxicity for the said material, the herbicide(s) used (a key concern, given the effects of certain herbicides on human health — see below) to test the HT of the basmati rice being used, the concentrations of the herbicides used and the genetic mechanism by which HT rice through mutagenesis has a resistant gene to imazethapyr. While the issue of intellectual property rights for the HT rice varieties using mutagenesis is unclear, the ICAR and IARI have executed a technology transfer agreement of the HT trait for commercial cultivation. In her letter, Rodrigues states that, based on empirical evidence of 35 years of HT crops in the US and Argentina, HT crops are a failed technology: it spawns super weeds, increased herbicide use and no added performance yield. Moreover, for India, HT crops are a perverse use of technology, whether genetic engineering or through mutagenesis, that risks small and marginal farmers’ crops and herbs and plants used in many Ayurvedic medicines because of herbicide drift. It will also uniquely impact the employment of women in weeding. Rodrigues goes on to state (with evidence provided) that in the US overall herbicide use has increased more than tenfold since the introduction of HT Crops (1992-2012 figure). In addition, HT crops are designed for monocultures and completely unsuited to Indian small-holder, multi-crop farming: anything not HT will be destroyed, the resistant crop stands, but everything else dies, including non-target organisms. The herbicides used with HT crops are also a major human health issue. There is a strong link between glyphosate and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. In relation to this, there are more than 100,000 lawsuits winding their way through US Courts. Glyphosate (used in Bayer’s Roundup herbicide) is also an endocrine disruptor and is linked to birth defects. Monsanto and the US Environmental Protection Agency had both known for over 40 years that glyphosate and its formulations cause cancer. Other herbicides used by Bayer include glufosinate (used in its Liberty herbicide), which is acknowledged as more toxic than glyphosate and, like it, is a systemic, broad spectrum, non-selective herbicide. It is a neurotoxin that can cause nerve damage and birth defects and is damaging to most plants that come into contact with it. Glufinosate is banned in Europe and not permitted in India. It has been implicated in brain developmental abnormalities in animal studies and is very persistent in the environment, so it will certainly contaminate water supplies in addition to food where it will be absorbed. Imazethapyr (contained in Bayer’s Adue herbicide) is also a systemic broad-spectrum herbicide and is banned in some countries and not approved for use in the EU. Prof. Jack Heinemann (University of Canterbury in New Zealand) adds that the likes of imazethapyr must be tested for their ability to cause bacterial antibiotic resistance. An important concern given that India’s population has some of the highest levels of antibiotic resistance in the world. Any spread of HT crops would put people at severe risk of resistance and disease. Despite these environmental and health concerns, the herbicide market in India is projected to grow by around 54 per cent in the next five years, from USD 361.85 million in 2024 to USD 558.17 million by 2029. Rodrigues concludes: “In view of the above evidence of serious irreversible harm to health, food and agriculture across several dimensions and contravention of the PP (Precautionary Principle), it is a required scientific response for the ICAR to immediately withdraw HT rice varieties and desist from introducing any HT crop through mutagenesis.” Environmentalist and campaigner Rosemary Mason has been relentlessly exposing the insidious effects of agrochemicals on human health and the environment through a decade-long series of incisive reports. Many of these reports have taken the form of scathing open letters directed at corporations, regulators and officials in the UK and the EU. Mason has never held back in her condemnations of the agrochemical giants. After Bayer’s acquisition of Monsanto in 2018, her focus sharpened on Bayer, scrutinising its troubling history and its actions, not least during one of humanity’s darkest chapters: Nazi Germany. Bayer’s complicity as part of IG Farben, a chemical and pharmaceutical conglomerate notorious for its involvement in war crimes, is well documented. The company was formed in 1925 from a merger of six chemical firms: Agfa, BASF, Bayer, Chemische Fabrik Griesheim-Elektron, Hoechst and Weiler-ter-Meer. Bayer was not merely an observer but an active participant in heinous medical experiments conducted on concentration camp inmates. These experiments involved testing drugs on unwilling subjects, including those at Auschwitz, where prisoners were deliberately infected with diseases to evaluate Bayer’s pharmaceuticals. During World War I, Bayer was involved in the development of chemical weapons, including chlorine and mustard gas. As part of IG Farben, Bayer later contributed to the creation of nerve agents like Tabun, Sarin and Soman. Post-war, Bayer transitioned these chemical developments into pesticides such as parathion, which are neurotoxic. In addition, IG Farben was implicated in the production of Zyklon B, the gas used in concentration camps. Executives from IG Farben were convicted for their roles in war crimes at the Nuremberg Trials. . IG Farben Building, Frankfurt, completed in 1931 and seized by the Allies in 1945 as the headquarters of the Supreme Allied Command. In 2001 it became part of the University of Frankfurt. (Licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0) . Bayer’s leadership was fully aware of these atrocities yet chose profit over ethics, benefiting from the forced labour of concentration camp inmates to produce essential chemicals for the Nazi war machine. The aftermath of World War II saw Bayer and other IG Farben companies face minimal repercussions for their actions. While some executives were tried, they received light sentences or were released early, allowing them to reclaim positions of power within their companies. As for Bayer, things did not stop with the end of the war. The Powerbase website provides a very long list of Bayer’s corporate wrongdoings since 1945, including allegations of corporate bullying, monopolistic practices, the suppression of scientific information, bribery, poisonings, false advertising and abusing workers. More recently, Bayer has inherited a legacy of deception through its acquisition of Monsanto. Both companies have been accused of concealing the health risks associated with glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup and the world’s most used agricultural herbicide. Internal documents reveal a concerted effort to downplay glyphosate’s carcinogenicity while ignoring substantial evidence indicating its dangers to human health. In her numerous reports, Mason has indicated how Bayer shaped regulatory processes to secure product approvals, influencing scientific studies and regulatory decisions while suppressing contrary evidence. The environmental devastation wrought by pesticides is alarming: Mason cites significant declines in biodiversity and poisoned ecosystems that she claims are as a direct consequence of the widespread use of Bayer’s chemicals. Moreover, rising cancer rates in communities exposed to Bayer’s products cannot be ignored, especially increasing cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma linked to glyphosate use in areas heavily treated with these chemicals. Rosemary Mason is not alone in her condemnation of Bayer. For instance, journalist Carey Gillam has written extensively about Bayer-Monsanto’s practices, particularly in relation to glyphosate and its health impacts in the book ‘Whitewash: The Story of a Weed Killer, Cancer, and the Corruption of Science’. Gillam says: “US Roundup litigation began in 2015 after the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen. Internal Monsanto documents dating back decades show that the company was aware of scientific research linking its weed killer to cancer but instead of warning consumers, the company worked to suppress the information and manipulate scientific literature.” Gillam has shown that, over the years, Monsanto mounted a deceitful defence of its health- and environment-damaging Roundup and its genetically modified crops, and it orchestrated toxic smear campaigns against anyone — scientist or campaigner — who threatened its interests. With that in mind, it comes as no surprise that a US-Based PR firm has created a watchlist, profiling activists, scientists and journalists who are critical of pesticide use and genetically modified organisms, as recently revealed in documents obtained by the investigative newsroom Lighthouse Reports. As a result of a year-long investigation, Lighthouse Reports argues that this operation seeks to cast pesticide critics, environmental scientists or campaigners as an anti-science “protest industry” and used US government money to do so. The watchlist is the brainchild of Jay Byrne, a former communications executive at Monsanto, and his reputation management firm v-Fluence. It comprises profiles (including personal information) on hundreds of scientists, campaigners and writers. These profiles have been published on a private social network, which grants privileged access to 1,000 people comprising a who’s-who of the agrochemical industry, alongside government officials from multiple countries. The US government funded v-Fluence as part of its programme to promote genetically modified organisms in Africa and Asia, including “enhanced monitoring” of critics of “modern agriculture approaches” — and to build the network. Watchlists and hitlists aside, to further its interests, the agrochemical giants pour huge resources into lobbying that seeks to shape narratives, deceive and coerce rather than engage with genuine public health and environmental concerns. The research and campaign group Corporate Europe Observatory (CEO) recently took a deep dive into Bayer’s disturbing “toxic trail” of lobbying as the company strives to maintain its huge slice of the seed and pesticides markets, fight off regulatory challenges to its toxic products, limit legal liability and exercise political influence. CEO’s report ‘Bayer’s Toxic Trails: Market Power, Monopolies and the Global Lobbying of an Agrochemicals Giant’ notes that Bayer spent between €7 million and €8 million in 2023 on EU lobbying, the biggest sum declared by any individual chemical company and the highest amount ever spent by Bayer on EU lobbying. According to CEO, Bayer’s current top lobbying priority in Europe is to derail the original ambitions of the European Green Deal and to prevent any of the company’s firmly established interests (chemicals and pesticides) from being touched. One of the central goals of this deal is to reduce the use and risk of chemical pesticides by 50 per cent by 2030 through the EU’s Farm to Fork strategy. This target aims to address both environmental and public health concerns associated with pesticide use in agriculture. Bayer’s lobby spend in the US has also risen considerably over the past few years, spending $7.5 million in 2023 alone, some of which is aimed at securing changes in the law to prevent further litigation cases and more hefty payouts to people suffering from conditions due to glyphosate exposure. To date, the company has reportedly paid out approximately $11 billion to settle nearly 100,000 lawsuits stemming from claims that Roundup causes cancer, particularly non-Hodgkin lymphoma. CEO states: “Bayer’s lobby tactics continue to capture public policymaking and in doing so hollow out democracy. A perverse symbiosis between corporate lobby groups and decision-makers has been actively created through its economic weight and large investments in many corners of the world, and this consistently leads to crucial decisions being made in favour of industry profits, rather than public interest.” It concludes that: “Around the world, Bayer’s modus operandi is not to work in the public interest but rather to capture public policy to serve its private interests and dividends of its shareholders, all while ignoring the public health and environmental impact of its activities.” So, why would a government want to do a deal with the devil? As stated in the previous chapter, that is precisely what the government of India seems to have done when it signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Bayer in September 2023. Bayer signed the MoU with the Indian Council for Agricultural Research (ICAR), which is responsible for co-ordinating agricultural education and research in India. Bayer’s aim first and foremost seems to be to exploit the ICAR’s vast infrastructure and networks to pursue its own commercial plans, including boosting sales of toxic proprietary products and the introduction of genetically modified food crops into India. These crops would be reliant on Bayer’s agrochemicals. Attempts to get genetically modified food crops into India’s fields is being done by all means necessary, as explained in Aruna Rodrigues insightful online article Waltzing with Bayer Makes The Indian Council of Agricultural Research Blind: India Ditches Mandate to Farmers and Uses Mutagenesis to Drive Toxic HT Crops Into India. That article explains that mutagenetic techniques are being used to bypass existing regulatory procedures in relation to genetically modified organisms, despite a recent Supreme Court directive for the government to formulate a national policy framework on genetically modified crops based on a democratic consultative process. Telangana State Seed Development Corporation chairman S Anvesh Reddy recently stated that farmers want a bio-safety policy and not a promotional policy for genetically modified crops. However, they are in danger of getting the latter. Prominent campaigner Kavitha Kuruganti has warned that the Ministry of Agriculture may bypass the democratic consultative processes recommended by the Supreme Court. It has already appointed a panel of ‘experts’ to draft the policy and information about it is being kept secret. On X (formerly Twitter), agricultural policy specialist Devinder Sharma stated: “How can a policy be framed for GM crops when there is still no consensus on the need for these crops? Despite heavy lobbying by industry, most countries oppose it.” How can this be? Let us turn to Aruna Rodrigues: “Our regulatory bodies have been captured by the biotech and agrichemical industries… It is breathtaking; all pretence is gone. We have a cancer that is metastasising vertically and horizontally throughout the entire regulatory body.” The need for genetically modified food crops is based on unsound logic, and, in general, neither farmers nor the public want them (see the online article Challenging the Flawed Premise Behind Pushing GMOs into Indian Agriculture). Moreover, the failure of Bt cotton in the country, India’s only officially approved genetically modified crop (see The Failure of GMO Cotton In India on resilience.org), should serve as a warning. In the meantime, farmers’ leaders from 18 states in India have resolved to oppose genetically modified crops. They say genetically modified organisms in agriculture are harmful to human and animal health, the environment, farmers’ livelihoods and trade and are based on failed promises. For some critics, if one firm tops a league table for anti-people, anti-nature business practices, it is Bayer (although there are many other worthy candidates). Nevertheless, as previously stated, the Indian Council for Agricultural Research (ICAR) signed a memorandum of understanding with Bayer in September 2023. Bayer’s approach to agricultural development involves promoting a model of industrial agriculture dependent on corporate products, including its toxic chemicals and genetically modified crops, and advocating for precision, data-driven agriculture that relies heavily on its proprietary technologies and software. Simon Wiebusch, Country Divisional Head of Crop Science for Bayer South Asia, recently stated that India cannot become a ‘developed nation’ with ‘backward’ agriculture. He believes India’s agriculture sector must modernise for the country to achieve developed nation status by 2047. Bayer’s vision for agriculture in India includes prioritising and fast-tracking approvals for its new products, introducing genetically modified food crops, addressing labour shortages (for weeding) by increasingly focusing on herbicides and developing herbicides for specific crops like paddy, wheat, sugarcane and maize. Government institutions like the ICAR seem likely to allow Bayer to leverage the agency’s infrastructure and networks to pursue its commercial plans. Wiebusch’s comments have received much media coverage. There is a tendency for journalists and media outlets to accept statements made by people in top corporate jobs as pearls of wisdom never to be critically questioned, especially in India when there is talk of the country achieving the gold standard in the eyes of some: ‘developed status’. But people like Wiebusch are hardly objective. They are not soothsayers who have an unbiased view of the world and its future. Bayer has a view of what agriculture should look like and is gaining increasing control of farmers in various countries in terms of having a direct influence on how they farm and what inputs they use. Its digital platforms are intended to be one-stop shops for carbon credits, seeds, pesticides and fertilisers and agronomic advice, all supplied by the company, which gets the added benefit of control over the agronomic and financial data harvested from farms. As for carbon credits, the non-profit GRAIN argues that, like digital platforms per se, carbon trading is about consolidating control within the food system and is certainly not about sequestering carbon. So, what does Wiebusch mean when he talks about modernisation of a backward agriculture in India? All of what is set out above and more. Like Wiebusch, corporate lobbyists often refer to ‘modern agriculture’. Instead, we should really be advocating for a system that produces healthy food for all while sustaining farming communities and livelihoods. That’s because the term ‘modern agriculture’ is deliberately deceptive: it means a system dependent on proprietary inputs and integrated with corporate global supply chains. Anything other is defined as ‘backward’. According to Bayer, Wiebusch is a star player who can drive market share and create business value for the company. On the Bayer India website it says: “Simon’s key strengths include unlocking business growth, redefining distribution strategies, driving change management and building diverse teams that drive market share and create business value.” Stripped of the corporate jargon and any talk of ‘helping’ India, the goal is to secure control of the sector and ensure corporate dependency. That is what is really meant by creating business value and driving market share. India has achieved self-sufficiency in food grains and has ensured there is enough food (in terms of calories) available to feed its entire population. It is the world’s largest producer of milk, pulses and millets and the second-largest producer of rice, wheat, sugarcane, groundnuts, vegetables, fruit and cotton. In 2014, environmental scientist Viva Kermani stated that India has been self-sufficient in food staples for over a decade and more than that for cereals. She noted that the country: “… grows about 100 million tons (mt) of rice, 95 mt of wheat, 170 mt of vegetables, 85 mt of fruit, 40 mt of coarse cereals and 18 mt of pulses (refer to the Economic Survey for the data). These totals ensure that our farmers grow enough to feed all Indians well with food staples. We have 66 mt of grain, two-and-a-half times the required buffer stock (on January 1, 2013).” She concluded: “The country has reached this stage through, first and foremost, the knowledge and skill of our farmers who have bred and saved seed themselves and exchanged their seed in ways that made our fields so biodiverse.” Kermani also observed that farmers have legitimate claims to being scientists, innovators, natural resource stewards, seed savers and hybridisation experts. However, they have too often been reduced to becoming recipients of technical fixes and consumers of the poisonous products of a growing agricultural inputs industry. It is clear that Bayer needs India for its corporate growth strategy, but who needs Bayer? Bhaskar Save certainly did not on his impressively bountiful organic farm in Gujarat. In 2006, he described in an eight-page open letter (along with six annexures) to M S Swaminathan (widely regarded as the father of the Green Revolution in India) how the type of chemical-intensive agriculture that Bayer promotes and the urban-centric model of development favoured by the government has had devastating environmental economic and social consequences for India. Save offered agroecological alternatives to address the problems, including solutions to boost farmer incomes and rural communities, cultivate a wider range of nutrient-dense crops, build soil fertility, improve water management, enhance on-farm ecology and increase biodiversity. The prominent environmentalist Vandana Shiva recently posted on X: “India’s agriculture was sustained over 10,000 years because it was based on nature’s laws of diversity, recycling, regeneration & circularity. Albert Howard spread organic farming worldwide learning from Indian peasants. Working with nature is sophistication, not backwardness. “Bayer calling India’s agriculture backward is a new toxic colonisation. Bayer/Monsanto, the poison cartel whose roots are in war, has driven biodiversity to extinction with monocultures, spread cancers with glyphosate & herbicides, destroyed democracy.” It seems that the ‘poor’ must be helped out of their awful ‘backwardness’ by the West and its powerful corporations and billionaire ‘philanthropists’ like Bill Gates. What some might regard as ‘backward’ stems from an ethnocentric ideology, which is used to legitimise the destruction of communities and economies that were once locally based and self-sufficient. Bayer promotes a corporate expansionist ‘development’ agenda that is self-sustaining and can be described as anything but development (see the online article Resisting Genetically Mutilated Food and the Eco-Modern Nightmare). Companies like Bayer present their technologies and products as fixes for the problems created by the model of ‘growth’ and ‘development’ they promote. ‘Scientific innovation’ is touted as the answer. The proposed solutions often create new problems or worsen existing ones. This leads to a cycle of dependency on corporate products and technologies. Monsanto’s failed Bt cotton in India being a case in point. Problems created by corporate-led development become opportunities for further corporate inputs and the commodification of knowledge and further ‘expert’ interventions. The primary motivation is financial gain rather than genuine societal improvement. Corporate-driven ‘development’ is a misnomer, especially in agriculture, as it often leads to regression in terms of health, environmental sustainability and rural community resilience, while perpetuating a cycle of problems and ‘solutions’ that primarily benefit large corporations. But the type of agroecological solutions presented by the likes of Bhaskar Save run counter to Bayer’s aims of more pesticides, more genetically modified organisms, more control and corporate consolidation. For example, as previously mentioned, the industry seeks to derail the EU’s farm to fork strategy (which involves a dramatic reduction in agrochemical use), and Bayer spends record amounts to shape policies to its advantage, courtesy of its entrenched lobbying networks. Of course, Bayer presents its neocolonial aspirations in terms of helping backward Indian farmers. A good old dose of Western saviourism. To promote its model, Bayer must appear to offer practical solutions. It uses the narrative of climate emergency to promote a Ponzi carbon trading scheme that is resulting in land displacement across the world. And Bayer says that labour shortages for manual weeding in Indian agriculture are a significant challenge, so the rollout of toxic herbicides like glyphosate are a necessity. But there are several approaches to address this issue beyond relying on herbicides like glyphosate (it will kill all plants that do not have the herbicide tolerant trait), which is wholly unsuitable for a nation comprising so many small farms cultivating a diverse range of crops. Mechanical weeding using animal-drawn or tractor-powered implements for larger farms is one solution, and there are several agronomic techniques that can help suppress weeds and reduce labour needs: crop rotation disrupts weed lifecycles, higher planting densities shade out weeds, proper fertilisation gives crops a competitive advantage and use of cover crops and mulches can suppress weed growth. Even here, however, there are cynical attempts to get farmers to change their cultivation methods (with no tangible financial benefits) and move away from traditional systems. In the article The Ox Fall Down: Path Breaking and Treadmills in Indian Cotton Agriculture, for instance, we see farmers being nudged away from traditional planting methods and pushed towards a method inconducive to oxen ploughing but very conducive for herbicide-dependent weed management. That article notes the huge growth potential for herbicides in India, something companies like Bayer are keen to capitalise on. Wiebusch talks of India reaching ‘developed status’. But what does the type of ‘development’ he proposes entail? We need only look around us for the answer: decision-making centralised in the hands of government and corporate entities, traditional local governance structures weakened and standardised, top-down policies and corporate consolidation through mergers and acquisitions with local independent enterprises struggling to compete. Consolidated corporations have greater lobbying power to shape regulations in their favour, further entrenching their market position. In other words, political centralisation and corporate consolidation are often intertwined. Centralised political structures tend to align with the interests of large, consolidated corporations, and both centralised governments and large corporations exert greater control over resources. This dual process has led to reduced economic diversity and resilience, weakened local communities and traditions, increased vulnerability to systemic shocks and diminished democratic participation. ‘Developed status’ also means accelerated urbanisation, land amalgamations for industrial-scale farming and depopulation of the countryside. And it means farmers being encouraged to grow cash crops for export based on trade policies that work in favour of big landowners and heavily subsidised Western agriculture. As mentioned earlier, it has been estimated that between 2016 and 2030, globally, urban areas will have tripled in size, expanding into cropland and undermining the productivity of agricultural systems. Around 60 per cent of the world’s cropland lies on the outskirts of cities. This land is, on average, twice as productive as land elsewhere on the globe. As cities expand, millions of small-scale farmers are displaced. These farmers produce the majority of food in the Global South and are key to global food security. A combination of urbanisation and policies deliberately designed to displace the food-producing peasantry will serve to boost the corporate takeover of India’s agrifood sector. This is what Bayer calls ‘development’. But none of this is inevitable. Many of us know what the response should be: prioritising sustainable, locally appropriate solutions and restoring food sovereignty and the economic vibrancy of rural communities; focusing on holistic human well-being rather than narrow economic metrics of ‘growth’; preserving traditional knowledge that underpins highly productive farming practices for the benefit of farmers, consumer health and the environment; and empowering communities through localism and decentralisation rather than creating state-corporate dependency. Such solutions are markedly different from those characterised by rural population displacement, the subjugation of peoples and nature, nutrient-poor diets, degraded on-farm and off-farm ecosystems and corporate consolidation. There are alternative visions for the future, alternative visions of human development. But these do not boost corporate margins or control and do not fit the hegemonic narrative of what passes for ‘development’. However, it is concerning that what Bayer advocates is regarded as the common sense of the age. The ultimate coup d’état by the transnational agribusiness conglomerates is that state officials, scientists and journalists take as given that profit-driven Fortune 500 corporations have a legitimate claim to be custodians of natural assets. These corporations have convinced so many that they have the ultimate legitimacy to own, control and manage what is essentially humanity’s commonwealth. Water, food, soil, land and agriculture have been handed over to powerful transnational corporations to milk for profit as though they are serving the needs of humanity. Corporations which promote industrial agriculture have embedded themselves deeply within the policy-making machinery on both national and international levels. The ultimate intertwining of political centralisation and corporate consolidation. It should be clear by now that the issues raised in this book transcend a narrow analysis of the food system. There has been much discussion about social control, technocracy and even transhumanism. And this chapter is no different. It is essential to explore broader power dynamics in order to gain a clearer understanding of the global food regime and the corporations and interests behind it. Power is increasingly concentrated in the hands of an elite that wields its considerable wealth, influence and technological advancements to dominate both resources and populations, profoundly shaping the fabric of our lives. In recent years, we have seen the nudging (manipulating) of populations to accept a ‘new normal’ based on, among other things, a climate emergency narrative, pandemic preparedness tyranny, unaccountable AI, synthetic ‘food’ and farmerless farms. Whether it involves a ‘food transition’, an ‘energy transition’, 15-minute cities or some other benign-sounding term, all this is to be determined by a supranational state-corporate ‘stakeholder’ elite with ordinary people sidelined in the process. An undemocratic agenda designed to place restrictions on individual liberty, marking a dramatic shift towards authoritarianism. In the 1980s, to help legitimise the deregulation-privatisation neoliberal globalisation agenda, government and media instigated an ideological onslaught on populations, driving home the primacy of ‘free enterprise’, individual rights and responsibility and emphasising a shift away from the role of the state, trade unions and the collective in society. We are currently seeing another ideological shift: individual rights and freedoms are said to undermine the wider needs of society and the planet; in a stark turnaround, personal freedom is now said to pose a threat to national security, public health or the climate. As in the 1980s, this messaging is being driven by an economic impulse. This time, the collapsing neoliberal project. In the UK, poverty is increasing, food banks are now a necessary part of life for millions. Indeed, the poorest families are enduring a ‘frightening’ collapse in living standards, resulting in life-changing and life-limiting poverty. In the US, it was reported in 2023 that around 30 million low-income people are on the edge of a ‘hunger cliff’ as a portion of their federal food assistance is taken away. In 2021, it was estimated that one in eight children were going hungry in the US. In April 2023, it was reported that small businesses were filing for bankruptcy in the US at a record rate. Image is from the Bank of England website The Bank of England’s chief economist, Huw Pill, says that people should ‘accept’ being poorer. This is similar to the response of Rob Kapito, co-founder of the world’s biggest asset management firm, BlackRock. In 2022, the unimaginably rich and entitled Kapito said that a “very entitled” generation of (ordinary working) people who have never had to sacrifice would soon have to face shortages for the first time in their lives. While business as usual prevails in Kapito’s world of privilege and that of major arms, energy, pharmaceuticals and food companies, whose megarich owners continue to rake in massive profits, Kapito and Pill tell ordinary people to get used to poverty and the ‘new normal’ as if we are ‘all in it together’ — billionaires and working class alike. They conveniently used COVID and the situation in Ukraine as cover for the collapsing neoliberalism. But this is part of the hegemonic agenda that seeks to ensure that the establishment’s world view is the accepted cultural norm. And anyone who challenges this world view — whether it involves, for instance, questioning climate alarmism, the ‘new normal’, the nature of the economic crisis, the mainstream COVID narrative or the official stance on Ukraine and Russia — is regarded as a spreader of misinformation and the ‘enemy within’. If we turn to New Zealand, we could see this in action during and after the COVID event. The country’s former prime minister Jacinda Ardern grabbed the global limelight a few years ago, making headlines by stating she wanted to put ‘kindness’ into politics. In 2019, Foreign Policy, a publication closely associated with the Atlantic Council and the US State Department, published the article ‘The Kindness Quotient’, a glowing promotion of Ardern. The strategic marketing of Ardern in various publications focused on her likeability, pro-environment stance, compassionate values and collaborative nature. To further appeal to liberal sentiments, she was said to represent everything Trump is not. Ardern belongs to a set of global leaders who were groomed for their positions through the World Economic Forum (WEF) Young Global Leaders Programme. Yes, that WEF — the elitist organisation where hard-nose billionaires and their handmaidens gather to set out policies aligned with powerful business interests. The charm offensive that Ardern’s promoters undertook was an investment. She delivered on COVID by implementing lockdowns and restrictions without question. Arden stated in her speech to the UN in September 2022: “As leaders, we are rightly concerned that even the most light-touch approaches to disinformation could be misinterpreted as hostile to values of free speech that we value so highly.” She went on to say: “How do you tackle climate change if people believe it does not exist? How do you ensure the human rights of others are upheld as they are subjected to hateful and dangerous ideology.” She continued by saying free speech (that the authorities disagree with) can be a weapon of war. During COVID, Ardern urged citizens to trust the government and its agencies for all information and stated: “Otherwise, dismiss anything else. We will continue to be your single source of truth.” Throughout that period, in the US, Fauci presented himself as ‘the science’. In New Zealand, Ardern’s government was ‘the truth’. It was similar in countries across the world. Different figures but the same approach. When anyone in power or any institution lays claim to ‘the truth’, history shows we are on a slippery slope to silencing thought and dissent that we disagree with. Like other political leaders, during COVID, Ardern clamped down on civil liberties with the full force of state violence on hand to ensure compliance with ‘the truth’. Clearly, Ardern was not alone here. Trudeau, the Biden administration and others have continued to display Orwellian undertones as they spoke of the need to challenge ‘misinformation’ and those who question ‘the truth’. The thin end of a very wide authoritarian wedge. It seems, especially post-COVID, critical analysis and open debate are fine as long as those involved keep within the framework of what is deemed supportive of official narratives. We are often urged to ‘trust the science’ and accept that the ‘science is decided’ on various issues. We heard this on the COVID issue, when we were told governments are ‘following the science’, while they and the big tech companies censored world-renowned scientists and opposing views and opinions. In ‘following the science’, conflicts of interest were rife and notions of objectivity, open disclosure and organised scepticism — core values of scientific endeavour — were trampled on. Those who questioned the COVID narrative were smeared, shut down and censored, the playbook of big agribusiness — manipulating science, smearing critics, derailing policies that threaten its interests and claiming that ‘the science is decided’ on genetically modified organisms — and authoritarian governments. Is anyone who questions and wants a more open debate on climate change or whether such change is occurring as stated or will lead to ‘extinction’ to be charged with disseminating misinformation? Is questioning the orthodoxy of the zero-carbon policy agenda to be shut down and those who challenge it to be labelled ‘extremists’. Ardern asked: “How do you tackle climate change if people believe it does not exist?” But it is also pertinent to ask: How do you tackle it if you accept it exists? Even if we accept humanity is in trouble and facing a genuine climate emergency, people should at least be able to question the current ‘green’ agenda based on a ‘stakeholder capitalism’ strategy (governments and others facilitating the needs of private capital) that has co-opted genuine concerns about the environment to pursue new multi-billion-dollar global investment opportunities (described in the 2020 report Nature for Sale by Friends of the Earth). If you read that report, you might conclude that we are witnessing a type of green imperialism that is using genuine concerns about the environment to pursue a familiar agenda of extractivism, colonisation and commodification. The same old mindset, greenwashed and rolled out for public consumption. Ardern’s utterances on the dangers of free speech, the singularity of ‘truth’ and the implicit shift towards authoritarianism must be viewed within the context of managing an economic crisis. What she was saying revealed how the financial and political elites based on Wall Street, in Washington and in the City of London were thinking. The authorities fear blowback in terms of mass dissent and uprisings. A few years ago, Liz Truss, then UK prime minister, wanted to place ‘legal curbs’ on striking trade unions. There is also the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts (PCSC) Act 2022, which may undermine the right to protest. It therefore comes as no surprise that, today, individual rights and free speech are under threat. The ultimate control mechanism would be linking central bank digital currencies to personal carbon footprints (including eating habits), spending and dissent in an age of economic turmoil. Trudeau might have given the game away on that when he hit protesting truckers where it hurt most — restricting access to bank accounts. How long before ‘misinformation’ and challenging ‘the truth’ becomes thought crime and — as Jacinda Ardern might put it — ‘cruel to be kind’ actions are taken against those who challenge dominant state-corporate narratives? Well, not long because we have already witnessed it during the last few years. A doubling down since COVID. Tyranny is the type of ‘kindness’ we don’t need. The term ‘enemy within’ was popularised by Margaret Thatcher during the UK miners’ strike in 1984-85 to describe the striking miners. But it is a notion with which Britain’s rulers have regarded protest movements and uprisings down the centuries. From the Peasants’ Revolt in 1381 to the Levellers and Diggers (who are discussed in the final chapter) in the 17th century, it is a concept associated with anyone or any group that challenges the existing social order and the interests of the ruling class. John Ball, a radical priest, addressed the Peasants’ Revolt rebels with the following words: “Good friends, matters cannot go well in England until all things be held in common; when there shall be neither vassals nor lords; when the lords shall be no more masters than ourselves.” The revolt was suppressed. John Ball was captured and hung, drawn and quartered. Part of the blood-soaked history of the British ruling class. Later on, the 17th-century Diggers’ movement wanted to create small, egalitarian rural communities and farm on common land that had been privatised by enclosures. The 1975 song ‘The world Turned Upside Down’ by Leon Rosselson commemorates the Diggers. His lyrics describe the aims and plight of the movement. In Rosselson’s words, the Diggers were dispossessed via theft and murder but reclaimed what was theirs only to be violently put down. Little surprise then that, in the 1980s, Margaret Thatcher used the full force of state machinery to defeat the country’s most powerful trade union, the shock troops of the labour movement, the National Union of Mineworkers — ‘the enemy within’. She needed to do this to open the gates for capital to profit from the subsequent deindustrialisation of much of the UK and the dismantling of large parts of the welfare state. And the result? A hollowed-out, debt-bloated economy, the destruction of the social fabric of entire communities and the great financial Ponzi scheme — the ‘miracle’ of deregulated finance — that now teeters on the brink of collapse, leading the likes of Kapito and Pill to tell the public to get ready to become poor. And now, in 2024, the latest version of the ‘enemy within’ is anyone who disseminates ‘misinformation’ — anything that challenges the official state-corporate narrative. So, this time, one goal is to have a fully controlled (censored) internet. For instance, US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) awarded Accrete a contract for Argus to detect disinformation threats from social media. Argus is AI software that analyses social media data to predict emergent narratives and generate intelligence reports at a speed and scale to help neutralise viral disinformation threats. Accrete AI is a leading dual-use enterprise AI company. It deployed its AI Argus software for open-source threat detection with the US Department of Defense in 2022. In a press release, Prashant Bhuyan, founder and CEO of Accrete, boasted: “Social media is widely recognised as an unregulated environment where adversaries routinely exploit reasoning vulnerabilities and manipulate behaviour through the intentional spread of disinformation. USSOCOM is at the tip of the spear in recognising the critical need to identify and analytically predict social media narratives at an embryonic stage before those narratives evolve and gain traction. Accrete is proud to support USSOCOM’s mission.” ‍This is about predicting wrong think on social media. But control over the internet is just part of a wider programme of establishment domination, surveillance and dealing with protest and dissent. The online article How the Government Weaponizes Surveillance to Silence Its Critics notes that, on any given day, the average person in the US is monitored, spied on and tracked in more than 20 different ways. The authors of the article ask us to consider some of the ways the US government is weaponising its surveillance technologies to flag citizens as a threat to national security, whether or not they have done anything wrong — from flagging citizens as a danger based on their feelings, phone and movements to their spending activities, social media activities, political views and correspondence. The elite has determined that the existential threat is you. The article Costs of War: Peterloo, written by UK Veterans for Peace member Aly Renwick, details the history of the brutal suppression of protesters by Britain’s rulers. He also strips away any notion that some may have of a benign, present-day ruling elite with democratic leanings. The leopard has not changed its spots. As we saw during COVID, the thinking is that hard-won rights must be curtailed, freedom of association is reckless, free thinking is dangerous, dissent is to be stamped on, impartial science is a threat and free speech is deadly. Government is ‘the truth’, Fauci (or some similar figure) is ‘the science’ and censorship is for your own good. None of this was justified. It only begins to make sense if we regard the COVID restrictions in terms of trying to deal with an economic crisis by closing down the global economy under cover of a public health crisis. The economic crisis is making many people poorer, so they must be controlled, monitored and subjugated. The transitions mentioned at the start of this chapter along with the surveillance agenda (together known as the ‘Great Reset’) are being accelerated at this time of economic crisis when countless millions across the West are being impoverished. The collapsing US-led financial system is resulting in an interrelated global debt, inflation and ‘austerity’ crisis and the biggest transfer of wealth to the rich in history. Integral to this is the ‘food transition’ and the ‘climate emergency’ narrative, an intertwined commentary that has been carefully constructed and promoted (see the work of investigative journalist Cory Morningstar), and net-zero ideology tied to carbon farming and carbon trading. The ‘food transition’ involves locking farmers (at least those farmers who will remain in farming) further into a corporate-controlled agriculture that extracts wealth and serves the market needs of global corporations, carbon trading Ponzi schemes and institutional investors and speculators with no connection to farming who regard agriculture, food commodities and agricultural land as mere financial assets. These farmers will be reduced to corporate profit-extracting agents who bear all of the risks. This predatory commercialisation of the countryside attempts to use flawed premises and climate alarmism to legitimise the roll-out of technologies to supposedly deliver us all from climate breakdown and Malthusian catastrophe. Meanwhile, a wealthy elite increasingly funds science, determines what should be studied, how it should be studied and how the findings are disseminated and how the technology produced is to be used. This elite has the power to shut down genuine debate and to smear and censor others who question the dominant narrative. The prevailing thinking is that the problems humanity face are to be solved through technical innovation determined by plutocrats and consolidated corporate power. This haughty mindset (or outright arrogance) leads to and is symptomatic of an authoritarianism that seeks to impose a range of technologies on humanity with no democratic oversight. This includes self-transmitting vaccines, the genetic engineering of plants and humans, synthetic food, geoengineering and transhumanism. And in India, as we have seen, it involves the imposition of policies in agriculture that, too, also lack any form of democratic oversight or debate. During the farmers’ protest in 2020-21, influential media and commentators wasted no time in attempting to portray farmers as ‘anti-national’ and the ‘enemy within’. What we see is a misguided eco-modernist paradigm that concentrates power and privileges techno-scientific expertise (a form of technocratic exceptionalism). At the same time, historical power relations (often rooted in agriculture and colonialism) and their legacies within and between societies across the world are conveniently ignored and depoliticised. Technology is not the cure-all for the destructive impacts of poverty, inequality, dispossession, imperialism or class exploitation. When it comes to the technologies and policies being rolled out in the agriculture sector, these phenomena will be reinforced and further entrenched — and that includes illness and poor health, which have markedly increased as a result of the modern food we eat and the agrochemicals and practices already used by the corporations pushing for the ‘food transition’. However, that then opens up other money-spinning techno-fix opportunities in the life sciences sector for investors like BlackRock that invest in both agriculture and pharmaceuticals. But in a neoliberal privatised economy that has often facilitated the rise of members of the controlling wealthy elite, it is reasonable to assume that its members possess certain assumptions of how the world works and should continue to work: a world based on deregulation with limited oversight and the hegemony of private capital and a world led by private individuals like Bill Gates who think they know best. Whether through, for instance, the patenting of life forms, carbon trading, entrenching market (corporate) dependency or land investments, their eco-modern policies serve as cover for generating and amassing further wealth and for cementing their control. It should come as little surprise that powerful people who have contempt for democratic principles (and by implication, ordinary people) believe they have some divine right to undermine food security, close down debate, enrich themselves further courtesy of their technologies and policies and gamble with humanity’s future. But the powers that be fear that the masses might once again pick up their pitchforks and revolt. They are adamant that the peasants must know their place. However, the flame of protest and dissent from centuries past still inspires and burns bright. Economist Prof Michael Hudson stated in 2014: “It’s by agriculture and control of the food supply that American diplomacy has been able to control most of the Third World. The World Bank’s geopolitical lending strategy has been to turn countries into food deficit areas by convincing them to grow cash crops — plantation export crops — not to feed themselves with their own food crops.” In 2019, Hudson described how debt, sanctions and the US-controlled international monetary system had backed Venezuelan president Maduro into a corner. Venezuela had become an oil monoculture, with revenue having been spent largely on importing food and other necessities, which it could have produced itself. In this respect, Word Trade Organization (WTO) policies and directives, debt and US-supported geopolitical lending strategies have compelled many countries in the Global South to eradicate food self-sufficiency and undermine their own food security. The control of global agriculture has been a tentacle of US capitalism’s geopolitical strategy. The Green Revolution was exported courtesy of oil-rich interests, and poorer nations adopted Western agri-capital’s chemical- and oil-dependent model of agriculture that required loans for inputs and related infrastructure development. It entailed trapping nations into a globalised system of debt bondage, rigged trade relations and a system vulnerable to oil price shocks (this was touched on in the final chapter of Sickening Profits). In his book The Unsettling of America (1977), Wendell Berry criticises the US Department of Agriculture for adopting a doctrine that treats food as an instrument of foreign political and economic speculation. Berry argues that treating food as a weapon ultimately serves the interests of large agribusiness corporations rather than farmers or consumers. He sees the weaponisation of food as part of a larger problem where agriculture is divorced from its cultural and ecological roots, leading to numerous negative consequences. Berry’s book discusses how modern agriculture has fostered a disconnect between people and the land. He laments that farming has been reduced to a mere business venture rather than a way of life that nurtures community and culture. A business venture and a geopolitical weapon. Something not lost on environmentalist Vandana Shiva who does not hesitate to label agrochemical companies as a poison cartel. She emphasises that this designation stems not only from the harmful effects of its chemicals on the food system but also from the historical connections of corporations like Bayer and BASF to warfare and chemical weapons. These companies have roots in producing toxic substances used during conflicts, including World War I and II, where they manufactured chemical agents such as chlorine gas and Zyklon B, the latter infamously used in Nazi gas chambers. These practices reflect a broader underlining (historical) pattern of exploitation and violence in the food system that undermines both human health and ecological integrity. Major agribusiness companies are deeply embedded in supranational policymaking machinery that allows them to draw up policies to serve their own interests. For instance, Monsanto played a key part in drafting the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights to create seed monopolies, and the global food processing industry (Cargill) had a leading role in shaping the WTO Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures. The powerful agribusiness lobby has secured privileged access to policy makers to ensure its model of agriculture prevails. And those same companies also profit from war and sovereign debt traps to gain access to markets (see, for instance, Sowing the Seeds of Famine in Ethiopia by Michel Chossudovsky). Hit lists, the corruption of science, profiteering and the infiltration of regulatory bodies aside (the list could go on), food cultivation — an endeavour that at its core seeks to nourish and sustain life — has been hijacked and weaponised to coerce, control and suck away life from nature and people. And Bayer talks about ‘backwardness’, as if any of the above is progressive. But few illusions are as pervasive and pernicious as the ideology of ‘progress’ and ‘development’ that hides behind corporate lobbyist soundbites about agribusiness and its money-spinning inputs being needed to prevent mass starvation. This ideology, propped up by the twin pillars of techno-solutionism and technocracy has become the unquestioned truth of the age, a secular religion that promises salvation through the relentless march of technology and the wisdom of experts. Writer Paul Cudenec says that ‘development’: “… is the destruction of nature, now seen as a mere resource to be used for development or as an empty undeveloped space in which development could, should and, ultimately, must take place. It is the destruction of natural human communities, whose self-sufficiency gets in the way of the advance of development, and of authentic human culture and traditional values, which are incompatible with the dogma and domination of development.” Cudenec argues that those behind ‘development’ have been destroying everything of real value in our natural world and our human societies in the pursuit of personal wealth and power. Moreover, they have concealed this crime behind all the positive-sounding rhetoric associated with development on every level. Indeed, the notion that human society is on an inevitable trajectory of improvement, driven by technological innovation and guided by technocratic elites, is perhaps the most insidious myth of our time. This narrative of perpetual progress is a convenient smokescreen, obscuring the stark realities of environmental degradation, social inequality and spiritual impoverishment that characterise so-called advanced civilisation. At the heart of this ideology lies the naive belief in techno-solutionism — the misguided faith that every problem, no matter how complex or deeply rooted in social and political structures, can be solved with the right technological fix. This reductionist worldview reduces the human experience to a series of technical challenges, eagerly awaiting the next groundbreaking innovation to set things right. Agriculture? Just invent more data-gathering apps. Poverty? Develop an app for that. This simplistic approach not only fails to address the root causes of our predicaments but actively distracts us from the necessary work of systemic change and collective action. Hand in hand with techno-solutionism marches technocracy — the idea that society would be best governed by the rich, technical experts and engineers rather than elected representatives or, just imagine, ordinary people! This elitist vision of governance places undue faith in the objectivity and benevolence of a technocratic class, ignoring the fact that these so-called experts are just as susceptible to self-interest as any other group. The technocratic mindset reduces the vibrant reality of human society to a series of data points and algorithms, treating citizens as variables in a grand social engineering experiment. A worldview that values efficiency over empathy, optimisation over justice and control over freedom. In this brave new world, the nuances of culture, the wisdom of tradition and the unpredictability of human nature are seen as inconvenient obstacles to be overcome rather than essential aspects of the human experience. Proponents of this ideology of progress would have us believe that we’re living in the best of all possible worlds — or at least on the path to it with the proliferation of gadgets as irrefutable evidence of our ascent. But this narrative of continuous improvement conveniently ignores the widening wealth gap, corporate corruption, the epidemic of mental health issues, the erosion of community ties and a globalised food system that results in all manner of illness and environmental degradation. The obsession with technological progress and economic growth has come at a tremendous cost. Elite interests have sacrificed the health of the planet, the well-being of countless species and our own connection to the natural world on the altar of ‘development’. They traded meaningful work and genuine human connections for the hollow notion of convenience and efficiency. The quantifiable trumps the qualitative, reducing the human experience to a series of metrics. The ideology of progress serves as a powerful tool for maintaining the status quo. By perpetuating the myth that our current corrupt system is the pinnacle of human achievement, or at least the best we can hope for (there is no alternative!) stifles imagination and is meant to induce apathy and demotivate the masses in striving to bring about meaningful change. And those who dare to question the wisdom of endless growth or propose alternative models of social organisation are censored or dismissed as naive idealists or dangerous radicals. The tech giants and corporations that benefit most from this ideology have become the new high priests of our age, peddling their digital opiates and shiny gadgets as the path to a better future. They promise connection but deliver isolation, offer information but breed confusion and pledge empowerment while tightening the public noose of surveillance. Ordinary people need to reclaim their agency, get off their cell phones and reimagine their relationship with technology, viewing it as a tool to be wielded judiciously rather than a force that shapes our destiny. We need to forge a new path that values human flourishing over ‘growth’, that prioritises ecological harmony over technological domination and that recognises the inherent worth of all beings — not just those deemed productive by the economic system. This means challenging the state-corporate-financial- digital elite, who use their wealth, policies and technologies to wage a class war on ordinary people, while reclaiming the power to shape our societies through collective action. It means reevaluating our definition of progress, moving beyond simplistic metrics of economic growth to consider the true measures of human and ecological well-being. And it means appreciating the complexity of the world, recognising that not every problem has a technological solution and that some of the most valuable aspects of human existence cannot be quantified or optimised. We find ourselves at a critical juncture where the very foundations of our food systems and, indeed, our relationship with the natural world are being systematically dismantled and reconstructed to serve the interests of a unimaginably rich elite. As we stand on the precipice of a brave new world dominated by genetically engineered crops, lab-grown meat and AI-driven farming, it is imperative that we pause and critically examine the path we are being herded down. The time has come to resist and reject the unchecked corporatisation and mechanisation of our food and, indeed, our lives. The Green Revolution, once hailed as the saviour of the ‘developing world’, has instead trapped millions of farmers in cycles of debt and dependency, while reducing the nutritional value of food and decimating biodiversity. Now, we are told that the solution to current problems lies in even more technology — gene editing, precision agriculture and artificial intelligence. But this is merely doubling down on a failed paradigm. These ‘solutions’ are not designed to address the root causes of our food crisis, but rather to further consolidate control over the food system in the hands of a few powerful corporations. Consider the push for genetically modified organisms and the new wave of gene-edited crops. Proponents claim these technologies will increase yields and reduce pesticide use. Yet, decades of cultivation of genetically modified organisms have shown us that these promises are hollow. Instead, we have seen the rise of superweeds, increased pesticide use and the erosion of seed sovereignty as farmers become beholden to patent-holding corporations. Similarly, the drive towards ‘smart’ farming and precision agriculture is often presented as a path to sustainability. In reality, it’s a trojan horse for increased corporate control and farmer disempowerment. As farms become more reliant on proprietary software, expensive machinery and data-driven decision making, traditional farming knowledge is devalued, and farmers are reduced to mere operators in a system they no longer fully understand or control. The solution lies in a return to human-scale agriculture, rooted in agroecological principles. This is not a romanticised view of the past but a forward-thinking approach that recognises the wisdom embedded in traditional farming practices while selectively incorporating appropriate technologies. Agroecology works with nature rather than against it, fostering biodiversity, building soil health and creating resilient food systems. The push for lab-grown meat and ultra-processed, plant-based alternatives is not about sustainability or animal welfare but about wresting control of protein production from farmers and placing it in the hands of tech companies and their investors. These products, often marketed as eco-friendly solutions, are in reality energy-intensive, highly processed foods that further disconnect us from the natural world and our food sources. In the face of this techno-industrial onslaught, we must advocate for food sovereignty — the right of peoples to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through ecologically sound and sustainable methods and their right to define their own food and agriculture systems. This means resisting the corporatisation of our food supply, supporting local food systems and preserving the diversity of crops and culinary traditions that have nourished humanity for millennia. In attempting to shape the future, we can indeed look to the past for inspiration and reclaim part of history by drawing from the radical vision and actions of ‘the Diggers’ movement (1649-1651). In the annals of agrarian history, one particular movement has left a profound impact on the collective imagination of food sovereignty advocates. The Diggers in 17th century England were led by the visionary Gerrard Winstanley. This radical group emerged during a period of intense social and political upheaval, offering a revolutionary perspective on land ownership and food production that continues to resonate with modern struggles for food justice. The Diggers, also known as the True Levellers, arose in 1649, a time when England was reeling from the aftermath of civil war. Winstanley and his followers dared to imagine a different world. The group challenged the very foundations of the emerging capitalist system and the enclosure movement that was rapidly privatising previously common lands. But Winstanley’s vision was not merely theoretical. On 1 April 1649, the Diggers began their most famous action, occupying St. George’s Hill in Surrey, where they established a commune, cultivating the land collectively and distributing food freely to all who needed it. This act of direct action was a powerful demonstration of their philosophy in practice. As Winstanley declared: “The earth was made to be a common treasury for all, not a private treasury for some.” The Diggers, true to their name, began their movement by literally digging up unused common lands and planting crops. According to Professor Justin Champion, they planted “peas and carrots and pulses” and let their cows graze on the fields. While the Diggers saw their actions as relatively harmless (Champion compares it to having an allotment), local property owners viewed it as a serious threat, likening it to “village terrorism”, according to Champion. The local landowners called in troops to suppress these actions. Despite their relatively small numbers and short-lived experiments, which spread across parts of England, Champion suggests that the Diggers posed a significant ideological threat to the existing social order, challenging notions of private property and social hierarchy. Winstanley declared: “Those that Buy and Sell Land, and are landlords, have got it either by Oppression, or Murther, or Theft”. He added: “The Work we are going about is this, To dig up Georges-Hill and the waste Ground thereabouts, and to Sow Corn, and to eat our bread together by the sweat of our brows. And the First Reason is this, That we may work in righteousness, and lay the Foundation of making the Earth a Common Treasury for All, both Rich and Poor, That every one that is born in the land, may be fed by the Earth his Mother that brought him forth, according to the Reason that rules in the Creation.” The backlash from local landlords was systematic. The Diggers faced beatings and arson, forcing them to move from St George’s Hill to a second site in Cobham, until they were finally driven off the land entirely. Writing in 1972 in his book The World Turned Upside Down, Christopher Hill, a prominent historian of the English Civil War period, suggested that the Diggers’ influence was more widespread than just their most famous colony at St. George’s Hill. He argued that from Nottinghamshire and Northamptonshire to Gloucestershire and Kent, Digger influence spread all over southern and central England. While the actual number of people involved in Digger experiments was relatively small (estimated at 100-200 people across England), their ideas spread more widely through pamphlets and word of mouth. This widespread influence, as described by Hill, suggests that the Diggers’ ideas resonated with people across a significant portion of England, even if actual Digger colonies were few in number. The Diggers were a radical, biblically inspired movement that practically implemented their beliefs about common ownership of land, provoking strong opposition from the established landowners despite their generally peaceful methods. The St. George’s Hill experiment represented a radical alternative to the prevailing economic and social order. It was an early example of what we might today call a food sovereignty project, emphasising local control over food production and distribution. In today’s era of industrial agriculture and corporate food systems, the Diggers’ ideas remain highly significant. Their resistance to the enclosure of common lands in the 17th century mirrors today’s struggles against corporate land grabs — and the colonising actions that underpin the likes of Bayer’s corporate jargon about the unlocking of ‘business growth’, ‘driving change management’, ‘driving market share’ and ‘creating business value’ — as well as the privatisation of seeds and genetic resources. The consolidation of the global agri-food chain in the hands of a few powerful corporations represents a modern form of enclosure, concentrating control over food production and distribution in ways that would have been all too familiar to Winstanley and his followers. The Diggers’ emphasis on local, community-controlled food production offers a stark alternative to the industrial agriculture model promoted by agribusiness giants and their allies in institutions like the World Bank and the WTO Where the dominant paradigm prioritises large-scale monocultures, global supply chains and market-driven food security, the Diggers’ vision aligns more closely with concepts of food sovereignty and agroecology. Food sovereignty, a concept developed by the international peasant movement La Via Campesina, shares much with the Diggers’ philosophy. Both emphasise the right of communities to define their own food and agriculture systems. The Diggers’ legacy can be seen in various contemporary movements challenging the corporate food regime. From La Via Campesina’s global struggle for peasant rights to local community garden initiatives and the work of the Agrarian Trust in the US (which provides good insight into the Diggers and their continued relevance in The Diggers Today: Enclosure, Manure and Resistance), we see echoes of the Diggers’ vision. Modern projects to create community-owned farms, seed banks and food cooperatives can be seen as spiritual descendants of the Diggers’ movement, aiming to reclaim food production from corporate control and put it back in the hands of communities. However, realising the Diggers’ vision in the current context faces significant obstacles. The influence of agribusiness conglomerates over key institutions and policymaking bodies presents a formidable challenge. From the World Bank to national agriculture ministries, as this book has made clear, corporate interests often shape policies that prioritise industrial agriculture and global markets over local food systems. International trade agreements and MoUs, often negotiated with minimal public scrutiny, frequently benefit large agribusiness at the expense of small farmers and local food sovereignty. Moreover, proponents of industrial agriculture often argue that it is the only way to feed the world. This narrative, however, ignores the environmental and social costs of this model, as well as the proven productivity of small-scale, agroecological farming methods. The Diggers didn’t just theorise about an alternative society; they attempted to build it by taking direct action, occupying land and implementing their vision of communal agriculture. The Diggers also understood that changing the food system required challenging broader power structures. Today’s food sovereignty movements similarly recognise the need for systemic change, addressing issues of land rights, trade policies and economic justice alongside agricultural practices. In this era of corporate-dominated agriculture, the Diggers’ vision of a “common treasury for all” remains as radical and necessary as ever. By reclaiming the commons, promoting agroecological practices and building food sovereignty, ordinary people can work towards a world where food is truly a common treasury for all. The Diggers recognised that true freedom and equality could not be achieved without addressing the fundamental question of who controls the land and the means of production. This understanding is crucial in the current context, where corporate control over the food system extends from land, seeds and inputs to distribution and retail. The Diggers’ vision also challenges us to rethink our relationship with the land and with each other. In a world increasingly dominated by individualism and market relations, the emphasis on communal ownership and collective labour offers a radical alternative. The Diggers’ legacy challenges us to think beyond the confines of the prevailing food regime, to envision and create a world where food and land are not commodities to be bought and sold but common resources to be shared and stewarded for the benefit of all. Their vision of a world where “the earth becomes a common treasury again” is not a quaint historical curiosity, but a vital and necessary alternative to the destructive practices of those who dominate the current food system. It is noteworthy that the annual Wigan Diggers Festival celebrates the life and ideas of Wigan born and bred Gerrard Winstanley and the Diggers’ Movement (see Wigan Diggers’ Festival). But let us finish with Leon Rosselson’s song lyrics from his 1975 song in reference to the Diggers’ movement (Billy Bragg’s version can be found here on YouTube).

Spices have been a cornerstone of South Indian commerce for centuries, and Chennai, with its strategic port location, has long been a key player in this trade. The prominence of chilli highlights its significance in South Indian cuisine and culture. While modern supermarkets and online platforms are changing consumer habits, wholesale markets like those in George Town continue to serve an essential function in the supply chain. Colin Todhunter is an independent researcher and writer and has spent many years in India. He is a research associate of the Centre for Research on Globalisation (Montreal) and writes on food, agriculture and development issues. In 2018, in recognition of his writing, he was named a Living Peace and Justice Leader and Model by Engaging Peace Inc. 𝐂𝐨𝐥𝐢𝐧 𝐓𝐨𝐝𝐡𝐮𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫 – Academia.edu Aruna Rodrigues, lead petitioner in the GMO mustard Public Interest Litigation in the Supreme Court of India, stated the following about the author’s 2022 e-book Food, Dispossession and Dependency. Resisting the New World Order: “Colin Todhunter at his best: this is graphic, a detailed horror tale in the making for India, an exposé on what is planned, via the farm laws, to hand over Indian sovereignty and food security to big business. There will come a time pretty soon — (not something out there but imminent, unfolding even now), when we will pay the Cargills, Ambanis, Bill Gates, Walmarts — in the absence of national buffer food stocks (an agri policy change to cash crops, the end to small-scale farmers, pushed aside by contract farming and GM crops) — we will pay them to send us food and finance borrowing from international markets to do it.” Frederic Mousseau, Policy Director at the Oakland Institute, says the following about the author’s work: “It takes a book to break down the dynamics that are pushing agro-chemical agriculture to farmers and consumers around the world and to reveal the strength of the diverse movement of people and organizations who stand in the way of these destructive and predatory forces. “Colin Todhunter takes readers on a world tour that makes a compelling case against the fallacy of the food scarcity and Green Revolution arguments advanced by the mainstream media and international institutions on behalf of powerful financial interests such as Blackrock, Vanguard, or Gates. Todhunter makes it obvious that a key factor of world hunger and of the environmental crisis we are facing is a capitalist system that ‘requires constant growth, expanding markets and sufficient demand.’ “Uplifting rather than depressing, after this lucid diagnosis, he highlights some of the countless people-led initiatives and movements, from Cuba, Ethiopia to India, that fight back against destruction and predation with agroecology and farmers-led practices, respectful of the people and the planet. By debunking the “artificial scarcity” myth that is constantly fed to us, Todhunter demonstrates that it is actually not complicated to change course. Readers will just have to join the movement.” This ebook provides insight into aspects of the global food system, including the micronutrient crisis, contested climate emergency rhetoric and its use in implementing the rollout of controlling technologies, the emergence and influence of digital platforms in shaping agricultural practices and the increasing corporate capture of Indian agriculture. The book is the third installment in a trilogy of ebooks by the author exploring the global food system. It evolved from a series of articles originally published by various media outlets and written by the author and follows the February 2022 publication of Food, Dependency and Dispossession: Resisting the New World Order and the December 2023 release of Sickening Profits: The Global Food System’s Poisoned Food and Toxic Wealth. When read together, the three books provide an overarching critique of contemporary food systems and possible solutions. For instance, the first book presents a more in-depth discussion of agroecology, the role of the Gates Foundation, the impact of pesticides, the state of agriculture in India, including the 2020-21 farmers protest, and the issue of development. The second book touches on some of those issues but broadens the debate to look at ecomodernism, food-related ill health, the role of big finance in the food system and the post-Covid food crisis. While readers do not have to read the first two books, it might help in providing added context and insights. This new book draws on and develops many of the themes presented in the first two. In particular, it returns to India to explore what has happened over the last 22 months (since the publication of the first book). More generally, it looks at the intertwining of political centralisation and corporate consolidation that is undermining democratic processes, economic diversity and local autonomy. This unholy alliance is creating a self-reinforcing, technocratic dystopia that concentrates power in the hands of a super-wealthy elite, which increasingly depicts anyone who challenges it as the ‘enemy within’. In this respect, the book weds the topic of food to the wider dynamics of power in society, which is becoming increasingly concentrated, resulting in the domination of both resources and populations and seeking to shape the very fabric of our lives and beliefs about who we are and what we could or should be. Such an analysis is integral to gaining a deeper understanding of the food system and the influence of global agribusiness and the tech giants that are increasingly moving into the food and agriculture sector. The following discussion is driven by a conviction in the transformative power of re-localising food systems, revitalising traditional ecological wisdom and rekindling our connection to the land that nourishes us. At its core, it challenges us to question our understanding of human progress and development. By focusing on the nature of power and certain challenges and issues that we face, this introductory chapter establishes a foundational framework for what appears in the subsequent chapters. We live in a world that sees political power becoming increasingly centralised. In turn, this creates an environment ripe for corporate influence. Large corporations, with their vast resources, can more easily focus their lobbying efforts and capture policymaking bodies at national and international levels than at a more fragmented local or regional level, leading to regulations and laws that favour big business over small enterprises and the needs and rights of ordinary people. This results in a landscape dominated by a handful of corporate giants, each wielding enormous economic and political clout. This consolidation of corporate power further reinforces political centralisation, as wealthy corporations (for example, think big pharma and big agribusiness) can effectively dictate policy through campaign contributions, lobbying efforts and the revolving door between government and industry. The voice of the average citizen is drowned out by the influence of corporate power. As a result of this corporate monopolisation, local markets and small businesses, once the backbone of communities, are being systematically crushed under the weight of centralised state-corporate power. Unable to compete with the economies of scale and political influence of large corporations, they are forced to close their doors or sell out to larger entities. This not only reduces choice and drives up prices but also strips communities of their unique character and economic self-determination. The global interests served by this system are at odds with local needs and values. Decisions made in distant boardrooms and government offices fail to account for the nuanced realities of diverse communities. Environmental concerns are brushed aside in favour of short-term profits, while cultural traditions are homogenised to fit corporate needs. Democratic processes, designed to give voice to the many, are subverted to serve the interests of the few. Real power resides in the hands of those who control the purse strings, and public discourse is shaped by the corporate media (often part of larger conglomerates), limiting the range of ideas and stifling dissent. At the same time, when decision-making is concentrated in a few hands, the potential for catastrophic errors increases. Over-centralised, corporate-dominated supply chains are vulnerable to disruptions, leading to shortages of essential goods that can ripple across the globe. The consolidation of corporate power in key sectors like agriculture creates dangerous monopolies that can manipulate markets, exploit farmers and ignore environmental safeguards with impunity. The struggle against the intertwining of political centralisation and corporate consolidation is a battle for a future where power is distributed equitably, where local voices matter and where the interests of communities and the environment take precedence over corporate profits. The stakes could not be higher. If we fail to check the runaway consolidation of political and corporate power, we risk sliding into a form of corporate feudalism or techno-feudalism, where the vast majority of people are reduced to serfs in service of a powerful elite. More specifically, the consolidation of corporate power in food and agriculture has far-reaching and deeply concerning implications for farmers, ordinary people and the environment. This concentration of control in the hands of a few transnational corporations has created a system that prioritises profit over ecological sustainability, health and food sovereignty. For farmers, the consequences are dire. The consolidation of the agriculture industry has led to a dramatic reduction in the number of small farms. The shift towards large-scale industrial farming has not only pushed many small farmers out of business but also trapped those who remain in a cycle of dependency on a handful of corporations for seeds, chemicals and market access. This loss of autonomy leaves farmers vulnerable to exploitative practices and reduces their ability to make decisions based on local needs and conditions. The impact on the wider population is equally troubling. While the illusion of choice persists in grocery stores, the reality is that a small number of corporations control the majority of food products. This concentration of power allows these companies to manipulate prices via aggressive discounting to destroy competition or to engage in profiteering through unnecessary price increases. Moreover, the focus on highly profitable, low-cost-ingredient processed foods high in fats, sugars and salt has contributed to a global health crisis, with rising rates of obesity and diet-related chronic diseases. Environmentally, the consequences of this corporate-controlled system are catastrophic. The industrial agricultural model promoted by these large corporations relies heavily on chemical inputs, monoculture farming and practices that degrade soil health, waterways and biodiversity. The centralisation of food production and distribution has also created a dangerously fragile system. As the COVID event demonstrated, disruptions in this highly consolidated supply chain can quickly lead to food shortages and price spikes. This lack of resilience poses a serious threat to global food security, particularly in times of crisis. Perhaps most alarmingly, this consolidated system is eroding food sovereignty — the right of peoples to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through ecologically sound and sustainable methods and their right to define their own food and agriculture systems. As global corporations increasingly control what is grown and how it is distributed, local communities lose the ability to make decisions about their food systems. The adverse implications of corporate consolidation in our food and agriculture system are profound and far-reaching. They threaten not only our current food security and public health but also the long-term sustainability of the planet’s food production capacity. Addressing this issue is not just about changing our food system; it’s about reclaiming democratic rights and ensuring a just and sustainable future for all. In India, as will be shown, the trends outlined above have concerning implications. These trends, driven by neoliberal policies and the growing influence of transnational corporations, are reshaping the landscape of Indian agriculture in ways that threaten traditional farming practices, food security and rural livelihoods. One of the most significant impacts is on small and marginal farmers, who make up about 85 per cent of India’s farming community (the importance of small farms will be discussed later). As corporate entities gain more control over various stages of the agricultural chain, these farmers face increasing pressure and vulnerability. They often find themselves at a disadvantage when negotiating prices or accessing markets, leading to reduced incomes and increased debt. The consolidation of power in the hands of a few large corporations also poses a threat to India’s food sovereignty. As these companies gain control over seeds, inputs and distribution channels, we could see a further reduction in crop diversity and a shift towards monoculture (contract) farming. This may also exacerbate the overuse of money-spinning proprietary chemical inputs, the degradation of soil and human health and the depletion of water resources, which are already major concerns in the country. The environmental costs of this approach are significant and could have long-lasting impacts on India’s agricultural productivity and food security. Furthermore, the corporatisation of agriculture threatens to erode traditional farming knowledge and practices that have been developed over generations. These practices, often more suited to local ecological conditions and more sustainable in the long term, risk being lost as standardised, corporate-driven farming ends up commodifying knowledge and practices (this will become clear later). The impact on rural communities extends beyond just the economic sphere. As the corporatisation of agriculture takes hold, there’s a risk of further rural-urban migration, as small farmers are pushed off their land. This can lead to the breakdown of rural social structures and exacerbate urban poverty and unemployment. The influence of corporate interests on agricultural research and policy is also a matter of concern. When private sector funding becomes more dominant in agricultural research, there is a risk that research priorities become skewed towards corporate interests rather than the needs of small farmers or ecological sustainability. Across the globe, an insidious corporatisation is reshaping agriculture. The consequences of this shift are far-reaching and deeply troubling, touching every aspect of the food system and, by extension, the very fabric of our societies. These corporations tell us that such a process goes hand in hand with the modernisation of the sector. The narrative of the need to ‘modernise agriculture’ pushed by corporations like Bayer, Corteva and Syngenta is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to secure control of the agricultural sector and ensure corporate dependency. Their vision of ‘development’ entails decision-making centralised in the hands of government and corporate entities, systematically weakening traditional local governance structures, and pushing top-down policies that favour large-scale industrial farming at the expense of small-scale, diversified agriculture. Ultimately, the struggle against corporate consolidation in agriculture is not just about changing our food system. It’s about recognising that food is not just a commodity but a fundamental human right and a cornerstone of our cultures and communities. There is a battle for the soul of our food system, for the future of our rural communities, for the health of our ecosystems and for the very nature of our societies. It’s a fight we cannot afford to lose. We must stand united to reclaim our food sovereignty and build a food system that nourishes not just our bodies but our communities. A fundamental restructuring of our food and agriculture systems is required. This should include antitrust enforcement to break up corporate monopolies, policies that support small and medium-sized farms and investment in research for agroecological farming methods. We must also work to shorten supply chains, promoting local food systems and territorial markets that are more resilient and responsive to community needs. The path ahead is challenging, but the alternative of a world where our food system is controlled by a handful of corporations, where biodiversity is decimated, where farmers are reduced to serfs on their own land and where our health is sacrificed for corporate profits is simply unacceptable. The world is experiencing a micronutrient food and health crisis. Micronutrient deficiency now affects billions of people. Micronutrients are key vitamins and minerals and deficiencies can cause severe health conditions. They are important for various functions, including blood clotting, brain development, the immune system, energy production and bone health, and play a critical role in disease prevention. The root of the crisis is due to an increased reliance on ultra processed foods (‘junk food’) and the way that modern food crops are grown in terms of the seeds used, the plants produced, the synthetic inputs required (fertilisers, pesticides etc.) and the effects on soil. In 2007, nutritional therapist David Thomas noted a precipitous change in the USA towards convenience and pre-prepared foods often devoid of vital micronutrients yet packed with a cocktail of chemical additives, including colourings, flavourings and preservatives. He noted that between 1940 and 2002 the character, growing methods, preparation, source and ultimate presentation of basic staples had changed significantly to the extent that trace elements and micronutrient contents have been severely depleted. Thomas added that ongoing research clearly demonstrates a significant relationship between deficiencies in micronutrients and physical and mental ill health. Prior to the Green Revolution, many of the older crops that were displaced carried dramatically higher counts of nutrients per calorie. For instance, the iron content of millet is four times that of rice, and oats carry four times more zinc than wheat. As a result, between 1961 and 2011, the protein, zinc and iron contents of the world’s directly consumed cereals declined by 4 per cent, 5 per cent and 19 per cent, respectively. The authors of a 2010 paper in the International Journal of Environmental and Rural Development state that cropping systems promoted by the Green Revolution have resulted in reduced food-crop diversity and decreased availability of micronutrients. They note that micronutrient malnutrition is causing increased rates of cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes and osteoporosis in many lower income nations. They add that soils are increasingly affected by micronutrient disorders. In 2016, India’s Central Soil Water Conservation Research and Training Institute reported that the country was losing 5,334 million tonnes of soil every year due to soil erosion because of indiscreet and excessive use of fertilisers, insecticides and pesticides over the years. On average, 16.4 tonnes of fertile soil is lost every year per hectare. It concluded that the non-judicious use of synthetic fertilisers had led to the deterioration of soil fertility causing loss of micro and macronutrients leading to poor soils and low yields. The high-input, chemical-intensive Green Revolution with its hybrid seeds and synthetic fertilisers and pesticides helped the drive towards greater monocropping and has resulted in less diverse diets and less nutritious foods. Its long-term impact has led to soil degradation and mineral imbalances, which, in turn, have adversely affected human health. But micronutrient depletion is not just due to a displacement of nutrient-dense staples in the diet or unhealthy soils. Take wheat, for example. Rothamsted Research in the UK has evaluated the mineral concentration of archived wheat grain and soil samples from the Broadbalk Wheat Experiment. The experiment began in 1843, and the findings show significant decreasing trends in the concentrations of zinc, copper, iron and magnesium in wheat grain since the 1960s. The researchers say that the concentrations of these four minerals remained stable between 1845 and the mid 1960s but have since decreased significantly by 20-30 per cent. This coincided with the introduction of Green Revolution semi-dwarf, high-yielding cultivars. They noted that the concentrations in soil used in the experiment have either increased or remained stable. So, in this case, soil is not the issue. A 2021 paper that appeared in the journal of Environmental and Experimental Botany reported that the large increase in the proportion of the global population suffering from zinc and iron deficiency over the last four decades has occurred since the Green Revolution and the introduction of its cultivars. Reflecting the findings of Rothamsted Research in the UK, a recent study led by Indian Council of Agricultural Research scientists found the grains eaten in India have lost food value. They conclude that many of today’s crops fail to absorb sufficient nutrients even when soil is healthy. The January 2024 article Indians consuming rice and wheat low in food value, high in toxins on the Down to Earth website reported on a study that found that rice and wheat, which meet over 50 per cent of the daily energy requirements of people in India, have lost up to 45 per cent of their food value in the past 50 years or so. The concentration of essential nutrients like zinc and iron has decreased by 33 per cent and 27 per cent in rice and by 30 per cent and 19 per cent in wheat, respectively. At the same time, the concentration of arsenic, a toxic element, in rice has increased by 1,493 per cent. Down to Earth also cites research by the Indian Council of Medical Research that indicates a 25 per cent rise in non-communicable diseases among the Indian population from 1990 to 2016. India is home to one-third of the two billion global population suffering from micronutrient deficiency. This is partly because modern-bred cultivars of rice and wheat are less efficient in sequestering zinc and iron, regardless of their abundance in soils. Plants have lost their capacity to take up nutrients from the soil. Increasing prevalence of diabetes, childhood leukaemia, childhood obesity, cardiovascular disorders, infertility, osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis, mental illnesses and so on have all been shown to have some direct relationship to diet and specifically micronutrient deficiency. The large increase in the proportion of the global population suffering from zinc and iron deficiency over the last four decades has coincided with the global expansion of high-yielding, input-responsive cereal cultivars released in the post-Green Revolution era. Agriculture and policy analyst Devinder Sharma says that high yield is inversely proportionate to plant nutrition: the drop in nutrition levels is so much that the high-yielding new wheat varieties have seen a steep fall in copper content, an essential trace mineral, by as much as 80 per cent, and some nutritionists ascribe this to a rise in cholesterol-related incidences across the world. India is self-sufficient in various staples, but many of these foodstuffs are high calorie-low nutrient and have led to the displacement of more nutritionally diverse cropping systems and more nutrient-dense crops. The importance of agronomist William Albrecht should not be overlooked here and his work on healthy soils and healthy people. In his experiments, he found that cows fed on less nutrient-dense crops ate more while cows that ate nutrient-rich grass stopped eating once their nutritional intake was satisfied. This may be one reason why we see rising rates of obesity at a time of micronutrient food insecurity. It is interesting that, given the above discussion on the Green Revolution’s adverse impacts on nutrition, the paper New Histories of the Green Revolution (2019) by Prof. Glenn Stone debunks the claim that the Green Revolution boosted productivity: it merely put more (nutrient-deficient) wheat into the Indian diet at the expense of other food crops. Stone argues that food productivity per capita showed no increase or even actually decreased. . . With this in mind, the table below makes for interesting reading. The data is provided by the National Productivity Council India (an autonomous body of the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, Ministry of Commerce and Industry). As mentioned earlier with reference to Albrecht, obesity has become a concern worldwide, including in India. This problem is multi-dimensional and, as alluded to, excess calorific intake and nutrient-poor food is a factor, leading to the consumption of sugary, fat-laden ultra processed food in an attempt to fill the nutritional gap. But there is also considerable evidence linking human exposure to agrochemicals with obesity. The September 2020 paper Agrochemicals and Obesity in the journal Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology summarises human epidemiological evidence and experimental animal studies supporting the association between agrochemical exposure and obesity and outlines possible mechanistic underpinnings for this link. Numerous other studies have also noted that exposure to pesticides has been associated with obesity and diabetes. For example, a 2022 paper in the journal Endocrine reports that first contact with environmental pesticides occurs during critical phases of life, such as gestation and lactation, which can lead to damage in central and peripheral tissues, subsequently programming disorders early and later in life. A 2013 paper in the journal Entropy on pathways to modern diseases reported that glyphosate (the active ingredient in Bayer-Monsanto’s Roundup), the most popular herbicide used worldwide, enhances the damaging effects of other food borne chemical residues and environmental toxins. The negative impact is insidious and manifests slowly over time as inflammation damages cellular systems throughout the body, resulting in conditions associated with a Western diet, which include gastrointestinal disorders, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, depression, autism, infertility, cancer and Alzheimer’s disease. Despite these findings, campaigner Rosemary Mason has drawn attention to how official government and industry narratives try to divert attention from the role of glyphosate in obesity (and other conditions) by urging the public to exercise and cut down on “biscuits”. In a January 2024 article, Kit Knightly, on the OffGuardian website, notes how big pharma is attempting to individualise obesity and make millions by pushing its ‘medical cures’ and drugs for the condition. To deal with micronutrient deficiencies, other money-spinning initiatives for industry are being pushed, not least biofortification of foodstuffs and plants and genetic engineering. Industry narratives have nothing to say about the food system itself in terms of food being regarded as just another commodity to be rinsed for profit regardless of the impacts on human health or the environment. We simply witness more techno-fix ‘solutions’ being rolled out to supposedly address the impacts of previous ‘innovations’ and policy decisions that benefitted the bottom line of Western agribusiness (and big pharma, which profits from the rising rates of disease and conditions). Quick techno-fixes do not offer genuine solutions to the problems outlined above. Such solutions involve challenging corporate power that shapes narratives and policies to suit its agenda. Healthy food, healthy people and healthy societies are not created at some ever-sprawling life sciences park that specialises in manipulating food and the human body (for corporate gain) under the banner of ‘innovation’ and ‘health’ while leaving intact the power relations that underpin bad food and ill health. A radical overhaul of the food system is required, from how food is grown to how society should be organised. This involves creating food sovereignty, encouraging localism, local markets and short supply chains, rejecting neoliberal globalisation, supporting smallholder agriculture and land reform while incentivising agroecological practices that build soil fertility, use and develop high-productive landraces and a focus on nutrition per acre rather than increased grain size, ‘yield’ and ‘output’. That’s how you create healthy food, healthy people and healthy societies. The relationship between financial investment and the commodification of farmland is increasingly significant for understanding the dynamics of modern agriculture and its implications for food systems. Financial institutions, including pension funds and investment firms, have turned farmland into a lucrative asset class, helping to fuel a paradigm shift in agricultural practices. This financialisation of farmland not only affects the economic landscape, opening up fresh investment opportunities, but also perpetuates an industrial agricultural model that prioritises profit over sustainability, sound agricultural practices and public health. The commodification of farmland involves transforming land into a tradable commodity, which is driven by the interests of big financial entities seeking high returns on their investments. This financial pressure leads to the aggregation of land into larger, industrial-scale farms owned by corporations or investment funds, which tend to employ input-intensive farming practices that degrade soil health and reduce biodiversity. The influx of capital into farmland has further fuelled an industrial agricultural model characterised by monocultures, heavy reliance on chemical inputs and a focus on maximising yields at the expense of human health, ecological balance and a systems approach (more on this later). The shift towards large-scale intensive farming operations has also diminished the role of smallholder farmers, who have traditionally played a major role in local food security and rural economies, thereby undermining community resilience and exacerbating food insecurity. Between 2008 and 2022, land prices nearly doubled throughout the world and tripled in Central-Eastern Europe. In the UK, an influx of investment from pension funds and private wealth contributed to a doubling of farmland prices from 2010-2015. Land prices in the US agricultural heartlands of Iowa quadrupled between 2002 and 2020. . A wheat field in Essex (Licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0) . Agricultural investment funds rose ten-fold between 2005 and 2018 and now regularly include farmland as a stand-alone asset class, with US investors having doubled their stakes in farmland since 2020. Meanwhile, agricultural commodity traders are speculating on farmland through their own private equity subsidiaries, while new financial derivatives are allowing speculators to accrue land parcels and lease them back to struggling farmers, driving steep and sustained land price inflation. Moreover, top-down ‘green grabs’ now account for 20 per cent of large-scale land deals. Government pledges for land-based carbon removals alone add up to almost 1.2 billion hectares, equivalent to total global cropland. Carbon offset markets are expected to quadruple in the next seven years. These are some of the findings published in the report ‘Land Squeeze’ (May 2024) by the International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food Systems (IPES), a non-profit thinktank headquartered in Brussels. The report says that agricultural land is increasingly being turned into a financial asset at the expense of small- and medium-scale farming, leading to land price inflation. Furthermore, the COVID-19 event and the conflict in Ukraine helped promote the ‘feed the world’ panic narrative, prompting agribusiness and investors to secure land for export commodity production and urging governments to deregulate land markets and adopt pro-investor policies. However, despite sky-rocketing food prices, there was, according to the IPES in 2022, sufficient food and no risk of global food supply shortages. The increased food prices were due to speculation on food commodities, corporate profiteering and a heavy reliance on food imports. But the self-serving narrative pushed by big agribusiness and land investors prevailed. At the same time, carbon and biodiversity offset markets are facilitating massive land transactions, bringing major polluters into land markets. The IPES notes that Shell has set aside more than $450 million for carbon offsetting projects. Land is also being appropriated for biofuels and green energy production, including water-intensive ‘green hydrogen’ projects that pose risks to local food cultivation. In addition, much-needed agricultural land is being repurposed for extractive industries and mega-developments. For example, urbanisation and mega-infrastructure developments in Asia and Africa are claiming prime farmland. According to the IPES, between 2000 and 2030, up to 3.3 million hectares of the world’s farmland will have been swallowed up by expanding megacities. Some 80 per cent of land loss to urbanisation is occurring in Asia and Africa. In India, 1.5 million hectares are estimated to have been lost to urban growth between 1955 and1985, a further 800,000 hectares lost between 1985 and 2000, with steady ongoing losses to this day. In a December 2016 paper on urban land expansion, it was projected that by 2030, globally, urban areas will have tripled in size, expanding into cropland. Around 60 per cent of the world’s cropland lies on the outskirts of cities, and this land is, on average, twice as productive as land elsewhere on the globe. This means that, as cities expand, millions of small-scale farmers are being displaced. These farmers produce the majority of food in lower income countries and are key to global food security. In their place, as their land is concreted over, we are seeing the aggregation of remaining agricultural land into large-scale farms, land buy ups and further land investments and the spread of industrial agriculture and all it brings, including poor food and diets, illness, environmental devastation and the destruction of rural communities. Investment funds have no real interest in farming or ensuring food security. They tend to invest for between only 10 and 15 years and can leave a trail of long-term environmental and social devastation and serve to undermine local and regional food security. Short- to medium-term returns on investments trump any notions of healthy food or human need. The IPES notes that, globally, just 1 per cent of the world’s largest farms now control 70 per cent of the world’s farmland. These tend to be input-intensive, industrial-scale farms that are straining resources, rapidly degrading farmland and further squeezing out smallholders. Additionally, agribusiness giants are pursuing monopolistic practices that drive up costs for farmers. These dynamics are creating systematic economic precarity for farmers, effectively forcing them to ‘get big or get out’. Factor in land degradation, much of which is attributable to modern chemical-intensive farming practices, and we have a recipe for global food insecurity. In India, more than 70 per cent of its arable land is affected by one or more forms of land degradation. Also consider that the Indian government has sanctioned 50 solar parks, covering one million hectares in seven states. More than 74 per cent of solar is on land of agricultural (67 per cent) or natural ecosystem value (7 per cent), causing potential food security and biodiversity conflicts. The IPES report notes that since 2017 there have been more than 15 instances of conflict in India linked with these projects. What is the impact of all this on farming and what might the future hold? Nettie Wiebe, from the IPES, explains: “Imagine trying to start a farm when 70 per cent of farmland is already controlled by just 1 per cent of the largest farms — and when land prices have risen for 20 years in a row, like in North America. That’s the stark reality young farmers face today. Farmland is increasingly owned not by farmers but by speculators, pension funds and big agribusinesses looking to cash in. Land prices have skyrocketed so high it’s becoming impossible to make a living from farming. This is reaching a tipping point — small and medium scale farming is simply being squeezed out.” Susan Chomba, also from the IPES, says that soaring land prices and land grabs are driving an unprecedented ‘land squeeze’, accelerating inequality and threatening food production. Moreover, the rush for dubious carbon projects, tree planting schemes, clean fuels and speculative buying is displacing not only small-scale farmers but also indigenous peoples. Huge swathes of farmland are being acquired by governments and corporations for these ‘green grabs’, despite little evidence of climate benefits. This issue is particularly affecting Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa. The IPES notes that some 25 million hectares of land have been snapped up for carbon projects by a single ‘environmental asset creation’ firm, UAE-based ‘Blue Carbon’, through agreements with the governments of Kenya, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Zambia and Liberia. According to the IPES, the ‘land squeeze’ is leading to farmer revolts, rural exodus, rural poverty and food insecurity. With global farmland prices having doubled in 15 years, farmers, peasants, and indigenous peoples are losing their land (or forced to downsize), while young farmers face significant barriers in accessing land to farm. The IPES calls for action to halt green grabs and remove speculative investment from land markets and establish integrated governance for land, environment and food systems to ensure a just transition. It also calls for support for collective ownership of farms and innovative financing for farmers to access land and wants a new deal for farmers and rural areas, and that includes a new generation of land and agrarian reforms. Capital accumulation based on the financialisation of farmland accelerated after the 2008 financial crisis. However, financialisation of the economy in general goes back to the 1970s and 1980s when we witnessed a deceleration of economic growth based on industrial production. The response was to compensate via financial capitalism and financial intermediation. Professor John Bellamy Foster, writing in 2010, not long after the 2008 crisis, stated: “Lacking an outlet in production, capital took refuge in speculation in debt-leveraged finance (a bewildering array of options, futures, derivatives, swaps etc.).” The neoliberal agenda was the political expression of capital’s response to the stagnation and included the raiding and sacking of public budgets, the expansion of credit to consumers and governments to sustain spending and consumption and frenzied financial speculation. With the engine of capital accumulation via production no longer firing on all cylinders, the emergency backup of financial expansion took over. We have seen a shift from real capital formation in many Western economies, which increases overall economic output, towards the appreciation of financial assets, which increases wealth claims but not output. Farmland is being transformed from a resource supporting food production and rural stability to a financial asset and speculative commodity. An asset class where wealthy investors can park their capital to further profit from inflated asset prices. The net-zero green agenda also has to be seen in this context: when capital struggles to make sufficient profit, productive wealth (capital) over accumulates and depreciates; to avoid crisis, constant growth and, in this case, the creation of fresh ‘green’ investment opportunities is required. The IPES report notes that nearly 45 per cent of all farmland investments in 2018, worth roughly $15 billion, came from pension funds and insurance companies. Based on workers’ contributions, pension fund investments in farmland are promoting land speculation, industrial agriculture and the interests of big agribusiness at the expense of smallholder farmers. Workers’ futures are tied to pension funds, which are supporting the growth and power of global finance and the degradation of other workers (in this case, cultivators). Sofía Monsalve Suárez, from the IPES, states: “It’s time decision-makers stop shirking their responsibility and start to tackle rural decline. The financialisation and liberalisation of land markets is ruining livelihoods and threatening the right to food. Instead of opening the floodgates to speculative capital, governments need to take concrete steps to halt bogus ‘green grabs’ and invest in rural development, sustainable farming and community-led conservation.” With pensions tied to an increasingly commodified food system, ordinary people have become deeply incorporated into a capitalist economy that requires private profit at the expense of public well-being. The links between big finance, the food system, illness and big pharma were described in Sickening Profits: The Global Food System’s Poisoned Food and Toxic Wealth. That book highlighted a cyclical relationship where financial institutions like BlackRock benefit from both their investments in the global food system and their investments in pharmaceuticals. At the same time, the relationship between ordinary people’s pensions and investments and the commodification of farmland further illustrates a complex interplay between finance and agriculture. Addressing these challenges requires a critical examination of how financial interests shape agricultural practices and a concerted effort towards more sustainable food systems that prioritise ecological integrity and community well-being over mere profitability. Earlier in this chapter, it was stated that the influx of capital into farmland has further fuelled an industrial agricultural model characterised by monocultures, heavy reliance on chemical inputs and a focus on maximising yields at the expense of ecological balance and a systems approach. But what is a systems approach? It involves understanding agriculture as part of a broader ecological and social system. It acknowledges that agricultural practices affect and are affected by environmental health, community well-being and economic viability. However, industrial agriculture often overlooks these interconnections, leading to detrimental outcomes such as soil degradation, polluted waterways, loss of biodiversity, the destruction of rural communities, small-scale farms and local economies and negative health impacts. By contrast, a systems approach promotes agroecological principles that prioritise local food security, sustainable practices and the resilience of farming communities. Agroecology serves as a primary framework within this systems approach. It integrates scientific research with traditional knowledge and grassroots participation, fostering practices that enhance ecological balance while ensuring farmers’ livelihoods. This method encourages diverse cropping systems, natural pest management and sustainable resource use, which collectively contribute to more resilient agricultural ecosystems. Agroecology not only addresses immediate agricultural challenges but also engages with broader political and economic issues affecting food systems. Moreover, a systems approach prioritises diverse nutrition production per acre, which contrasts sharply with conventional, reductionist agricultural models that focus predominantly on maximising yields of a single crop. Agroecological methods, which are foundational to this systems perspective, can lead to improved nutritional outcomes: by cultivating a wider variety of crops, farmers can enhance the nutritional quality of food produced on each acre, thereby addressing issues of malnutrition and food insecurity more effectively. Localised food systems and the primacy of small farms are critical to a systems approach. By reducing dependency on global supply chains dominated by big finance and large agribusiness, localised systems can enhance food sovereignty and empower communities. This shift not only mitigates vulnerability to global market fluctuations and supply chain crises but also fosters self-sufficiency and resilience against environmental changes. A systems approach thus advocates for policies that support smallholder farmers and promote sustainable practices tailored to local conditions. (For further insight into agroecology and its feasibility, successes and scaling up, there is an entire chapter on agroecology in Food, Dependency and Dispossession: Resisting the New World Order.) Throughout the world, from the Netherlands to India, farmers are protesting. The protests might appear to have little in common. But they do. Farmers are increasingly finding it difficult to make a living, whether, for instance, because of neoliberal trade policies that lead to the import of produce that undermines domestic production and undercuts prices, the withdrawal of state support or the implementation of net-zero emissions policies that set unrealistic targets. The common thread is that, by one way or another, farming is deliberately being made impossible or financially non-viable. The aim is to drive most farmers off the land and ram through an agenda that by its very nature seems likely to produce shortages and undermine food security. . Farmers’ protest in The Hague 1 October 2019. (Licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0) . A ‘one world agriculture’ global agenda is being promoted by the likes of the Gates Foundation and the World Economic Forum. It involves a vision of food and farming that sees companies such as Bayer, Corteva, Syngenta and Cargill working with Microsoft, Google and the big-tech giants to facilitate AI-driven farmerless farms, laboratory-engineered ‘food’ and retail dominated by the likes of Amazon and Walmart. A cartel of data owners, proprietary input suppliers and e-commerce platforms at the commanding heights of the economy. The agenda is the brainchild of a digital-corporate-financial complex that wants to transform and control all aspects of life and human behaviour. This complex forms part of an authoritarian global elite that has the ability to coordinate its agenda globally via the United Nations, the World Economic Forum, the World Trade Organization (WTO), the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and other supranational organisations, including influential think tanks and foundations (Gates, Rockefeller etc.). Its agenda for food and farming is euphemistically called a ‘food transition’. Big agribusiness and ‘philanthropic’ foundations position themselves as the saviours of humanity due to their much-promoted plans to ‘feed the world’ with high-tech ‘precision’ farming’, ‘data-driven’ agriculture and ‘green’ (net-zero) production — with a warped notion of ‘sustainability’ being the mantra. A much talked about ‘food transition’ goes hand in hand with an energy transition, net-zero ideology, programmable central bank digital currencies, the censorship of free speech and clampdowns on protest. To properly understand these processes, we need to first locate what is essentially a social and economic reset within the context of a collapsing financial system. Writer Ted Reece notes that the general rate of profit has trended downwards from an estimated 43 per cent in the 1870s to 17 per cent in the 2000s. By late 2019, many companies could not generate enough profit. Falling turnover, squeezed margins, limited cashflows and highly leveraged balance sheets were prevalent. Professor Fabio Vighi of Cardiff University has described how closing down the global economy in early 2020 under the guise of fighting a supposedly new and novel pathogen allowed the US Federal Reserve to flood collapsing financial markets (COVID relief) with freshly printed money without causing hyperinflation. Lockdowns curtailed economic activity, thereby removing demand for the newly printed money (credit) in the physical economy and preventing ‘contagion’. According to investigative journalist Michael Byrant, €1.5 trillion was needed to deal with the crisis in Europe alone. The financial collapse staring European central bankers in the face came to a head in 2019. The appearance of a ‘novel virus’ provided a convenient cover story. The European Central Bank agreed to a €1.31 trillion bailout of banks followed by the EU agreeing to a €750 billion recovery fund for European states and corporations. This package of long-term, ultra-cheap credit to hundreds of banks was sold to the public as a necessary programme to cushion the impact of the ‘pandemic’ on businesses and workers. In response to a collapsing neoliberalism, we are now seeing the rollout of an authoritarian great reset — an agenda that intends to reshape the economy and change how we live. The new economy is to be dominated by a handful of tech giants, global conglomerates and e-commerce platforms, and new markets will also be created through the financialisation of nature, which is to be colonised, commodified and traded under the notion of protecting the environment. In recent years, we have witnessed an overaccumulation of capital, and the creation of such markets will provide fresh investment opportunities (including dodgy carbon offsetting Ponzi schemes) for the super-rich to park their wealth and prosper. This great reset envisages a transformation of Western societies, resulting in permanent restrictions on fundamental liberties and mass surveillance. Being rolled out under the benign term of a ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution’, the World Economic Forum (WEF) says the public will eventually ‘rent’ everything they require (remember the WEF video ‘you will own nothing and be happy’?): stripping the right of ownership under the guise of a ‘green economy’ and underpinned by the rhetoric of ‘sustainable consumption’ and ‘climate emergency’. . Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates – World Economic Forum Annual Meeting Davos 2008 (Copyright World Economic Forum by Remy Steinegger) . Climate alarmism and the mantra of sustainability are about promoting money-making schemes. But they also serve another purpose: social control. Neoliberalism has run its course, resulting in the impoverishment of large sections of the population. But to dampen dissent and lower expectations, the levels of personal freedom we have been used to will not be tolerated. This means that the wider population will be subjected to the discipline of an emerging surveillance state. To push back against any dissent, ordinary people are being told that they must sacrifice personal liberty in order to protect public health, societal security (those terrible Russians, Islamic extremists or that Sunak-designated bogeyman George Galloway) or the climate; in the case of the climate, this means, for instance, travelling less and eating synthetic ‘meat’. Unlike in the old normal of neoliberalism, an ideological shift is occurring whereby personal freedoms are increasingly depicted as being dangerous because they run counter to the collective good. A main reason for this ideological shift is to ensure that the masses get used to lower living standards and accept them. Consider, for instance, the Bank of England’s chief economist Huw Pill saying that people should ‘accept’ being poorer. And then there is Rob Kapito of the world’s biggest asset management firm BlackRock, who says that a “very entitled” generation must deal with scarcity for the first time in their lives. At the same time, to muddy the waters, the message is that lower living standards are the result of the conflict in Ukraine and supply shocks that both the war and ‘the virus’ have caused. The net-zero carbon emissions agenda will help legitimise lower living standards (reducing your carbon footprint) while reinforcing the notion that our rights must be sacrificed for the greater good. You will own nothing, not because the rich and their neoliberal agenda made you poor but because you will be instructed to stop being irresponsible and must act to protect the planet. But what of this shift towards net-zero greenhouse gas emissions and the plan to slash our carbon footprints? Is it even feasible or necessary? Gordon Hughes, a former World Bank economist and current professor of economics at the University of Edinburgh, says in a 2024 report that current UK and European net-zero policies will likely lead to further economic ruin. Apparently, the only viable way to raise the cash for sufficient new capital expenditure (on wind and solar infrastructure) would be a two decades-long reduction in private consumption of up to 10 per cent. Such a shock has never occurred in the last century outside war; even then, never for more than a decade. But this agenda will also cause serious environmental degradation. So says Andrew Nikiforuk in the article The Rising Chorus of Renewable Energy Skeptics, which outlines how the green techno-dream is vastly destructive. He lists the devastating environmental impacts of an even more mineral-intensive system based on renewables and warns: “The whole process of replacing a declining system with a more complex mining-based enterprise is now supposed to take place with a fragile banking system, dysfunctional democracies, broken supply chains, critical mineral shortages and hostile geopolitics.” All of this assumes that global warming is real and anthropogenic. Not everyone agrees. In the article Global warming and the confrontation between the West and the rest of the world, journalist Thierry Meyssan argues that net zero is based on political ideology rather than science. But to state such things has become heresy in the Western countries and shouted down with accusations of ‘climate science denial’. Regardless of such concerns, the march towards net zero continues, and key to this is the United Nations Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development Goals. . A proposal to visualize the 17 SDGs in a thematic pyramid (Licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0) . Today, almost every business or corporate report, website or brochure includes a multitude of references to ‘carbon footprints’, ‘sustainability’, ‘net zero’ or ‘climate neutrality’ and how a company or organisation intends to achieve its sustainability targets. Green profiling, green bonds and green investments go hand in hand with displaying ‘green’ credentials and ambitions wherever and whenever possible. It seems anyone and everyone in business is planting their corporate flag on the summit of sustainability. Take Sainsbury’s, for instance. It is one of the ‘big six’ food retail supermarkets in the UK and has a vision for the future of food that it published in 2019 that dovetails with the so-called food transition and the interrelated net-zero agenda — you must change your eating habits and eat synthetic food to save the planet! Here’s a quote from it: “Personalised Optimisation is a trend that could see people chipped and connected like never before. A significant step on from wearable tech used today, the advent of personal microchips and neural laces has the potential to see all of our genetic, health and situational data recorded, stored and analysed by algorithms which could work out exactly what we need to support us at a particular time in our life. Retailers, such as Sainsbury’s could play a critical role to support this, arranging delivery of the needed food within thirty minutes — perhaps by drone.” Tracked, traced and chipped — for your own benefit. Corporations accessing all of our personal data, right down to our DNA. The report is littered with references to sustainability and the climate or environment, and it is difficult not to get the impression that it is written so as to leave the reader awestruck by the technological possibilities. We shall return to this report in the next chapter. The report appears to be part of a paradigm that promotes a brave new world of technological innovation but has nothing to say about power — who determines policies that have led to massive inequalities, poverty, malnutrition, food insecurity and hunger and who is responsible for the degradation of the environment in the first place — is nothing new. The essence of power is conveniently glossed over, not least because those involved in the prevailing food regime are also shaping the techno-utopian fairytale where everyone lives happily ever after eating synthetic food while living in a digital panopticon. The type of ‘green’ agenda being pushed is not just about social engineering and behavioural change; it is also a multi-trillion market opportunity for lining the pockets of rich investors and subsidy-sucking green infrastructure firms. It is, furthermore, a type of green that plans to cover much of the countryside with wind farms and solar panels with most farmers no longer farming. A recipe for food insecurity. Those investing in the ‘green’ agenda care first and foremost about profit. The supremely influential BlackRock is not only promoting this agenda; it also invests in the current food system and the corporations responsible for polluted waterways, degraded soils, the displacement of smallholder farmers, a spiralling public health crisis, malnutrition and much more. It also invests in healthcare — an industry that thrives on the illnesses and conditions created by eating the substandard food that the current system produces. Did Larry Fink, the top man at BlackRock, suddenly develop a conscience and become an environmentalist who cares about the planet and ordinary people? Of course not. He smells ever more profit in ‘climate-friendly’, ‘precision’ agriculture, genetic engineering and facilitating a new technocratic fake-green normal. Any serious deliberations on the future of food would surely consider issues like food sovereignty, the role of agroecology and the strengthening of family farms — the backbone of current global food production. The aforementioned article by Andrew Nikiforuk concludes that, if we are really serious about our impacts on the environment, we must scale back our needs and simplify society. In terms of food, the solution rests on a low-input approach that strengthens rural communities and local markets and prioritises smallholder farms and small independent enterprises and retailers, localised democratic food systems and a concept of food sovereignty based on self-sufficiency, agroecological principles and regenerative agriculture. It would involve facilitating the right to culturally appropriate food that is nutritionally dense due to diverse cropping patterns and free from toxic chemicals while ensuring local ownership and stewardship of common resources like land, water, soil and seeds. That’s where genuine environmentalism, ‘sustainability’, social justice and the future of food begins. But there’s no profit or role in that for Fink or the big agribusiness and tech giants that despise such approaches. Sainsbury’s Future of Food report (2019), mentioned in the previous chapter, is not merely a misguided attempt at forecasting future trends and habits; it reads more like a manifesto for corporate control and technocratic tyranny disguised as ‘progress’. This document epitomises everything wrong with the industrial food system’s vision for our future. It represents a dystopian roadmap to a world where our most fundamental connection to nature and culture — our food — is hijacked by corporate interests and mediated through a maze of unnecessary and potentially harmful technologies. . Illustration by Margarita Mitrovic / Screenshot from Sainsbury’s Report . The wild predictions and technological ‘solutions’ presented in the report reveal a profound disconnection from the lived experiences of ordinary people and the real challenges facing our food systems. Its claim (in 2019) that a quarter of Britons will be vegetarian by 2025 seems way off the mark. But it fits a narrative that seeks to reshape our diets and food culture. Once you convince the reader that things are going to be a certain way in the future, it is easier to pave the way for normalising what appears elsewhere in the report: lab-grown meat, 3D-printed foods and space farming. Of course, the underlying assumption is that giant corporations — and supermarkets like Sainsbury’s — will be controlling everything and rolling out marvellous ‘innovations’ under the guise of ‘feeding the world’ or ‘saving the planet’. There is no concern expressed in the report about the consolidation of corporate-technocratic control over the food system. By promoting high-tech solutions, the report seemingly advocates for a future where our food supply is entirely dependent on complex technologies controlled by a handful of corporations. The report talks of ‘artisan factories’ run by robots. Is this meant to get ordinary people to buy into Sainsbury’s vision of the future? Possibly, if the intention is to further alienate people from their food sources, making them ever more dependent on corporate-controlled, ultra-processed products. It’s a future where the art of cooking, the joy of growing food and the cultural significance of traditional dishes are replaced by sterile, automated processes devoid of human touch and cultural meaning. This erosion of food culture and skills is not an unintended consequence — it’s a core feature of the corporate food system’s strategy to create a captive market of consumers unable to feed themselves without corporate intervention. The report’s enthusiasm for personalised nutrition driven by AI and biometric data is akin to an Orwellian scenario that would give corporations unprecedented control over our dietary choices, turning the most fundamental human need into a data-mined, algorithm-driven commodity. The privacy implications are staggering, as is the potential for new forms of discrimination and social control based on eating habits. Imagine a world where your insurance premiums are tied to your adherence to a corporate-prescribed diet or where your employment prospects are influenced by your ‘Food ID’. The possible dystopian reality lurking behind Sainsbury’s glossy predictions. The report’s fixation on exotic ingredients like jellyfish and lichen draws attention away from the real issues affecting our food systems — corporate concentration, environmental degradation and the systematic destruction of local food cultures and economies. It would be better to address the root causes of food insecurity and malnutrition, which are fundamentally issues of poverty and inequality, not a lack of novel food sources. Nothing is mentioned about the vital role of agroecology, traditional farming knowledge and food sovereignty in creating truly sustainable and just food systems. Instead, what we see is a future where every aspect of our diet is mediated by technology and corporate interests, from gene-edited crops to synthetic biology-derived foods. A direct assault on the principles of food sovereignty, which assert the right of peoples to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through ecologically sound and sustainable methods. The report’s emphasis on lab-grown meat and other high-tech protein sources is particularly troubling. These technologies, far from being the environmental saviours they are promoted as, risk increasing energy use and further centralising food production in the hands of a few tech giants. The massive energy requirements for large-scale cultured meat production are conveniently glossed over, as are the potential health risks of consuming these novel foods without long-term safety studies. This push for synthetic foods is not about sustainability or animal welfare — it’s about creating new, patentable food sources that can be controlled and monetised by corporations. Moreover, the push for synthetic foods and ‘precision fermentation’ threatens to destroy the livelihoods of millions of small farmers and pastoralists worldwide, replacing them with a handful of high-tech facilities controlled by multinational corporations. Is this meant to be ‘progress’? It’s more like a boardroom recipe for increased food insecurity, rural poverty and corporate monopolisation. The destruction of traditional farming communities and practices would not only be an economic disaster but a cultural catastrophe, erasing millennia of accumulated knowledge and wisdom about sustainable food production. The report’s casual mention of ‘sin taxes’ on meat signals a future where our dietary choices are increasingly policed and penalised by the state, likely at the behest of corporate interests. However, on the issue of the need to reduce meat consumption and replace meat with laboratory-manufactured items in order to reduce carbon emissions, it must be stated that the dramatic increase in the amount of meat consumed post-1945 was not necessarily the result of consumer preference; it had more to do with political policy, the mechanisation of agriculture and Green Revolution practices. That much was made clear by Laila Kassam, who, in her 2017 article What’s grain got to do with it? How the problem of surplus grain was solved by increasing ‘meat’ consumption in post-WWII US, asked: “Have you ever wondered how ‘meat’ became such a central part of the Western diet? Or how the industrialisation of ‘animal agriculture’ came about? It might seem like the natural outcome of the ‘free market’ meeting demand for more ‘meat’. But from what I have learned from Nibert (2002) and Winders and Nibert (2004), the story of how ‘meat’ consumption increased so much in the post-World War II period is anything but natural. They argue it is largely due to a decision in the 1940s by the US government to deal with the problem of surplus grain by increasing the production of ‘meat’.” Kassam notes: “In the second half of the 20th century, global ‘meat’ production increased by nearly 5 times. The amount of ‘meat’ eaten per person doubled. By 2050 ‘meat’ consumption is estimated to increase by 160 percent (The World Counts, 2017). While global per capita ‘meat’ consumption is currently 43 kg/year, it is nearly double in the UK (82 kg/year) and almost triple in the US (118 kg/year).” Kassam notes that habits and desires are manipulated by elite groups for their own interests. Propaganda, advertising and ‘public relations’ are used to manufacture demand for products. Agribusiness corporations and the state have used these techniques to encourage ‘meat’ consumption, leading to the slaughter and untold misery of billions of creatures, as Kassam makes clear. People were manipulated to buy into ‘meat culture’. Now they are being manipulated to buy out, again by elite groups. But ‘sin taxes’ and Orwellian-type controls on individual behaviour are not the way to go about reducing meat consumption. So, what is the answer? Kassam says that one way to do this is to support grassroots organisations and movements which are working to resist the power of global agribusiness and reclaim our food systems. Movements for food justice and food sovereignty which promote sustainable, agroecological production systems. At least then people will be free from corporate manipulation and better placed to make their own food choices. As Kassam says: “From what I have learned so far, our oppression of other animals is not just a result of individual choices. It is underpinned by a state supported economic system driven by profit.” Meanwhile, Sainsbury’s vision of food production in space and on other planets is perhaps the most egregious example of misplaced priorities. While around a billion struggle with hunger and malnutrition and many more with micronutrient deficiencies, corporate futurists are fantasising about growing food on Mars. Is this supposed to be visionary thinking? It’s a perfect encapsulation of the technocratic mindset that believes every problem can be solved with more technology, no matter how impractical or divorced from reality. Moreover, by promoting a future dependent on complex, centralised technologies, we become increasingly vulnerable to system failures and corporate monopolies. A truly resilient food system should be decentralised, diverse and rooted in local knowledge and resources. The report’s emphasis on nutrient delivery through implants, patches and intravenous methods is particularly disturbing. This represents the ultimate commodification of nutrition, reducing food to mere fuel and stripping away all cultural, social and sensory aspects of eating. It’s a vision that treats the human body as a machine to be optimised, rather than a living being with complex needs and experiences. The idea of ‘grow-your-own’ ingredients for cultured meat and other synthetic foods at home is another example of how this technocratic vision co-opts and perverts concepts of self-sufficiency and local food production. Instead of encouraging people to grow real, whole foods, it proposes a dystopian parody of home food production that still keeps consumers dependent on corporate-supplied technologies and inputs. A clever marketing ploy to make synthetic foods seem more natural and acceptable. The report’s predictions about AI-driven personal nutrition advisors and highly customised diets based on individual ‘Food IDs’ raise serious privacy concerns and threaten to further medicalise our relationship with food. While personalised nutrition could offer some benefits, the level of data collection and analysis required for such systems could lead to unprecedented corporate control over our dietary choices. Furthermore, the emphasis on ‘artisan’ factories run by robots completely misunderstands the nature of artisanal food production. True artisanal foods are the product of human skill, creativity and cultural knowledge passed down through generations. It’s a perfect example of how the technocratic mindset reduces everything to mere processes that can be automated, ignoring the human and cultural elements that give food its true value. The report’s vision of meat ‘assembled’ on 3D printing belts is another disturbing example of the ultra-processed future being proposed. This approach to food production treats nutrition as a mere assembly of nutrients, ignoring the complex interactions between whole foods and the human body. It’s a continuation of the reductionist thinking that has led to the current epidemic of diet-related diseases. Sainsbury’s is essentially advocating for a future where our diets are even further removed from natural, whole foods. The concept of ‘farms’ cultivating plants to make growth serum for cells is yet another step towards the complete artificialisation of the food supply. This approach further distances food production from natural processes. It’s a vision of farming that has more in common with pharmaceutical production than traditional agriculture, and it threatens to complete the transformation of food from a natural resource into an industrial product. Sainsbury’s apparent enthusiasm for gene-edited and synthetic biology-derived foods is also concerning. These technologies’ rapid adoption without thorough long-term safety studies and public debate could lead to unforeseen health and environmental impacts. The history of agricultural biotechnology is rife with examples of unintended consequences, from the development of herbicide-resistant superweeds to the contamination of non-GM crops. Is Sainsbury’s uncritically promoting these technologies, disregarding the precautionary principle? Issues like food insecurity, malnutrition and environmental degradation are not primarily technical problems — they are the result of inequitable distribution of resources, exploitative economic systems and misguided policies. By framing these issues as purely technological challenges, Sainsbury’s is diverting attention from the need for systemic change and social justice in the food system. The high-tech solutions proposed are likely to be accessible only to the wealthy, at least initially, creating a two-tiered food system where the rich have access to ‘optimized’ nutrition while the poor are left with increasingly degraded and processed options. But the report’s apparent disregard for the cultural and social aspects of food is perhaps its most fundamental flaw. Food is not merely fuel for our bodies; it’s a central part of our cultural identities, social relationships and connection to the natural world. By reducing food to a series of nutrients to be optimised and delivered in the most efficient manner possible, Sainsbury’s is proposing a future that is not only less healthy but less human. While Sainsbury’s Future of Food report can be regarded as a roadmap to a better future, it is really a corporate wish list, representing a dangerous consolidation of power in the hands of agribusiness giants and tech companies at the expense of farmers, consumers and the environment. The report is symptomatic of a wider ideology that seeks to legitimise total corporate control over our food supply. And the result? A homogenised, tech-driven dystopia. A technocratic nightmare that gives no regard for implementing food systems that are truly democratic, ecologically sound and rooted in the needs and knowledge of local communities. The real future of food lies not in corporate labs and AI algorithms, but in the fields of agroecological farmers, the kitchens of home cooks and the markets of local food producers. The path forward is not through more technology and corporate control but through a return to the principles of agroecology, food sovereignty and cultural diversity. “A total demolition of the previous forms of existence is underway: how one comes into the world, biological sex, education, relationships, the family, even the diet that is about to become synthetic.” — Silvia Guerini, radical ecologist, in From the ‘Neutral’ Body to the Posthuman Cyborg (2023) We are currently seeing an acceleration of the corporate consolidation of the entire global agri-food chain. The big data conglomerates, including Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook and Google, have joined traditional agribusiness giants, such as Corteva, Bayer, Cargill and Syngenta, in a quest to impose their model of food and agriculture on the world. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and big financial institutions, like BlackRock and Vanguard, are also involved, whether through buying up huge tracts of farmland, pushing biosynthetic (fake) food and genetic engineering technologies or more generally facilitating and financing the aims of the mega agri-food corporations. The billionaire interests behind this try to portray their techno-solutionism as some kind of humanitarian endeavour: saving the planet with ‘climate-friendly solutions’, ‘helping farmers’ or ‘feeding the world’. But what it really amounts to is repackaging and greenwashing the dispossessive strategies of imperialism. It involves a shift towards a ‘one world agriculture’ under the control of agritech and the data giants, which is to be based on genetically-engineered seeds, laboratory-created products that resemble food, ‘precision’ and ‘data-driven’ agriculture and farming without farmers, with the entire agrifood chain, from field (or lab) to retail, being governed by monopolistic e-commerce platforms determined by artificial intelligence systems and algorithms. Those who are pushing this agenda have a vision not only for farmers but also for humanity in general. The elites through their military-digital-financial (Pentagon/Silicon Valley/Big Finance) complex want to use their technologies to reshape the world and redefine what it means to be human. They regard humans, their cultures and their practices, like nature itself, as a problem and deficient. Farmers are to be displaced and replaced with drones, machines and cloud-based computing. Food is to be redefined, and people are to be fed synthetic, genetically-engineered products. Cultures are to be eradicated, and humanity is to be fully urbanised, subservient and disconnected from the natural world. What it means to be human is to be radically transformed. But what has it meant to be human until now or at least prior to the (relatively recent) Industrial Revolution and associated mass urbanisation? To answer this question, we need to discuss our connection to nature and what most of humanity was involved in prior to industrialisation — cultivating food. Many of the ancient rituals and celebrations of our forebears were built around stories, myths and rituals that helped them come to terms with some of the most fundamental issues of existence, from death to rebirth and fertility. These culturally-embedded beliefs and practices served to sanctify people’s practical relationship with nature and its role in sustaining human life. As agriculture became key to human survival, the planting and harvesting of crops and other seasonal activities associated with food production were central to these customs. Humans celebrated nature and the life it gave birth to. Ancient beliefs and rituals were imbued with hope and renewal and people had a necessary and immediate relationship with the sun, seeds, animals, wind, fire, soil and rain and the changing seasons that nourished and brought life. Our cultural and social relationships with agrarian production and associated deities had a sound practical base. People’s lives have been tied to planting, harvesting, seeds, soil and the seasons for thousands of years. Silvia Guerini, whose quote introduces this chapter, notes the importance of deep-rooted relationships and the rituals that re-affirm them. She says that through rituals a community recognises itself and its place in the world. They create the spirit of a rooted community by contributing to rooting and making a single existence endure in a time, in a territory, in a community. Professor Robert W Nicholls explains that the cults of Woden and Thor were superimposed on far older and better-rooted beliefs related to the sun and the earth, the crops and the animals and the rotation of the seasons between the light and warmth of summer and the cold and dark of winter. Humanity’s relationship with farming and food and our connections to land, nature and community has for millennia defined what it means to be human. Take India, for example. Environmental scientist Viva Kermani says that Hinduism is the world’s largest nature-based religion that: “… recognises and seeks the Divine in nature and acknowledges everything as sacred. It views the earth as our Mother and hence advocates that it should not be exploited. A loss of this understanding that earth is our mother, or rather a deliberate ignorance of this, has resulted in the abuse and the exploitation of the earth and its resources.” Kermani notes that ancient scriptures instructed people that the animals and plants found in India are sacred and, therefore, all aspects of nature are to be revered. She adds that this understanding of and reverence towards the environment is common to all Indic religious and spiritual systems: Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. According to Kermani, the Vedic deities have deep symbolism and many layers of existence. One such association is with ecology. Surya is associated with the sun, the source of heat and light that nourishes everyone; Indra is associated with rain, crops, and abundance; and Agni is the deity of fire and transformation and controls all changes. She notes that the Vrikshayurveda, an ancient Sanskrit text on the science of plants and trees, contains details about soil conservation, planting, sowing, treatment, propagating, how to deal with pests and diseases and a lot more. Like Nicholls, Kermani provides insight into some of the profound cultural, philosophical and practical aspects of humanity’s connection to nature and food production. This connection resonates with agrarianism, a philosophy based on cooperative labour and fellowship, which stands in stark contrast to the values and impacts of urban life, capitalism and technology that are too often detrimental to independence and dignity. Agrarianism, too, emphasises a spiritual dimension as well as the value of rural society, small farms, widespread property ownership and political decentralisation. The poet and prominent proponent of agrarianism Wendell Berry says: “The revolution which began with machines and chemicals now continues with automation, computers and biotechnology.” For Berry, agrarianism is not a sentimental longing for a time past. Colonial attitudes, domestic, foreign and now global, have resisted true agrarianism almost from the beginning — there has never been fully sustainable, stable, locally adapted, land-based economies. However, Berry provides many examples of small (and larger) farms that have similar output as industrial agriculture with one third of the energy. In his poem ‘A Spiritual Journey’, Berry writes the following: “And the world cannot be discovered by a journey of miles, no matter how long, but only by a spiritual journey, a journey of one inch, very arduous and humbling and joyful, by which we arrive at the ground at our feet, and learn to be at home.” Agrarianism, while advocating for a return to small-scale farming and community-oriented living, is often critiqued for its idealisation of rural life and agricultural work. Critics argue that it mistakenly elevates farming above other forms of labour, suggesting that agricultural work inherently fosters moral virtues and a closer relationship with nature. It might appear to be naive, not least because, it overlooks the complexities and ethical dilemmas present in agrarian communities, which can be just as susceptible to corruption and environmental degradation as urban settings. This raises the question: are solutions based on agrarianism utopian and disconnected from modern societal needs? Not really. Agrarianism offers a necessary critique of industrial agriculture and the accelerated urbanisation we see across the world, emphasising the importance of local communities and sustainable practices. It promotes the idea that close relationships with the land can foster not only environmental stewardship but also social cohesion and moral integrity among community members. By advocating for small-scale farming and local food systems, agrarianism seeks to empower individuals and families, encouraging self-sufficiency and resilience against the negative impacts of globalisation and corporate control in agriculture. As a philosophy, agrarianism highlights the value of traditional knowledge and practices in addressing contemporary issues such as climate challenges, food security and social inequality. We shall return to Wendell Berry in the final chapter. But in the cold, centralised, technocratic dystopia that is planned, humanity’s spiritual connection to the countryside, food and agrarian production are to be cast into the dustbin of history. What we are seeing is an agenda based on a different set of values rooted in a lust for power and money and the total subjugation of ordinary people. Silvia Guerini says: “The past becomes something to be erased in order to break the thread that binds us to a history, to a tradition, to a belonging, for the transition towards a new uprooted humanity, without past, without memory… a new humanity dehumanised in its essence, totally in the hands of the manipulators of reality and truth”. This dehumanised humanity severed from the past is part of the wider agenda of transhumanism. For instance, we are not just seeing a push towards a world without farmers and everything that has connected us to the soil but, according to Guerini, also a world without mothers. She argues that those behind test-tube babies and surrogate motherhood now have their sights on genetic engineering and artificial wombs, which would cut women out of the reproductive process. Guerini predicts that artificial wombs could eventually be demanded, or rather marketed, as a right for everyone, including transgender people. It is interesting that the language around pregnancy is already contested with the omission of ‘women’ from statements like ‘persons who can get pregnant’. Of course, there has long been a blurring of lines between biotechnology, eugenics and genetic engineering. Genetically engineered crops, gene drives and gene editing are now a reality, but the ultimate goal is marrying artificial intelligence, bionanotechnology and genetic engineering to produce the one-world transhuman. This is being pushed by powerful interests, who, according to Guerini, are using a rainbow, transgenic left and LGBTQ+ organisations to promote a new synthetic identity and claim to new rights. She says this is an attack on life, on nature, on “what is born, as opposed to artificial” and adds that all ties to the real, natural world must be severed. It is interesting that in its report Future of Food, the UK supermarket giant Sainsbury’s celebrates a future where we are microchipped and tracked and neural laces have the potential to see all of our genetic, health and situational data recorded, stored and analysed by algorithms that could work out exactly what food (delivered by drone) we need to support us at a particular time in our life. All sold as ‘personal optimisation’. Moreover, it is likely, according to the report, that we will be getting key nutrients through implants. Part of these nutrients will come in the form of lab-grown food and insects. A neural lace is an ultra-thin mesh that can be implanted in the skull, forming a collection of electrodes capable of monitoring brain function. It creates an interface between the brain and the machine. Sainsbury’s does a pretty good job of trying to promote a dystopian future where AI has taken your job, but, according to the report, you have lots of time to celebrate the wonderful, warped world of ‘food culture’ created by the supermarket and your digital overlords. Technofeudalism meets transhumanism — all for your convenience, of course. Imagine, as you sit all day unemployed in your high-rise, your ‘food’ will be delivered via an online platform bought courtesy of your programmable universal basic income digital money. Food courtesy of Gates-promoted farms manned by driverless machines, monitored by drones and doused with chemicals to produce crops from patented genetically modified seeds for industrial ‘biomatter’ to be engineered, processed and constituted into something resembling food. Enjoy and be happy eating your fake food, stripped of satisfying productive endeavour and genuine self-fulfilment. But really, it will not be a problem. You can sit all day and exist virtually in Zuckerberg’s fantasy metaverse. Property-less and happy in your open prison of state dependency, track and chip surveillance passports and financial exclusion via programmable currency. A world also in which bodily integrity no longer exists courtesy of a mandatory vaccination agenda linked to emerging digital-biopharmaceutical technologies. But none of this will happen overnight. And whether the technology will deliver remains to be seen. Those who are promoting this brave new world might have overplayed their hand but will spend the following decades trying to drive their vision forward. But arrogance is their Achilles heel. There is still time to educate, to organise, to resist and to agitate against this hubris, not least by challenging the industrial food giants and the system that sustains them and by advocating for and creating grass-root food movements and local economies that strengthen food sovereignty. Max Weber (1864-1920) was a prominent German sociologist who developed influential theories on rationality and authority. He examined the different types of rationality that underpinned systems of authority. He argued that modern Western societies were based on legal-rational authority and had moved away from systems that were based on traditional authority and charismatic authority. Traditional authority derives its power from long-standing customs and traditions, while charismatic authority is based on the exceptional personal qualities or charisma of a leader. According to Weber, the legal-rational authority that characterises Western capitalist industrial society is based on instrumental rationality that focuses on the most efficient means to achieve given ends. This type of rationality manifests in bureaucratic power. Weber contrasted this with another form of rationality: value rationality that is based on conscious beliefs in the inherent value of certain behaviour. While Weber saw the benefits of instrumental rationality in terms of increased efficiency, he feared that this could lead to a stifling “iron cage” of a rule-based order and rule following (instrumental rationality) as an end in itself. The result would be humanity’s “polar night of icy darkness.” Today, technological change is sweeping across the planet and presents many challenges. The danger is of a technological iron cage in the hands of an elite that uses technology for malevolent purposes. Lewis Coyne of Exeter University says: “We do not — or should not — want to become a society in which things of deeper significance are appreciated only for any instrumental value. The challenge, therefore, is to delimit instrumental rationality and the technologies that embody it by protecting that which we value intrinsically, above and beyond mere utility.” He adds that we must decide which technologies we are for, to what ends, and how they can be democratically managed, with a view to the kind of society we wish to be. A major change that we have seen in recent years is the increasing dominance of cloud-based services and platforms. In the food and agriculture sector, we are seeing the rollout of these phenomena tied to a techno solutionist ‘data-driven’ or ‘precision’ agriculture legitimised by ‘humanitarian’ notions of ‘helping farmers’, ‘saving the planet’ and ‘feeding the world’ in the face of some kind of impending Malthusian catastrophe. A part-fear mongering, part-self-aggrandisement narrative promoted by those who have fuelled ecological devastation, corporate dependency, land dispossession, food insecurity and farmer indebtedness as a result of the global food regime that they helped to create and profited from. Now, with a highly profitable but flawed carbon credit trading scheme and a greenwashed technology-driven eco-modernism, they are supposedly going to save humanity from itself. In the agrifood sector, we are seeing the rollout of data-driven or precision approaches to agriculture by the likes of Microsoft, Syngenta, Bayer and Amazon centred on cloud-based data information services. Data-driven agriculture mines data to be exploited by the agribusiness/big tech giants to instruct farmers what and how much to produce and what type of proprietary inputs they must purchase and from whom. Data owners (Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet etc.), input suppliers (Bayer, Corteva, Syngenta, Cargill etc.) and retail concerns (Amazon, Walmart etc) aim to secure the commanding heights of the global agrifood economy through their monopolistic platforms. But what does this model of agriculture look like in practice? Let us use Bayer’s digital platform Climate FieldView as an example. It collects data from satellites and sensors in fields and on tractors and then uses algorithms to advise farmers on their farming practices: when and what to plant, how much pesticide to spray, how much fertiliser to apply etc. To be part of Bayer’s Carbon Program, farmers have to be enrolled in FieldView. Bayer then uses the FieldView app to instruct farmers on the implementation of just two practices that are said to sequester carbon in the soils: reduced tillage or no-till farming and the planting of cover crops. Through the app, the company monitors these two practices and estimates the amount of carbon that the participating farmers have sequestered. Farmers are then supposed to be paid according to Bayer’s calculations, and Bayer uses that information to claim carbon credits and sell these in carbon markets. Bayer also has a programme in the US called ForGround. Upstream companies can use the platform to advertise and offer discounts for equipment, seeds and other inputs. For example, getting more farmers to use reduced tillage or no-till is of huge benefit to Bayer (sold on the basis of it being ‘climate friendly’ as it keeps carbon in the soil). The kind of reduced tillage or no-till promoted by Bayer requires dousing fields with its RoundUp (toxic glyphosate) or some other toxic herbicide and planting seeds of its genetically engineered herbicide tolerant soybeans or hybrid maize. And what of the cover crops referred to above? Bayer also intends to profit from the promotion of cover crops. It has taken majority ownership of a seed company developing a gene-edited cover crop, called CoverCress. Seeds of CoverCress will be sold to farmers who are enrolled in ForGround and the crop will be sold as a biofuel. But Bayer’s big target is the downstream food companies which can use the platform to claim emissions reductions in their supply chains. Agribusiness corporations and the big tech companies are jointly developing carbon farming platforms to influence farmers on their choice of inputs and farming practices (big tech companies, like Microsoft and IBM, are major buyers of carbon credits). The non-profit GRAIN says (see the article The corporate agenda behind carbon farming) that Bayer is gaining increasing control over farmers in various countries, dictating exactly how they farm and what inputs they use through its Carbon Program. GRAIN argues that, for corporations, carbon farming is all about increasing their control within the food system and is certainly not about sequestering carbon. Digital platforms are intended to be one-stop shops for carbon credits, seeds, pesticides and fertilisers and agronomic advice, all supplied by the company, which gets the added benefit of control over the data harvested from the participating farms. Yanis Varoufakis, former finance minister of Greece, argues that what we are seeing is a shift from capitalism to techno-feudalism. He argues that tech giants like Apple, Meta and Amazon act as modern-day feudal lords. Users of digital platforms (such as companies or farmers) essentially become ‘cloud serfs’, and ‘rent’ (fees, data etc) is extracted from them for being on a platform. In feudalism (land) rent drives the system. In capitalism, profits drive the system. Varoufakis says that markets are being replaced by algorithmic ‘digital fiefdoms’. Although digital platforms require some form of capitalist production, as companies like Amazon or Bayer need manufacturers or farmers to produce goods for their platforms, the new system represents a significant shift in power dynamics, favouring those who own and control the platforms. Whether this system is technofeudalism, hypercapitalism or something else is open to debate. But we should at least be able to agree on one thing: the changes we are seeing are having profound impacts on economies as well as producers and populations that are increasingly surveilled as they are compelled to shift their activities and lives online. The very corporations that are responsible for the problems of the prevailing food system merely offer more of the same, this time packaged in an app-friendly, genetically engineered, ecomodernist, fake-green, carbon-trading wrapping. Elected officials are facilitating this by putting the needs of monopolistic global interests ahead of ordinary people’s personal freedoms and workers’ rights, as well as the needs of independent local producers, enterprises and markets. For instance, the Indian government has in recent times signed memoranda of understanding (MoU) with Amazon, Bayer, Microsoft and Syngenta to rollout data-driven, precision agriculture. Integral to A standardised ‘one world agriculture’ under the control of these companies based on genetically engineered seeds, laboratory created products that resemble food and farming without farmers, with the entire agrifood chain, from field (or lab) to retail in their hands. In response, a ‘citizen letter’ (July 2024) was sent to the government. It stated that it is not clear what the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) will learn from Bayer that the well-paid public sector scientists of the institution cannot develop themselves. The letter says entities that have been responsible for causing an economic and environmental crisis in Indian agriculture are being partnered by ICAR. The letter raises some key concerns. Where is the democratic debate on carbon credit markets? Is the ICAR ensuring that the farmers get the best rather than biased advice that boosts the further rollout of proprietary products? Is there a system in place for the ICAR to develop research and education agendas from the farmers it is supposed to serve as opposed to being led by the whims and business ideas of corporations? The authors of the letter note that copies of the MoUs are not being shared proactively in the public domain by the ICAR. The letter asks that the ICAR suspends the signed MoUs, shares all details in the public domain and desists from signing any more such MoUs without necessary public debate. As will be made clear in the following chapters, this is part of a broader geopolitical strategy to ensure India’s food dependence on foreign corporations and eradicate any semblance of food democracy (or indeed national sovereignty). In a October 2024 report, GRAIN.org sheds some light: “Jayachandra Sharma, a farmer leader from India’s Karnataka Rajya Ryot Sangha farmer union, sees these developments and the digitalisation of agriculture as part of a broader strategy to push millions of farmers out of agriculture and make India’s food supply dependent on global finance and foreign corporations. Given how companies like Microsoft, Syngenta, Amazon and JD.com are expanding, he could well be right.” Genuine approaches to addressing the challenges humanity faces are being ignored by policymakers or cynically attacked by corporate lobbyists. These solutions involve systemic shifts in agricultural, food and economic systems with a focus on low-consumption (energy) lifestyles, localisation and an ecologically sustainable agroecology. As activist John Wilson says, this is based on creative solutions, a connection to nature and the land, nurturing people, peaceful transformation and solidarity. Co-operative labour, fellowship and our long-standing spiritual connection to the land should inform how as a society we should live. This stands in stark contrast to the values and impacts of capitalism and technology based on instrumental rationality and too often fuelled by revenue streams and the goal to control populations. When we hear talk of a ‘spiritual connection’, what is meant by ‘spiritual’? In a broad sense it can be regarded as a concept that refers to thoughts, beliefs and feelings about the meaning of life, rather than just physical existence. A sense of connection to something greater than ourselves. Something akin to Weber’s concept of value rationality. The spiritual, the diverse and the local are juxtaposed with the selfishness of modern urban society, the increasing homogeneity of thought and practice and an instrumental rationality which becomes an end in itself. Having a direct link with nature/the land is fundamental to developing an appreciation of a type of ‘being’ and an ‘understanding’ that results in a reality worth living in. However, what we are seeing is an agenda based on a different set of values rooted in a lust for power and money and the total subjugation of ordinary people (and farmers) being rammed through under the false promise of techno solutionism (think neural laces to detect moods implanted in the skull, programmable digital money, track and trace technology etc.) and some distant notion of a techno utopia that leave malevolent power relations intact and unchallenged. Is this then to be humanity’s never-ending “polar night of icy darkness”? Hopefully not. This vision is being imposed from above. Ordinary people (whether, for example, farmers in India or those being beaten down through austerity policies) find themselves on the receiving end of a class war being waged against them by a mega rich elite. Indeed, in 1941, Herbert Marcuse stated that technology could be used as an instrument for control and domination. Precisely the agenda of the likes of Bayer, the Gates Foundation, BlackRock and the World Bank, which are trying to eradicate genuine diversity and impose a one-size-fits-all model of thinking and behaviour. A final thought courtesy of civil rights campaigner Frederick Douglass in a speech from 1857: “Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will. Find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have found out the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them, and these will continue till they are resisted with either words or blows, or with both. The limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress.” In October 2024, Indian journalist Bharat Dogra noted the following trend in agriculture: “Small farmers are being displaced and family farms are disappearing as those who are truly dedicated to farming have to say tearful farewells to their farms, while billionaires and richest corporations acquire millions of acres of farmland. While small scale food processors too are being pushed out and possibilities of direct contacts between farmers and consumers to promote sustainable livelihoods based on making available healthy food to all are diminishing, giant multinational companies are taking up food production, trade and processing in ways that are harmful for both consumers and farmers.” It might be an inconvenient truth for big agribusiness, land investors and agritech concerns that prefer large-scale industrial agriculture, but small-scale farmers and peasants feed most of the world. That means the types of farms Dogra refers to. What is more, small farms are more productive than their larger counterparts, which is why they are essential for food security. However, the trend noted by Dogra is apparent across the world. And it is something that, as yet, is still in the early stages in India. But have no doubt, this is the plan for India too, where small-scale farmers make up 85 per cent of the farming community. In late 2021, the Indian government announced that three important farm laws, which would have introduced neoliberal shock therapy to the agricultural sector, would be repealed after a one-year farmers’ mobilisation against the legislation (although discussed below, for more in-depth insight into the issues that sparked the protest, see the relevant chapters in Food, Dependency and Dispossession: Resisting the New World Order). The repeal of the three laws was little more than a tactical manoeuvre given that state elections were upcoming in key rural heartlands in 2022. The powerful global interests behind the legislation have not gone away and farmers’ concerns remain highly relevant. These interests have been behind a decades-long agenda to displace the prevailing agri-food system in India. The laws might have been struck down, but the goal to capture and radically restructure the sector remains. The farmers’ struggle in India is not over. The repeal of the controversial farm laws in India may have been seen as a victory for protesting farmers, but it seems the government is pursuing alternative strategies to achieve similar agricultural reforms. These new approaches, while less direct, could potentially implement many of the changes originally proposed in the repealed legislation. The government seems to be gradually introducing smaller, incremental changes to agricultural policies that align with some of the original goals of the farm laws. For instance, an increased focus on digitalisation and technological solutions in agriculture could indirectly achieve some of the aims of the laws, and encouraging private investment and partnerships in the agricultural sector through other means could still lead to increased corporatisation. This chapter and the following three chapters will address this and will discuss the implications of a number of agreements between the Indian government and the likes of Amazon, Bayer and Syngenta that had little to no democratic oversight. But we will begin by looking at the claim that the BJP-led government was seeking to extract revenge for the humiliating defeat it suffered at the hands of the farmers. This claim was made during a press conference that took place in Delhi in October 2023 held by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) (United Farmers Front). The SKM was formed in November 2020 as a coalition of more than 40 Indian farmers’ unions to coordinate non-violent resistance against the three farm acts initiated two months before. Asserting that the laws violated the constitution and were anti-farmer and pro big business, the SKM announced renewed agitation and expressed grave concern about a crackdown by the government against the online media platform NewsClick, which supported the farmers throughout their one-year struggle. Those present heard that there has been “baseless dishonest and false allegations in the Newsclick FIR against the historic farmers’ struggle” and that the “FIR accuses the farmers’ movement as anti-national, funded by foreign and terrorist forces.” An FIR is a ‘first information report’: a document prepared by police in India when they receive information about the commission of a “cognisable” (serious) offence. Delhi Police issued an FIR against NewsClick founder Prabir Purkayastha and the human resources head Amit Chakravarty, which infers that the farmers’ movement was aimed at stopping the supply of essential goods for citizens and creating law and order issues. An article on The Hindu newspaper’s Frontline portal describes the nature of the FIR, which goes far beyond the farmers’ issue, and concludes police actions along with the FIR marks a major low point for media freedom in India. According to Frontline, the police raids on the offices of NewsClick and the residences of virtually anyone associated with it; the indiscriminate seizure of the electronic devices of journalists and other employees; the sealing of the news portal’s main office; the arrest of its founder-editor and its administrative officer on terrorism-related charges; and the searches conducted at the premises of NewsClick and the home of its founder-editor mark the lowest point for media freedom in India since the Emergency of 1975-1977. The withdrawal of the FIR against Newsclick was called for during the press conference. There was also a demand for the immediate release of NewsClick journalists. The SKM said that farmers across the country would burn copies of the FIR on 6 November 2023 after a sustained campaign at village level against the government’s pro-corporate policies from 1-5 November. The farmers’ coalition also pledged to campaign in five poll-going states with the slogan “Oppose Corporate, Punish BJP, Save Country.” It was also announced that a 72-hour sit-in would take place in front of the Raj Bhawans (official residences of state governors) in state capitals between 26 and 28 November. On November 13, 2024, the Supreme Court of India declared Purkayastha’s arrest and subsequent remand as invalid, emphasising that he and his legal counsel were not provided with the grounds for his arrest prior to his remand hearing. The court criticised the police for circumventing due process and noted that the lack of communication regarding the grounds of arrest severely hindered Purkayastha’s ability to defend himself. The Supreme Court’s ruling mandated his release upon fulfilling bail bond requirements set by the trial court. The case highlights ongoing concerns regarding press freedom in India, particularly in relation to government actions against journalists and media outlets perceived as critical of state policies. The SKM stated that the farmers’ movement was committed and patriotic and saw through the “nefarious plan” of the three farm laws to withdraw government support from agriculture and hand over farming, mandis (state-run wholesale agricultural markets) and public food distribution to corporations led by Adani, Ambani, Tata, Cargill, Pepsi, Walmart, Bayer, Amazon and others. It added that the farmers exposed the corporate-backed plan of depriving the people of India of food security, pauperising farmers, changing cropping patterns to suit corporations and allowing the free penetration of foreign corporations into India’s food processing market. Those in attendance also heard about the hardships experienced by farmers during the one-year agitation: “In the process, the farmers braved water cannons, teargas shelling, roadblocks with huge containers, deep road cuts, lathi charge, cold and hot weather. Over 13 months, they sacrificed 732 martyrs… This was a patriotic movement of the highest quality in the face of repression by a fascist government serving interests of Imperialist exploiters.” State investment in agriculture infrastructure was called for, along with the promotion of profitable farming, the facilitation and securing of modern food processing, marketing and consumer networks under the collective ownership and control of peasant-worker cooperatives. Accusing the government of acting on behalf of corporate interests, one speaker said that it had targeted Newsclick because it only did what a genuine news media should have been doing — reporting on the truth, the problems of farmers and the nature of the struggle. It was claimed that: “The BJP Government is using the farcical FIR to spread a canard that the farmers’ movement was anti-people, anti-national and backed by terrorist funding routed through Newsclick. This is factually wrong and mischievously inserted to portray the movement in bad light and seeking to extract revenge for the humiliating defeat they suffered at the hands of the farmers of our country.” The farmers’ coalition argued that the government is moving to falsely charge the farmers movement of being foreign funded and sponsored by terrorist forces, while it is “promoting FDI, Foreign MNCs, big corporations into agriculture.” The coalition said it remains committed to saving the rural economy, preventing foreign looting and rejuvenating the village economy in order to build a strong India. In 2024, farmers were still protesting. Facilitation of the neoliberal corporatisation of farming that sparked the previous protest remains on the board and farmers’ demands have not been met. The World Bank, the WTO, global agribusiness and financial capital are working to corporatise India’s agriculture sector. This plan goes back to the early 1990s and India’s foreign exchange crisis, which was used (and manipulated) to set this plan in motion. This debt-trap ‘structural adjustment’ policy and process involves displacing the current food production system with contract farming and an industrial model of agriculture and food retail that serves the above interests. The aim is to reduce the role of the public sector in agriculture to a facilitator of private capital, which requires industrial commodity-crop farming. The beneficiaries will include Cargill, Archer Daniels Midlands, Louis Dreyfus, Bunge and India’s retail and agribusiness giants as well as the global agritech, seed and agrochemical corporations and the big tech companies with their ‘data-driven agriculture’. The plan is to displace the peasantry, create a land market and amalgamate landholdings to form larger farms that are more suited to international land investors and industrial farming. As a result, there has been an ongoing strategy to make farming non-viable for many of India’s smallholder farmers and force hundreds of millions out of farming and into urban centres that have already sprawled to form peri-urban areas, which often tend to contain the most agriculturally fertile land. The loss of such land should be a concern in itself. It is not as though farmers want to leave farming. It tends to be in their blood. But if the are unable to cover the costs of production and make a decent living due to the lack of guaranteed prices and the issues laid out below, they will flock to the cities to try to gain a foothold in urban economies. And what will those hundreds of millions do? Driven to the cities because of deliberate impoverishment, they will serve as cheap labour or, more likely, an unemployed or underemployed reserve army of labour for global capital — labour which is being replaced with automation. They will be in search of jobs that are increasingly hard to come by the (World Bank reports that there is more than 23 per cent youth unemployment in India). The impoverishment of farmers results from rising input costs, the withdrawal of government assistance, debt and debt repayments and the impacts of cheap, subsidised imports, which depress farmers’ incomes. While corporations in India receive massive handouts and have loans written off, the lack of a secure income, exposure to volatile and manipulated international market prices and cheap imports contribute to farmers’ misery of not being able to cover the costs of production and secure a decent standard of living. The pressure from the richer nations for the Indian government to further reduce support given to farmers and open up to imports and export-oriented ‘free market’ trade is based on nothing but hypocrisy. For instance, policy analyst Devinder Sharma comments that subsidies provided to US wheat and rice farmers are more than the market worth of these two crops. He also notes that, per day, each cow in Europe receives a subsidy worth more than an Indian farmer’s daily income. The World Bank, the WTO, global institutional investors and transnational agribusiness giants require corporate-dictated contract farming and full-scale neoliberal marketisation for the sale and procurement of produce. They demand that India sacrifice its farmers and its own food security for the benefit of a handful of billionaires. Farmers are merely regarded as producers of raw materials (crops) to be fleeced by suppliers of chemical and biotech inputs and the food processing and retail conglomerates. The more farmers can be squeezed, the greater the profits these corporations can extract. This entails creating farmer dependency on costly external inputs and corporate-dominated markets and supply chains. Global agrifood corporations have cleverly and cynically weaved a narrative that equates eradicating food sovereignty and creating dependency with ‘food security’. In 2018, a charter was released by the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (an umbrella group of around 250 farmers’ organisations). The farmers were concerned about the deepening penetration of predatory corporations and the unbearable burden of indebtedness and the widening disparities between farmers and other sectors. They wanted the government to take measures to bring down the input costs of farming, while making purchases of farm produce below the minimum support price (MSP) both illegal and punishable. The charter also called for a special discussion on the universalisation of the public distribution system (PDS), the withdrawal of pesticides that have been banned elsewhere and the non-approval of genetically engineered seeds without a comprehensive need and impact assessment. Other demands included no foreign direct investment in agriculture and food processing, the protection of farmers from corporate plunder in the name of contract farming, investment in farmers’ collectives to create farmer producer organisations and peasant cooperatives and the promotion of agroecology based on suitable cropping patterns and local seed diversity revival. These demands remain relevant today due to government inaction. In fact, the three farm laws that were repealed aimed to do precisely the opposite. They were intended to expose Indian agriculture to a massive dose of neoliberal marketisation and shock therapy. Although the laws were struck down, the corporate interests behind them never went away and are adamant that the Indian government implements the policies they require. This would mean India reducing the state procurement and distribution of essential foodstuffs and eradicating its food buffer stocks — so vital to national food security — and purchasing the nation’s needs with its foreign exchange reserves on manipulated global commodity markets. This would make the country wholly dependent on attracting foreign investment and international finance. To ensure food sovereignty and national food security, the Mumbai-based Research Unit for Political Economy (RUPE) says that MSPs, through government procurement of essential crops and commodities, should be extended to many major cops such as maize, cotton, oilseed and pulses. At the moment, only farmers in certain states who produce rice and wheat are the main beneficiaries of government procurement at the MSP. Since per capita protein consumption in India is abysmally low and has fallen further during the liberalisation era, the provision of pulses in the PDS is long overdue and desperately needed. The PDS works with central government, via the Food Corporation of India, being responsible for buying food grains from farmers at MSPs at state-run market yards or mandis. It then allocates the grains to each state. State governments then deliver to ‘ration shops’. In 2024, farm union leaders were still seeking guarantees for a minimum purchase price for crops. Although the government announces support prices for more than 20 crops each year, government agencies buy only rice and wheat at the support level and, even then, in only some states. State agencies buy the two staples at government-fixed minimum support prices to build reserves to run the world’s biggest food welfare programme that entitles more than 800 million Indians to free rice and wheat. Currently, that’s more than half the population who per household will receive five kilos per month of these essential foodstuffs for at least the next four years, which would be denied to them by the ‘free market’. As we have seen throughout the world, corporate plunder under the guise of neoliberal marketisation is no friend of the poor and those in need who rely on state support to exist. If public procurement of a wider range of crops at the MSP were to occur — and MSPs were guaranteed for rice and wheat across all states — it would help address hunger and malnutrition, encourage crop diversification and ease farmer distress. By helping hundreds of millions involved in farming this way, it would give a massive boost to rural spending power and the economy in general. Instead of rolling back the role of the public sector and surrendering the system to what constitutes a transnational billionaire class and its corporations, there is a need to further expand official procurement and public distribution. The RUPE notes, it would cost around 20 per cent of the current handouts (‘incentives’) received by corporations and their super-rich owners, which do not benefit the bulk of the wider population in any way. It is also worth considering that the loans provided to just five large corporations in India were in 2016 equal to the entire farm debt. However, it is clear that the existence of the MSP, the public distribution system and publicly held buffer stocks are an impediment to global agribusiness interests. In the meantime, the current administration is keen to demonstrate to international finance capital and agricapital that it is being tough on farmers and remains steadfast in its willingness to facilitate the pro-corporate agenda. In 2024, after the breakdown in talks between government and farmers’ representatives, the farmers decided to peacefully march to and demonstrate in Delhi. But at the Delhi border, farmers were met with barricades, tear gas and state violence. However, to date, current farmers’ resistance lacks the momentum of the 2020-21 protests. Furthermore, by one means or another, as the following chapters indicate, the central government continues to ignore the key demands of farmers and hand over the sector to global agribusiness and other corporate interests Farmers produce humanities’ most essential need and are not the ‘enemy within’. The spotlight should fall on the ‘enemy beyond’. Instead of depicting farmers as ‘anti-national’, as sections of the media and prominent commentators in India try to, the focus needs to be on challenging those interests that seek to gain from undermining India’s food security and sovereignty and the impoverishment of farmers. The citizens of India have a problem. In what the media like to call ‘the world’s biggest democracy’, there is a serious, proven conflict of interest among officials in the areas of science, agriculture and agricultural research that results in privileging the needs of powerful private interests ahead of farmers and ordinary people. This has been a longstanding concern. In 2013, for instance, prominent campaigner and environmentalist Aruna Rodrigues said: “The Ministry of Agriculture has handed Monsanto and the industry access to our agri-research public institutions, placing them in a position to seriously influence agri-policy in India. You cannot have a conflict of interest larger or more alarming than this one.” In 2020, Kavitha Kuruganti (Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture) stated that the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee had acted more like a servant for Monsanto: there is an ongoing revolving door between crop developers (even patent holders) and regulators, with developers-cum-lobbyists sitting on regulatory bodies. However, the capture of public policymaking space by the private sector is set to accelerate due to a recent spate of memorandums of understanding between state institutions and influential private corporations involved in agriculture and agricultural services, including Bayer and Amazon. As part of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and Amazon (June 2023), farmers will produce for Amazon Fresh stores in India as part of a ‘farm to fork’ supply chain. It will see “critical inputs” in agriculture and “season-based crop plans” in collaboration with Amazon based on “technologies, capacity building and transfer of new knowledge.” This corporate jargon ties in with the much-publicised notion of ‘data-driven agriculture’ centred on cloud-based data information services (which Amazon also offers). In this model, data is to be accessed and controlled by corporates and the farmer will be told how much production is expected, how much rain is anticipated, what type of soil quality there is, what must be produced and what type of genetically engineered seeds and inputs they must purchase and from whom. This amounts to a recolonisation of Indian agriculture, which will eventually involve a handful of data owners (Microsoft, Amazon etc.), input suppliers (Bayer, Corteva, Syngenta etc.) and retail concerns (Amazon and Walmart-Flipkart — both firms already control 60 per cent of India’s e-commerce market) at the heights of the agrifood economy, determining the nature of agriculture and peddling industrial food. Farmers who remain in this AI-driven system (a stated aim is farmerless farms) will be reduced to exploitable labour at the mercy of global conglomerates. This is part of a broader strategy to shift hundreds of millions out of agriculture, ensure India’s food dependence on global finance and foreign corporations and eradicate any semblance of food democracy (or national sovereignty). In addition to the MoU with Amazon, an MoU was signed between the ICAR and Bayer in September 2023. Bayer (it bought Monsanto in 2018), which profits from various environmentally harmful and disease-causing chemicals like glyphosate, signed the MoU to help “develop resource-efficient, climate-resilient solutions for crops, varieties, crop protection, weed and mechanization”, according to the ICAR website. The ICAR is responsible for co-ordinating agricultural education and research in India, and Bayer seems likely to exploit the ICAR’s vast infrastructure and networks to pursue its own commercial plans, including boosting sales of toxic proprietary products. But that’s not all. According to the non-profit GRAIN in its article ‘The corporate agenda behind carbon farming’, Bayer is gaining increasing control over farmers in various countries, dictating exactly how they farm and what inputs they use through its Carbon Program. GRAIN says: “You can see in the evolution of Bayer’s programmes that, for corporations, carbon farming is all about increasing their control within the food system. It’s certainly not about sequestering carbon.” Given the seriousness of what is laid out by GRAIN in its article, India’s citizens and farmers should take heed, especially as the ICAR website states that a focus of the MoU with Bayer will be on developing carbon credit markets. In a letter (July 2004) to Rabindra Padaria, principal scientist at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), and Himanshu Pathak, director-general of the ICAR, Aruna Rodrigues says: “Inking in ICAR’s formal partnership with Bayer (Monsanto) quite simply confirms straightforwardly that the ICAR protects its interest, which is the same as those of Bayer-Monsanto, large chemical/herbicide corporates… the ICAR has ditched its mandate to Indian farmers and farming, which is to promote farmer interests as a priority in an unbiased and objective assessment of what is right and good for Indian farming and food… “ A separate citizens’ letter was also sent to Pathak on the various MoUs that the Indian government has signed with influential private orporations. Hundreds of scientists, farmer leaders, farmers and ordinary citizens signed the letter. It states: “Bayer is a company notorious for its anti-people, anti-nature business products and operations in itself and, furthermore, after its takeover of Monsanto. Its deadly poisons have violated basic human rights of peoples across the world, and it is a company that has always prioritised profits over people and planet.” It goes on to say that it is not clear what the ICAR will learn from Bayer that the well-paid public sector scientists of the institution cannot develop themselves. The letter says entities that have been responsible for causing an economic and environmental crisis in Indian agriculture are being partnered by ICAR for so-called solutions when these entities are only interested in their profits and not sustainability (or any other nomenclature they use). The letter asks that the ICAR suspends the signed MoUs, shares all details in the public domain and desists from signing any more such MoUs without necessary public debate. However, on 19 July 2024, there were reports that the ICAR had signed another MoU, this time with Syngenta for promoting climate resilient agriculture and training programmes. In response, the authors of the letter state that the ICAR has (again) partnered with a corporation that has a track record of anti-nature and anti-people activities, selling toxic products like paraquat, class action suits against its corn seeds and anti-competitive behaviour. It is becoming clear who the ICAR actually serves. Let us return to Aruna Rodrigues and her letter to Rabindra Padaria (IARI) and Himanshu Pathak (ICAR) for additional insight. Rodrigues’ letter focuses on the commercial cultivation of basmati rice varieties tolerant to imazethapyr-based, non-selective herbicides. These chemicals can be liberally sprayed on herbicide tolerant (HT) crops because the crops have been manipulated to withstand the toxic impacts of spraying. The HT varieties of rice have undergone some form of mutagenesis rather than genetic engineering. Mutagenesis has traditionally involved subjecting plant cells to chemical or physical agents (for example, radiation) that cause mutations to the DNA in the hope that a resulting mutation may produce a desirable effect in the plant. This kind of mutation breeding has been used for decades but only affects a minority of the plants on the market. Industry watchdog GMWatch says this risky technology (mutagenesis breeding) in the past managed to escape regulation. So, this HT crop by the mutagenesis route is not defined as ‘genetic engineering’ (the method usually used to create HT crops) and therefore falls outside the purview of current regulations on genetically modified organisms. Although the Supreme Court-appointed Technical Expert Committee (TEC) bars HT crops (a) for being an HT crop and (b) on account of contamination of crops in a centre of genetic diversity, it has been a long-standing aim of biotech companies like Bayer (Monsanto) to get HT crops cultivated in India. Rodrigues asks: “Is it a deliberate decision of the ICAR to use the mutagenesis route to produce HT rice varieties (tolerant to imazethapyr) with the explicit objective to bypass the formal regulation of GE crops/GMOs?” Rodrigues accuses the ICAR of effectively ditching its mandate to Indian farmers, many of whom regard organic farming as their competitive advantage. This step is also a potential threat to India’s export markets, which are based on organic standards, along with the necessary co-surety that India’s foods and farms are not contaminated by herbicides, a consequence of using HT crops. By adding a trait for herbicide tolerance, the ICAR is informed: “ICAR’s action directly impacts this vital issue of contaminating our germ plasm in rice and contravenes a Supreme Court Order of “No Contamination”. Furthermore, our export markets for basmati are in excess of US $5 billion in 2023-24. Your action will also directly impact India’s exports and thereby, impact farmer export potential, incomes and income opportunities that premium prices provide.” Moreover, Rodrigues asserts that the entire mutagenesis process for HT rice must be elaborated, especially when the mutant variety is for the purpose of human consumption. The ICAR is duty-bound to provide, for example, whether a physical or a chemical mutagen was used, the range of doses used and the toxicity for the said material, the herbicide(s) used (a key concern, given the effects of certain herbicides on human health — see below) to test the HT of the basmati rice being used, the concentrations of the herbicides used and the genetic mechanism by which HT rice through mutagenesis has a resistant gene to imazethapyr. While the issue of intellectual property rights for the HT rice varieties using mutagenesis is unclear, the ICAR and IARI have executed a technology transfer agreement of the HT trait for commercial cultivation. In her letter, Rodrigues states that, based on empirical evidence of 35 years of HT crops in the US and Argentina, HT crops are a failed technology: it spawns super weeds, increased herbicide use and no added performance yield. Moreover, for India, HT crops are a perverse use of technology, whether genetic engineering or through mutagenesis, that risks small and marginal farmers’ crops and herbs and plants used in many Ayurvedic medicines because of herbicide drift. It will also uniquely impact the employment of women in weeding. Rodrigues goes on to state (with evidence provided) that in the US overall herbicide use has increased more than tenfold since the introduction of HT Crops (1992-2012 figure). In addition, HT crops are designed for monocultures and completely unsuited to Indian small-holder, multi-crop farming: anything not HT will be destroyed, the resistant crop stands, but everything else dies, including non-target organisms. The herbicides used with HT crops are also a major human health issue. There is a strong link between glyphosate and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. In relation to this, there are more than 100,000 lawsuits winding their way through US Courts. Glyphosate (used in Bayer’s Roundup herbicide) is also an endocrine disruptor and is linked to birth defects. Monsanto and the US Environmental Protection Agency had both known for over 40 years that glyphosate and its formulations cause cancer. Other herbicides used by Bayer include glufosinate (used in its Liberty herbicide), which is acknowledged as more toxic than glyphosate and, like it, is a systemic, broad spectrum, non-selective herbicide. It is a neurotoxin that can cause nerve damage and birth defects and is damaging to most plants that come into contact with it. Glufinosate is banned in Europe and not permitted in India. It has been implicated in brain developmental abnormalities in animal studies and is very persistent in the environment, so it will certainly contaminate water supplies in addition to food where it will be absorbed. Imazethapyr (contained in Bayer’s Adue herbicide) is also a systemic broad-spectrum herbicide and is banned in some countries and not approved for use in the EU. Prof. Jack Heinemann (University of Canterbury in New Zealand) adds that the likes of imazethapyr must be tested for their ability to cause bacterial antibiotic resistance. An important concern given that India’s population has some of the highest levels of antibiotic resistance in the world. Any spread of HT crops would put people at severe risk of resistance and disease. Despite these environmental and health concerns, the herbicide market in India is projected to grow by around 54 per cent in the next five years, from USD 361.85 million in 2024 to USD 558.17 million by 2029. Rodrigues concludes: “In view of the above evidence of serious irreversible harm to health, food and agriculture across several dimensions and contravention of the PP (Precautionary Principle), it is a required scientific response for the ICAR to immediately withdraw HT rice varieties and desist from introducing any HT crop through mutagenesis.” Environmentalist and campaigner Rosemary Mason has been relentlessly exposing the insidious effects of agrochemicals on human health and the environment through a decade-long series of incisive reports. Many of these reports have taken the form of scathing open letters directed at corporations, regulators and officials in the UK and the EU. Mason has never held back in her condemnations of the agrochemical giants. After Bayer’s acquisition of Monsanto in 2018, her focus sharpened on Bayer, scrutinising its troubling history and its actions, not least during one of humanity’s darkest chapters: Nazi Germany. Bayer’s complicity as part of IG Farben, a chemical and pharmaceutical conglomerate notorious for its involvement in war crimes, is well documented. The company was formed in 1925 from a merger of six chemical firms: Agfa, BASF, Bayer, Chemische Fabrik Griesheim-Elektron, Hoechst and Weiler-ter-Meer. Bayer was not merely an observer but an active participant in heinous medical experiments conducted on concentration camp inmates. These experiments involved testing drugs on unwilling subjects, including those at Auschwitz, where prisoners were deliberately infected with diseases to evaluate Bayer’s pharmaceuticals. During World War I, Bayer was involved in the development of chemical weapons, including chlorine and mustard gas. As part of IG Farben, Bayer later contributed to the creation of nerve agents like Tabun, Sarin and Soman. Post-war, Bayer transitioned these chemical developments into pesticides such as parathion, which are neurotoxic. In addition, IG Farben was implicated in the production of Zyklon B, the gas used in concentration camps. Executives from IG Farben were convicted for their roles in war crimes at the Nuremberg Trials. . IG Farben Building, Frankfurt, completed in 1931 and seized by the Allies in 1945 as the headquarters of the Supreme Allied Command. In 2001 it became part of the University of Frankfurt. (Licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0) . Bayer’s leadership was fully aware of these atrocities yet chose profit over ethics, benefiting from the forced labour of concentration camp inmates to produce essential chemicals for the Nazi war machine. The aftermath of World War II saw Bayer and other IG Farben companies face minimal repercussions for their actions. While some executives were tried, they received light sentences or were released early, allowing them to reclaim positions of power within their companies. As for Bayer, things did not stop with the end of the war. The Powerbase website provides a very long list of Bayer’s corporate wrongdoings since 1945, including allegations of corporate bullying, monopolistic practices, the suppression of scientific information, bribery, poisonings, false advertising and abusing workers. More recently, Bayer has inherited a legacy of deception through its acquisition of Monsanto. Both companies have been accused of concealing the health risks associated with glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup and the world’s most used agricultural herbicide. Internal documents reveal a concerted effort to downplay glyphosate’s carcinogenicity while ignoring substantial evidence indicating its dangers to human health. In her numerous reports, Mason has indicated how Bayer shaped regulatory processes to secure product approvals, influencing scientific studies and regulatory decisions while suppressing contrary evidence. The environmental devastation wrought by pesticides is alarming: Mason cites significant declines in biodiversity and poisoned ecosystems that she claims are as a direct consequence of the widespread use of Bayer’s chemicals. Moreover, rising cancer rates in communities exposed to Bayer’s products cannot be ignored, especially increasing cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma linked to glyphosate use in areas heavily treated with these chemicals. Rosemary Mason is not alone in her condemnation of Bayer. For instance, journalist Carey Gillam has written extensively about Bayer-Monsanto’s practices, particularly in relation to glyphosate and its health impacts in the book ‘Whitewash: The Story of a Weed Killer, Cancer, and the Corruption of Science’. Gillam says: “US Roundup litigation began in 2015 after the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen. Internal Monsanto documents dating back decades show that the company was aware of scientific research linking its weed killer to cancer but instead of warning consumers, the company worked to suppress the information and manipulate scientific literature.” Gillam has shown that, over the years, Monsanto mounted a deceitful defence of its health- and environment-damaging Roundup and its genetically modified crops, and it orchestrated toxic smear campaigns against anyone — scientist or campaigner — who threatened its interests. With that in mind, it comes as no surprise that a US-Based PR firm has created a watchlist, profiling activists, scientists and journalists who are critical of pesticide use and genetically modified organisms, as recently revealed in documents obtained by the investigative newsroom Lighthouse Reports. As a result of a year-long investigation, Lighthouse Reports argues that this operation seeks to cast pesticide critics, environmental scientists or campaigners as an anti-science “protest industry” and used US government money to do so. The watchlist is the brainchild of Jay Byrne, a former communications executive at Monsanto, and his reputation management firm v-Fluence. It comprises profiles (including personal information) on hundreds of scientists, campaigners and writers. These profiles have been published on a private social network, which grants privileged access to 1,000 people comprising a who’s-who of the agrochemical industry, alongside government officials from multiple countries. The US government funded v-Fluence as part of its programme to promote genetically modified organisms in Africa and Asia, including “enhanced monitoring” of critics of “modern agriculture approaches” — and to build the network. Watchlists and hitlists aside, to further its interests, the agrochemical giants pour huge resources into lobbying that seeks to shape narratives, deceive and coerce rather than engage with genuine public health and environmental concerns. The research and campaign group Corporate Europe Observatory (CEO) recently took a deep dive into Bayer’s disturbing “toxic trail” of lobbying as the company strives to maintain its huge slice of the seed and pesticides markets, fight off regulatory challenges to its toxic products, limit legal liability and exercise political influence. CEO’s report ‘Bayer’s Toxic Trails: Market Power, Monopolies and the Global Lobbying of an Agrochemicals Giant’ notes that Bayer spent between €7 million and €8 million in 2023 on EU lobbying, the biggest sum declared by any individual chemical company and the highest amount ever spent by Bayer on EU lobbying. According to CEO, Bayer’s current top lobbying priority in Europe is to derail the original ambitions of the European Green Deal and to prevent any of the company’s firmly established interests (chemicals and pesticides) from being touched. One of the central goals of this deal is to reduce the use and risk of chemical pesticides by 50 per cent by 2030 through the EU’s Farm to Fork strategy. This target aims to address both environmental and public health concerns associated with pesticide use in agriculture. Bayer’s lobby spend in the US has also risen considerably over the past few years, spending $7.5 million in 2023 alone, some of which is aimed at securing changes in the law to prevent further litigation cases and more hefty payouts to people suffering from conditions due to glyphosate exposure. To date, the company has reportedly paid out approximately $11 billion to settle nearly 100,000 lawsuits stemming from claims that Roundup causes cancer, particularly non-Hodgkin lymphoma. CEO states: “Bayer’s lobby tactics continue to capture public policymaking and in doing so hollow out democracy. A perverse symbiosis between corporate lobby groups and decision-makers has been actively created through its economic weight and large investments in many corners of the world, and this consistently leads to crucial decisions being made in favour of industry profits, rather than public interest.” It concludes that: “Around the world, Bayer’s modus operandi is not to work in the public interest but rather to capture public policy to serve its private interests and dividends of its shareholders, all while ignoring the public health and environmental impact of its activities.” So, why would a government want to do a deal with the devil? As stated in the previous chapter, that is precisely what the government of India seems to have done when it signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Bayer in September 2023. Bayer signed the MoU with the Indian Council for Agricultural Research (ICAR), which is responsible for co-ordinating agricultural education and research in India. Bayer’s aim first and foremost seems to be to exploit the ICAR’s vast infrastructure and networks to pursue its own commercial plans, including boosting sales of toxic proprietary products and the introduction of genetically modified food crops into India. These crops would be reliant on Bayer’s agrochemicals. Attempts to get genetically modified food crops into India’s fields is being done by all means necessary, as explained in Aruna Rodrigues insightful online article Waltzing with Bayer Makes The Indian Council of Agricultural Research Blind: India Ditches Mandate to Farmers and Uses Mutagenesis to Drive Toxic HT Crops Into India. That article explains that mutagenetic techniques are being used to bypass existing regulatory procedures in relation to genetically modified organisms, despite a recent Supreme Court directive for the government to formulate a national policy framework on genetically modified crops based on a democratic consultative process. Telangana State Seed Development Corporation chairman S Anvesh Reddy recently stated that farmers want a bio-safety policy and not a promotional policy for genetically modified crops. However, they are in danger of getting the latter. Prominent campaigner Kavitha Kuruganti has warned that the Ministry of Agriculture may bypass the democratic consultative processes recommended by the Supreme Court. It has already appointed a panel of ‘experts’ to draft the policy and information about it is being kept secret. On X (formerly Twitter), agricultural policy specialist Devinder Sharma stated: “How can a policy be framed for GM crops when there is still no consensus on the need for these crops? Despite heavy lobbying by industry, most countries oppose it.” How can this be? Let us turn to Aruna Rodrigues: “Our regulatory bodies have been captured by the biotech and agrichemical industries… It is breathtaking; all pretence is gone. We have a cancer that is metastasising vertically and horizontally throughout the entire regulatory body.” The need for genetically modified food crops is based on unsound logic, and, in general, neither farmers nor the public want them (see the online article Challenging the Flawed Premise Behind Pushing GMOs into Indian Agriculture). Moreover, the failure of Bt cotton in the country, India’s only officially approved genetically modified crop (see The Failure of GMO Cotton In India on resilience.org), should serve as a warning. In the meantime, farmers’ leaders from 18 states in India have resolved to oppose genetically modified crops. They say genetically modified organisms in agriculture are harmful to human and animal health, the environment, farmers’ livelihoods and trade and are based on failed promises. For some critics, if one firm tops a league table for anti-people, anti-nature business practices, it is Bayer (although there are many other worthy candidates). Nevertheless, as previously stated, the Indian Council for Agricultural Research (ICAR) signed a memorandum of understanding with Bayer in September 2023. Bayer’s approach to agricultural development involves promoting a model of industrial agriculture dependent on corporate products, including its toxic chemicals and genetically modified crops, and advocating for precision, data-driven agriculture that relies heavily on its proprietary technologies and software. Simon Wiebusch, Country Divisional Head of Crop Science for Bayer South Asia, recently stated that India cannot become a ‘developed nation’ with ‘backward’ agriculture. He believes India’s agriculture sector must modernise for the country to achieve developed nation status by 2047. Bayer’s vision for agriculture in India includes prioritising and fast-tracking approvals for its new products, introducing genetically modified food crops, addressing labour shortages (for weeding) by increasingly focusing on herbicides and developing herbicides for specific crops like paddy, wheat, sugarcane and maize. Government institutions like the ICAR seem likely to allow Bayer to leverage the agency’s infrastructure and networks to pursue its commercial plans. Wiebusch’s comments have received much media coverage. There is a tendency for journalists and media outlets to accept statements made by people in top corporate jobs as pearls of wisdom never to be critically questioned, especially in India when there is talk of the country achieving the gold standard in the eyes of some: ‘developed status’. But people like Wiebusch are hardly objective. They are not soothsayers who have an unbiased view of the world and its future. Bayer has a view of what agriculture should look like and is gaining increasing control of farmers in various countries in terms of having a direct influence on how they farm and what inputs they use. Its digital platforms are intended to be one-stop shops for carbon credits, seeds, pesticides and fertilisers and agronomic advice, all supplied by the company, which gets the added benefit of control over the agronomic and financial data harvested from farms. As for carbon credits, the non-profit GRAIN argues that, like digital platforms per se, carbon trading is about consolidating control within the food system and is certainly not about sequestering carbon. So, what does Wiebusch mean when he talks about modernisation of a backward agriculture in India? All of what is set out above and more. Like Wiebusch, corporate lobbyists often refer to ‘modern agriculture’. Instead, we should really be advocating for a system that produces healthy food for all while sustaining farming communities and livelihoods. That’s because the term ‘modern agriculture’ is deliberately deceptive: it means a system dependent on proprietary inputs and integrated with corporate global supply chains. Anything other is defined as ‘backward’. According to Bayer, Wiebusch is a star player who can drive market share and create business value for the company. On the Bayer India website it says: “Simon’s key strengths include unlocking business growth, redefining distribution strategies, driving change management and building diverse teams that drive market share and create business value.” Stripped of the corporate jargon and any talk of ‘helping’ India, the goal is to secure control of the sector and ensure corporate dependency. That is what is really meant by creating business value and driving market share. India has achieved self-sufficiency in food grains and has ensured there is enough food (in terms of calories) available to feed its entire population. It is the world’s largest producer of milk, pulses and millets and the second-largest producer of rice, wheat, sugarcane, groundnuts, vegetables, fruit and cotton. In 2014, environmental scientist Viva Kermani stated that India has been self-sufficient in food staples for over a decade and more than that for cereals. She noted that the country: “… grows about 100 million tons (mt) of rice, 95 mt of wheat, 170 mt of vegetables, 85 mt of fruit, 40 mt of coarse cereals and 18 mt of pulses (refer to the Economic Survey for the data). These totals ensure that our farmers grow enough to feed all Indians well with food staples. We have 66 mt of grain, two-and-a-half times the required buffer stock (on January 1, 2013).” She concluded: “The country has reached this stage through, first and foremost, the knowledge and skill of our farmers who have bred and saved seed themselves and exchanged their seed in ways that made our fields so biodiverse.” Kermani also observed that farmers have legitimate claims to being scientists, innovators, natural resource stewards, seed savers and hybridisation experts. However, they have too often been reduced to becoming recipients of technical fixes and consumers of the poisonous products of a growing agricultural inputs industry. It is clear that Bayer needs India for its corporate growth strategy, but who needs Bayer? Bhaskar Save certainly did not on his impressively bountiful organic farm in Gujarat. In 2006, he described in an eight-page open letter (along with six annexures) to M S Swaminathan (widely regarded as the father of the Green Revolution in India) how the type of chemical-intensive agriculture that Bayer promotes and the urban-centric model of development favoured by the government has had devastating environmental economic and social consequences for India. Save offered agroecological alternatives to address the problems, including solutions to boost farmer incomes and rural communities, cultivate a wider range of nutrient-dense crops, build soil fertility, improve water management, enhance on-farm ecology and increase biodiversity. The prominent environmentalist Vandana Shiva recently posted on X: “India’s agriculture was sustained over 10,000 years because it was based on nature’s laws of diversity, recycling, regeneration & circularity. Albert Howard spread organic farming worldwide learning from Indian peasants. Working with nature is sophistication, not backwardness. “Bayer calling India’s agriculture backward is a new toxic colonisation. Bayer/Monsanto, the poison cartel whose roots are in war, has driven biodiversity to extinction with monocultures, spread cancers with glyphosate & herbicides, destroyed democracy.” It seems that the ‘poor’ must be helped out of their awful ‘backwardness’ by the West and its powerful corporations and billionaire ‘philanthropists’ like Bill Gates. What some might regard as ‘backward’ stems from an ethnocentric ideology, which is used to legitimise the destruction of communities and economies that were once locally based and self-sufficient. Bayer promotes a corporate expansionist ‘development’ agenda that is self-sustaining and can be described as anything but development (see the online article Resisting Genetically Mutilated Food and the Eco-Modern Nightmare). Companies like Bayer present their technologies and products as fixes for the problems created by the model of ‘growth’ and ‘development’ they promote. ‘Scientific innovation’ is touted as the answer. The proposed solutions often create new problems or worsen existing ones. This leads to a cycle of dependency on corporate products and technologies. Monsanto’s failed Bt cotton in India being a case in point. Problems created by corporate-led development become opportunities for further corporate inputs and the commodification of knowledge and further ‘expert’ interventions. The primary motivation is financial gain rather than genuine societal improvement. Corporate-driven ‘development’ is a misnomer, especially in agriculture, as it often leads to regression in terms of health, environmental sustainability and rural community resilience, while perpetuating a cycle of problems and ‘solutions’ that primarily benefit large corporations. But the type of agroecological solutions presented by the likes of Bhaskar Save run counter to Bayer’s aims of more pesticides, more genetically modified organisms, more control and corporate consolidation. For example, as previously mentioned, the industry seeks to derail the EU’s farm to fork strategy (which involves a dramatic reduction in agrochemical use), and Bayer spends record amounts to shape policies to its advantage, courtesy of its entrenched lobbying networks. Of course, Bayer presents its neocolonial aspirations in terms of helping backward Indian farmers. A good old dose of Western saviourism. To promote its model, Bayer must appear to offer practical solutions. It uses the narrative of climate emergency to promote a Ponzi carbon trading scheme that is resulting in land displacement across the world. And Bayer says that labour shortages for manual weeding in Indian agriculture are a significant challenge, so the rollout of toxic herbicides like glyphosate are a necessity. But there are several approaches to address this issue beyond relying on herbicides like glyphosate (it will kill all plants that do not have the herbicide tolerant trait), which is wholly unsuitable for a nation comprising so many small farms cultivating a diverse range of crops. Mechanical weeding using animal-drawn or tractor-powered implements for larger farms is one solution, and there are several agronomic techniques that can help suppress weeds and reduce labour needs: crop rotation disrupts weed lifecycles, higher planting densities shade out weeds, proper fertilisation gives crops a competitive advantage and use of cover crops and mulches can suppress weed growth. Even here, however, there are cynical attempts to get farmers to change their cultivation methods (with no tangible financial benefits) and move away from traditional systems. In the article The Ox Fall Down: Path Breaking and Treadmills in Indian Cotton Agriculture, for instance, we see farmers being nudged away from traditional planting methods and pushed towards a method inconducive to oxen ploughing but very conducive for herbicide-dependent weed management. That article notes the huge growth potential for herbicides in India, something companies like Bayer are keen to capitalise on. Wiebusch talks of India reaching ‘developed status’. But what does the type of ‘development’ he proposes entail? We need only look around us for the answer: decision-making centralised in the hands of government and corporate entities, traditional local governance structures weakened and standardised, top-down policies and corporate consolidation through mergers and acquisitions with local independent enterprises struggling to compete. Consolidated corporations have greater lobbying power to shape regulations in their favour, further entrenching their market position. In other words, political centralisation and corporate consolidation are often intertwined. Centralised political structures tend to align with the interests of large, consolidated corporations, and both centralised governments and large corporations exert greater control over resources. This dual process has led to reduced economic diversity and resilience, weakened local communities and traditions, increased vulnerability to systemic shocks and diminished democratic participation. ‘Developed status’ also means accelerated urbanisation, land amalgamations for industrial-scale farming and depopulation of the countryside. And it means farmers being encouraged to grow cash crops for export based on trade policies that work in favour of big landowners and heavily subsidised Western agriculture. As mentioned earlier, it has been estimated that between 2016 and 2030, globally, urban areas will have tripled in size, expanding into cropland and undermining the productivity of agricultural systems. Around 60 per cent of the world’s cropland lies on the outskirts of cities. This land is, on average, twice as productive as land elsewhere on the globe. As cities expand, millions of small-scale farmers are displaced. These farmers produce the majority of food in the Global South and are key to global food security. A combination of urbanisation and policies deliberately designed to displace the food-producing peasantry will serve to boost the corporate takeover of India’s agrifood sector. This is what Bayer calls ‘development’. But none of this is inevitable. Many of us know what the response should be: prioritising sustainable, locally appropriate solutions and restoring food sovereignty and the economic vibrancy of rural communities; focusing on holistic human well-being rather than narrow economic metrics of ‘growth’; preserving traditional knowledge that underpins highly productive farming practices for the benefit of farmers, consumer health and the environment; and empowering communities through localism and decentralisation rather than creating state-corporate dependency. Such solutions are markedly different from those characterised by rural population displacement, the subjugation of peoples and nature, nutrient-poor diets, degraded on-farm and off-farm ecosystems and corporate consolidation. There are alternative visions for the future, alternative visions of human development. But these do not boost corporate margins or control and do not fit the hegemonic narrative of what passes for ‘development’. However, it is concerning that what Bayer advocates is regarded as the common sense of the age. The ultimate coup d’état by the transnational agribusiness conglomerates is that state officials, scientists and journalists take as given that profit-driven Fortune 500 corporations have a legitimate claim to be custodians of natural assets. These corporations have convinced so many that they have the ultimate legitimacy to own, control and manage what is essentially humanity’s commonwealth. Water, food, soil, land and agriculture have been handed over to powerful transnational corporations to milk for profit as though they are serving the needs of humanity. Corporations which promote industrial agriculture have embedded themselves deeply within the policy-making machinery on both national and international levels. The ultimate intertwining of political centralisation and corporate consolidation. It should be clear by now that the issues raised in this book transcend a narrow analysis of the food system. There has been much discussion about social control, technocracy and even transhumanism. And this chapter is no different. It is essential to explore broader power dynamics in order to gain a clearer understanding of the global food regime and the corporations and interests behind it. Power is increasingly concentrated in the hands of an elite that wields its considerable wealth, influence and technological advancements to dominate both resources and populations, profoundly shaping the fabric of our lives. In recent years, we have seen the nudging (manipulating) of populations to accept a ‘new normal’ based on, among other things, a climate emergency narrative, pandemic preparedness tyranny, unaccountable AI, synthetic ‘food’ and farmerless farms. Whether it involves a ‘food transition’, an ‘energy transition’, 15-minute cities or some other benign-sounding term, all this is to be determined by a supranational state-corporate ‘stakeholder’ elite with ordinary people sidelined in the process. An undemocratic agenda designed to place restrictions on individual liberty, marking a dramatic shift towards authoritarianism. In the 1980s, to help legitimise the deregulation-privatisation neoliberal globalisation agenda, government and media instigated an ideological onslaught on populations, driving home the primacy of ‘free enterprise’, individual rights and responsibility and emphasising a shift away from the role of the state, trade unions and the collective in society. We are currently seeing another ideological shift: individual rights and freedoms are said to undermine the wider needs of society and the planet; in a stark turnaround, personal freedom is now said to pose a threat to national security, public health or the climate. As in the 1980s, this messaging is being driven by an economic impulse. This time, the collapsing neoliberal project. In the UK, poverty is increasing, food banks are now a necessary part of life for millions. Indeed, the poorest families are enduring a ‘frightening’ collapse in living standards, resulting in life-changing and life-limiting poverty. In the US, it was reported in 2023 that around 30 million low-income people are on the edge of a ‘hunger cliff’ as a portion of their federal food assistance is taken away. In 2021, it was estimated that one in eight children were going hungry in the US. In April 2023, it was reported that small businesses were filing for bankruptcy in the US at a record rate. Image is from the Bank of England website The Bank of England’s chief economist, Huw Pill, says that people should ‘accept’ being poorer. This is similar to the response of Rob Kapito, co-founder of the world’s biggest asset management firm, BlackRock. In 2022, the unimaginably rich and entitled Kapito said that a “very entitled” generation of (ordinary working) people who have never had to sacrifice would soon have to face shortages for the first time in their lives. While business as usual prevails in Kapito’s world of privilege and that of major arms, energy, pharmaceuticals and food companies, whose megarich owners continue to rake in massive profits, Kapito and Pill tell ordinary people to get used to poverty and the ‘new normal’ as if we are ‘all in it together’ — billionaires and working class alike. They conveniently used COVID and the situation in Ukraine as cover for the collapsing neoliberalism. But this is part of the hegemonic agenda that seeks to ensure that the establishment’s world view is the accepted cultural norm. And anyone who challenges this world view — whether it involves, for instance, questioning climate alarmism, the ‘new normal’, the nature of the economic crisis, the mainstream COVID narrative or the official stance on Ukraine and Russia — is regarded as a spreader of misinformation and the ‘enemy within’. If we turn to New Zealand, we could see this in action during and after the COVID event. The country’s former prime minister Jacinda Ardern grabbed the global limelight a few years ago, making headlines by stating she wanted to put ‘kindness’ into politics. In 2019, Foreign Policy, a publication closely associated with the Atlantic Council and the US State Department, published the article ‘The Kindness Quotient’, a glowing promotion of Ardern. The strategic marketing of Ardern in various publications focused on her likeability, pro-environment stance, compassionate values and collaborative nature. To further appeal to liberal sentiments, she was said to represent everything Trump is not. Ardern belongs to a set of global leaders who were groomed for their positions through the World Economic Forum (WEF) Young Global Leaders Programme. Yes, that WEF — the elitist organisation where hard-nose billionaires and their handmaidens gather to set out policies aligned with powerful business interests. The charm offensive that Ardern’s promoters undertook was an investment. She delivered on COVID by implementing lockdowns and restrictions without question. Arden stated in her speech to the UN in September 2022: “As leaders, we are rightly concerned that even the most light-touch approaches to disinformation could be misinterpreted as hostile to values of free speech that we value so highly.” She went on to say: “How do you tackle climate change if people believe it does not exist? How do you ensure the human rights of others are upheld as they are subjected to hateful and dangerous ideology.” She continued by saying free speech (that the authorities disagree with) can be a weapon of war. During COVID, Ardern urged citizens to trust the government and its agencies for all information and stated: “Otherwise, dismiss anything else. We will continue to be your single source of truth.” Throughout that period, in the US, Fauci presented himself as ‘the science’. In New Zealand, Ardern’s government was ‘the truth’. It was similar in countries across the world. Different figures but the same approach. When anyone in power or any institution lays claim to ‘the truth’, history shows we are on a slippery slope to silencing thought and dissent that we disagree with. Like other political leaders, during COVID, Ardern clamped down on civil liberties with the full force of state violence on hand to ensure compliance with ‘the truth’. Clearly, Ardern was not alone here. Trudeau, the Biden administration and others have continued to display Orwellian undertones as they spoke of the need to challenge ‘misinformation’ and those who question ‘the truth’. The thin end of a very wide authoritarian wedge. It seems, especially post-COVID, critical analysis and open debate are fine as long as those involved keep within the framework of what is deemed supportive of official narratives. We are often urged to ‘trust the science’ and accept that the ‘science is decided’ on various issues. We heard this on the COVID issue, when we were told governments are ‘following the science’, while they and the big tech companies censored world-renowned scientists and opposing views and opinions. In ‘following the science’, conflicts of interest were rife and notions of objectivity, open disclosure and organised scepticism — core values of scientific endeavour — were trampled on. Those who questioned the COVID narrative were smeared, shut down and censored, the playbook of big agribusiness — manipulating science, smearing critics, derailing policies that threaten its interests and claiming that ‘the science is decided’ on genetically modified organisms — and authoritarian governments. Is anyone who questions and wants a more open debate on climate change or whether such change is occurring as stated or will lead to ‘extinction’ to be charged with disseminating misinformation? Is questioning the orthodoxy of the zero-carbon policy agenda to be shut down and those who challenge it to be labelled ‘extremists’. Ardern asked: “How do you tackle climate change if people believe it does not exist?” But it is also pertinent to ask: How do you tackle it if you accept it exists? Even if we accept humanity is in trouble and facing a genuine climate emergency, people should at least be able to question the current ‘green’ agenda based on a ‘stakeholder capitalism’ strategy (governments and others facilitating the needs of private capital) that has co-opted genuine concerns about the environment to pursue new multi-billion-dollar global investment opportunities (described in the 2020 report Nature for Sale by Friends of the Earth). If you read that report, you might conclude that we are witnessing a type of green imperialism that is using genuine concerns about the environment to pursue a familiar agenda of extractivism, colonisation and commodification. The same old mindset, greenwashed and rolled out for public consumption. Ardern’s utterances on the dangers of free speech, the singularity of ‘truth’ and the implicit shift towards authoritarianism must be viewed within the context of managing an economic crisis. What she was saying revealed how the financial and political elites based on Wall Street, in Washington and in the City of London were thinking. The authorities fear blowback in terms of mass dissent and uprisings. A few years ago, Liz Truss, then UK prime minister, wanted to place ‘legal curbs’ on striking trade unions. There is also the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts (PCSC) Act 2022, which may undermine the right to protest. It therefore comes as no surprise that, today, individual rights and free speech are under threat. The ultimate control mechanism would be linking central bank digital currencies to personal carbon footprints (including eating habits), spending and dissent in an age of economic turmoil. Trudeau might have given the game away on that when he hit protesting truckers where it hurt most — restricting access to bank accounts. How long before ‘misinformation’ and challenging ‘the truth’ becomes thought crime and — as Jacinda Ardern might put it — ‘cruel to be kind’ actions are taken against those who challenge dominant state-corporate narratives? Well, not long because we have already witnessed it during the last few years. A doubling down since COVID. Tyranny is the type of ‘kindness’ we don’t need. The term ‘enemy within’ was popularised by Margaret Thatcher during the UK miners’ strike in 1984-85 to describe the striking miners. But it is a notion with which Britain’s rulers have regarded protest movements and uprisings down the centuries. From the Peasants’ Revolt in 1381 to the Levellers and Diggers (who are discussed in the final chapter) in the 17th century, it is a concept associated with anyone or any group that challenges the existing social order and the interests of the ruling class. John Ball, a radical priest, addressed the Peasants’ Revolt rebels with the following words: “Good friends, matters cannot go well in England until all things be held in common; when there shall be neither vassals nor lords; when the lords shall be no more masters than ourselves.” The revolt was suppressed. John Ball was captured and hung, drawn and quartered. Part of the blood-soaked history of the British ruling class. Later on, the 17th-century Diggers’ movement wanted to create small, egalitarian rural communities and farm on common land that had been privatised by enclosures. The 1975 song ‘The world Turned Upside Down’ by Leon Rosselson commemorates the Diggers. His lyrics describe the aims and plight of the movement. In Rosselson’s words, the Diggers were dispossessed via theft and murder but reclaimed what was theirs only to be violently put down. Little surprise then that, in the 1980s, Margaret Thatcher used the full force of state machinery to defeat the country’s most powerful trade union, the shock troops of the labour movement, the National Union of Mineworkers — ‘the enemy within’. She needed to do this to open the gates for capital to profit from the subsequent deindustrialisation of much of the UK and the dismantling of large parts of the welfare state. And the result? A hollowed-out, debt-bloated economy, the destruction of the social fabric of entire communities and the great financial Ponzi scheme — the ‘miracle’ of deregulated finance — that now teeters on the brink of collapse, leading the likes of Kapito and Pill to tell the public to get ready to become poor. And now, in 2024, the latest version of the ‘enemy within’ is anyone who disseminates ‘misinformation’ — anything that challenges the official state-corporate narrative. So, this time, one goal is to have a fully controlled (censored) internet. For instance, US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) awarded Accrete a contract for Argus to detect disinformation threats from social media. Argus is AI software that analyses social media data to predict emergent narratives and generate intelligence reports at a speed and scale to help neutralise viral disinformation threats. Accrete AI is a leading dual-use enterprise AI company. It deployed its AI Argus software for open-source threat detection with the US Department of Defense in 2022. In a press release, Prashant Bhuyan, founder and CEO of Accrete, boasted: “Social media is widely recognised as an unregulated environment where adversaries routinely exploit reasoning vulnerabilities and manipulate behaviour through the intentional spread of disinformation. USSOCOM is at the tip of the spear in recognising the critical need to identify and analytically predict social media narratives at an embryonic stage before those narratives evolve and gain traction. Accrete is proud to support USSOCOM’s mission.” ‍This is about predicting wrong think on social media. But control over the internet is just part of a wider programme of establishment domination, surveillance and dealing with protest and dissent. The online article How the Government Weaponizes Surveillance to Silence Its Critics notes that, on any given day, the average person in the US is monitored, spied on and tracked in more than 20 different ways. The authors of the article ask us to consider some of the ways the US government is weaponising its surveillance technologies to flag citizens as a threat to national security, whether or not they have done anything wrong — from flagging citizens as a danger based on their feelings, phone and movements to their spending activities, social media activities, political views and correspondence. The elite has determined that the existential threat is you. The article Costs of War: Peterloo, written by UK Veterans for Peace member Aly Renwick, details the history of the brutal suppression of protesters by Britain’s rulers. He also strips away any notion that some may have of a benign, present-day ruling elite with democratic leanings. The leopard has not changed its spots. As we saw during COVID, the thinking is that hard-won rights must be curtailed, freedom of association is reckless, free thinking is dangerous, dissent is to be stamped on, impartial science is a threat and free speech is deadly. Government is ‘the truth’, Fauci (or some similar figure) is ‘the science’ and censorship is for your own good. None of this was justified. It only begins to make sense if we regard the COVID restrictions in terms of trying to deal with an economic crisis by closing down the global economy under cover of a public health crisis. The economic crisis is making many people poorer, so they must be controlled, monitored and subjugated. The transitions mentioned at the start of this chapter along with the surveillance agenda (together known as the ‘Great Reset’) are being accelerated at this time of economic crisis when countless millions across the West are being impoverished. The collapsing US-led financial system is resulting in an interrelated global debt, inflation and ‘austerity’ crisis and the biggest transfer of wealth to the rich in history. Integral to this is the ‘food transition’ and the ‘climate emergency’ narrative, an intertwined commentary that has been carefully constructed and promoted (see the work of investigative journalist Cory Morningstar), and net-zero ideology tied to carbon farming and carbon trading. The ‘food transition’ involves locking farmers (at least those farmers who will remain in farming) further into a corporate-controlled agriculture that extracts wealth and serves the market needs of global corporations, carbon trading Ponzi schemes and institutional investors and speculators with no connection to farming who regard agriculture, food commodities and agricultural land as mere financial assets. These farmers will be reduced to corporate profit-extracting agents who bear all of the risks. This predatory commercialisation of the countryside attempts to use flawed premises and climate alarmism to legitimise the roll-out of technologies to supposedly deliver us all from climate breakdown and Malthusian catastrophe. Meanwhile, a wealthy elite increasingly funds science, determines what should be studied, how it should be studied and how the findings are disseminated and how the technology produced is to be used. This elite has the power to shut down genuine debate and to smear and censor others who question the dominant narrative. The prevailing thinking is that the problems humanity face are to be solved through technical innovation determined by plutocrats and consolidated corporate power. This haughty mindset (or outright arrogance) leads to and is symptomatic of an authoritarianism that seeks to impose a range of technologies on humanity with no democratic oversight. This includes self-transmitting vaccines, the genetic engineering of plants and humans, synthetic food, geoengineering and transhumanism. And in India, as we have seen, it involves the imposition of policies in agriculture that, too, also lack any form of democratic oversight or debate. During the farmers’ protest in 2020-21, influential media and commentators wasted no time in attempting to portray farmers as ‘anti-national’ and the ‘enemy within’. What we see is a misguided eco-modernist paradigm that concentrates power and privileges techno-scientific expertise (a form of technocratic exceptionalism). At the same time, historical power relations (often rooted in agriculture and colonialism) and their legacies within and between societies across the world are conveniently ignored and depoliticised. Technology is not the cure-all for the destructive impacts of poverty, inequality, dispossession, imperialism or class exploitation. When it comes to the technologies and policies being rolled out in the agriculture sector, these phenomena will be reinforced and further entrenched — and that includes illness and poor health, which have markedly increased as a result of the modern food we eat and the agrochemicals and practices already used by the corporations pushing for the ‘food transition’. However, that then opens up other money-spinning techno-fix opportunities in the life sciences sector for investors like BlackRock that invest in both agriculture and pharmaceuticals. But in a neoliberal privatised economy that has often facilitated the rise of members of the controlling wealthy elite, it is reasonable to assume that its members possess certain assumptions of how the world works and should continue to work: a world based on deregulation with limited oversight and the hegemony of private capital and a world led by private individuals like Bill Gates who think they know best. Whether through, for instance, the patenting of life forms, carbon trading, entrenching market (corporate) dependency or land investments, their eco-modern policies serve as cover for generating and amassing further wealth and for cementing their control. It should come as little surprise that powerful people who have contempt for democratic principles (and by implication, ordinary people) believe they have some divine right to undermine food security, close down debate, enrich themselves further courtesy of their technologies and policies and gamble with humanity’s future. But the powers that be fear that the masses might once again pick up their pitchforks and revolt. They are adamant that the peasants must know their place. However, the flame of protest and dissent from centuries past still inspires and burns bright. Economist Prof Michael Hudson stated in 2014: “It’s by agriculture and control of the food supply that American diplomacy has been able to control most of the Third World. The World Bank’s geopolitical lending strategy has been to turn countries into food deficit areas by convincing them to grow cash crops — plantation export crops — not to feed themselves with their own food crops.” In 2019, Hudson described how debt, sanctions and the US-controlled international monetary system had backed Venezuelan president Maduro into a corner. Venezuela had become an oil monoculture, with revenue having been spent largely on importing food and other necessities, which it could have produced itself. In this respect, Word Trade Organization (WTO) policies and directives, debt and US-supported geopolitical lending strategies have compelled many countries in the Global South to eradicate food self-sufficiency and undermine their own food security. The control of global agriculture has been a tentacle of US capitalism’s geopolitical strategy. The Green Revolution was exported courtesy of oil-rich interests, and poorer nations adopted Western agri-capital’s chemical- and oil-dependent model of agriculture that required loans for inputs and related infrastructure development. It entailed trapping nations into a globalised system of debt bondage, rigged trade relations and a system vulnerable to oil price shocks (this was touched on in the final chapter of Sickening Profits). In his book The Unsettling of America (1977), Wendell Berry criticises the US Department of Agriculture for adopting a doctrine that treats food as an instrument of foreign political and economic speculation. Berry argues that treating food as a weapon ultimately serves the interests of large agribusiness corporations rather than farmers or consumers. He sees the weaponisation of food as part of a larger problem where agriculture is divorced from its cultural and ecological roots, leading to numerous negative consequences. Berry’s book discusses how modern agriculture has fostered a disconnect between people and the land. He laments that farming has been reduced to a mere business venture rather than a way of life that nurtures community and culture. A business venture and a geopolitical weapon. Something not lost on environmentalist Vandana Shiva who does not hesitate to label agrochemical companies as a poison cartel. She emphasises that this designation stems not only from the harmful effects of its chemicals on the food system but also from the historical connections of corporations like Bayer and BASF to warfare and chemical weapons. These companies have roots in producing toxic substances used during conflicts, including World War I and II, where they manufactured chemical agents such as chlorine gas and Zyklon B, the latter infamously used in Nazi gas chambers. These practices reflect a broader underlining (historical) pattern of exploitation and violence in the food system that undermines both human health and ecological integrity. Major agribusiness companies are deeply embedded in supranational policymaking machinery that allows them to draw up policies to serve their own interests. For instance, Monsanto played a key part in drafting the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights to create seed monopolies, and the global food processing industry (Cargill) had a leading role in shaping the WTO Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures. The powerful agribusiness lobby has secured privileged access to policy makers to ensure its model of agriculture prevails. And those same companies also profit from war and sovereign debt traps to gain access to markets (see, for instance, Sowing the Seeds of Famine in Ethiopia by Michel Chossudovsky). Hit lists, the corruption of science, profiteering and the infiltration of regulatory bodies aside (the list could go on), food cultivation — an endeavour that at its core seeks to nourish and sustain life — has been hijacked and weaponised to coerce, control and suck away life from nature and people. And Bayer talks about ‘backwardness’, as if any of the above is progressive. But few illusions are as pervasive and pernicious as the ideology of ‘progress’ and ‘development’ that hides behind corporate lobbyist soundbites about agribusiness and its money-spinning inputs being needed to prevent mass starvation. This ideology, propped up by the twin pillars of techno-solutionism and technocracy has become the unquestioned truth of the age, a secular religion that promises salvation through the relentless march of technology and the wisdom of experts. Writer Paul Cudenec says that ‘development’: “… is the destruction of nature, now seen as a mere resource to be used for development or as an empty undeveloped space in which development could, should and, ultimately, must take place. It is the destruction of natural human communities, whose self-sufficiency gets in the way of the advance of development, and of authentic human culture and traditional values, which are incompatible with the dogma and domination of development.” Cudenec argues that those behind ‘development’ have been destroying everything of real value in our natural world and our human societies in the pursuit of personal wealth and power. Moreover, they have concealed this crime behind all the positive-sounding rhetoric associated with development on every level. Indeed, the notion that human society is on an inevitable trajectory of improvement, driven by technological innovation and guided by technocratic elites, is perhaps the most insidious myth of our time. This narrative of perpetual progress is a convenient smokescreen, obscuring the stark realities of environmental degradation, social inequality and spiritual impoverishment that characterise so-called advanced civilisation. At the heart of this ideology lies the naive belief in techno-solutionism — the misguided faith that every problem, no matter how complex or deeply rooted in social and political structures, can be solved with the right technological fix. This reductionist worldview reduces the human experience to a series of technical challenges, eagerly awaiting the next groundbreaking innovation to set things right. Agriculture? Just invent more data-gathering apps. Poverty? Develop an app for that. This simplistic approach not only fails to address the root causes of our predicaments but actively distracts us from the necessary work of systemic change and collective action. Hand in hand with techno-solutionism marches technocracy — the idea that society would be best governed by the rich, technical experts and engineers rather than elected representatives or, just imagine, ordinary people! This elitist vision of governance places undue faith in the objectivity and benevolence of a technocratic class, ignoring the fact that these so-called experts are just as susceptible to self-interest as any other group. The technocratic mindset reduces the vibrant reality of human society to a series of data points and algorithms, treating citizens as variables in a grand social engineering experiment. A worldview that values efficiency over empathy, optimisation over justice and control over freedom. In this brave new world, the nuances of culture, the wisdom of tradition and the unpredictability of human nature are seen as inconvenient obstacles to be overcome rather than essential aspects of the human experience. Proponents of this ideology of progress would have us believe that we’re living in the best of all possible worlds — or at least on the path to it with the proliferation of gadgets as irrefutable evidence of our ascent. But this narrative of continuous improvement conveniently ignores the widening wealth gap, corporate corruption, the epidemic of mental health issues, the erosion of community ties and a globalised food system that results in all manner of illness and environmental degradation. The obsession with technological progress and economic growth has come at a tremendous cost. Elite interests have sacrificed the health of the planet, the well-being of countless species and our own connection to the natural world on the altar of ‘development’. They traded meaningful work and genuine human connections for the hollow notion of convenience and efficiency. The quantifiable trumps the qualitative, reducing the human experience to a series of metrics. The ideology of progress serves as a powerful tool for maintaining the status quo. By perpetuating the myth that our current corrupt system is the pinnacle of human achievement, or at least the best we can hope for (there is no alternative!) stifles imagination and is meant to induce apathy and demotivate the masses in striving to bring about meaningful change. And those who dare to question the wisdom of endless growth or propose alternative models of social organisation are censored or dismissed as naive idealists or dangerous radicals. The tech giants and corporations that benefit most from this ideology have become the new high priests of our age, peddling their digital opiates and shiny gadgets as the path to a better future. They promise connection but deliver isolation, offer information but breed confusion and pledge empowerment while tightening the public noose of surveillance. Ordinary people need to reclaim their agency, get off their cell phones and reimagine their relationship with technology, viewing it as a tool to be wielded judiciously rather than a force that shapes our destiny. We need to forge a new path that values human flourishing over ‘growth’, that prioritises ecological harmony over technological domination and that recognises the inherent worth of all beings — not just those deemed productive by the economic system. This means challenging the state-corporate-financial- digital elite, who use their wealth, policies and technologies to wage a class war on ordinary people, while reclaiming the power to shape our societies through collective action. It means reevaluating our definition of progress, moving beyond simplistic metrics of economic growth to consider the true measures of human and ecological well-being. And it means appreciating the complexity of the world, recognising that not every problem has a technological solution and that some of the most valuable aspects of human existence cannot be quantified or optimised. We find ourselves at a critical juncture where the very foundations of our food systems and, indeed, our relationship with the natural world are being systematically dismantled and reconstructed to serve the interests of a unimaginably rich elite. As we stand on the precipice of a brave new world dominated by genetically engineered crops, lab-grown meat and AI-driven farming, it is imperative that we pause and critically examine the path we are being herded down. The time has come to resist and reject the unchecked corporatisation and mechanisation of our food and, indeed, our lives. The Green Revolution, once hailed as the saviour of the ‘developing world’, has instead trapped millions of farmers in cycles of debt and dependency, while reducing the nutritional value of food and decimating biodiversity. Now, we are told that the solution to current problems lies in even more technology — gene editing, precision agriculture and artificial intelligence. But this is merely doubling down on a failed paradigm. These ‘solutions’ are not designed to address the root causes of our food crisis, but rather to further consolidate control over the food system in the hands of a few powerful corporations. Consider the push for genetically modified organisms and the new wave of gene-edited crops. Proponents claim these technologies will increase yields and reduce pesticide use. Yet, decades of cultivation of genetically modified organisms have shown us that these promises are hollow. Instead, we have seen the rise of superweeds, increased pesticide use and the erosion of seed sovereignty as farmers become beholden to patent-holding corporations. Similarly, the drive towards ‘smart’ farming and precision agriculture is often presented as a path to sustainability. In reality, it’s a trojan horse for increased corporate control and farmer disempowerment. As farms become more reliant on proprietary software, expensive machinery and data-driven decision making, traditional farming knowledge is devalued, and farmers are reduced to mere operators in a system they no longer fully understand or control. The solution lies in a return to human-scale agriculture, rooted in agroecological principles. This is not a romanticised view of the past but a forward-thinking approach that recognises the wisdom embedded in traditional farming practices while selectively incorporating appropriate technologies. Agroecology works with nature rather than against it, fostering biodiversity, building soil health and creating resilient food systems. The push for lab-grown meat and ultra-processed, plant-based alternatives is not about sustainability or animal welfare but about wresting control of protein production from farmers and placing it in the hands of tech companies and their investors. These products, often marketed as eco-friendly solutions, are in reality energy-intensive, highly processed foods that further disconnect us from the natural world and our food sources. In the face of this techno-industrial onslaught, we must advocate for food sovereignty — the right of peoples to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through ecologically sound and sustainable methods and their right to define their own food and agriculture systems. This means resisting the corporatisation of our food supply, supporting local food systems and preserving the diversity of crops and culinary traditions that have nourished humanity for millennia. In attempting to shape the future, we can indeed look to the past for inspiration and reclaim part of history by drawing from the radical vision and actions of ‘the Diggers’ movement (1649-1651). In the annals of agrarian history, one particular movement has left a profound impact on the collective imagination of food sovereignty advocates. The Diggers in 17th century England were led by the visionary Gerrard Winstanley. This radical group emerged during a period of intense social and political upheaval, offering a revolutionary perspective on land ownership and food production that continues to resonate with modern struggles for food justice. The Diggers, also known as the True Levellers, arose in 1649, a time when England was reeling from the aftermath of civil war. Winstanley and his followers dared to imagine a different world. The group challenged the very foundations of the emerging capitalist system and the enclosure movement that was rapidly privatising previously common lands. But Winstanley’s vision was not merely theoretical. On 1 April 1649, the Diggers began their most famous action, occupying St. George’s Hill in Surrey, where they established a commune, cultivating the land collectively and distributing food freely to all who needed it. This act of direct action was a powerful demonstration of their philosophy in practice. As Winstanley declared: “The earth was made to be a common treasury for all, not a private treasury for some.” The Diggers, true to their name, began their movement by literally digging up unused common lands and planting crops. According to Professor Justin Champion, they planted “peas and carrots and pulses” and let their cows graze on the fields. While the Diggers saw their actions as relatively harmless (Champion compares it to having an allotment), local property owners viewed it as a serious threat, likening it to “village terrorism”, according to Champion. The local landowners called in troops to suppress these actions. Despite their relatively small numbers and short-lived experiments, which spread across parts of England, Champion suggests that the Diggers posed a significant ideological threat to the existing social order, challenging notions of private property and social hierarchy. Winstanley declared: “Those that Buy and Sell Land, and are landlords, have got it either by Oppression, or Murther, or Theft”. He added: “The Work we are going about is this, To dig up Georges-Hill and the waste Ground thereabouts, and to Sow Corn, and to eat our bread together by the sweat of our brows. And the First Reason is this, That we may work in righteousness, and lay the Foundation of making the Earth a Common Treasury for All, both Rich and Poor, That every one that is born in the land, may be fed by the Earth his Mother that brought him forth, according to the Reason that rules in the Creation.” The backlash from local landlords was systematic. The Diggers faced beatings and arson, forcing them to move from St George’s Hill to a second site in Cobham, until they were finally driven off the land entirely. Writing in 1972 in his book The World Turned Upside Down, Christopher Hill, a prominent historian of the English Civil War period, suggested that the Diggers’ influence was more widespread than just their most famous colony at St. George’s Hill. He argued that from Nottinghamshire and Northamptonshire to Gloucestershire and Kent, Digger influence spread all over southern and central England. While the actual number of people involved in Digger experiments was relatively small (estimated at 100-200 people across England), their ideas spread more widely through pamphlets and word of mouth. This widespread influence, as described by Hill, suggests that the Diggers’ ideas resonated with people across a significant portion of England, even if actual Digger colonies were few in number. The Diggers were a radical, biblically inspired movement that practically implemented their beliefs about common ownership of land, provoking strong opposition from the established landowners despite their generally peaceful methods. The St. George’s Hill experiment represented a radical alternative to the prevailing economic and social order. It was an early example of what we might today call a food sovereignty project, emphasising local control over food production and distribution. In today’s era of industrial agriculture and corporate food systems, the Diggers’ ideas remain highly significant. Their resistance to the enclosure of common lands in the 17th century mirrors today’s struggles against corporate land grabs — and the colonising actions that underpin the likes of Bayer’s corporate jargon about the unlocking of ‘business growth’, ‘driving change management’, ‘driving market share’ and ‘creating business value’ — as well as the privatisation of seeds and genetic resources. The consolidation of the global agri-food chain in the hands of a few powerful corporations represents a modern form of enclosure, concentrating control over food production and distribution in ways that would have been all too familiar to Winstanley and his followers. The Diggers’ emphasis on local, community-controlled food production offers a stark alternative to the industrial agriculture model promoted by agribusiness giants and their allies in institutions like the World Bank and the WTO Where the dominant paradigm prioritises large-scale monocultures, global supply chains and market-driven food security, the Diggers’ vision aligns more closely with concepts of food sovereignty and agroecology. Food sovereignty, a concept developed by the international peasant movement La Via Campesina, shares much with the Diggers’ philosophy. Both emphasise the right of communities to define their own food and agriculture systems. The Diggers’ legacy can be seen in various contemporary movements challenging the corporate food regime. From La Via Campesina’s global struggle for peasant rights to local community garden initiatives and the work of the Agrarian Trust in the US (which provides good insight into the Diggers and their continued relevance in The Diggers Today: Enclosure, Manure and Resistance), we see echoes of the Diggers’ vision. Modern projects to create community-owned farms, seed banks and food cooperatives can be seen as spiritual descendants of the Diggers’ movement, aiming to reclaim food production from corporate control and put it back in the hands of communities. However, realising the Diggers’ vision in the current context faces significant obstacles. The influence of agribusiness conglomerates over key institutions and policymaking bodies presents a formidable challenge. From the World Bank to national agriculture ministries, as this book has made clear, corporate interests often shape policies that prioritise industrial agriculture and global markets over local food systems. International trade agreements and MoUs, often negotiated with minimal public scrutiny, frequently benefit large agribusiness at the expense of small farmers and local food sovereignty. Moreover, proponents of industrial agriculture often argue that it is the only way to feed the world. This narrative, however, ignores the environmental and social costs of this model, as well as the proven productivity of small-scale, agroecological farming methods. The Diggers didn’t just theorise about an alternative society; they attempted to build it by taking direct action, occupying land and implementing their vision of communal agriculture. The Diggers also understood that changing the food system required challenging broader power structures. Today’s food sovereignty movements similarly recognise the need for systemic change, addressing issues of land rights, trade policies and economic justice alongside agricultural practices. In this era of corporate-dominated agriculture, the Diggers’ vision of a “common treasury for all” remains as radical and necessary as ever. By reclaiming the commons, promoting agroecological practices and building food sovereignty, ordinary people can work towards a world where food is truly a common treasury for all. The Diggers recognised that true freedom and equality could not be achieved without addressing the fundamental question of who controls the land and the means of production. This understanding is crucial in the current context, where corporate control over the food system extends from land, seeds and inputs to distribution and retail. The Diggers’ vision also challenges us to rethink our relationship with the land and with each other. In a world increasingly dominated by individualism and market relations, the emphasis on communal ownership and collective labour offers a radical alternative. The Diggers’ legacy challenges us to think beyond the confines of the prevailing food regime, to envision and create a world where food and land are not commodities to be bought and sold but common resources to be shared and stewarded for the benefit of all. Their vision of a world where “the earth becomes a common treasury again” is not a quaint historical curiosity, but a vital and necessary alternative to the destructive practices of those who dominate the current food system. It is noteworthy that the annual Wigan Diggers Festival celebrates the life and ideas of Wigan born and bred Gerrard Winstanley and the Diggers’ Movement (see Wigan Diggers’ Festival). But let us finish with Leon Rosselson’s song lyrics from his 1975 song in reference to the Diggers’ movement (Billy Bragg’s version can be found here on YouTube).

Spices have been a cornerstone of South Indian commerce for centuries, and Chennai, with its strategic port location, has long been a key player in this trade. The prominence of chilli highlights its significance in South Indian cuisine and culture. While modern supermarkets and online platforms are changing consumer habits, wholesale markets like those in George Town continue to serve an essential function in the supply chain. Colin Todhunter is an independent researcher and writer and has spent many years in India. He is a research associate of the Centre for Research on Globalisation (Montreal) and writes on food, agriculture and development issues. In 2018, in recognition of his writing, he was named a Living Peace and Justice Leader and Model by Engaging Peace Inc. 𝐂𝐨𝐥𝐢𝐧 𝐓𝐨𝐝𝐡𝐮𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫 – Academia.edu Aruna Rodrigues, lead petitioner in the GMO mustard Public Interest Litigation in the Supreme Court of India, stated the following about the author’s 2022 e-book Food, Dispossession and Dependency. Resisting the New World Order: “Colin Todhunter at his best: this is graphic, a detailed horror tale in the making for India, an exposé on what is planned, via the farm laws, to hand over Indian sovereignty and food security to big business. There will come a time pretty soon — (not something out there but imminent, unfolding even now), when we will pay the Cargills, Ambanis, Bill Gates, Walmarts — in the absence of national buffer food stocks (an agri policy change to cash crops, the end to small-scale farmers, pushed aside by contract farming and GM crops) — we will pay them to send us food and finance borrowing from international markets to do it.” Frederic Mousseau, Policy Director at the Oakland Institute, says the following about the author’s work: “It takes a book to break down the dynamics that are pushing agro-chemical agriculture to farmers and consumers around the world and to reveal the strength of the diverse movement of people and organizations who stand in the way of these destructive and predatory forces. “Colin Todhunter takes readers on a world tour that makes a compelling case against the fallacy of the food scarcity and Green Revolution arguments advanced by the mainstream media and international institutions on behalf of powerful financial interests such as Blackrock, Vanguard, or Gates. Todhunter makes it obvious that a key factor of world hunger and of the environmental crisis we are facing is a capitalist system that ‘requires constant growth, expanding markets and sufficient demand.’ “Uplifting rather than depressing, after this lucid diagnosis, he highlights some of the countless people-led initiatives and movements, from Cuba, Ethiopia to India, that fight back against destruction and predation with agroecology and farmers-led practices, respectful of the people and the planet. By debunking the “artificial scarcity” myth that is constantly fed to us, Todhunter demonstrates that it is actually not complicated to change course. Readers will just have to join the movement.” This ebook provides insight into aspects of the global food system, including the micronutrient crisis, contested climate emergency rhetoric and its use in implementing the rollout of controlling technologies, the emergence and influence of digital platforms in shaping agricultural practices and the increasing corporate capture of Indian agriculture. The book is the third installment in a trilogy of ebooks by the author exploring the global food system. It evolved from a series of articles originally published by various media outlets and written by the author and follows the February 2022 publication of Food, Dependency and Dispossession: Resisting the New World Order and the December 2023 release of Sickening Profits: The Global Food System’s Poisoned Food and Toxic Wealth. When read together, the three books provide an overarching critique of contemporary food systems and possible solutions. For instance, the first book presents a more in-depth discussion of agroecology, the role of the Gates Foundation, the impact of pesticides, the state of agriculture in India, including the 2020-21 farmers protest, and the issue of development. The second book touches on some of those issues but broadens the debate to look at ecomodernism, food-related ill health, the role of big finance in the food system and the post-Covid food crisis. While readers do not have to read the first two books, it might help in providing added context and insights. This new book draws on and develops many of the themes presented in the first two. In particular, it returns to India to explore what has happened over the last 22 months (since the publication of the first book). More generally, it looks at the intertwining of political centralisation and corporate consolidation that is undermining democratic processes, economic diversity and local autonomy. This unholy alliance is creating a self-reinforcing, technocratic dystopia that concentrates power in the hands of a super-wealthy elite, which increasingly depicts anyone who challenges it as the ‘enemy within’. In this respect, the book weds the topic of food to the wider dynamics of power in society, which is becoming increasingly concentrated, resulting in the domination of both resources and populations and seeking to shape the very fabric of our lives and beliefs about who we are and what we could or should be. Such an analysis is integral to gaining a deeper understanding of the food system and the influence of global agribusiness and the tech giants that are increasingly moving into the food and agriculture sector. The following discussion is driven by a conviction in the transformative power of re-localising food systems, revitalising traditional ecological wisdom and rekindling our connection to the land that nourishes us. At its core, it challenges us to question our understanding of human progress and development. By focusing on the nature of power and certain challenges and issues that we face, this introductory chapter establishes a foundational framework for what appears in the subsequent chapters. We live in a world that sees political power becoming increasingly centralised. In turn, this creates an environment ripe for corporate influence. Large corporations, with their vast resources, can more easily focus their lobbying efforts and capture policymaking bodies at national and international levels than at a more fragmented local or regional level, leading to regulations and laws that favour big business over small enterprises and the needs and rights of ordinary people. This results in a landscape dominated by a handful of corporate giants, each wielding enormous economic and political clout. This consolidation of corporate power further reinforces political centralisation, as wealthy corporations (for example, think big pharma and big agribusiness) can effectively dictate policy through campaign contributions, lobbying efforts and the revolving door between government and industry. The voice of the average citizen is drowned out by the influence of corporate power. As a result of this corporate monopolisation, local markets and small businesses, once the backbone of communities, are being systematically crushed under the weight of centralised state-corporate power. Unable to compete with the economies of scale and political influence of large corporations, they are forced to close their doors or sell out to larger entities. This not only reduces choice and drives up prices but also strips communities of their unique character and economic self-determination. The global interests served by this system are at odds with local needs and values. Decisions made in distant boardrooms and government offices fail to account for the nuanced realities of diverse communities. Environmental concerns are brushed aside in favour of short-term profits, while cultural traditions are homogenised to fit corporate needs. Democratic processes, designed to give voice to the many, are subverted to serve the interests of the few. Real power resides in the hands of those who control the purse strings, and public discourse is shaped by the corporate media (often part of larger conglomerates), limiting the range of ideas and stifling dissent. At the same time, when decision-making is concentrated in a few hands, the potential for catastrophic errors increases. Over-centralised, corporate-dominated supply chains are vulnerable to disruptions, leading to shortages of essential goods that can ripple across the globe. The consolidation of corporate power in key sectors like agriculture creates dangerous monopolies that can manipulate markets, exploit farmers and ignore environmental safeguards with impunity. The struggle against the intertwining of political centralisation and corporate consolidation is a battle for a future where power is distributed equitably, where local voices matter and where the interests of communities and the environment take precedence over corporate profits. The stakes could not be higher. If we fail to check the runaway consolidation of political and corporate power, we risk sliding into a form of corporate feudalism or techno-feudalism, where the vast majority of people are reduced to serfs in service of a powerful elite. More specifically, the consolidation of corporate power in food and agriculture has far-reaching and deeply concerning implications for farmers, ordinary people and the environment. This concentration of control in the hands of a few transnational corporations has created a system that prioritises profit over ecological sustainability, health and food sovereignty. For farmers, the consequences are dire. The consolidation of the agriculture industry has led to a dramatic reduction in the number of small farms. The shift towards large-scale industrial farming has not only pushed many small farmers out of business but also trapped those who remain in a cycle of dependency on a handful of corporations for seeds, chemicals and market access. This loss of autonomy leaves farmers vulnerable to exploitative practices and reduces their ability to make decisions based on local needs and conditions. The impact on the wider population is equally troubling. While the illusion of choice persists in grocery stores, the reality is that a small number of corporations control the majority of food products. This concentration of power allows these companies to manipulate prices via aggressive discounting to destroy competition or to engage in profiteering through unnecessary price increases. Moreover, the focus on highly profitable, low-cost-ingredient processed foods high in fats, sugars and salt has contributed to a global health crisis, with rising rates of obesity and diet-related chronic diseases. Environmentally, the consequences of this corporate-controlled system are catastrophic. The industrial agricultural model promoted by these large corporations relies heavily on chemical inputs, monoculture farming and practices that degrade soil health, waterways and biodiversity. The centralisation of food production and distribution has also created a dangerously fragile system. As the COVID event demonstrated, disruptions in this highly consolidated supply chain can quickly lead to food shortages and price spikes. This lack of resilience poses a serious threat to global food security, particularly in times of crisis. Perhaps most alarmingly, this consolidated system is eroding food sovereignty — the right of peoples to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through ecologically sound and sustainable methods and their right to define their own food and agriculture systems. As global corporations increasingly control what is grown and how it is distributed, local communities lose the ability to make decisions about their food systems. The adverse implications of corporate consolidation in our food and agriculture system are profound and far-reaching. They threaten not only our current food security and public health but also the long-term sustainability of the planet’s food production capacity. Addressing this issue is not just about changing our food system; it’s about reclaiming democratic rights and ensuring a just and sustainable future for all. In India, as will be shown, the trends outlined above have concerning implications. These trends, driven by neoliberal policies and the growing influence of transnational corporations, are reshaping the landscape of Indian agriculture in ways that threaten traditional farming practices, food security and rural livelihoods. One of the most significant impacts is on small and marginal farmers, who make up about 85 per cent of India’s farming community (the importance of small farms will be discussed later). As corporate entities gain more control over various stages of the agricultural chain, these farmers face increasing pressure and vulnerability. They often find themselves at a disadvantage when negotiating prices or accessing markets, leading to reduced incomes and increased debt. The consolidation of power in the hands of a few large corporations also poses a threat to India’s food sovereignty. As these companies gain control over seeds, inputs and distribution channels, we could see a further reduction in crop diversity and a shift towards monoculture (contract) farming. This may also exacerbate the overuse of money-spinning proprietary chemical inputs, the degradation of soil and human health and the depletion of water resources, which are already major concerns in the country. The environmental costs of this approach are significant and could have long-lasting impacts on India’s agricultural productivity and food security. Furthermore, the corporatisation of agriculture threatens to erode traditional farming knowledge and practices that have been developed over generations. These practices, often more suited to local ecological conditions and more sustainable in the long term, risk being lost as standardised, corporate-driven farming ends up commodifying knowledge and practices (this will become clear later). The impact on rural communities extends beyond just the economic sphere. As the corporatisation of agriculture takes hold, there’s a risk of further rural-urban migration, as small farmers are pushed off their land. This can lead to the breakdown of rural social structures and exacerbate urban poverty and unemployment. The influence of corporate interests on agricultural research and policy is also a matter of concern. When private sector funding becomes more dominant in agricultural research, there is a risk that research priorities become skewed towards corporate interests rather than the needs of small farmers or ecological sustainability. Across the globe, an insidious corporatisation is reshaping agriculture. The consequences of this shift are far-reaching and deeply troubling, touching every aspect of the food system and, by extension, the very fabric of our societies. These corporations tell us that such a process goes hand in hand with the modernisation of the sector. The narrative of the need to ‘modernise agriculture’ pushed by corporations like Bayer, Corteva and Syngenta is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to secure control of the agricultural sector and ensure corporate dependency. Their vision of ‘development’ entails decision-making centralised in the hands of government and corporate entities, systematically weakening traditional local governance structures, and pushing top-down policies that favour large-scale industrial farming at the expense of small-scale, diversified agriculture. Ultimately, the struggle against corporate consolidation in agriculture is not just about changing our food system. It’s about recognising that food is not just a commodity but a fundamental human right and a cornerstone of our cultures and communities. There is a battle for the soul of our food system, for the future of our rural communities, for the health of our ecosystems and for the very nature of our societies. It’s a fight we cannot afford to lose. We must stand united to reclaim our food sovereignty and build a food system that nourishes not just our bodies but our communities. A fundamental restructuring of our food and agriculture systems is required. This should include antitrust enforcement to break up corporate monopolies, policies that support small and medium-sized farms and investment in research for agroecological farming methods. We must also work to shorten supply chains, promoting local food systems and territorial markets that are more resilient and responsive to community needs. The path ahead is challenging, but the alternative of a world where our food system is controlled by a handful of corporations, where biodiversity is decimated, where farmers are reduced to serfs on their own land and where our health is sacrificed for corporate profits is simply unacceptable. The world is experiencing a micronutrient food and health crisis. Micronutrient deficiency now affects billions of people. Micronutrients are key vitamins and minerals and deficiencies can cause severe health conditions. They are important for various functions, including blood clotting, brain development, the immune system, energy production and bone health, and play a critical role in disease prevention. The root of the crisis is due to an increased reliance on ultra processed foods (‘junk food’) and the way that modern food crops are grown in terms of the seeds used, the plants produced, the synthetic inputs required (fertilisers, pesticides etc.) and the effects on soil. In 2007, nutritional therapist David Thomas noted a precipitous change in the USA towards convenience and pre-prepared foods often devoid of vital micronutrients yet packed with a cocktail of chemical additives, including colourings, flavourings and preservatives. He noted that between 1940 and 2002 the character, growing methods, preparation, source and ultimate presentation of basic staples had changed significantly to the extent that trace elements and micronutrient contents have been severely depleted. Thomas added that ongoing research clearly demonstrates a significant relationship between deficiencies in micronutrients and physical and mental ill health. Prior to the Green Revolution, many of the older crops that were displaced carried dramatically higher counts of nutrients per calorie. For instance, the iron content of millet is four times that of rice, and oats carry four times more zinc than wheat. As a result, between 1961 and 2011, the protein, zinc and iron contents of the world’s directly consumed cereals declined by 4 per cent, 5 per cent and 19 per cent, respectively. The authors of a 2010 paper in the International Journal of Environmental and Rural Development state that cropping systems promoted by the Green Revolution have resulted in reduced food-crop diversity and decreased availability of micronutrients. They note that micronutrient malnutrition is causing increased rates of cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes and osteoporosis in many lower income nations. They add that soils are increasingly affected by micronutrient disorders. In 2016, India’s Central Soil Water Conservation Research and Training Institute reported that the country was losing 5,334 million tonnes of soil every year due to soil erosion because of indiscreet and excessive use of fertilisers, insecticides and pesticides over the years. On average, 16.4 tonnes of fertile soil is lost every year per hectare. It concluded that the non-judicious use of synthetic fertilisers had led to the deterioration of soil fertility causing loss of micro and macronutrients leading to poor soils and low yields. The high-input, chemical-intensive Green Revolution with its hybrid seeds and synthetic fertilisers and pesticides helped the drive towards greater monocropping and has resulted in less diverse diets and less nutritious foods. Its long-term impact has led to soil degradation and mineral imbalances, which, in turn, have adversely affected human health. But micronutrient depletion is not just due to a displacement of nutrient-dense staples in the diet or unhealthy soils. Take wheat, for example. Rothamsted Research in the UK has evaluated the mineral concentration of archived wheat grain and soil samples from the Broadbalk Wheat Experiment. The experiment began in 1843, and the findings show significant decreasing trends in the concentrations of zinc, copper, iron and magnesium in wheat grain since the 1960s. The researchers say that the concentrations of these four minerals remained stable between 1845 and the mid 1960s but have since decreased significantly by 20-30 per cent. This coincided with the introduction of Green Revolution semi-dwarf, high-yielding cultivars. They noted that the concentrations in soil used in the experiment have either increased or remained stable. So, in this case, soil is not the issue. A 2021 paper that appeared in the journal of Environmental and Experimental Botany reported that the large increase in the proportion of the global population suffering from zinc and iron deficiency over the last four decades has occurred since the Green Revolution and the introduction of its cultivars. Reflecting the findings of Rothamsted Research in the UK, a recent study led by Indian Council of Agricultural Research scientists found the grains eaten in India have lost food value. They conclude that many of today’s crops fail to absorb sufficient nutrients even when soil is healthy. The January 2024 article Indians consuming rice and wheat low in food value, high in toxins on the Down to Earth website reported on a study that found that rice and wheat, which meet over 50 per cent of the daily energy requirements of people in India, have lost up to 45 per cent of their food value in the past 50 years or so. The concentration of essential nutrients like zinc and iron has decreased by 33 per cent and 27 per cent in rice and by 30 per cent and 19 per cent in wheat, respectively. At the same time, the concentration of arsenic, a toxic element, in rice has increased by 1,493 per cent. Down to Earth also cites research by the Indian Council of Medical Research that indicates a 25 per cent rise in non-communicable diseases among the Indian population from 1990 to 2016. India is home to one-third of the two billion global population suffering from micronutrient deficiency. This is partly because modern-bred cultivars of rice and wheat are less efficient in sequestering zinc and iron, regardless of their abundance in soils. Plants have lost their capacity to take up nutrients from the soil. Increasing prevalence of diabetes, childhood leukaemia, childhood obesity, cardiovascular disorders, infertility, osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis, mental illnesses and so on have all been shown to have some direct relationship to diet and specifically micronutrient deficiency. The large increase in the proportion of the global population suffering from zinc and iron deficiency over the last four decades has coincided with the global expansion of high-yielding, input-responsive cereal cultivars released in the post-Green Revolution era. Agriculture and policy analyst Devinder Sharma says that high yield is inversely proportionate to plant nutrition: the drop in nutrition levels is so much that the high-yielding new wheat varieties have seen a steep fall in copper content, an essential trace mineral, by as much as 80 per cent, and some nutritionists ascribe this to a rise in cholesterol-related incidences across the world. India is self-sufficient in various staples, but many of these foodstuffs are high calorie-low nutrient and have led to the displacement of more nutritionally diverse cropping systems and more nutrient-dense crops. The importance of agronomist William Albrecht should not be overlooked here and his work on healthy soils and healthy people. In his experiments, he found that cows fed on less nutrient-dense crops ate more while cows that ate nutrient-rich grass stopped eating once their nutritional intake was satisfied. This may be one reason why we see rising rates of obesity at a time of micronutrient food insecurity. It is interesting that, given the above discussion on the Green Revolution’s adverse impacts on nutrition, the paper New Histories of the Green Revolution (2019) by Prof. Glenn Stone debunks the claim that the Green Revolution boosted productivity: it merely put more (nutrient-deficient) wheat into the Indian diet at the expense of other food crops. Stone argues that food productivity per capita showed no increase or even actually decreased. . . With this in mind, the table below makes for interesting reading. The data is provided by the National Productivity Council India (an autonomous body of the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, Ministry of Commerce and Industry). As mentioned earlier with reference to Albrecht, obesity has become a concern worldwide, including in India. This problem is multi-dimensional and, as alluded to, excess calorific intake and nutrient-poor food is a factor, leading to the consumption of sugary, fat-laden ultra processed food in an attempt to fill the nutritional gap. But there is also considerable evidence linking human exposure to agrochemicals with obesity. The September 2020 paper Agrochemicals and Obesity in the journal Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology summarises human epidemiological evidence and experimental animal studies supporting the association between agrochemical exposure and obesity and outlines possible mechanistic underpinnings for this link. Numerous other studies have also noted that exposure to pesticides has been associated with obesity and diabetes. For example, a 2022 paper in the journal Endocrine reports that first contact with environmental pesticides occurs during critical phases of life, such as gestation and lactation, which can lead to damage in central and peripheral tissues, subsequently programming disorders early and later in life. A 2013 paper in the journal Entropy on pathways to modern diseases reported that glyphosate (the active ingredient in Bayer-Monsanto’s Roundup), the most popular herbicide used worldwide, enhances the damaging effects of other food borne chemical residues and environmental toxins. The negative impact is insidious and manifests slowly over time as inflammation damages cellular systems throughout the body, resulting in conditions associated with a Western diet, which include gastrointestinal disorders, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, depression, autism, infertility, cancer and Alzheimer’s disease. Despite these findings, campaigner Rosemary Mason has drawn attention to how official government and industry narratives try to divert attention from the role of glyphosate in obesity (and other conditions) by urging the public to exercise and cut down on “biscuits”. In a January 2024 article, Kit Knightly, on the OffGuardian website, notes how big pharma is attempting to individualise obesity and make millions by pushing its ‘medical cures’ and drugs for the condition. To deal with micronutrient deficiencies, other money-spinning initiatives for industry are being pushed, not least biofortification of foodstuffs and plants and genetic engineering. Industry narratives have nothing to say about the food system itself in terms of food being regarded as just another commodity to be rinsed for profit regardless of the impacts on human health or the environment. We simply witness more techno-fix ‘solutions’ being rolled out to supposedly address the impacts of previous ‘innovations’ and policy decisions that benefitted the bottom line of Western agribusiness (and big pharma, which profits from the rising rates of disease and conditions). Quick techno-fixes do not offer genuine solutions to the problems outlined above. Such solutions involve challenging corporate power that shapes narratives and policies to suit its agenda. Healthy food, healthy people and healthy societies are not created at some ever-sprawling life sciences park that specialises in manipulating food and the human body (for corporate gain) under the banner of ‘innovation’ and ‘health’ while leaving intact the power relations that underpin bad food and ill health. A radical overhaul of the food system is required, from how food is grown to how society should be organised. This involves creating food sovereignty, encouraging localism, local markets and short supply chains, rejecting neoliberal globalisation, supporting smallholder agriculture and land reform while incentivising agroecological practices that build soil fertility, use and develop high-productive landraces and a focus on nutrition per acre rather than increased grain size, ‘yield’ and ‘output’. That’s how you create healthy food, healthy people and healthy societies. The relationship between financial investment and the commodification of farmland is increasingly significant for understanding the dynamics of modern agriculture and its implications for food systems. Financial institutions, including pension funds and investment firms, have turned farmland into a lucrative asset class, helping to fuel a paradigm shift in agricultural practices. This financialisation of farmland not only affects the economic landscape, opening up fresh investment opportunities, but also perpetuates an industrial agricultural model that prioritises profit over sustainability, sound agricultural practices and public health. The commodification of farmland involves transforming land into a tradable commodity, which is driven by the interests of big financial entities seeking high returns on their investments. This financial pressure leads to the aggregation of land into larger, industrial-scale farms owned by corporations or investment funds, which tend to employ input-intensive farming practices that degrade soil health and reduce biodiversity. The influx of capital into farmland has further fuelled an industrial agricultural model characterised by monocultures, heavy reliance on chemical inputs and a focus on maximising yields at the expense of human health, ecological balance and a systems approach (more on this later). The shift towards large-scale intensive farming operations has also diminished the role of smallholder farmers, who have traditionally played a major role in local food security and rural economies, thereby undermining community resilience and exacerbating food insecurity. Between 2008 and 2022, land prices nearly doubled throughout the world and tripled in Central-Eastern Europe. In the UK, an influx of investment from pension funds and private wealth contributed to a doubling of farmland prices from 2010-2015. Land prices in the US agricultural heartlands of Iowa quadrupled between 2002 and 2020. . A wheat field in Essex (Licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0) . Agricultural investment funds rose ten-fold between 2005 and 2018 and now regularly include farmland as a stand-alone asset class, with US investors having doubled their stakes in farmland since 2020. Meanwhile, agricultural commodity traders are speculating on farmland through their own private equity subsidiaries, while new financial derivatives are allowing speculators to accrue land parcels and lease them back to struggling farmers, driving steep and sustained land price inflation. Moreover, top-down ‘green grabs’ now account for 20 per cent of large-scale land deals. Government pledges for land-based carbon removals alone add up to almost 1.2 billion hectares, equivalent to total global cropland. Carbon offset markets are expected to quadruple in the next seven years. These are some of the findings published in the report ‘Land Squeeze’ (May 2024) by the International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food Systems (IPES), a non-profit thinktank headquartered in Brussels. The report says that agricultural land is increasingly being turned into a financial asset at the expense of small- and medium-scale farming, leading to land price inflation. Furthermore, the COVID-19 event and the conflict in Ukraine helped promote the ‘feed the world’ panic narrative, prompting agribusiness and investors to secure land for export commodity production and urging governments to deregulate land markets and adopt pro-investor policies. However, despite sky-rocketing food prices, there was, according to the IPES in 2022, sufficient food and no risk of global food supply shortages. The increased food prices were due to speculation on food commodities, corporate profiteering and a heavy reliance on food imports. But the self-serving narrative pushed by big agribusiness and land investors prevailed. At the same time, carbon and biodiversity offset markets are facilitating massive land transactions, bringing major polluters into land markets. The IPES notes that Shell has set aside more than $450 million for carbon offsetting projects. Land is also being appropriated for biofuels and green energy production, including water-intensive ‘green hydrogen’ projects that pose risks to local food cultivation. In addition, much-needed agricultural land is being repurposed for extractive industries and mega-developments. For example, urbanisation and mega-infrastructure developments in Asia and Africa are claiming prime farmland. According to the IPES, between 2000 and 2030, up to 3.3 million hectares of the world’s farmland will have been swallowed up by expanding megacities. Some 80 per cent of land loss to urbanisation is occurring in Asia and Africa. In India, 1.5 million hectares are estimated to have been lost to urban growth between 1955 and1985, a further 800,000 hectares lost between 1985 and 2000, with steady ongoing losses to this day. In a December 2016 paper on urban land expansion, it was projected that by 2030, globally, urban areas will have tripled in size, expanding into cropland. Around 60 per cent of the world’s cropland lies on the outskirts of cities, and this land is, on average, twice as productive as land elsewhere on the globe. This means that, as cities expand, millions of small-scale farmers are being displaced. These farmers produce the majority of food in lower income countries and are key to global food security. In their place, as their land is concreted over, we are seeing the aggregation of remaining agricultural land into large-scale farms, land buy ups and further land investments and the spread of industrial agriculture and all it brings, including poor food and diets, illness, environmental devastation and the destruction of rural communities. Investment funds have no real interest in farming or ensuring food security. They tend to invest for between only 10 and 15 years and can leave a trail of long-term environmental and social devastation and serve to undermine local and regional food security. Short- to medium-term returns on investments trump any notions of healthy food or human need. The IPES notes that, globally, just 1 per cent of the world’s largest farms now control 70 per cent of the world’s farmland. These tend to be input-intensive, industrial-scale farms that are straining resources, rapidly degrading farmland and further squeezing out smallholders. Additionally, agribusiness giants are pursuing monopolistic practices that drive up costs for farmers. These dynamics are creating systematic economic precarity for farmers, effectively forcing them to ‘get big or get out’. Factor in land degradation, much of which is attributable to modern chemical-intensive farming practices, and we have a recipe for global food insecurity. In India, more than 70 per cent of its arable land is affected by one or more forms of land degradation. Also consider that the Indian government has sanctioned 50 solar parks, covering one million hectares in seven states. More than 74 per cent of solar is on land of agricultural (67 per cent) or natural ecosystem value (7 per cent), causing potential food security and biodiversity conflicts. The IPES report notes that since 2017 there have been more than 15 instances of conflict in India linked with these projects. What is the impact of all this on farming and what might the future hold? Nettie Wiebe, from the IPES, explains: “Imagine trying to start a farm when 70 per cent of farmland is already controlled by just 1 per cent of the largest farms — and when land prices have risen for 20 years in a row, like in North America. That’s the stark reality young farmers face today. Farmland is increasingly owned not by farmers but by speculators, pension funds and big agribusinesses looking to cash in. Land prices have skyrocketed so high it’s becoming impossible to make a living from farming. This is reaching a tipping point — small and medium scale farming is simply being squeezed out.” Susan Chomba, also from the IPES, says that soaring land prices and land grabs are driving an unprecedented ‘land squeeze’, accelerating inequality and threatening food production. Moreover, the rush for dubious carbon projects, tree planting schemes, clean fuels and speculative buying is displacing not only small-scale farmers but also indigenous peoples. Huge swathes of farmland are being acquired by governments and corporations for these ‘green grabs’, despite little evidence of climate benefits. This issue is particularly affecting Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa. The IPES notes that some 25 million hectares of land have been snapped up for carbon projects by a single ‘environmental asset creation’ firm, UAE-based ‘Blue Carbon’, through agreements with the governments of Kenya, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Zambia and Liberia. According to the IPES, the ‘land squeeze’ is leading to farmer revolts, rural exodus, rural poverty and food insecurity. With global farmland prices having doubled in 15 years, farmers, peasants, and indigenous peoples are losing their land (or forced to downsize), while young farmers face significant barriers in accessing land to farm. The IPES calls for action to halt green grabs and remove speculative investment from land markets and establish integrated governance for land, environment and food systems to ensure a just transition. It also calls for support for collective ownership of farms and innovative financing for farmers to access land and wants a new deal for farmers and rural areas, and that includes a new generation of land and agrarian reforms. Capital accumulation based on the financialisation of farmland accelerated after the 2008 financial crisis. However, financialisation of the economy in general goes back to the 1970s and 1980s when we witnessed a deceleration of economic growth based on industrial production. The response was to compensate via financial capitalism and financial intermediation. Professor John Bellamy Foster, writing in 2010, not long after the 2008 crisis, stated: “Lacking an outlet in production, capital took refuge in speculation in debt-leveraged finance (a bewildering array of options, futures, derivatives, swaps etc.).” The neoliberal agenda was the political expression of capital’s response to the stagnation and included the raiding and sacking of public budgets, the expansion of credit to consumers and governments to sustain spending and consumption and frenzied financial speculation. With the engine of capital accumulation via production no longer firing on all cylinders, the emergency backup of financial expansion took over. We have seen a shift from real capital formation in many Western economies, which increases overall economic output, towards the appreciation of financial assets, which increases wealth claims but not output. Farmland is being transformed from a resource supporting food production and rural stability to a financial asset and speculative commodity. An asset class where wealthy investors can park their capital to further profit from inflated asset prices. The net-zero green agenda also has to be seen in this context: when capital struggles to make sufficient profit, productive wealth (capital) over accumulates and depreciates; to avoid crisis, constant growth and, in this case, the creation of fresh ‘green’ investment opportunities is required. The IPES report notes that nearly 45 per cent of all farmland investments in 2018, worth roughly $15 billion, came from pension funds and insurance companies. Based on workers’ contributions, pension fund investments in farmland are promoting land speculation, industrial agriculture and the interests of big agribusiness at the expense of smallholder farmers. Workers’ futures are tied to pension funds, which are supporting the growth and power of global finance and the degradation of other workers (in this case, cultivators). Sofía Monsalve Suárez, from the IPES, states: “It’s time decision-makers stop shirking their responsibility and start to tackle rural decline. The financialisation and liberalisation of land markets is ruining livelihoods and threatening the right to food. Instead of opening the floodgates to speculative capital, governments need to take concrete steps to halt bogus ‘green grabs’ and invest in rural development, sustainable farming and community-led conservation.” With pensions tied to an increasingly commodified food system, ordinary people have become deeply incorporated into a capitalist economy that requires private profit at the expense of public well-being. The links between big finance, the food system, illness and big pharma were described in Sickening Profits: The Global Food System’s Poisoned Food and Toxic Wealth. That book highlighted a cyclical relationship where financial institutions like BlackRock benefit from both their investments in the global food system and their investments in pharmaceuticals. At the same time, the relationship between ordinary people’s pensions and investments and the commodification of farmland further illustrates a complex interplay between finance and agriculture. Addressing these challenges requires a critical examination of how financial interests shape agricultural practices and a concerted effort towards more sustainable food systems that prioritise ecological integrity and community well-being over mere profitability. Earlier in this chapter, it was stated that the influx of capital into farmland has further fuelled an industrial agricultural model characterised by monocultures, heavy reliance on chemical inputs and a focus on maximising yields at the expense of ecological balance and a systems approach. But what is a systems approach? It involves understanding agriculture as part of a broader ecological and social system. It acknowledges that agricultural practices affect and are affected by environmental health, community well-being and economic viability. However, industrial agriculture often overlooks these interconnections, leading to detrimental outcomes such as soil degradation, polluted waterways, loss of biodiversity, the destruction of rural communities, small-scale farms and local economies and negative health impacts. By contrast, a systems approach promotes agroecological principles that prioritise local food security, sustainable practices and the resilience of farming communities. Agroecology serves as a primary framework within this systems approach. It integrates scientific research with traditional knowledge and grassroots participation, fostering practices that enhance ecological balance while ensuring farmers’ livelihoods. This method encourages diverse cropping systems, natural pest management and sustainable resource use, which collectively contribute to more resilient agricultural ecosystems. Agroecology not only addresses immediate agricultural challenges but also engages with broader political and economic issues affecting food systems. Moreover, a systems approach prioritises diverse nutrition production per acre, which contrasts sharply with conventional, reductionist agricultural models that focus predominantly on maximising yields of a single crop. Agroecological methods, which are foundational to this systems perspective, can lead to improved nutritional outcomes: by cultivating a wider variety of crops, farmers can enhance the nutritional quality of food produced on each acre, thereby addressing issues of malnutrition and food insecurity more effectively. Localised food systems and the primacy of small farms are critical to a systems approach. By reducing dependency on global supply chains dominated by big finance and large agribusiness, localised systems can enhance food sovereignty and empower communities. This shift not only mitigates vulnerability to global market fluctuations and supply chain crises but also fosters self-sufficiency and resilience against environmental changes. A systems approach thus advocates for policies that support smallholder farmers and promote sustainable practices tailored to local conditions. (For further insight into agroecology and its feasibility, successes and scaling up, there is an entire chapter on agroecology in Food, Dependency and Dispossession: Resisting the New World Order.) Throughout the world, from the Netherlands to India, farmers are protesting. The protests might appear to have little in common. But they do. Farmers are increasingly finding it difficult to make a living, whether, for instance, because of neoliberal trade policies that lead to the import of produce that undermines domestic production and undercuts prices, the withdrawal of state support or the implementation of net-zero emissions policies that set unrealistic targets. The common thread is that, by one way or another, farming is deliberately being made impossible or financially non-viable. The aim is to drive most farmers off the land and ram through an agenda that by its very nature seems likely to produce shortages and undermine food security. . Farmers’ protest in The Hague 1 October 2019. (Licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0) . A ‘one world agriculture’ global agenda is being promoted by the likes of the Gates Foundation and the World Economic Forum. It involves a vision of food and farming that sees companies such as Bayer, Corteva, Syngenta and Cargill working with Microsoft, Google and the big-tech giants to facilitate AI-driven farmerless farms, laboratory-engineered ‘food’ and retail dominated by the likes of Amazon and Walmart. A cartel of data owners, proprietary input suppliers and e-commerce platforms at the commanding heights of the economy. The agenda is the brainchild of a digital-corporate-financial complex that wants to transform and control all aspects of life and human behaviour. This complex forms part of an authoritarian global elite that has the ability to coordinate its agenda globally via the United Nations, the World Economic Forum, the World Trade Organization (WTO), the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and other supranational organisations, including influential think tanks and foundations (Gates, Rockefeller etc.). Its agenda for food and farming is euphemistically called a ‘food transition’. Big agribusiness and ‘philanthropic’ foundations position themselves as the saviours of humanity due to their much-promoted plans to ‘feed the world’ with high-tech ‘precision’ farming’, ‘data-driven’ agriculture and ‘green’ (net-zero) production — with a warped notion of ‘sustainability’ being the mantra. A much talked about ‘food transition’ goes hand in hand with an energy transition, net-zero ideology, programmable central bank digital currencies, the censorship of free speech and clampdowns on protest. To properly understand these processes, we need to first locate what is essentially a social and economic reset within the context of a collapsing financial system. Writer Ted Reece notes that the general rate of profit has trended downwards from an estimated 43 per cent in the 1870s to 17 per cent in the 2000s. By late 2019, many companies could not generate enough profit. Falling turnover, squeezed margins, limited cashflows and highly leveraged balance sheets were prevalent. Professor Fabio Vighi of Cardiff University has described how closing down the global economy in early 2020 under the guise of fighting a supposedly new and novel pathogen allowed the US Federal Reserve to flood collapsing financial markets (COVID relief) with freshly printed money without causing hyperinflation. Lockdowns curtailed economic activity, thereby removing demand for the newly printed money (credit) in the physical economy and preventing ‘contagion’. According to investigative journalist Michael Byrant, €1.5 trillion was needed to deal with the crisis in Europe alone. The financial collapse staring European central bankers in the face came to a head in 2019. The appearance of a ‘novel virus’ provided a convenient cover story. The European Central Bank agreed to a €1.31 trillion bailout of banks followed by the EU agreeing to a €750 billion recovery fund for European states and corporations. This package of long-term, ultra-cheap credit to hundreds of banks was sold to the public as a necessary programme to cushion the impact of the ‘pandemic’ on businesses and workers. In response to a collapsing neoliberalism, we are now seeing the rollout of an authoritarian great reset — an agenda that intends to reshape the economy and change how we live. The new economy is to be dominated by a handful of tech giants, global conglomerates and e-commerce platforms, and new markets will also be created through the financialisation of nature, which is to be colonised, commodified and traded under the notion of protecting the environment. In recent years, we have witnessed an overaccumulation of capital, and the creation of such markets will provide fresh investment opportunities (including dodgy carbon offsetting Ponzi schemes) for the super-rich to park their wealth and prosper. This great reset envisages a transformation of Western societies, resulting in permanent restrictions on fundamental liberties and mass surveillance. Being rolled out under the benign term of a ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution’, the World Economic Forum (WEF) says the public will eventually ‘rent’ everything they require (remember the WEF video ‘you will own nothing and be happy’?): stripping the right of ownership under the guise of a ‘green economy’ and underpinned by the rhetoric of ‘sustainable consumption’ and ‘climate emergency’. . Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates – World Economic Forum Annual Meeting Davos 2008 (Copyright World Economic Forum by Remy Steinegger) . Climate alarmism and the mantra of sustainability are about promoting money-making schemes. But they also serve another purpose: social control. Neoliberalism has run its course, resulting in the impoverishment of large sections of the population. But to dampen dissent and lower expectations, the levels of personal freedom we have been used to will not be tolerated. This means that the wider population will be subjected to the discipline of an emerging surveillance state. To push back against any dissent, ordinary people are being told that they must sacrifice personal liberty in order to protect public health, societal security (those terrible Russians, Islamic extremists or that Sunak-designated bogeyman George Galloway) or the climate; in the case of the climate, this means, for instance, travelling less and eating synthetic ‘meat’. Unlike in the old normal of neoliberalism, an ideological shift is occurring whereby personal freedoms are increasingly depicted as being dangerous because they run counter to the collective good. A main reason for this ideological shift is to ensure that the masses get used to lower living standards and accept them. Consider, for instance, the Bank of England’s chief economist Huw Pill saying that people should ‘accept’ being poorer. And then there is Rob Kapito of the world’s biggest asset management firm BlackRock, who says that a “very entitled” generation must deal with scarcity for the first time in their lives. At the same time, to muddy the waters, the message is that lower living standards are the result of the conflict in Ukraine and supply shocks that both the war and ‘the virus’ have caused. The net-zero carbon emissions agenda will help legitimise lower living standards (reducing your carbon footprint) while reinforcing the notion that our rights must be sacrificed for the greater good. You will own nothing, not because the rich and their neoliberal agenda made you poor but because you will be instructed to stop being irresponsible and must act to protect the planet. But what of this shift towards net-zero greenhouse gas emissions and the plan to slash our carbon footprints? Is it even feasible or necessary? Gordon Hughes, a former World Bank economist and current professor of economics at the University of Edinburgh, says in a 2024 report that current UK and European net-zero policies will likely lead to further economic ruin. Apparently, the only viable way to raise the cash for sufficient new capital expenditure (on wind and solar infrastructure) would be a two decades-long reduction in private consumption of up to 10 per cent. Such a shock has never occurred in the last century outside war; even then, never for more than a decade. But this agenda will also cause serious environmental degradation. So says Andrew Nikiforuk in the article The Rising Chorus of Renewable Energy Skeptics, which outlines how the green techno-dream is vastly destructive. He lists the devastating environmental impacts of an even more mineral-intensive system based on renewables and warns: “The whole process of replacing a declining system with a more complex mining-based enterprise is now supposed to take place with a fragile banking system, dysfunctional democracies, broken supply chains, critical mineral shortages and hostile geopolitics.” All of this assumes that global warming is real and anthropogenic. Not everyone agrees. In the article Global warming and the confrontation between the West and the rest of the world, journalist Thierry Meyssan argues that net zero is based on political ideology rather than science. But to state such things has become heresy in the Western countries and shouted down with accusations of ‘climate science denial’. Regardless of such concerns, the march towards net zero continues, and key to this is the United Nations Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development Goals. . A proposal to visualize the 17 SDGs in a thematic pyramid (Licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0) . Today, almost every business or corporate report, website or brochure includes a multitude of references to ‘carbon footprints’, ‘sustainability’, ‘net zero’ or ‘climate neutrality’ and how a company or organisation intends to achieve its sustainability targets. Green profiling, green bonds and green investments go hand in hand with displaying ‘green’ credentials and ambitions wherever and whenever possible. It seems anyone and everyone in business is planting their corporate flag on the summit of sustainability. Take Sainsbury’s, for instance. It is one of the ‘big six’ food retail supermarkets in the UK and has a vision for the future of food that it published in 2019 that dovetails with the so-called food transition and the interrelated net-zero agenda — you must change your eating habits and eat synthetic food to save the planet! Here’s a quote from it: “Personalised Optimisation is a trend that could see people chipped and connected like never before. A significant step on from wearable tech used today, the advent of personal microchips and neural laces has the potential to see all of our genetic, health and situational data recorded, stored and analysed by algorithms which could work out exactly what we need to support us at a particular time in our life. Retailers, such as Sainsbury’s could play a critical role to support this, arranging delivery of the needed food within thirty minutes — perhaps by drone.” Tracked, traced and chipped — for your own benefit. Corporations accessing all of our personal data, right down to our DNA. The report is littered with references to sustainability and the climate or environment, and it is difficult not to get the impression that it is written so as to leave the reader awestruck by the technological possibilities. We shall return to this report in the next chapter. The report appears to be part of a paradigm that promotes a brave new world of technological innovation but has nothing to say about power — who determines policies that have led to massive inequalities, poverty, malnutrition, food insecurity and hunger and who is responsible for the degradation of the environment in the first place — is nothing new. The essence of power is conveniently glossed over, not least because those involved in the prevailing food regime are also shaping the techno-utopian fairytale where everyone lives happily ever after eating synthetic food while living in a digital panopticon. The type of ‘green’ agenda being pushed is not just about social engineering and behavioural change; it is also a multi-trillion market opportunity for lining the pockets of rich investors and subsidy-sucking green infrastructure firms. It is, furthermore, a type of green that plans to cover much of the countryside with wind farms and solar panels with most farmers no longer farming. A recipe for food insecurity. Those investing in the ‘green’ agenda care first and foremost about profit. The supremely influential BlackRock is not only promoting this agenda; it also invests in the current food system and the corporations responsible for polluted waterways, degraded soils, the displacement of smallholder farmers, a spiralling public health crisis, malnutrition and much more. It also invests in healthcare — an industry that thrives on the illnesses and conditions created by eating the substandard food that the current system produces. Did Larry Fink, the top man at BlackRock, suddenly develop a conscience and become an environmentalist who cares about the planet and ordinary people? Of course not. He smells ever more profit in ‘climate-friendly’, ‘precision’ agriculture, genetic engineering and facilitating a new technocratic fake-green normal. Any serious deliberations on the future of food would surely consider issues like food sovereignty, the role of agroecology and the strengthening of family farms — the backbone of current global food production. The aforementioned article by Andrew Nikiforuk concludes that, if we are really serious about our impacts on the environment, we must scale back our needs and simplify society. In terms of food, the solution rests on a low-input approach that strengthens rural communities and local markets and prioritises smallholder farms and small independent enterprises and retailers, localised democratic food systems and a concept of food sovereignty based on self-sufficiency, agroecological principles and regenerative agriculture. It would involve facilitating the right to culturally appropriate food that is nutritionally dense due to diverse cropping patterns and free from toxic chemicals while ensuring local ownership and stewardship of common resources like land, water, soil and seeds. That’s where genuine environmentalism, ‘sustainability’, social justice and the future of food begins. But there’s no profit or role in that for Fink or the big agribusiness and tech giants that despise such approaches. Sainsbury’s Future of Food report (2019), mentioned in the previous chapter, is not merely a misguided attempt at forecasting future trends and habits; it reads more like a manifesto for corporate control and technocratic tyranny disguised as ‘progress’. This document epitomises everything wrong with the industrial food system’s vision for our future. It represents a dystopian roadmap to a world where our most fundamental connection to nature and culture — our food — is hijacked by corporate interests and mediated through a maze of unnecessary and potentially harmful technologies. . Illustration by Margarita Mitrovic / Screenshot from Sainsbury’s Report . The wild predictions and technological ‘solutions’ presented in the report reveal a profound disconnection from the lived experiences of ordinary people and the real challenges facing our food systems. Its claim (in 2019) that a quarter of Britons will be vegetarian by 2025 seems way off the mark. But it fits a narrative that seeks to reshape our diets and food culture. Once you convince the reader that things are going to be a certain way in the future, it is easier to pave the way for normalising what appears elsewhere in the report: lab-grown meat, 3D-printed foods and space farming. Of course, the underlying assumption is that giant corporations — and supermarkets like Sainsbury’s — will be controlling everything and rolling out marvellous ‘innovations’ under the guise of ‘feeding the world’ or ‘saving the planet’. There is no concern expressed in the report about the consolidation of corporate-technocratic control over the food system. By promoting high-tech solutions, the report seemingly advocates for a future where our food supply is entirely dependent on complex technologies controlled by a handful of corporations. The report talks of ‘artisan factories’ run by robots. Is this meant to get ordinary people to buy into Sainsbury’s vision of the future? Possibly, if the intention is to further alienate people from their food sources, making them ever more dependent on corporate-controlled, ultra-processed products. It’s a future where the art of cooking, the joy of growing food and the cultural significance of traditional dishes are replaced by sterile, automated processes devoid of human touch and cultural meaning. This erosion of food culture and skills is not an unintended consequence — it’s a core feature of the corporate food system’s strategy to create a captive market of consumers unable to feed themselves without corporate intervention. The report’s enthusiasm for personalised nutrition driven by AI and biometric data is akin to an Orwellian scenario that would give corporations unprecedented control over our dietary choices, turning the most fundamental human need into a data-mined, algorithm-driven commodity. The privacy implications are staggering, as is the potential for new forms of discrimination and social control based on eating habits. Imagine a world where your insurance premiums are tied to your adherence to a corporate-prescribed diet or where your employment prospects are influenced by your ‘Food ID’. The possible dystopian reality lurking behind Sainsbury’s glossy predictions. The report’s fixation on exotic ingredients like jellyfish and lichen draws attention away from the real issues affecting our food systems — corporate concentration, environmental degradation and the systematic destruction of local food cultures and economies. It would be better to address the root causes of food insecurity and malnutrition, which are fundamentally issues of poverty and inequality, not a lack of novel food sources. Nothing is mentioned about the vital role of agroecology, traditional farming knowledge and food sovereignty in creating truly sustainable and just food systems. Instead, what we see is a future where every aspect of our diet is mediated by technology and corporate interests, from gene-edited crops to synthetic biology-derived foods. A direct assault on the principles of food sovereignty, which assert the right of peoples to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through ecologically sound and sustainable methods. The report’s emphasis on lab-grown meat and other high-tech protein sources is particularly troubling. These technologies, far from being the environmental saviours they are promoted as, risk increasing energy use and further centralising food production in the hands of a few tech giants. The massive energy requirements for large-scale cultured meat production are conveniently glossed over, as are the potential health risks of consuming these novel foods without long-term safety studies. This push for synthetic foods is not about sustainability or animal welfare — it’s about creating new, patentable food sources that can be controlled and monetised by corporations. Moreover, the push for synthetic foods and ‘precision fermentation’ threatens to destroy the livelihoods of millions of small farmers and pastoralists worldwide, replacing them with a handful of high-tech facilities controlled by multinational corporations. Is this meant to be ‘progress’? It’s more like a boardroom recipe for increased food insecurity, rural poverty and corporate monopolisation. The destruction of traditional farming communities and practices would not only be an economic disaster but a cultural catastrophe, erasing millennia of accumulated knowledge and wisdom about sustainable food production. The report’s casual mention of ‘sin taxes’ on meat signals a future where our dietary choices are increasingly policed and penalised by the state, likely at the behest of corporate interests. However, on the issue of the need to reduce meat consumption and replace meat with laboratory-manufactured items in order to reduce carbon emissions, it must be stated that the dramatic increase in the amount of meat consumed post-1945 was not necessarily the result of consumer preference; it had more to do with political policy, the mechanisation of agriculture and Green Revolution practices. That much was made clear by Laila Kassam, who, in her 2017 article What’s grain got to do with it? How the problem of surplus grain was solved by increasing ‘meat’ consumption in post-WWII US, asked: “Have you ever wondered how ‘meat’ became such a central part of the Western diet? Or how the industrialisation of ‘animal agriculture’ came about? It might seem like the natural outcome of the ‘free market’ meeting demand for more ‘meat’. But from what I have learned from Nibert (2002) and Winders and Nibert (2004), the story of how ‘meat’ consumption increased so much in the post-World War II period is anything but natural. They argue it is largely due to a decision in the 1940s by the US government to deal with the problem of surplus grain by increasing the production of ‘meat’.” Kassam notes: “In the second half of the 20th century, global ‘meat’ production increased by nearly 5 times. The amount of ‘meat’ eaten per person doubled. By 2050 ‘meat’ consumption is estimated to increase by 160 percent (The World Counts, 2017). While global per capita ‘meat’ consumption is currently 43 kg/year, it is nearly double in the UK (82 kg/year) and almost triple in the US (118 kg/year).” Kassam notes that habits and desires are manipulated by elite groups for their own interests. Propaganda, advertising and ‘public relations’ are used to manufacture demand for products. Agribusiness corporations and the state have used these techniques to encourage ‘meat’ consumption, leading to the slaughter and untold misery of billions of creatures, as Kassam makes clear. People were manipulated to buy into ‘meat culture’. Now they are being manipulated to buy out, again by elite groups. But ‘sin taxes’ and Orwellian-type controls on individual behaviour are not the way to go about reducing meat consumption. So, what is the answer? Kassam says that one way to do this is to support grassroots organisations and movements which are working to resist the power of global agribusiness and reclaim our food systems. Movements for food justice and food sovereignty which promote sustainable, agroecological production systems. At least then people will be free from corporate manipulation and better placed to make their own food choices. As Kassam says: “From what I have learned so far, our oppression of other animals is not just a result of individual choices. It is underpinned by a state supported economic system driven by profit.” Meanwhile, Sainsbury’s vision of food production in space and on other planets is perhaps the most egregious example of misplaced priorities. While around a billion struggle with hunger and malnutrition and many more with micronutrient deficiencies, corporate futurists are fantasising about growing food on Mars. Is this supposed to be visionary thinking? It’s a perfect encapsulation of the technocratic mindset that believes every problem can be solved with more technology, no matter how impractical or divorced from reality. Moreover, by promoting a future dependent on complex, centralised technologies, we become increasingly vulnerable to system failures and corporate monopolies. A truly resilient food system should be decentralised, diverse and rooted in local knowledge and resources. The report’s emphasis on nutrient delivery through implants, patches and intravenous methods is particularly disturbing. This represents the ultimate commodification of nutrition, reducing food to mere fuel and stripping away all cultural, social and sensory aspects of eating. It’s a vision that treats the human body as a machine to be optimised, rather than a living being with complex needs and experiences. The idea of ‘grow-your-own’ ingredients for cultured meat and other synthetic foods at home is another example of how this technocratic vision co-opts and perverts concepts of self-sufficiency and local food production. Instead of encouraging people to grow real, whole foods, it proposes a dystopian parody of home food production that still keeps consumers dependent on corporate-supplied technologies and inputs. A clever marketing ploy to make synthetic foods seem more natural and acceptable. The report’s predictions about AI-driven personal nutrition advisors and highly customised diets based on individual ‘Food IDs’ raise serious privacy concerns and threaten to further medicalise our relationship with food. While personalised nutrition could offer some benefits, the level of data collection and analysis required for such systems could lead to unprecedented corporate control over our dietary choices. Furthermore, the emphasis on ‘artisan’ factories run by robots completely misunderstands the nature of artisanal food production. True artisanal foods are the product of human skill, creativity and cultural knowledge passed down through generations. It’s a perfect example of how the technocratic mindset reduces everything to mere processes that can be automated, ignoring the human and cultural elements that give food its true value. The report’s vision of meat ‘assembled’ on 3D printing belts is another disturbing example of the ultra-processed future being proposed. This approach to food production treats nutrition as a mere assembly of nutrients, ignoring the complex interactions between whole foods and the human body. It’s a continuation of the reductionist thinking that has led to the current epidemic of diet-related diseases. Sainsbury’s is essentially advocating for a future where our diets are even further removed from natural, whole foods. The concept of ‘farms’ cultivating plants to make growth serum for cells is yet another step towards the complete artificialisation of the food supply. This approach further distances food production from natural processes. It’s a vision of farming that has more in common with pharmaceutical production than traditional agriculture, and it threatens to complete the transformation of food from a natural resource into an industrial product. Sainsbury’s apparent enthusiasm for gene-edited and synthetic biology-derived foods is also concerning. These technologies’ rapid adoption without thorough long-term safety studies and public debate could lead to unforeseen health and environmental impacts. The history of agricultural biotechnology is rife with examples of unintended consequences, from the development of herbicide-resistant superweeds to the contamination of non-GM crops. Is Sainsbury’s uncritically promoting these technologies, disregarding the precautionary principle? Issues like food insecurity, malnutrition and environmental degradation are not primarily technical problems — they are the result of inequitable distribution of resources, exploitative economic systems and misguided policies. By framing these issues as purely technological challenges, Sainsbury’s is diverting attention from the need for systemic change and social justice in the food system. The high-tech solutions proposed are likely to be accessible only to the wealthy, at least initially, creating a two-tiered food system where the rich have access to ‘optimized’ nutrition while the poor are left with increasingly degraded and processed options. But the report’s apparent disregard for the cultural and social aspects of food is perhaps its most fundamental flaw. Food is not merely fuel for our bodies; it’s a central part of our cultural identities, social relationships and connection to the natural world. By reducing food to a series of nutrients to be optimised and delivered in the most efficient manner possible, Sainsbury’s is proposing a future that is not only less healthy but less human. While Sainsbury’s Future of Food report can be regarded as a roadmap to a better future, it is really a corporate wish list, representing a dangerous consolidation of power in the hands of agribusiness giants and tech companies at the expense of farmers, consumers and the environment. The report is symptomatic of a wider ideology that seeks to legitimise total corporate control over our food supply. And the result? A homogenised, tech-driven dystopia. A technocratic nightmare that gives no regard for implementing food systems that are truly democratic, ecologically sound and rooted in the needs and knowledge of local communities. The real future of food lies not in corporate labs and AI algorithms, but in the fields of agroecological farmers, the kitchens of home cooks and the markets of local food producers. The path forward is not through more technology and corporate control but through a return to the principles of agroecology, food sovereignty and cultural diversity. “A total demolition of the previous forms of existence is underway: how one comes into the world, biological sex, education, relationships, the family, even the diet that is about to become synthetic.” — Silvia Guerini, radical ecologist, in From the ‘Neutral’ Body to the Posthuman Cyborg (2023) We are currently seeing an acceleration of the corporate consolidation of the entire global agri-food chain. The big data conglomerates, including Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook and Google, have joined traditional agribusiness giants, such as Corteva, Bayer, Cargill and Syngenta, in a quest to impose their model of food and agriculture on the world. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and big financial institutions, like BlackRock and Vanguard, are also involved, whether through buying up huge tracts of farmland, pushing biosynthetic (fake) food and genetic engineering technologies or more generally facilitating and financing the aims of the mega agri-food corporations. The billionaire interests behind this try to portray their techno-solutionism as some kind of humanitarian endeavour: saving the planet with ‘climate-friendly solutions’, ‘helping farmers’ or ‘feeding the world’. But what it really amounts to is repackaging and greenwashing the dispossessive strategies of imperialism. It involves a shift towards a ‘one world agriculture’ under the control of agritech and the data giants, which is to be based on genetically-engineered seeds, laboratory-created products that resemble food, ‘precision’ and ‘data-driven’ agriculture and farming without farmers, with the entire agrifood chain, from field (or lab) to retail, being governed by monopolistic e-commerce platforms determined by artificial intelligence systems and algorithms. Those who are pushing this agenda have a vision not only for farmers but also for humanity in general. The elites through their military-digital-financial (Pentagon/Silicon Valley/Big Finance) complex want to use their technologies to reshape the world and redefine what it means to be human. They regard humans, their cultures and their practices, like nature itself, as a problem and deficient. Farmers are to be displaced and replaced with drones, machines and cloud-based computing. Food is to be redefined, and people are to be fed synthetic, genetically-engineered products. Cultures are to be eradicated, and humanity is to be fully urbanised, subservient and disconnected from the natural world. What it means to be human is to be radically transformed. But what has it meant to be human until now or at least prior to the (relatively recent) Industrial Revolution and associated mass urbanisation? To answer this question, we need to discuss our connection to nature and what most of humanity was involved in prior to industrialisation — cultivating food. Many of the ancient rituals and celebrations of our forebears were built around stories, myths and rituals that helped them come to terms with some of the most fundamental issues of existence, from death to rebirth and fertility. These culturally-embedded beliefs and practices served to sanctify people’s practical relationship with nature and its role in sustaining human life. As agriculture became key to human survival, the planting and harvesting of crops and other seasonal activities associated with food production were central to these customs. Humans celebrated nature and the life it gave birth to. Ancient beliefs and rituals were imbued with hope and renewal and people had a necessary and immediate relationship with the sun, seeds, animals, wind, fire, soil and rain and the changing seasons that nourished and brought life. Our cultural and social relationships with agrarian production and associated deities had a sound practical base. People’s lives have been tied to planting, harvesting, seeds, soil and the seasons for thousands of years. Silvia Guerini, whose quote introduces this chapter, notes the importance of deep-rooted relationships and the rituals that re-affirm them. She says that through rituals a community recognises itself and its place in the world. They create the spirit of a rooted community by contributing to rooting and making a single existence endure in a time, in a territory, in a community. Professor Robert W Nicholls explains that the cults of Woden and Thor were superimposed on far older and better-rooted beliefs related to the sun and the earth, the crops and the animals and the rotation of the seasons between the light and warmth of summer and the cold and dark of winter. Humanity’s relationship with farming and food and our connections to land, nature and community has for millennia defined what it means to be human. Take India, for example. Environmental scientist Viva Kermani says that Hinduism is the world’s largest nature-based religion that: “… recognises and seeks the Divine in nature and acknowledges everything as sacred. It views the earth as our Mother and hence advocates that it should not be exploited. A loss of this understanding that earth is our mother, or rather a deliberate ignorance of this, has resulted in the abuse and the exploitation of the earth and its resources.” Kermani notes that ancient scriptures instructed people that the animals and plants found in India are sacred and, therefore, all aspects of nature are to be revered. She adds that this understanding of and reverence towards the environment is common to all Indic religious and spiritual systems: Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. According to Kermani, the Vedic deities have deep symbolism and many layers of existence. One such association is with ecology. Surya is associated with the sun, the source of heat and light that nourishes everyone; Indra is associated with rain, crops, and abundance; and Agni is the deity of fire and transformation and controls all changes. She notes that the Vrikshayurveda, an ancient Sanskrit text on the science of plants and trees, contains details about soil conservation, planting, sowing, treatment, propagating, how to deal with pests and diseases and a lot more. Like Nicholls, Kermani provides insight into some of the profound cultural, philosophical and practical aspects of humanity’s connection to nature and food production. This connection resonates with agrarianism, a philosophy based on cooperative labour and fellowship, which stands in stark contrast to the values and impacts of urban life, capitalism and technology that are too often detrimental to independence and dignity. Agrarianism, too, emphasises a spiritual dimension as well as the value of rural society, small farms, widespread property ownership and political decentralisation. The poet and prominent proponent of agrarianism Wendell Berry says: “The revolution which began with machines and chemicals now continues with automation, computers and biotechnology.” For Berry, agrarianism is not a sentimental longing for a time past. Colonial attitudes, domestic, foreign and now global, have resisted true agrarianism almost from the beginning — there has never been fully sustainable, stable, locally adapted, land-based economies. However, Berry provides many examples of small (and larger) farms that have similar output as industrial agriculture with one third of the energy. In his poem ‘A Spiritual Journey’, Berry writes the following: “And the world cannot be discovered by a journey of miles, no matter how long, but only by a spiritual journey, a journey of one inch, very arduous and humbling and joyful, by which we arrive at the ground at our feet, and learn to be at home.” Agrarianism, while advocating for a return to small-scale farming and community-oriented living, is often critiqued for its idealisation of rural life and agricultural work. Critics argue that it mistakenly elevates farming above other forms of labour, suggesting that agricultural work inherently fosters moral virtues and a closer relationship with nature. It might appear to be naive, not least because, it overlooks the complexities and ethical dilemmas present in agrarian communities, which can be just as susceptible to corruption and environmental degradation as urban settings. This raises the question: are solutions based on agrarianism utopian and disconnected from modern societal needs? Not really. Agrarianism offers a necessary critique of industrial agriculture and the accelerated urbanisation we see across the world, emphasising the importance of local communities and sustainable practices. It promotes the idea that close relationships with the land can foster not only environmental stewardship but also social cohesion and moral integrity among community members. By advocating for small-scale farming and local food systems, agrarianism seeks to empower individuals and families, encouraging self-sufficiency and resilience against the negative impacts of globalisation and corporate control in agriculture. As a philosophy, agrarianism highlights the value of traditional knowledge and practices in addressing contemporary issues such as climate challenges, food security and social inequality. We shall return to Wendell Berry in the final chapter. But in the cold, centralised, technocratic dystopia that is planned, humanity’s spiritual connection to the countryside, food and agrarian production are to be cast into the dustbin of history. What we are seeing is an agenda based on a different set of values rooted in a lust for power and money and the total subjugation of ordinary people. Silvia Guerini says: “The past becomes something to be erased in order to break the thread that binds us to a history, to a tradition, to a belonging, for the transition towards a new uprooted humanity, without past, without memory… a new humanity dehumanised in its essence, totally in the hands of the manipulators of reality and truth”. This dehumanised humanity severed from the past is part of the wider agenda of transhumanism. For instance, we are not just seeing a push towards a world without farmers and everything that has connected us to the soil but, according to Guerini, also a world without mothers. She argues that those behind test-tube babies and surrogate motherhood now have their sights on genetic engineering and artificial wombs, which would cut women out of the reproductive process. Guerini predicts that artificial wombs could eventually be demanded, or rather marketed, as a right for everyone, including transgender people. It is interesting that the language around pregnancy is already contested with the omission of ‘women’ from statements like ‘persons who can get pregnant’. Of course, there has long been a blurring of lines between biotechnology, eugenics and genetic engineering. Genetically engineered crops, gene drives and gene editing are now a reality, but the ultimate goal is marrying artificial intelligence, bionanotechnology and genetic engineering to produce the one-world transhuman. This is being pushed by powerful interests, who, according to Guerini, are using a rainbow, transgenic left and LGBTQ+ organisations to promote a new synthetic identity and claim to new rights. She says this is an attack on life, on nature, on “what is born, as opposed to artificial” and adds that all ties to the real, natural world must be severed. It is interesting that in its report Future of Food, the UK supermarket giant Sainsbury’s celebrates a future where we are microchipped and tracked and neural laces have the potential to see all of our genetic, health and situational data recorded, stored and analysed by algorithms that could work out exactly what food (delivered by drone) we need to support us at a particular time in our life. All sold as ‘personal optimisation’. Moreover, it is likely, according to the report, that we will be getting key nutrients through implants. Part of these nutrients will come in the form of lab-grown food and insects. A neural lace is an ultra-thin mesh that can be implanted in the skull, forming a collection of electrodes capable of monitoring brain function. It creates an interface between the brain and the machine. Sainsbury’s does a pretty good job of trying to promote a dystopian future where AI has taken your job, but, according to the report, you have lots of time to celebrate the wonderful, warped world of ‘food culture’ created by the supermarket and your digital overlords. Technofeudalism meets transhumanism — all for your convenience, of course. Imagine, as you sit all day unemployed in your high-rise, your ‘food’ will be delivered via an online platform bought courtesy of your programmable universal basic income digital money. Food courtesy of Gates-promoted farms manned by driverless machines, monitored by drones and doused with chemicals to produce crops from patented genetically modified seeds for industrial ‘biomatter’ to be engineered, processed and constituted into something resembling food. Enjoy and be happy eating your fake food, stripped of satisfying productive endeavour and genuine self-fulfilment. But really, it will not be a problem. You can sit all day and exist virtually in Zuckerberg’s fantasy metaverse. Property-less and happy in your open prison of state dependency, track and chip surveillance passports and financial exclusion via programmable currency. A world also in which bodily integrity no longer exists courtesy of a mandatory vaccination agenda linked to emerging digital-biopharmaceutical technologies. But none of this will happen overnight. And whether the technology will deliver remains to be seen. Those who are promoting this brave new world might have overplayed their hand but will spend the following decades trying to drive their vision forward. But arrogance is their Achilles heel. There is still time to educate, to organise, to resist and to agitate against this hubris, not least by challenging the industrial food giants and the system that sustains them and by advocating for and creating grass-root food movements and local economies that strengthen food sovereignty. Max Weber (1864-1920) was a prominent German sociologist who developed influential theories on rationality and authority. He examined the different types of rationality that underpinned systems of authority. He argued that modern Western societies were based on legal-rational authority and had moved away from systems that were based on traditional authority and charismatic authority. Traditional authority derives its power from long-standing customs and traditions, while charismatic authority is based on the exceptional personal qualities or charisma of a leader. According to Weber, the legal-rational authority that characterises Western capitalist industrial society is based on instrumental rationality that focuses on the most efficient means to achieve given ends. This type of rationality manifests in bureaucratic power. Weber contrasted this with another form of rationality: value rationality that is based on conscious beliefs in the inherent value of certain behaviour. While Weber saw the benefits of instrumental rationality in terms of increased efficiency, he feared that this could lead to a stifling “iron cage” of a rule-based order and rule following (instrumental rationality) as an end in itself. The result would be humanity’s “polar night of icy darkness.” Today, technological change is sweeping across the planet and presents many challenges. The danger is of a technological iron cage in the hands of an elite that uses technology for malevolent purposes. Lewis Coyne of Exeter University says: “We do not — or should not — want to become a society in which things of deeper significance are appreciated only for any instrumental value. The challenge, therefore, is to delimit instrumental rationality and the technologies that embody it by protecting that which we value intrinsically, above and beyond mere utility.” He adds that we must decide which technologies we are for, to what ends, and how they can be democratically managed, with a view to the kind of society we wish to be. A major change that we have seen in recent years is the increasing dominance of cloud-based services and platforms. In the food and agriculture sector, we are seeing the rollout of these phenomena tied to a techno solutionist ‘data-driven’ or ‘precision’ agriculture legitimised by ‘humanitarian’ notions of ‘helping farmers’, ‘saving the planet’ and ‘feeding the world’ in the face of some kind of impending Malthusian catastrophe. A part-fear mongering, part-self-aggrandisement narrative promoted by those who have fuelled ecological devastation, corporate dependency, land dispossession, food insecurity and farmer indebtedness as a result of the global food regime that they helped to create and profited from. Now, with a highly profitable but flawed carbon credit trading scheme and a greenwashed technology-driven eco-modernism, they are supposedly going to save humanity from itself. In the agrifood sector, we are seeing the rollout of data-driven or precision approaches to agriculture by the likes of Microsoft, Syngenta, Bayer and Amazon centred on cloud-based data information services. Data-driven agriculture mines data to be exploited by the agribusiness/big tech giants to instruct farmers what and how much to produce and what type of proprietary inputs they must purchase and from whom. Data owners (Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet etc.), input suppliers (Bayer, Corteva, Syngenta, Cargill etc.) and retail concerns (Amazon, Walmart etc) aim to secure the commanding heights of the global agrifood economy through their monopolistic platforms. But what does this model of agriculture look like in practice? Let us use Bayer’s digital platform Climate FieldView as an example. It collects data from satellites and sensors in fields and on tractors and then uses algorithms to advise farmers on their farming practices: when and what to plant, how much pesticide to spray, how much fertiliser to apply etc. To be part of Bayer’s Carbon Program, farmers have to be enrolled in FieldView. Bayer then uses the FieldView app to instruct farmers on the implementation of just two practices that are said to sequester carbon in the soils: reduced tillage or no-till farming and the planting of cover crops. Through the app, the company monitors these two practices and estimates the amount of carbon that the participating farmers have sequestered. Farmers are then supposed to be paid according to Bayer’s calculations, and Bayer uses that information to claim carbon credits and sell these in carbon markets. Bayer also has a programme in the US called ForGround. Upstream companies can use the platform to advertise and offer discounts for equipment, seeds and other inputs. For example, getting more farmers to use reduced tillage or no-till is of huge benefit to Bayer (sold on the basis of it being ‘climate friendly’ as it keeps carbon in the soil). The kind of reduced tillage or no-till promoted by Bayer requires dousing fields with its RoundUp (toxic glyphosate) or some other toxic herbicide and planting seeds of its genetically engineered herbicide tolerant soybeans or hybrid maize. And what of the cover crops referred to above? Bayer also intends to profit from the promotion of cover crops. It has taken majority ownership of a seed company developing a gene-edited cover crop, called CoverCress. Seeds of CoverCress will be sold to farmers who are enrolled in ForGround and the crop will be sold as a biofuel. But Bayer’s big target is the downstream food companies which can use the platform to claim emissions reductions in their supply chains. Agribusiness corporations and the big tech companies are jointly developing carbon farming platforms to influence farmers on their choice of inputs and farming practices (big tech companies, like Microsoft and IBM, are major buyers of carbon credits). The non-profit GRAIN says (see the article The corporate agenda behind carbon farming) that Bayer is gaining increasing control over farmers in various countries, dictating exactly how they farm and what inputs they use through its Carbon Program. GRAIN argues that, for corporations, carbon farming is all about increasing their control within the food system and is certainly not about sequestering carbon. Digital platforms are intended to be one-stop shops for carbon credits, seeds, pesticides and fertilisers and agronomic advice, all supplied by the company, which gets the added benefit of control over the data harvested from the participating farms. Yanis Varoufakis, former finance minister of Greece, argues that what we are seeing is a shift from capitalism to techno-feudalism. He argues that tech giants like Apple, Meta and Amazon act as modern-day feudal lords. Users of digital platforms (such as companies or farmers) essentially become ‘cloud serfs’, and ‘rent’ (fees, data etc) is extracted from them for being on a platform. In feudalism (land) rent drives the system. In capitalism, profits drive the system. Varoufakis says that markets are being replaced by algorithmic ‘digital fiefdoms’. Although digital platforms require some form of capitalist production, as companies like Amazon or Bayer need manufacturers or farmers to produce goods for their platforms, the new system represents a significant shift in power dynamics, favouring those who own and control the platforms. Whether this system is technofeudalism, hypercapitalism or something else is open to debate. But we should at least be able to agree on one thing: the changes we are seeing are having profound impacts on economies as well as producers and populations that are increasingly surveilled as they are compelled to shift their activities and lives online. The very corporations that are responsible for the problems of the prevailing food system merely offer more of the same, this time packaged in an app-friendly, genetically engineered, ecomodernist, fake-green, carbon-trading wrapping. Elected officials are facilitating this by putting the needs of monopolistic global interests ahead of ordinary people’s personal freedoms and workers’ rights, as well as the needs of independent local producers, enterprises and markets. For instance, the Indian government has in recent times signed memoranda of understanding (MoU) with Amazon, Bayer, Microsoft and Syngenta to rollout data-driven, precision agriculture. Integral to A standardised ‘one world agriculture’ under the control of these companies based on genetically engineered seeds, laboratory created products that resemble food and farming without farmers, with the entire agrifood chain, from field (or lab) to retail in their hands. In response, a ‘citizen letter’ (July 2024) was sent to the government. It stated that it is not clear what the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) will learn from Bayer that the well-paid public sector scientists of the institution cannot develop themselves. The letter says entities that have been responsible for causing an economic and environmental crisis in Indian agriculture are being partnered by ICAR. The letter raises some key concerns. Where is the democratic debate on carbon credit markets? Is the ICAR ensuring that the farmers get the best rather than biased advice that boosts the further rollout of proprietary products? Is there a system in place for the ICAR to develop research and education agendas from the farmers it is supposed to serve as opposed to being led by the whims and business ideas of corporations? The authors of the letter note that copies of the MoUs are not being shared proactively in the public domain by the ICAR. The letter asks that the ICAR suspends the signed MoUs, shares all details in the public domain and desists from signing any more such MoUs without necessary public debate. As will be made clear in the following chapters, this is part of a broader geopolitical strategy to ensure India’s food dependence on foreign corporations and eradicate any semblance of food democracy (or indeed national sovereignty). In a October 2024 report, GRAIN.org sheds some light: “Jayachandra Sharma, a farmer leader from India’s Karnataka Rajya Ryot Sangha farmer union, sees these developments and the digitalisation of agriculture as part of a broader strategy to push millions of farmers out of agriculture and make India’s food supply dependent on global finance and foreign corporations. Given how companies like Microsoft, Syngenta, Amazon and JD.com are expanding, he could well be right.” Genuine approaches to addressing the challenges humanity faces are being ignored by policymakers or cynically attacked by corporate lobbyists. These solutions involve systemic shifts in agricultural, food and economic systems with a focus on low-consumption (energy) lifestyles, localisation and an ecologically sustainable agroecology. As activist John Wilson says, this is based on creative solutions, a connection to nature and the land, nurturing people, peaceful transformation and solidarity. Co-operative labour, fellowship and our long-standing spiritual connection to the land should inform how as a society we should live. This stands in stark contrast to the values and impacts of capitalism and technology based on instrumental rationality and too often fuelled by revenue streams and the goal to control populations. When we hear talk of a ‘spiritual connection’, what is meant by ‘spiritual’? In a broad sense it can be regarded as a concept that refers to thoughts, beliefs and feelings about the meaning of life, rather than just physical existence. A sense of connection to something greater than ourselves. Something akin to Weber’s concept of value rationality. The spiritual, the diverse and the local are juxtaposed with the selfishness of modern urban society, the increasing homogeneity of thought and practice and an instrumental rationality which becomes an end in itself. Having a direct link with nature/the land is fundamental to developing an appreciation of a type of ‘being’ and an ‘understanding’ that results in a reality worth living in. However, what we are seeing is an agenda based on a different set of values rooted in a lust for power and money and the total subjugation of ordinary people (and farmers) being rammed through under the false promise of techno solutionism (think neural laces to detect moods implanted in the skull, programmable digital money, track and trace technology etc.) and some distant notion of a techno utopia that leave malevolent power relations intact and unchallenged. Is this then to be humanity’s never-ending “polar night of icy darkness”? Hopefully not. This vision is being imposed from above. Ordinary people (whether, for example, farmers in India or those being beaten down through austerity policies) find themselves on the receiving end of a class war being waged against them by a mega rich elite. Indeed, in 1941, Herbert Marcuse stated that technology could be used as an instrument for control and domination. Precisely the agenda of the likes of Bayer, the Gates Foundation, BlackRock and the World Bank, which are trying to eradicate genuine diversity and impose a one-size-fits-all model of thinking and behaviour. A final thought courtesy of civil rights campaigner Frederick Douglass in a speech from 1857: “Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will. Find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have found out the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them, and these will continue till they are resisted with either words or blows, or with both. The limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress.” In October 2024, Indian journalist Bharat Dogra noted the following trend in agriculture: “Small farmers are being displaced and family farms are disappearing as those who are truly dedicated to farming have to say tearful farewells to their farms, while billionaires and richest corporations acquire millions of acres of farmland. While small scale food processors too are being pushed out and possibilities of direct contacts between farmers and consumers to promote sustainable livelihoods based on making available healthy food to all are diminishing, giant multinational companies are taking up food production, trade and processing in ways that are harmful for both consumers and farmers.” It might be an inconvenient truth for big agribusiness, land investors and agritech concerns that prefer large-scale industrial agriculture, but small-scale farmers and peasants feed most of the world. That means the types of farms Dogra refers to. What is more, small farms are more productive than their larger counterparts, which is why they are essential for food security. However, the trend noted by Dogra is apparent across the world. And it is something that, as yet, is still in the early stages in India. But have no doubt, this is the plan for India too, where small-scale farmers make up 85 per cent of the farming community. In late 2021, the Indian government announced that three important farm laws, which would have introduced neoliberal shock therapy to the agricultural sector, would be repealed after a one-year farmers’ mobilisation against the legislation (although discussed below, for more in-depth insight into the issues that sparked the protest, see the relevant chapters in Food, Dependency and Dispossession: Resisting the New World Order). The repeal of the three laws was little more than a tactical manoeuvre given that state elections were upcoming in key rural heartlands in 2022. The powerful global interests behind the legislation have not gone away and farmers’ concerns remain highly relevant. These interests have been behind a decades-long agenda to displace the prevailing agri-food system in India. The laws might have been struck down, but the goal to capture and radically restructure the sector remains. The farmers’ struggle in India is not over. The repeal of the controversial farm laws in India may have been seen as a victory for protesting farmers, but it seems the government is pursuing alternative strategies to achieve similar agricultural reforms. These new approaches, while less direct, could potentially implement many of the changes originally proposed in the repealed legislation. The government seems to be gradually introducing smaller, incremental changes to agricultural policies that align with some of the original goals of the farm laws. For instance, an increased focus on digitalisation and technological solutions in agriculture could indirectly achieve some of the aims of the laws, and encouraging private investment and partnerships in the agricultural sector through other means could still lead to increased corporatisation. This chapter and the following three chapters will address this and will discuss the implications of a number of agreements between the Indian government and the likes of Amazon, Bayer and Syngenta that had little to no democratic oversight. But we will begin by looking at the claim that the BJP-led government was seeking to extract revenge for the humiliating defeat it suffered at the hands of the farmers. This claim was made during a press conference that took place in Delhi in October 2023 held by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) (United Farmers Front). The SKM was formed in November 2020 as a coalition of more than 40 Indian farmers’ unions to coordinate non-violent resistance against the three farm acts initiated two months before. Asserting that the laws violated the constitution and were anti-farmer and pro big business, the SKM announced renewed agitation and expressed grave concern about a crackdown by the government against the online media platform NewsClick, which supported the farmers throughout their one-year struggle. Those present heard that there has been “baseless dishonest and false allegations in the Newsclick FIR against the historic farmers’ struggle” and that the “FIR accuses the farmers’ movement as anti-national, funded by foreign and terrorist forces.” An FIR is a ‘first information report’: a document prepared by police in India when they receive information about the commission of a “cognisable” (serious) offence. Delhi Police issued an FIR against NewsClick founder Prabir Purkayastha and the human resources head Amit Chakravarty, which infers that the farmers’ movement was aimed at stopping the supply of essential goods for citizens and creating law and order issues. An article on The Hindu newspaper’s Frontline portal describes the nature of the FIR, which goes far beyond the farmers’ issue, and concludes police actions along with the FIR marks a major low point for media freedom in India. According to Frontline, the police raids on the offices of NewsClick and the residences of virtually anyone associated with it; the indiscriminate seizure of the electronic devices of journalists and other employees; the sealing of the news portal’s main office; the arrest of its founder-editor and its administrative officer on terrorism-related charges; and the searches conducted at the premises of NewsClick and the home of its founder-editor mark the lowest point for media freedom in India since the Emergency of 1975-1977. The withdrawal of the FIR against Newsclick was called for during the press conference. There was also a demand for the immediate release of NewsClick journalists. The SKM said that farmers across the country would burn copies of the FIR on 6 November 2023 after a sustained campaign at village level against the government’s pro-corporate policies from 1-5 November. The farmers’ coalition also pledged to campaign in five poll-going states with the slogan “Oppose Corporate, Punish BJP, Save Country.” It was also announced that a 72-hour sit-in would take place in front of the Raj Bhawans (official residences of state governors) in state capitals between 26 and 28 November. On November 13, 2024, the Supreme Court of India declared Purkayastha’s arrest and subsequent remand as invalid, emphasising that he and his legal counsel were not provided with the grounds for his arrest prior to his remand hearing. The court criticised the police for circumventing due process and noted that the lack of communication regarding the grounds of arrest severely hindered Purkayastha’s ability to defend himself. The Supreme Court’s ruling mandated his release upon fulfilling bail bond requirements set by the trial court. The case highlights ongoing concerns regarding press freedom in India, particularly in relation to government actions against journalists and media outlets perceived as critical of state policies. The SKM stated that the farmers’ movement was committed and patriotic and saw through the “nefarious plan” of the three farm laws to withdraw government support from agriculture and hand over farming, mandis (state-run wholesale agricultural markets) and public food distribution to corporations led by Adani, Ambani, Tata, Cargill, Pepsi, Walmart, Bayer, Amazon and others. It added that the farmers exposed the corporate-backed plan of depriving the people of India of food security, pauperising farmers, changing cropping patterns to suit corporations and allowing the free penetration of foreign corporations into India’s food processing market. Those in attendance also heard about the hardships experienced by farmers during the one-year agitation: “In the process, the farmers braved water cannons, teargas shelling, roadblocks with huge containers, deep road cuts, lathi charge, cold and hot weather. Over 13 months, they sacrificed 732 martyrs… This was a patriotic movement of the highest quality in the face of repression by a fascist government serving interests of Imperialist exploiters.” State investment in agriculture infrastructure was called for, along with the promotion of profitable farming, the facilitation and securing of modern food processing, marketing and consumer networks under the collective ownership and control of peasant-worker cooperatives. Accusing the government of acting on behalf of corporate interests, one speaker said that it had targeted Newsclick because it only did what a genuine news media should have been doing — reporting on the truth, the problems of farmers and the nature of the struggle. It was claimed that: “The BJP Government is using the farcical FIR to spread a canard that the farmers’ movement was anti-people, anti-national and backed by terrorist funding routed through Newsclick. This is factually wrong and mischievously inserted to portray the movement in bad light and seeking to extract revenge for the humiliating defeat they suffered at the hands of the farmers of our country.” The farmers’ coalition argued that the government is moving to falsely charge the farmers movement of being foreign funded and sponsored by terrorist forces, while it is “promoting FDI, Foreign MNCs, big corporations into agriculture.” The coalition said it remains committed to saving the rural economy, preventing foreign looting and rejuvenating the village economy in order to build a strong India. In 2024, farmers were still protesting. Facilitation of the neoliberal corporatisation of farming that sparked the previous protest remains on the board and farmers’ demands have not been met. The World Bank, the WTO, global agribusiness and financial capital are working to corporatise India’s agriculture sector. This plan goes back to the early 1990s and India’s foreign exchange crisis, which was used (and manipulated) to set this plan in motion. This debt-trap ‘structural adjustment’ policy and process involves displacing the current food production system with contract farming and an industrial model of agriculture and food retail that serves the above interests. The aim is to reduce the role of the public sector in agriculture to a facilitator of private capital, which requires industrial commodity-crop farming. The beneficiaries will include Cargill, Archer Daniels Midlands, Louis Dreyfus, Bunge and India’s retail and agribusiness giants as well as the global agritech, seed and agrochemical corporations and the big tech companies with their ‘data-driven agriculture’. The plan is to displace the peasantry, create a land market and amalgamate landholdings to form larger farms that are more suited to international land investors and industrial farming. As a result, there has been an ongoing strategy to make farming non-viable for many of India’s smallholder farmers and force hundreds of millions out of farming and into urban centres that have already sprawled to form peri-urban areas, which often tend to contain the most agriculturally fertile land. The loss of such land should be a concern in itself. It is not as though farmers want to leave farming. It tends to be in their blood. But if the are unable to cover the costs of production and make a decent living due to the lack of guaranteed prices and the issues laid out below, they will flock to the cities to try to gain a foothold in urban economies. And what will those hundreds of millions do? Driven to the cities because of deliberate impoverishment, they will serve as cheap labour or, more likely, an unemployed or underemployed reserve army of labour for global capital — labour which is being replaced with automation. They will be in search of jobs that are increasingly hard to come by the (World Bank reports that there is more than 23 per cent youth unemployment in India). The impoverishment of farmers results from rising input costs, the withdrawal of government assistance, debt and debt repayments and the impacts of cheap, subsidised imports, which depress farmers’ incomes. While corporations in India receive massive handouts and have loans written off, the lack of a secure income, exposure to volatile and manipulated international market prices and cheap imports contribute to farmers’ misery of not being able to cover the costs of production and secure a decent standard of living. The pressure from the richer nations for the Indian government to further reduce support given to farmers and open up to imports and export-oriented ‘free market’ trade is based on nothing but hypocrisy. For instance, policy analyst Devinder Sharma comments that subsidies provided to US wheat and rice farmers are more than the market worth of these two crops. He also notes that, per day, each cow in Europe receives a subsidy worth more than an Indian farmer’s daily income. The World Bank, the WTO, global institutional investors and transnational agribusiness giants require corporate-dictated contract farming and full-scale neoliberal marketisation for the sale and procurement of produce. They demand that India sacrifice its farmers and its own food security for the benefit of a handful of billionaires. Farmers are merely regarded as producers of raw materials (crops) to be fleeced by suppliers of chemical and biotech inputs and the food processing and retail conglomerates. The more farmers can be squeezed, the greater the profits these corporations can extract. This entails creating farmer dependency on costly external inputs and corporate-dominated markets and supply chains. Global agrifood corporations have cleverly and cynically weaved a narrative that equates eradicating food sovereignty and creating dependency with ‘food security’. In 2018, a charter was released by the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (an umbrella group of around 250 farmers’ organisations). The farmers were concerned about the deepening penetration of predatory corporations and the unbearable burden of indebtedness and the widening disparities between farmers and other sectors. They wanted the government to take measures to bring down the input costs of farming, while making purchases of farm produce below the minimum support price (MSP) both illegal and punishable. The charter also called for a special discussion on the universalisation of the public distribution system (PDS), the withdrawal of pesticides that have been banned elsewhere and the non-approval of genetically engineered seeds without a comprehensive need and impact assessment. Other demands included no foreign direct investment in agriculture and food processing, the protection of farmers from corporate plunder in the name of contract farming, investment in farmers’ collectives to create farmer producer organisations and peasant cooperatives and the promotion of agroecology based on suitable cropping patterns and local seed diversity revival. These demands remain relevant today due to government inaction. In fact, the three farm laws that were repealed aimed to do precisely the opposite. They were intended to expose Indian agriculture to a massive dose of neoliberal marketisation and shock therapy. Although the laws were struck down, the corporate interests behind them never went away and are adamant that the Indian government implements the policies they require. This would mean India reducing the state procurement and distribution of essential foodstuffs and eradicating its food buffer stocks — so vital to national food security — and purchasing the nation’s needs with its foreign exchange reserves on manipulated global commodity markets. This would make the country wholly dependent on attracting foreign investment and international finance. To ensure food sovereignty and national food security, the Mumbai-based Research Unit for Political Economy (RUPE) says that MSPs, through government procurement of essential crops and commodities, should be extended to many major cops such as maize, cotton, oilseed and pulses. At the moment, only farmers in certain states who produce rice and wheat are the main beneficiaries of government procurement at the MSP. Since per capita protein consumption in India is abysmally low and has fallen further during the liberalisation era, the provision of pulses in the PDS is long overdue and desperately needed. The PDS works with central government, via the Food Corporation of India, being responsible for buying food grains from farmers at MSPs at state-run market yards or mandis. It then allocates the grains to each state. State governments then deliver to ‘ration shops’. In 2024, farm union leaders were still seeking guarantees for a minimum purchase price for crops. Although the government announces support prices for more than 20 crops each year, government agencies buy only rice and wheat at the support level and, even then, in only some states. State agencies buy the two staples at government-fixed minimum support prices to build reserves to run the world’s biggest food welfare programme that entitles more than 800 million Indians to free rice and wheat. Currently, that’s more than half the population who per household will receive five kilos per month of these essential foodstuffs for at least the next four years, which would be denied to them by the ‘free market’. As we have seen throughout the world, corporate plunder under the guise of neoliberal marketisation is no friend of the poor and those in need who rely on state support to exist. If public procurement of a wider range of crops at the MSP were to occur — and MSPs were guaranteed for rice and wheat across all states — it would help address hunger and malnutrition, encourage crop diversification and ease farmer distress. By helping hundreds of millions involved in farming this way, it would give a massive boost to rural spending power and the economy in general. Instead of rolling back the role of the public sector and surrendering the system to what constitutes a transnational billionaire class and its corporations, there is a need to further expand official procurement and public distribution. The RUPE notes, it would cost around 20 per cent of the current handouts (‘incentives’) received by corporations and their super-rich owners, which do not benefit the bulk of the wider population in any way. It is also worth considering that the loans provided to just five large corporations in India were in 2016 equal to the entire farm debt. However, it is clear that the existence of the MSP, the public distribution system and publicly held buffer stocks are an impediment to global agribusiness interests. In the meantime, the current administration is keen to demonstrate to international finance capital and agricapital that it is being tough on farmers and remains steadfast in its willingness to facilitate the pro-corporate agenda. In 2024, after the breakdown in talks between government and farmers’ representatives, the farmers decided to peacefully march to and demonstrate in Delhi. But at the Delhi border, farmers were met with barricades, tear gas and state violence. However, to date, current farmers’ resistance lacks the momentum of the 2020-21 protests. Furthermore, by one means or another, as the following chapters indicate, the central government continues to ignore the key demands of farmers and hand over the sector to global agribusiness and other corporate interests Farmers produce humanities’ most essential need and are not the ‘enemy within’. The spotlight should fall on the ‘enemy beyond’. Instead of depicting farmers as ‘anti-national’, as sections of the media and prominent commentators in India try to, the focus needs to be on challenging those interests that seek to gain from undermining India’s food security and sovereignty and the impoverishment of farmers. The citizens of India have a problem. In what the media like to call ‘the world’s biggest democracy’, there is a serious, proven conflict of interest among officials in the areas of science, agriculture and agricultural research that results in privileging the needs of powerful private interests ahead of farmers and ordinary people. This has been a longstanding concern. In 2013, for instance, prominent campaigner and environmentalist Aruna Rodrigues said: “The Ministry of Agriculture has handed Monsanto and the industry access to our agri-research public institutions, placing them in a position to seriously influence agri-policy in India. You cannot have a conflict of interest larger or more alarming than this one.” In 2020, Kavitha Kuruganti (Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture) stated that the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee had acted more like a servant for Monsanto: there is an ongoing revolving door between crop developers (even patent holders) and regulators, with developers-cum-lobbyists sitting on regulatory bodies. However, the capture of public policymaking space by the private sector is set to accelerate due to a recent spate of memorandums of understanding between state institutions and influential private corporations involved in agriculture and agricultural services, including Bayer and Amazon. As part of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and Amazon (June 2023), farmers will produce for Amazon Fresh stores in India as part of a ‘farm to fork’ supply chain. It will see “critical inputs” in agriculture and “season-based crop plans” in collaboration with Amazon based on “technologies, capacity building and transfer of new knowledge.” This corporate jargon ties in with the much-publicised notion of ‘data-driven agriculture’ centred on cloud-based data information services (which Amazon also offers). In this model, data is to be accessed and controlled by corporates and the farmer will be told how much production is expected, how much rain is anticipated, what type of soil quality there is, what must be produced and what type of genetically engineered seeds and inputs they must purchase and from whom. This amounts to a recolonisation of Indian agriculture, which will eventually involve a handful of data owners (Microsoft, Amazon etc.), input suppliers (Bayer, Corteva, Syngenta etc.) and retail concerns (Amazon and Walmart-Flipkart — both firms already control 60 per cent of India’s e-commerce market) at the heights of the agrifood economy, determining the nature of agriculture and peddling industrial food. Farmers who remain in this AI-driven system (a stated aim is farmerless farms) will be reduced to exploitable labour at the mercy of global conglomerates. This is part of a broader strategy to shift hundreds of millions out of agriculture, ensure India’s food dependence on global finance and foreign corporations and eradicate any semblance of food democracy (or national sovereignty). In addition to the MoU with Amazon, an MoU was signed between the ICAR and Bayer in September 2023. Bayer (it bought Monsanto in 2018), which profits from various environmentally harmful and disease-causing chemicals like glyphosate, signed the MoU to help “develop resource-efficient, climate-resilient solutions for crops, varieties, crop protection, weed and mechanization”, according to the ICAR website. The ICAR is responsible for co-ordinating agricultural education and research in India, and Bayer seems likely to exploit the ICAR’s vast infrastructure and networks to pursue its own commercial plans, including boosting sales of toxic proprietary products. But that’s not all. According to the non-profit GRAIN in its article ‘The corporate agenda behind carbon farming’, Bayer is gaining increasing control over farmers in various countries, dictating exactly how they farm and what inputs they use through its Carbon Program. GRAIN says: “You can see in the evolution of Bayer’s programmes that, for corporations, carbon farming is all about increasing their control within the food system. It’s certainly not about sequestering carbon.” Given the seriousness of what is laid out by GRAIN in its article, India’s citizens and farmers should take heed, especially as the ICAR website states that a focus of the MoU with Bayer will be on developing carbon credit markets. In a letter (July 2004) to Rabindra Padaria, principal scientist at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), and Himanshu Pathak, director-general of the ICAR, Aruna Rodrigues says: “Inking in ICAR’s formal partnership with Bayer (Monsanto) quite simply confirms straightforwardly that the ICAR protects its interest, which is the same as those of Bayer-Monsanto, large chemical/herbicide corporates… the ICAR has ditched its mandate to Indian farmers and farming, which is to promote farmer interests as a priority in an unbiased and objective assessment of what is right and good for Indian farming and food… “ A separate citizens’ letter was also sent to Pathak on the various MoUs that the Indian government has signed with influential private orporations. Hundreds of scientists, farmer leaders, farmers and ordinary citizens signed the letter. It states: “Bayer is a company notorious for its anti-people, anti-nature business products and operations in itself and, furthermore, after its takeover of Monsanto. Its deadly poisons have violated basic human rights of peoples across the world, and it is a company that has always prioritised profits over people and planet.” It goes on to say that it is not clear what the ICAR will learn from Bayer that the well-paid public sector scientists of the institution cannot develop themselves. The letter says entities that have been responsible for causing an economic and environmental crisis in Indian agriculture are being partnered by ICAR for so-called solutions when these entities are only interested in their profits and not sustainability (or any other nomenclature they use). The letter asks that the ICAR suspends the signed MoUs, shares all details in the public domain and desists from signing any more such MoUs without necessary public debate. However, on 19 July 2024, there were reports that the ICAR had signed another MoU, this time with Syngenta for promoting climate resilient agriculture and training programmes. In response, the authors of the letter state that the ICAR has (again) partnered with a corporation that has a track record of anti-nature and anti-people activities, selling toxic products like paraquat, class action suits against its corn seeds and anti-competitive behaviour. It is becoming clear who the ICAR actually serves. Let us return to Aruna Rodrigues and her letter to Rabindra Padaria (IARI) and Himanshu Pathak (ICAR) for additional insight. Rodrigues’ letter focuses on the commercial cultivation of basmati rice varieties tolerant to imazethapyr-based, non-selective herbicides. These chemicals can be liberally sprayed on herbicide tolerant (HT) crops because the crops have been manipulated to withstand the toxic impacts of spraying. The HT varieties of rice have undergone some form of mutagenesis rather than genetic engineering. Mutagenesis has traditionally involved subjecting plant cells to chemical or physical agents (for example, radiation) that cause mutations to the DNA in the hope that a resulting mutation may produce a desirable effect in the plant. This kind of mutation breeding has been used for decades but only affects a minority of the plants on the market. Industry watchdog GMWatch says this risky technology (mutagenesis breeding) in the past managed to escape regulation. So, this HT crop by the mutagenesis route is not defined as ‘genetic engineering’ (the method usually used to create HT crops) and therefore falls outside the purview of current regulations on genetically modified organisms. Although the Supreme Court-appointed Technical Expert Committee (TEC) bars HT crops (a) for being an HT crop and (b) on account of contamination of crops in a centre of genetic diversity, it has been a long-standing aim of biotech companies like Bayer (Monsanto) to get HT crops cultivated in India. Rodrigues asks: “Is it a deliberate decision of the ICAR to use the mutagenesis route to produce HT rice varieties (tolerant to imazethapyr) with the explicit objective to bypass the formal regulation of GE crops/GMOs?” Rodrigues accuses the ICAR of effectively ditching its mandate to Indian farmers, many of whom regard organic farming as their competitive advantage. This step is also a potential threat to India’s export markets, which are based on organic standards, along with the necessary co-surety that India’s foods and farms are not contaminated by herbicides, a consequence of using HT crops. By adding a trait for herbicide tolerance, the ICAR is informed: “ICAR’s action directly impacts this vital issue of contaminating our germ plasm in rice and contravenes a Supreme Court Order of “No Contamination”. Furthermore, our export markets for basmati are in excess of US $5 billion in 2023-24. Your action will also directly impact India’s exports and thereby, impact farmer export potential, incomes and income opportunities that premium prices provide.” Moreover, Rodrigues asserts that the entire mutagenesis process for HT rice must be elaborated, especially when the mutant variety is for the purpose of human consumption. The ICAR is duty-bound to provide, for example, whether a physical or a chemical mutagen was used, the range of doses used and the toxicity for the said material, the herbicide(s) used (a key concern, given the effects of certain herbicides on human health — see below) to test the HT of the basmati rice being used, the concentrations of the herbicides used and the genetic mechanism by which HT rice through mutagenesis has a resistant gene to imazethapyr. While the issue of intellectual property rights for the HT rice varieties using mutagenesis is unclear, the ICAR and IARI have executed a technology transfer agreement of the HT trait for commercial cultivation. In her letter, Rodrigues states that, based on empirical evidence of 35 years of HT crops in the US and Argentina, HT crops are a failed technology: it spawns super weeds, increased herbicide use and no added performance yield. Moreover, for India, HT crops are a perverse use of technology, whether genetic engineering or through mutagenesis, that risks small and marginal farmers’ crops and herbs and plants used in many Ayurvedic medicines because of herbicide drift. It will also uniquely impact the employment of women in weeding. Rodrigues goes on to state (with evidence provided) that in the US overall herbicide use has increased more than tenfold since the introduction of HT Crops (1992-2012 figure). In addition, HT crops are designed for monocultures and completely unsuited to Indian small-holder, multi-crop farming: anything not HT will be destroyed, the resistant crop stands, but everything else dies, including non-target organisms. The herbicides used with HT crops are also a major human health issue. There is a strong link between glyphosate and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. In relation to this, there are more than 100,000 lawsuits winding their way through US Courts. Glyphosate (used in Bayer’s Roundup herbicide) is also an endocrine disruptor and is linked to birth defects. Monsanto and the US Environmental Protection Agency had both known for over 40 years that glyphosate and its formulations cause cancer. Other herbicides used by Bayer include glufosinate (used in its Liberty herbicide), which is acknowledged as more toxic than glyphosate and, like it, is a systemic, broad spectrum, non-selective herbicide. It is a neurotoxin that can cause nerve damage and birth defects and is damaging to most plants that come into contact with it. Glufinosate is banned in Europe and not permitted in India. It has been implicated in brain developmental abnormalities in animal studies and is very persistent in the environment, so it will certainly contaminate water supplies in addition to food where it will be absorbed. Imazethapyr (contained in Bayer’s Adue herbicide) is also a systemic broad-spectrum herbicide and is banned in some countries and not approved for use in the EU. Prof. Jack Heinemann (University of Canterbury in New Zealand) adds that the likes of imazethapyr must be tested for their ability to cause bacterial antibiotic resistance. An important concern given that India’s population has some of the highest levels of antibiotic resistance in the world. Any spread of HT crops would put people at severe risk of resistance and disease. Despite these environmental and health concerns, the herbicide market in India is projected to grow by around 54 per cent in the next five years, from USD 361.85 million in 2024 to USD 558.17 million by 2029. Rodrigues concludes: “In view of the above evidence of serious irreversible harm to health, food and agriculture across several dimensions and contravention of the PP (Precautionary Principle), it is a required scientific response for the ICAR to immediately withdraw HT rice varieties and desist from introducing any HT crop through mutagenesis.” Environmentalist and campaigner Rosemary Mason has been relentlessly exposing the insidious effects of agrochemicals on human health and the environment through a decade-long series of incisive reports. Many of these reports have taken the form of scathing open letters directed at corporations, regulators and officials in the UK and the EU. Mason has never held back in her condemnations of the agrochemical giants. After Bayer’s acquisition of Monsanto in 2018, her focus sharpened on Bayer, scrutinising its troubling history and its actions, not least during one of humanity’s darkest chapters: Nazi Germany. Bayer’s complicity as part of IG Farben, a chemical and pharmaceutical conglomerate notorious for its involvement in war crimes, is well documented. The company was formed in 1925 from a merger of six chemical firms: Agfa, BASF, Bayer, Chemische Fabrik Griesheim-Elektron, Hoechst and Weiler-ter-Meer. Bayer was not merely an observer but an active participant in heinous medical experiments conducted on concentration camp inmates. These experiments involved testing drugs on unwilling subjects, including those at Auschwitz, where prisoners were deliberately infected with diseases to evaluate Bayer’s pharmaceuticals. During World War I, Bayer was involved in the development of chemical weapons, including chlorine and mustard gas. As part of IG Farben, Bayer later contributed to the creation of nerve agents like Tabun, Sarin and Soman. Post-war, Bayer transitioned these chemical developments into pesticides such as parathion, which are neurotoxic. In addition, IG Farben was implicated in the production of Zyklon B, the gas used in concentration camps. Executives from IG Farben were convicted for their roles in war crimes at the Nuremberg Trials. . IG Farben Building, Frankfurt, completed in 1931 and seized by the Allies in 1945 as the headquarters of the Supreme Allied Command. In 2001 it became part of the University of Frankfurt. (Licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0) . Bayer’s leadership was fully aware of these atrocities yet chose profit over ethics, benefiting from the forced labour of concentration camp inmates to produce essential chemicals for the Nazi war machine. The aftermath of World War II saw Bayer and other IG Farben companies face minimal repercussions for their actions. While some executives were tried, they received light sentences or were released early, allowing them to reclaim positions of power within their companies. As for Bayer, things did not stop with the end of the war. The Powerbase website provides a very long list of Bayer’s corporate wrongdoings since 1945, including allegations of corporate bullying, monopolistic practices, the suppression of scientific information, bribery, poisonings, false advertising and abusing workers. More recently, Bayer has inherited a legacy of deception through its acquisition of Monsanto. Both companies have been accused of concealing the health risks associated with glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup and the world’s most used agricultural herbicide. Internal documents reveal a concerted effort to downplay glyphosate’s carcinogenicity while ignoring substantial evidence indicating its dangers to human health. In her numerous reports, Mason has indicated how Bayer shaped regulatory processes to secure product approvals, influencing scientific studies and regulatory decisions while suppressing contrary evidence. The environmental devastation wrought by pesticides is alarming: Mason cites significant declines in biodiversity and poisoned ecosystems that she claims are as a direct consequence of the widespread use of Bayer’s chemicals. Moreover, rising cancer rates in communities exposed to Bayer’s products cannot be ignored, especially increasing cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma linked to glyphosate use in areas heavily treated with these chemicals. Rosemary Mason is not alone in her condemnation of Bayer. For instance, journalist Carey Gillam has written extensively about Bayer-Monsanto’s practices, particularly in relation to glyphosate and its health impacts in the book ‘Whitewash: The Story of a Weed Killer, Cancer, and the Corruption of Science’. Gillam says: “US Roundup litigation began in 2015 after the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen. Internal Monsanto documents dating back decades show that the company was aware of scientific research linking its weed killer to cancer but instead of warning consumers, the company worked to suppress the information and manipulate scientific literature.” Gillam has shown that, over the years, Monsanto mounted a deceitful defence of its health- and environment-damaging Roundup and its genetically modified crops, and it orchestrated toxic smear campaigns against anyone — scientist or campaigner — who threatened its interests. With that in mind, it comes as no surprise that a US-Based PR firm has created a watchlist, profiling activists, scientists and journalists who are critical of pesticide use and genetically modified organisms, as recently revealed in documents obtained by the investigative newsroom Lighthouse Reports. As a result of a year-long investigation, Lighthouse Reports argues that this operation seeks to cast pesticide critics, environmental scientists or campaigners as an anti-science “protest industry” and used US government money to do so. The watchlist is the brainchild of Jay Byrne, a former communications executive at Monsanto, and his reputation management firm v-Fluence. It comprises profiles (including personal information) on hundreds of scientists, campaigners and writers. These profiles have been published on a private social network, which grants privileged access to 1,000 people comprising a who’s-who of the agrochemical industry, alongside government officials from multiple countries. The US government funded v-Fluence as part of its programme to promote genetically modified organisms in Africa and Asia, including “enhanced monitoring” of critics of “modern agriculture approaches” — and to build the network. Watchlists and hitlists aside, to further its interests, the agrochemical giants pour huge resources into lobbying that seeks to shape narratives, deceive and coerce rather than engage with genuine public health and environmental concerns. The research and campaign group Corporate Europe Observatory (CEO) recently took a deep dive into Bayer’s disturbing “toxic trail” of lobbying as the company strives to maintain its huge slice of the seed and pesticides markets, fight off regulatory challenges to its toxic products, limit legal liability and exercise political influence. CEO’s report ‘Bayer’s Toxic Trails: Market Power, Monopolies and the Global Lobbying of an Agrochemicals Giant’ notes that Bayer spent between €7 million and €8 million in 2023 on EU lobbying, the biggest sum declared by any individual chemical company and the highest amount ever spent by Bayer on EU lobbying. According to CEO, Bayer’s current top lobbying priority in Europe is to derail the original ambitions of the European Green Deal and to prevent any of the company’s firmly established interests (chemicals and pesticides) from being touched. One of the central goals of this deal is to reduce the use and risk of chemical pesticides by 50 per cent by 2030 through the EU’s Farm to Fork strategy. This target aims to address both environmental and public health concerns associated with pesticide use in agriculture. Bayer’s lobby spend in the US has also risen considerably over the past few years, spending $7.5 million in 2023 alone, some of which is aimed at securing changes in the law to prevent further litigation cases and more hefty payouts to people suffering from conditions due to glyphosate exposure. To date, the company has reportedly paid out approximately $11 billion to settle nearly 100,000 lawsuits stemming from claims that Roundup causes cancer, particularly non-Hodgkin lymphoma. CEO states: “Bayer’s lobby tactics continue to capture public policymaking and in doing so hollow out democracy. A perverse symbiosis between corporate lobby groups and decision-makers has been actively created through its economic weight and large investments in many corners of the world, and this consistently leads to crucial decisions being made in favour of industry profits, rather than public interest.” It concludes that: “Around the world, Bayer’s modus operandi is not to work in the public interest but rather to capture public policy to serve its private interests and dividends of its shareholders, all while ignoring the public health and environmental impact of its activities.” So, why would a government want to do a deal with the devil? As stated in the previous chapter, that is precisely what the government of India seems to have done when it signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Bayer in September 2023. Bayer signed the MoU with the Indian Council for Agricultural Research (ICAR), which is responsible for co-ordinating agricultural education and research in India. Bayer’s aim first and foremost seems to be to exploit the ICAR’s vast infrastructure and networks to pursue its own commercial plans, including boosting sales of toxic proprietary products and the introduction of genetically modified food crops into India. These crops would be reliant on Bayer’s agrochemicals. Attempts to get genetically modified food crops into India’s fields is being done by all means necessary, as explained in Aruna Rodrigues insightful online article Waltzing with Bayer Makes The Indian Council of Agricultural Research Blind: India Ditches Mandate to Farmers and Uses Mutagenesis to Drive Toxic HT Crops Into India. That article explains that mutagenetic techniques are being used to bypass existing regulatory procedures in relation to genetically modified organisms, despite a recent Supreme Court directive for the government to formulate a national policy framework on genetically modified crops based on a democratic consultative process. Telangana State Seed Development Corporation chairman S Anvesh Reddy recently stated that farmers want a bio-safety policy and not a promotional policy for genetically modified crops. However, they are in danger of getting the latter. Prominent campaigner Kavitha Kuruganti has warned that the Ministry of Agriculture may bypass the democratic consultative processes recommended by the Supreme Court. It has already appointed a panel of ‘experts’ to draft the policy and information about it is being kept secret. On X (formerly Twitter), agricultural policy specialist Devinder Sharma stated: “How can a policy be framed for GM crops when there is still no consensus on the need for these crops? Despite heavy lobbying by industry, most countries oppose it.” How can this be? Let us turn to Aruna Rodrigues: “Our regulatory bodies have been captured by the biotech and agrichemical industries… It is breathtaking; all pretence is gone. We have a cancer that is metastasising vertically and horizontally throughout the entire regulatory body.” The need for genetically modified food crops is based on unsound logic, and, in general, neither farmers nor the public want them (see the online article Challenging the Flawed Premise Behind Pushing GMOs into Indian Agriculture). Moreover, the failure of Bt cotton in the country, India’s only officially approved genetically modified crop (see The Failure of GMO Cotton In India on resilience.org), should serve as a warning. In the meantime, farmers’ leaders from 18 states in India have resolved to oppose genetically modified crops. They say genetically modified organisms in agriculture are harmful to human and animal health, the environment, farmers’ livelihoods and trade and are based on failed promises. For some critics, if one firm tops a league table for anti-people, anti-nature business practices, it is Bayer (although there are many other worthy candidates). Nevertheless, as previously stated, the Indian Council for Agricultural Research (ICAR) signed a memorandum of understanding with Bayer in September 2023. Bayer’s approach to agricultural development involves promoting a model of industrial agriculture dependent on corporate products, including its toxic chemicals and genetically modified crops, and advocating for precision, data-driven agriculture that relies heavily on its proprietary technologies and software. Simon Wiebusch, Country Divisional Head of Crop Science for Bayer South Asia, recently stated that India cannot become a ‘developed nation’ with ‘backward’ agriculture. He believes India’s agriculture sector must modernise for the country to achieve developed nation status by 2047. Bayer’s vision for agriculture in India includes prioritising and fast-tracking approvals for its new products, introducing genetically modified food crops, addressing labour shortages (for weeding) by increasingly focusing on herbicides and developing herbicides for specific crops like paddy, wheat, sugarcane and maize. Government institutions like the ICAR seem likely to allow Bayer to leverage the agency’s infrastructure and networks to pursue its commercial plans. Wiebusch’s comments have received much media coverage. There is a tendency for journalists and media outlets to accept statements made by people in top corporate jobs as pearls of wisdom never to be critically questioned, especially in India when there is talk of the country achieving the gold standard in the eyes of some: ‘developed status’. But people like Wiebusch are hardly objective. They are not soothsayers who have an unbiased view of the world and its future. Bayer has a view of what agriculture should look like and is gaining increasing control of farmers in various countries in terms of having a direct influence on how they farm and what inputs they use. Its digital platforms are intended to be one-stop shops for carbon credits, seeds, pesticides and fertilisers and agronomic advice, all supplied by the company, which gets the added benefit of control over the agronomic and financial data harvested from farms. As for carbon credits, the non-profit GRAIN argues that, like digital platforms per se, carbon trading is about consolidating control within the food system and is certainly not about sequestering carbon. So, what does Wiebusch mean when he talks about modernisation of a backward agriculture in India? All of what is set out above and more. Like Wiebusch, corporate lobbyists often refer to ‘modern agriculture’. Instead, we should really be advocating for a system that produces healthy food for all while sustaining farming communities and livelihoods. That’s because the term ‘modern agriculture’ is deliberately deceptive: it means a system dependent on proprietary inputs and integrated with corporate global supply chains. Anything other is defined as ‘backward’. According to Bayer, Wiebusch is a star player who can drive market share and create business value for the company. On the Bayer India website it says: “Simon’s key strengths include unlocking business growth, redefining distribution strategies, driving change management and building diverse teams that drive market share and create business value.” Stripped of the corporate jargon and any talk of ‘helping’ India, the goal is to secure control of the sector and ensure corporate dependency. That is what is really meant by creating business value and driving market share. India has achieved self-sufficiency in food grains and has ensured there is enough food (in terms of calories) available to feed its entire population. It is the world’s largest producer of milk, pulses and millets and the second-largest producer of rice, wheat, sugarcane, groundnuts, vegetables, fruit and cotton. In 2014, environmental scientist Viva Kermani stated that India has been self-sufficient in food staples for over a decade and more than that for cereals. She noted that the country: “… grows about 100 million tons (mt) of rice, 95 mt of wheat, 170 mt of vegetables, 85 mt of fruit, 40 mt of coarse cereals and 18 mt of pulses (refer to the Economic Survey for the data). These totals ensure that our farmers grow enough to feed all Indians well with food staples. We have 66 mt of grain, two-and-a-half times the required buffer stock (on January 1, 2013).” She concluded: “The country has reached this stage through, first and foremost, the knowledge and skill of our farmers who have bred and saved seed themselves and exchanged their seed in ways that made our fields so biodiverse.” Kermani also observed that farmers have legitimate claims to being scientists, innovators, natural resource stewards, seed savers and hybridisation experts. However, they have too often been reduced to becoming recipients of technical fixes and consumers of the poisonous products of a growing agricultural inputs industry. It is clear that Bayer needs India for its corporate growth strategy, but who needs Bayer? Bhaskar Save certainly did not on his impressively bountiful organic farm in Gujarat. In 2006, he described in an eight-page open letter (along with six annexures) to M S Swaminathan (widely regarded as the father of the Green Revolution in India) how the type of chemical-intensive agriculture that Bayer promotes and the urban-centric model of development favoured by the government has had devastating environmental economic and social consequences for India. Save offered agroecological alternatives to address the problems, including solutions to boost farmer incomes and rural communities, cultivate a wider range of nutrient-dense crops, build soil fertility, improve water management, enhance on-farm ecology and increase biodiversity. The prominent environmentalist Vandana Shiva recently posted on X: “India’s agriculture was sustained over 10,000 years because it was based on nature’s laws of diversity, recycling, regeneration & circularity. Albert Howard spread organic farming worldwide learning from Indian peasants. Working with nature is sophistication, not backwardness. “Bayer calling India’s agriculture backward is a new toxic colonisation. Bayer/Monsanto, the poison cartel whose roots are in war, has driven biodiversity to extinction with monocultures, spread cancers with glyphosate & herbicides, destroyed democracy.” It seems that the ‘poor’ must be helped out of their awful ‘backwardness’ by the West and its powerful corporations and billionaire ‘philanthropists’ like Bill Gates. What some might regard as ‘backward’ stems from an ethnocentric ideology, which is used to legitimise the destruction of communities and economies that were once locally based and self-sufficient. Bayer promotes a corporate expansionist ‘development’ agenda that is self-sustaining and can be described as anything but development (see the online article Resisting Genetically Mutilated Food and the Eco-Modern Nightmare). Companies like Bayer present their technologies and products as fixes for the problems created by the model of ‘growth’ and ‘development’ they promote. ‘Scientific innovation’ is touted as the answer. The proposed solutions often create new problems or worsen existing ones. This leads to a cycle of dependency on corporate products and technologies. Monsanto’s failed Bt cotton in India being a case in point. Problems created by corporate-led development become opportunities for further corporate inputs and the commodification of knowledge and further ‘expert’ interventions. The primary motivation is financial gain rather than genuine societal improvement. Corporate-driven ‘development’ is a misnomer, especially in agriculture, as it often leads to regression in terms of health, environmental sustainability and rural community resilience, while perpetuating a cycle of problems and ‘solutions’ that primarily benefit large corporations. But the type of agroecological solutions presented by the likes of Bhaskar Save run counter to Bayer’s aims of more pesticides, more genetically modified organisms, more control and corporate consolidation. For example, as previously mentioned, the industry seeks to derail the EU’s farm to fork strategy (which involves a dramatic reduction in agrochemical use), and Bayer spends record amounts to shape policies to its advantage, courtesy of its entrenched lobbying networks. Of course, Bayer presents its neocolonial aspirations in terms of helping backward Indian farmers. A good old dose of Western saviourism. To promote its model, Bayer must appear to offer practical solutions. It uses the narrative of climate emergency to promote a Ponzi carbon trading scheme that is resulting in land displacement across the world. And Bayer says that labour shortages for manual weeding in Indian agriculture are a significant challenge, so the rollout of toxic herbicides like glyphosate are a necessity. But there are several approaches to address this issue beyond relying on herbicides like glyphosate (it will kill all plants that do not have the herbicide tolerant trait), which is wholly unsuitable for a nation comprising so many small farms cultivating a diverse range of crops. Mechanical weeding using animal-drawn or tractor-powered implements for larger farms is one solution, and there are several agronomic techniques that can help suppress weeds and reduce labour needs: crop rotation disrupts weed lifecycles, higher planting densities shade out weeds, proper fertilisation gives crops a competitive advantage and use of cover crops and mulches can suppress weed growth. Even here, however, there are cynical attempts to get farmers to change their cultivation methods (with no tangible financial benefits) and move away from traditional systems. In the article The Ox Fall Down: Path Breaking and Treadmills in Indian Cotton Agriculture, for instance, we see farmers being nudged away from traditional planting methods and pushed towards a method inconducive to oxen ploughing but very conducive for herbicide-dependent weed management. That article notes the huge growth potential for herbicides in India, something companies like Bayer are keen to capitalise on. Wiebusch talks of India reaching ‘developed status’. But what does the type of ‘development’ he proposes entail? We need only look around us for the answer: decision-making centralised in the hands of government and corporate entities, traditional local governance structures weakened and standardised, top-down policies and corporate consolidation through mergers and acquisitions with local independent enterprises struggling to compete. Consolidated corporations have greater lobbying power to shape regulations in their favour, further entrenching their market position. In other words, political centralisation and corporate consolidation are often intertwined. Centralised political structures tend to align with the interests of large, consolidated corporations, and both centralised governments and large corporations exert greater control over resources. This dual process has led to reduced economic diversity and resilience, weakened local communities and traditions, increased vulnerability to systemic shocks and diminished democratic participation. ‘Developed status’ also means accelerated urbanisation, land amalgamations for industrial-scale farming and depopulation of the countryside. And it means farmers being encouraged to grow cash crops for export based on trade policies that work in favour of big landowners and heavily subsidised Western agriculture. As mentioned earlier, it has been estimated that between 2016 and 2030, globally, urban areas will have tripled in size, expanding into cropland and undermining the productivity of agricultural systems. Around 60 per cent of the world’s cropland lies on the outskirts of cities. This land is, on average, twice as productive as land elsewhere on the globe. As cities expand, millions of small-scale farmers are displaced. These farmers produce the majority of food in the Global South and are key to global food security. A combination of urbanisation and policies deliberately designed to displace the food-producing peasantry will serve to boost the corporate takeover of India’s agrifood sector. This is what Bayer calls ‘development’. But none of this is inevitable. Many of us know what the response should be: prioritising sustainable, locally appropriate solutions and restoring food sovereignty and the economic vibrancy of rural communities; focusing on holistic human well-being rather than narrow economic metrics of ‘growth’; preserving traditional knowledge that underpins highly productive farming practices for the benefit of farmers, consumer health and the environment; and empowering communities through localism and decentralisation rather than creating state-corporate dependency. Such solutions are markedly different from those characterised by rural population displacement, the subjugation of peoples and nature, nutrient-poor diets, degraded on-farm and off-farm ecosystems and corporate consolidation. There are alternative visions for the future, alternative visions of human development. But these do not boost corporate margins or control and do not fit the hegemonic narrative of what passes for ‘development’. However, it is concerning that what Bayer advocates is regarded as the common sense of the age. The ultimate coup d’état by the transnational agribusiness conglomerates is that state officials, scientists and journalists take as given that profit-driven Fortune 500 corporations have a legitimate claim to be custodians of natural assets. These corporations have convinced so many that they have the ultimate legitimacy to own, control and manage what is essentially humanity’s commonwealth. Water, food, soil, land and agriculture have been handed over to powerful transnational corporations to milk for profit as though they are serving the needs of humanity. Corporations which promote industrial agriculture have embedded themselves deeply within the policy-making machinery on both national and international levels. The ultimate intertwining of political centralisation and corporate consolidation. It should be clear by now that the issues raised in this book transcend a narrow analysis of the food system. There has been much discussion about social control, technocracy and even transhumanism. And this chapter is no different. It is essential to explore broader power dynamics in order to gain a clearer understanding of the global food regime and the corporations and interests behind it. Power is increasingly concentrated in the hands of an elite that wields its considerable wealth, influence and technological advancements to dominate both resources and populations, profoundly shaping the fabric of our lives. In recent years, we have seen the nudging (manipulating) of populations to accept a ‘new normal’ based on, among other things, a climate emergency narrative, pandemic preparedness tyranny, unaccountable AI, synthetic ‘food’ and farmerless farms. Whether it involves a ‘food transition’, an ‘energy transition’, 15-minute cities or some other benign-sounding term, all this is to be determined by a supranational state-corporate ‘stakeholder’ elite with ordinary people sidelined in the process. An undemocratic agenda designed to place restrictions on individual liberty, marking a dramatic shift towards authoritarianism. In the 1980s, to help legitimise the deregulation-privatisation neoliberal globalisation agenda, government and media instigated an ideological onslaught on populations, driving home the primacy of ‘free enterprise’, individual rights and responsibility and emphasising a shift away from the role of the state, trade unions and the collective in society. We are currently seeing another ideological shift: individual rights and freedoms are said to undermine the wider needs of society and the planet; in a stark turnaround, personal freedom is now said to pose a threat to national security, public health or the climate. As in the 1980s, this messaging is being driven by an economic impulse. This time, the collapsing neoliberal project. In the UK, poverty is increasing, food banks are now a necessary part of life for millions. Indeed, the poorest families are enduring a ‘frightening’ collapse in living standards, resulting in life-changing and life-limiting poverty. In the US, it was reported in 2023 that around 30 million low-income people are on the edge of a ‘hunger cliff’ as a portion of their federal food assistance is taken away. In 2021, it was estimated that one in eight children were going hungry in the US. In April 2023, it was reported that small businesses were filing for bankruptcy in the US at a record rate. Image is from the Bank of England website The Bank of England’s chief economist, Huw Pill, says that people should ‘accept’ being poorer. This is similar to the response of Rob Kapito, co-founder of the world’s biggest asset management firm, BlackRock. In 2022, the unimaginably rich and entitled Kapito said that a “very entitled” generation of (ordinary working) people who have never had to sacrifice would soon have to face shortages for the first time in their lives. While business as usual prevails in Kapito’s world of privilege and that of major arms, energy, pharmaceuticals and food companies, whose megarich owners continue to rake in massive profits, Kapito and Pill tell ordinary people to get used to poverty and the ‘new normal’ as if we are ‘all in it together’ — billionaires and working class alike. They conveniently used COVID and the situation in Ukraine as cover for the collapsing neoliberalism. But this is part of the hegemonic agenda that seeks to ensure that the establishment’s world view is the accepted cultural norm. And anyone who challenges this world view — whether it involves, for instance, questioning climate alarmism, the ‘new normal’, the nature of the economic crisis, the mainstream COVID narrative or the official stance on Ukraine and Russia — is regarded as a spreader of misinformation and the ‘enemy within’. If we turn to New Zealand, we could see this in action during and after the COVID event. The country’s former prime minister Jacinda Ardern grabbed the global limelight a few years ago, making headlines by stating she wanted to put ‘kindness’ into politics. In 2019, Foreign Policy, a publication closely associated with the Atlantic Council and the US State Department, published the article ‘The Kindness Quotient’, a glowing promotion of Ardern. The strategic marketing of Ardern in various publications focused on her likeability, pro-environment stance, compassionate values and collaborative nature. To further appeal to liberal sentiments, she was said to represent everything Trump is not. Ardern belongs to a set of global leaders who were groomed for their positions through the World Economic Forum (WEF) Young Global Leaders Programme. Yes, that WEF — the elitist organisation where hard-nose billionaires and their handmaidens gather to set out policies aligned with powerful business interests. The charm offensive that Ardern’s promoters undertook was an investment. She delivered on COVID by implementing lockdowns and restrictions without question. Arden stated in her speech to the UN in September 2022: “As leaders, we are rightly concerned that even the most light-touch approaches to disinformation could be misinterpreted as hostile to values of free speech that we value so highly.” She went on to say: “How do you tackle climate change if people believe it does not exist? How do you ensure the human rights of others are upheld as they are subjected to hateful and dangerous ideology.” She continued by saying free speech (that the authorities disagree with) can be a weapon of war. During COVID, Ardern urged citizens to trust the government and its agencies for all information and stated: “Otherwise, dismiss anything else. We will continue to be your single source of truth.” Throughout that period, in the US, Fauci presented himself as ‘the science’. In New Zealand, Ardern’s government was ‘the truth’. It was similar in countries across the world. Different figures but the same approach. When anyone in power or any institution lays claim to ‘the truth’, history shows we are on a slippery slope to silencing thought and dissent that we disagree with. Like other political leaders, during COVID, Ardern clamped down on civil liberties with the full force of state violence on hand to ensure compliance with ‘the truth’. Clearly, Ardern was not alone here. Trudeau, the Biden administration and others have continued to display Orwellian undertones as they spoke of the need to challenge ‘misinformation’ and those who question ‘the truth’. The thin end of a very wide authoritarian wedge. It seems, especially post-COVID, critical analysis and open debate are fine as long as those involved keep within the framework of what is deemed supportive of official narratives. We are often urged to ‘trust the science’ and accept that the ‘science is decided’ on various issues. We heard this on the COVID issue, when we were told governments are ‘following the science’, while they and the big tech companies censored world-renowned scientists and opposing views and opinions. In ‘following the science’, conflicts of interest were rife and notions of objectivity, open disclosure and organised scepticism — core values of scientific endeavour — were trampled on. Those who questioned the COVID narrative were smeared, shut down and censored, the playbook of big agribusiness — manipulating science, smearing critics, derailing policies that threaten its interests and claiming that ‘the science is decided’ on genetically modified organisms — and authoritarian governments. Is anyone who questions and wants a more open debate on climate change or whether such change is occurring as stated or will lead to ‘extinction’ to be charged with disseminating misinformation? Is questioning the orthodoxy of the zero-carbon policy agenda to be shut down and those who challenge it to be labelled ‘extremists’. Ardern asked: “How do you tackle climate change if people believe it does not exist?” But it is also pertinent to ask: How do you tackle it if you accept it exists? Even if we accept humanity is in trouble and facing a genuine climate emergency, people should at least be able to question the current ‘green’ agenda based on a ‘stakeholder capitalism’ strategy (governments and others facilitating the needs of private capital) that has co-opted genuine concerns about the environment to pursue new multi-billion-dollar global investment opportunities (described in the 2020 report Nature for Sale by Friends of the Earth). If you read that report, you might conclude that we are witnessing a type of green imperialism that is using genuine concerns about the environment to pursue a familiar agenda of extractivism, colonisation and commodification. The same old mindset, greenwashed and rolled out for public consumption. Ardern’s utterances on the dangers of free speech, the singularity of ‘truth’ and the implicit shift towards authoritarianism must be viewed within the context of managing an economic crisis. What she was saying revealed how the financial and political elites based on Wall Street, in Washington and in the City of London were thinking. The authorities fear blowback in terms of mass dissent and uprisings. A few years ago, Liz Truss, then UK prime minister, wanted to place ‘legal curbs’ on striking trade unions. There is also the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts (PCSC) Act 2022, which may undermine the right to protest. It therefore comes as no surprise that, today, individual rights and free speech are under threat. The ultimate control mechanism would be linking central bank digital currencies to personal carbon footprints (including eating habits), spending and dissent in an age of economic turmoil. Trudeau might have given the game away on that when he hit protesting truckers where it hurt most — restricting access to bank accounts. How long before ‘misinformation’ and challenging ‘the truth’ becomes thought crime and — as Jacinda Ardern might put it — ‘cruel to be kind’ actions are taken against those who challenge dominant state-corporate narratives? Well, not long because we have already witnessed it during the last few years. A doubling down since COVID. Tyranny is the type of ‘kindness’ we don’t need. The term ‘enemy within’ was popularised by Margaret Thatcher during the UK miners’ strike in 1984-85 to describe the striking miners. But it is a notion with which Britain’s rulers have regarded protest movements and uprisings down the centuries. From the Peasants’ Revolt in 1381 to the Levellers and Diggers (who are discussed in the final chapter) in the 17th century, it is a concept associated with anyone or any group that challenges the existing social order and the interests of the ruling class. John Ball, a radical priest, addressed the Peasants’ Revolt rebels with the following words: “Good friends, matters cannot go well in England until all things be held in common; when there shall be neither vassals nor lords; when the lords shall be no more masters than ourselves.” The revolt was suppressed. John Ball was captured and hung, drawn and quartered. Part of the blood-soaked history of the British ruling class. Later on, the 17th-century Diggers’ movement wanted to create small, egalitarian rural communities and farm on common land that had been privatised by enclosures. The 1975 song ‘The world Turned Upside Down’ by Leon Rosselson commemorates the Diggers. His lyrics describe the aims and plight of the movement. In Rosselson’s words, the Diggers were dispossessed via theft and murder but reclaimed what was theirs only to be violently put down. Little surprise then that, in the 1980s, Margaret Thatcher used the full force of state machinery to defeat the country’s most powerful trade union, the shock troops of the labour movement, the National Union of Mineworkers — ‘the enemy within’. She needed to do this to open the gates for capital to profit from the subsequent deindustrialisation of much of the UK and the dismantling of large parts of the welfare state. And the result? A hollowed-out, debt-bloated economy, the destruction of the social fabric of entire communities and the great financial Ponzi scheme — the ‘miracle’ of deregulated finance — that now teeters on the brink of collapse, leading the likes of Kapito and Pill to tell the public to get ready to become poor. And now, in 2024, the latest version of the ‘enemy within’ is anyone who disseminates ‘misinformation’ — anything that challenges the official state-corporate narrative. So, this time, one goal is to have a fully controlled (censored) internet. For instance, US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) awarded Accrete a contract for Argus to detect disinformation threats from social media. Argus is AI software that analyses social media data to predict emergent narratives and generate intelligence reports at a speed and scale to help neutralise viral disinformation threats. Accrete AI is a leading dual-use enterprise AI company. It deployed its AI Argus software for open-source threat detection with the US Department of Defense in 2022. In a press release, Prashant Bhuyan, founder and CEO of Accrete, boasted: “Social media is widely recognised as an unregulated environment where adversaries routinely exploit reasoning vulnerabilities and manipulate behaviour through the intentional spread of disinformation. USSOCOM is at the tip of the spear in recognising the critical need to identify and analytically predict social media narratives at an embryonic stage before those narratives evolve and gain traction. Accrete is proud to support USSOCOM’s mission.” ‍This is about predicting wrong think on social media. But control over the internet is just part of a wider programme of establishment domination, surveillance and dealing with protest and dissent. The online article How the Government Weaponizes Surveillance to Silence Its Critics notes that, on any given day, the average person in the US is monitored, spied on and tracked in more than 20 different ways. The authors of the article ask us to consider some of the ways the US government is weaponising its surveillance technologies to flag citizens as a threat to national security, whether or not they have done anything wrong — from flagging citizens as a danger based on their feelings, phone and movements to their spending activities, social media activities, political views and correspondence. The elite has determined that the existential threat is you. The article Costs of War: Peterloo, written by UK Veterans for Peace member Aly Renwick, details the history of the brutal suppression of protesters by Britain’s rulers. He also strips away any notion that some may have of a benign, present-day ruling elite with democratic leanings. The leopard has not changed its spots. As we saw during COVID, the thinking is that hard-won rights must be curtailed, freedom of association is reckless, free thinking is dangerous, dissent is to be stamped on, impartial science is a threat and free speech is deadly. Government is ‘the truth’, Fauci (or some similar figure) is ‘the science’ and censorship is for your own good. None of this was justified. It only begins to make sense if we regard the COVID restrictions in terms of trying to deal with an economic crisis by closing down the global economy under cover of a public health crisis. The economic crisis is making many people poorer, so they must be controlled, monitored and subjugated. The transitions mentioned at the start of this chapter along with the surveillance agenda (together known as the ‘Great Reset’) are being accelerated at this time of economic crisis when countless millions across the West are being impoverished. The collapsing US-led financial system is resulting in an interrelated global debt, inflation and ‘austerity’ crisis and the biggest transfer of wealth to the rich in history. Integral to this is the ‘food transition’ and the ‘climate emergency’ narrative, an intertwined commentary that has been carefully constructed and promoted (see the work of investigative journalist Cory Morningstar), and net-zero ideology tied to carbon farming and carbon trading. The ‘food transition’ involves locking farmers (at least those farmers who will remain in farming) further into a corporate-controlled agriculture that extracts wealth and serves the market needs of global corporations, carbon trading Ponzi schemes and institutional investors and speculators with no connection to farming who regard agriculture, food commodities and agricultural land as mere financial assets. These farmers will be reduced to corporate profit-extracting agents who bear all of the risks. This predatory commercialisation of the countryside attempts to use flawed premises and climate alarmism to legitimise the roll-out of technologies to supposedly deliver us all from climate breakdown and Malthusian catastrophe. Meanwhile, a wealthy elite increasingly funds science, determines what should be studied, how it should be studied and how the findings are disseminated and how the technology produced is to be used. This elite has the power to shut down genuine debate and to smear and censor others who question the dominant narrative. The prevailing thinking is that the problems humanity face are to be solved through technical innovation determined by plutocrats and consolidated corporate power. This haughty mindset (or outright arrogance) leads to and is symptomatic of an authoritarianism that seeks to impose a range of technologies on humanity with no democratic oversight. This includes self-transmitting vaccines, the genetic engineering of plants and humans, synthetic food, geoengineering and transhumanism. And in India, as we have seen, it involves the imposition of policies in agriculture that, too, also lack any form of democratic oversight or debate. During the farmers’ protest in 2020-21, influential media and commentators wasted no time in attempting to portray farmers as ‘anti-national’ and the ‘enemy within’. What we see is a misguided eco-modernist paradigm that concentrates power and privileges techno-scientific expertise (a form of technocratic exceptionalism). At the same time, historical power relations (often rooted in agriculture and colonialism) and their legacies within and between societies across the world are conveniently ignored and depoliticised. Technology is not the cure-all for the destructive impacts of poverty, inequality, dispossession, imperialism or class exploitation. When it comes to the technologies and policies being rolled out in the agriculture sector, these phenomena will be reinforced and further entrenched — and that includes illness and poor health, which have markedly increased as a result of the modern food we eat and the agrochemicals and practices already used by the corporations pushing for the ‘food transition’. However, that then opens up other money-spinning techno-fix opportunities in the life sciences sector for investors like BlackRock that invest in both agriculture and pharmaceuticals. But in a neoliberal privatised economy that has often facilitated the rise of members of the controlling wealthy elite, it is reasonable to assume that its members possess certain assumptions of how the world works and should continue to work: a world based on deregulation with limited oversight and the hegemony of private capital and a world led by private individuals like Bill Gates who think they know best. Whether through, for instance, the patenting of life forms, carbon trading, entrenching market (corporate) dependency or land investments, their eco-modern policies serve as cover for generating and amassing further wealth and for cementing their control. It should come as little surprise that powerful people who have contempt for democratic principles (and by implication, ordinary people) believe they have some divine right to undermine food security, close down debate, enrich themselves further courtesy of their technologies and policies and gamble with humanity’s future. But the powers that be fear that the masses might once again pick up their pitchforks and revolt. They are adamant that the peasants must know their place. However, the flame of protest and dissent from centuries past still inspires and burns bright. Economist Prof Michael Hudson stated in 2014: “It’s by agriculture and control of the food supply that American diplomacy has been able to control most of the Third World. The World Bank’s geopolitical lending strategy has been to turn countries into food deficit areas by convincing them to grow cash crops — plantation export crops — not to feed themselves with their own food crops.” In 2019, Hudson described how debt, sanctions and the US-controlled international monetary system had backed Venezuelan president Maduro into a corner. Venezuela had become an oil monoculture, with revenue having been spent largely on importing food and other necessities, which it could have produced itself. In this respect, Word Trade Organization (WTO) policies and directives, debt and US-supported geopolitical lending strategies have compelled many countries in the Global South to eradicate food self-sufficiency and undermine their own food security. The control of global agriculture has been a tentacle of US capitalism’s geopolitical strategy. The Green Revolution was exported courtesy of oil-rich interests, and poorer nations adopted Western agri-capital’s chemical- and oil-dependent model of agriculture that required loans for inputs and related infrastructure development. It entailed trapping nations into a globalised system of debt bondage, rigged trade relations and a system vulnerable to oil price shocks (this was touched on in the final chapter of Sickening Profits). In his book The Unsettling of America (1977), Wendell Berry criticises the US Department of Agriculture for adopting a doctrine that treats food as an instrument of foreign political and economic speculation. Berry argues that treating food as a weapon ultimately serves the interests of large agribusiness corporations rather than farmers or consumers. He sees the weaponisation of food as part of a larger problem where agriculture is divorced from its cultural and ecological roots, leading to numerous negative consequences. Berry’s book discusses how modern agriculture has fostered a disconnect between people and the land. He laments that farming has been reduced to a mere business venture rather than a way of life that nurtures community and culture. A business venture and a geopolitical weapon. Something not lost on environmentalist Vandana Shiva who does not hesitate to label agrochemical companies as a poison cartel. She emphasises that this designation stems not only from the harmful effects of its chemicals on the food system but also from the historical connections of corporations like Bayer and BASF to warfare and chemical weapons. These companies have roots in producing toxic substances used during conflicts, including World War I and II, where they manufactured chemical agents such as chlorine gas and Zyklon B, the latter infamously used in Nazi gas chambers. These practices reflect a broader underlining (historical) pattern of exploitation and violence in the food system that undermines both human health and ecological integrity. Major agribusiness companies are deeply embedded in supranational policymaking machinery that allows them to draw up policies to serve their own interests. For instance, Monsanto played a key part in drafting the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights to create seed monopolies, and the global food processing industry (Cargill) had a leading role in shaping the WTO Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures. The powerful agribusiness lobby has secured privileged access to policy makers to ensure its model of agriculture prevails. And those same companies also profit from war and sovereign debt traps to gain access to markets (see, for instance, Sowing the Seeds of Famine in Ethiopia by Michel Chossudovsky). Hit lists, the corruption of science, profiteering and the infiltration of regulatory bodies aside (the list could go on), food cultivation — an endeavour that at its core seeks to nourish and sustain life — has been hijacked and weaponised to coerce, control and suck away life from nature and people. And Bayer talks about ‘backwardness’, as if any of the above is progressive. But few illusions are as pervasive and pernicious as the ideology of ‘progress’ and ‘development’ that hides behind corporate lobbyist soundbites about agribusiness and its money-spinning inputs being needed to prevent mass starvation. This ideology, propped up by the twin pillars of techno-solutionism and technocracy has become the unquestioned truth of the age, a secular religion that promises salvation through the relentless march of technology and the wisdom of experts. Writer Paul Cudenec says that ‘development’: “… is the destruction of nature, now seen as a mere resource to be used for development or as an empty undeveloped space in which development could, should and, ultimately, must take place. It is the destruction of natural human communities, whose self-sufficiency gets in the way of the advance of development, and of authentic human culture and traditional values, which are incompatible with the dogma and domination of development.” Cudenec argues that those behind ‘development’ have been destroying everything of real value in our natural world and our human societies in the pursuit of personal wealth and power. Moreover, they have concealed this crime behind all the positive-sounding rhetoric associated with development on every level. Indeed, the notion that human society is on an inevitable trajectory of improvement, driven by technological innovation and guided by technocratic elites, is perhaps the most insidious myth of our time. This narrative of perpetual progress is a convenient smokescreen, obscuring the stark realities of environmental degradation, social inequality and spiritual impoverishment that characterise so-called advanced civilisation. At the heart of this ideology lies the naive belief in techno-solutionism — the misguided faith that every problem, no matter how complex or deeply rooted in social and political structures, can be solved with the right technological fix. This reductionist worldview reduces the human experience to a series of technical challenges, eagerly awaiting the next groundbreaking innovation to set things right. Agriculture? Just invent more data-gathering apps. Poverty? Develop an app for that. This simplistic approach not only fails to address the root causes of our predicaments but actively distracts us from the necessary work of systemic change and collective action. Hand in hand with techno-solutionism marches technocracy — the idea that society would be best governed by the rich, technical experts and engineers rather than elected representatives or, just imagine, ordinary people! This elitist vision of governance places undue faith in the objectivity and benevolence of a technocratic class, ignoring the fact that these so-called experts are just as susceptible to self-interest as any other group. The technocratic mindset reduces the vibrant reality of human society to a series of data points and algorithms, treating citizens as variables in a grand social engineering experiment. A worldview that values efficiency over empathy, optimisation over justice and control over freedom. In this brave new world, the nuances of culture, the wisdom of tradition and the unpredictability of human nature are seen as inconvenient obstacles to be overcome rather than essential aspects of the human experience. Proponents of this ideology of progress would have us believe that we’re living in the best of all possible worlds — or at least on the path to it with the proliferation of gadgets as irrefutable evidence of our ascent. But this narrative of continuous improvement conveniently ignores the widening wealth gap, corporate corruption, the epidemic of mental health issues, the erosion of community ties and a globalised food system that results in all manner of illness and environmental degradation. The obsession with technological progress and economic growth has come at a tremendous cost. Elite interests have sacrificed the health of the planet, the well-being of countless species and our own connection to the natural world on the altar of ‘development’. They traded meaningful work and genuine human connections for the hollow notion of convenience and efficiency. The quantifiable trumps the qualitative, reducing the human experience to a series of metrics. The ideology of progress serves as a powerful tool for maintaining the status quo. By perpetuating the myth that our current corrupt system is the pinnacle of human achievement, or at least the best we can hope for (there is no alternative!) stifles imagination and is meant to induce apathy and demotivate the masses in striving to bring about meaningful change. And those who dare to question the wisdom of endless growth or propose alternative models of social organisation are censored or dismissed as naive idealists or dangerous radicals. The tech giants and corporations that benefit most from this ideology have become the new high priests of our age, peddling their digital opiates and shiny gadgets as the path to a better future. They promise connection but deliver isolation, offer information but breed confusion and pledge empowerment while tightening the public noose of surveillance. Ordinary people need to reclaim their agency, get off their cell phones and reimagine their relationship with technology, viewing it as a tool to be wielded judiciously rather than a force that shapes our destiny. We need to forge a new path that values human flourishing over ‘growth’, that prioritises ecological harmony over technological domination and that recognises the inherent worth of all beings — not just those deemed productive by the economic system. This means challenging the state-corporate-financial- digital elite, who use their wealth, policies and technologies to wage a class war on ordinary people, while reclaiming the power to shape our societies through collective action. It means reevaluating our definition of progress, moving beyond simplistic metrics of economic growth to consider the true measures of human and ecological well-being. And it means appreciating the complexity of the world, recognising that not every problem has a technological solution and that some of the most valuable aspects of human existence cannot be quantified or optimised. We find ourselves at a critical juncture where the very foundations of our food systems and, indeed, our relationship with the natural world are being systematically dismantled and reconstructed to serve the interests of a unimaginably rich elite. As we stand on the precipice of a brave new world dominated by genetically engineered crops, lab-grown meat and AI-driven farming, it is imperative that we pause and critically examine the path we are being herded down. The time has come to resist and reject the unchecked corporatisation and mechanisation of our food and, indeed, our lives. The Green Revolution, once hailed as the saviour of the ‘developing world’, has instead trapped millions of farmers in cycles of debt and dependency, while reducing the nutritional value of food and decimating biodiversity. Now, we are told that the solution to current problems lies in even more technology — gene editing, precision agriculture and artificial intelligence. But this is merely doubling down on a failed paradigm. These ‘solutions’ are not designed to address the root causes of our food crisis, but rather to further consolidate control over the food system in the hands of a few powerful corporations. Consider the push for genetically modified organisms and the new wave of gene-edited crops. Proponents claim these technologies will increase yields and reduce pesticide use. Yet, decades of cultivation of genetically modified organisms have shown us that these promises are hollow. Instead, we have seen the rise of superweeds, increased pesticide use and the erosion of seed sovereignty as farmers become beholden to patent-holding corporations. Similarly, the drive towards ‘smart’ farming and precision agriculture is often presented as a path to sustainability. In reality, it’s a trojan horse for increased corporate control and farmer disempowerment. As farms become more reliant on proprietary software, expensive machinery and data-driven decision making, traditional farming knowledge is devalued, and farmers are reduced to mere operators in a system they no longer fully understand or control. The solution lies in a return to human-scale agriculture, rooted in agroecological principles. This is not a romanticised view of the past but a forward-thinking approach that recognises the wisdom embedded in traditional farming practices while selectively incorporating appropriate technologies. Agroecology works with nature rather than against it, fostering biodiversity, building soil health and creating resilient food systems. The push for lab-grown meat and ultra-processed, plant-based alternatives is not about sustainability or animal welfare but about wresting control of protein production from farmers and placing it in the hands of tech companies and their investors. These products, often marketed as eco-friendly solutions, are in reality energy-intensive, highly processed foods that further disconnect us from the natural world and our food sources. In the face of this techno-industrial onslaught, we must advocate for food sovereignty — the right of peoples to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through ecologically sound and sustainable methods and their right to define their own food and agriculture systems. This means resisting the corporatisation of our food supply, supporting local food systems and preserving the diversity of crops and culinary traditions that have nourished humanity for millennia. In attempting to shape the future, we can indeed look to the past for inspiration and reclaim part of history by drawing from the radical vision and actions of ‘the Diggers’ movement (1649-1651). In the annals of agrarian history, one particular movement has left a profound impact on the collective imagination of food sovereignty advocates. The Diggers in 17th century England were led by the visionary Gerrard Winstanley. This radical group emerged during a period of intense social and political upheaval, offering a revolutionary perspective on land ownership and food production that continues to resonate with modern struggles for food justice. The Diggers, also known as the True Levellers, arose in 1649, a time when England was reeling from the aftermath of civil war. Winstanley and his followers dared to imagine a different world. The group challenged the very foundations of the emerging capitalist system and the enclosure movement that was rapidly privatising previously common lands. But Winstanley’s vision was not merely theoretical. On 1 April 1649, the Diggers began their most famous action, occupying St. George’s Hill in Surrey, where they established a commune, cultivating the land collectively and distributing food freely to all who needed it. This act of direct action was a powerful demonstration of their philosophy in practice. As Winstanley declared: “The earth was made to be a common treasury for all, not a private treasury for some.” The Diggers, true to their name, began their movement by literally digging up unused common lands and planting crops. According to Professor Justin Champion, they planted “peas and carrots and pulses” and let their cows graze on the fields. While the Diggers saw their actions as relatively harmless (Champion compares it to having an allotment), local property owners viewed it as a serious threat, likening it to “village terrorism”, according to Champion. The local landowners called in troops to suppress these actions. Despite their relatively small numbers and short-lived experiments, which spread across parts of England, Champion suggests that the Diggers posed a significant ideological threat to the existing social order, challenging notions of private property and social hierarchy. Winstanley declared: “Those that Buy and Sell Land, and are landlords, have got it either by Oppression, or Murther, or Theft”. He added: “The Work we are going about is this, To dig up Georges-Hill and the waste Ground thereabouts, and to Sow Corn, and to eat our bread together by the sweat of our brows. And the First Reason is this, That we may work in righteousness, and lay the Foundation of making the Earth a Common Treasury for All, both Rich and Poor, That every one that is born in the land, may be fed by the Earth his Mother that brought him forth, according to the Reason that rules in the Creation.” The backlash from local landlords was systematic. The Diggers faced beatings and arson, forcing them to move from St George’s Hill to a second site in Cobham, until they were finally driven off the land entirely. Writing in 1972 in his book The World Turned Upside Down, Christopher Hill, a prominent historian of the English Civil War period, suggested that the Diggers’ influence was more widespread than just their most famous colony at St. George’s Hill. He argued that from Nottinghamshire and Northamptonshire to Gloucestershire and Kent, Digger influence spread all over southern and central England. While the actual number of people involved in Digger experiments was relatively small (estimated at 100-200 people across England), their ideas spread more widely through pamphlets and word of mouth. This widespread influence, as described by Hill, suggests that the Diggers’ ideas resonated with people across a significant portion of England, even if actual Digger colonies were few in number. The Diggers were a radical, biblically inspired movement that practically implemented their beliefs about common ownership of land, provoking strong opposition from the established landowners despite their generally peaceful methods. The St. George’s Hill experiment represented a radical alternative to the prevailing economic and social order. It was an early example of what we might today call a food sovereignty project, emphasising local control over food production and distribution. In today’s era of industrial agriculture and corporate food systems, the Diggers’ ideas remain highly significant. Their resistance to the enclosure of common lands in the 17th century mirrors today’s struggles against corporate land grabs — and the colonising actions that underpin the likes of Bayer’s corporate jargon about the unlocking of ‘business growth’, ‘driving change management’, ‘driving market share’ and ‘creating business value’ — as well as the privatisation of seeds and genetic resources. The consolidation of the global agri-food chain in the hands of a few powerful corporations represents a modern form of enclosure, concentrating control over food production and distribution in ways that would have been all too familiar to Winstanley and his followers. The Diggers’ emphasis on local, community-controlled food production offers a stark alternative to the industrial agriculture model promoted by agribusiness giants and their allies in institutions like the World Bank and the WTO Where the dominant paradigm prioritises large-scale monocultures, global supply chains and market-driven food security, the Diggers’ vision aligns more closely with concepts of food sovereignty and agroecology. Food sovereignty, a concept developed by the international peasant movement La Via Campesina, shares much with the Diggers’ philosophy. Both emphasise the right of communities to define their own food and agriculture systems. The Diggers’ legacy can be seen in various contemporary movements challenging the corporate food regime. From La Via Campesina’s global struggle for peasant rights to local community garden initiatives and the work of the Agrarian Trust in the US (which provides good insight into the Diggers and their continued relevance in The Diggers Today: Enclosure, Manure and Resistance), we see echoes of the Diggers’ vision. Modern projects to create community-owned farms, seed banks and food cooperatives can be seen as spiritual descendants of the Diggers’ movement, aiming to reclaim food production from corporate control and put it back in the hands of communities. However, realising the Diggers’ vision in the current context faces significant obstacles. The influence of agribusiness conglomerates over key institutions and policymaking bodies presents a formidable challenge. From the World Bank to national agriculture ministries, as this book has made clear, corporate interests often shape policies that prioritise industrial agriculture and global markets over local food systems. International trade agreements and MoUs, often negotiated with minimal public scrutiny, frequently benefit large agribusiness at the expense of small farmers and local food sovereignty. Moreover, proponents of industrial agriculture often argue that it is the only way to feed the world. This narrative, however, ignores the environmental and social costs of this model, as well as the proven productivity of small-scale, agroecological farming methods. The Diggers didn’t just theorise about an alternative society; they attempted to build it by taking direct action, occupying land and implementing their vision of communal agriculture. The Diggers also understood that changing the food system required challenging broader power structures. Today’s food sovereignty movements similarly recognise the need for systemic change, addressing issues of land rights, trade policies and economic justice alongside agricultural practices. In this era of corporate-dominated agriculture, the Diggers’ vision of a “common treasury for all” remains as radical and necessary as ever. By reclaiming the commons, promoting agroecological practices and building food sovereignty, ordinary people can work towards a world where food is truly a common treasury for all. The Diggers recognised that true freedom and equality could not be achieved without addressing the fundamental question of who controls the land and the means of production. This understanding is crucial in the current context, where corporate control over the food system extends from land, seeds and inputs to distribution and retail. The Diggers’ vision also challenges us to rethink our relationship with the land and with each other. In a world increasingly dominated by individualism and market relations, the emphasis on communal ownership and collective labour offers a radical alternative. The Diggers’ legacy challenges us to think beyond the confines of the prevailing food regime, to envision and create a world where food and land are not commodities to be bought and sold but common resources to be shared and stewarded for the benefit of all. Their vision of a world where “the earth becomes a common treasury again” is not a quaint historical curiosity, but a vital and necessary alternative to the destructive practices of those who dominate the current food system. It is noteworthy that the annual Wigan Diggers Festival celebrates the life and ideas of Wigan born and bred Gerrard Winstanley and the Diggers’ Movement (see Wigan Diggers’ Festival). But let us finish with Leon Rosselson’s song lyrics from his 1975 song in reference to the Diggers’ movement (Billy Bragg’s version can be found here on YouTube). In sixteen forty-nine/To St. George’s Hill A ragged band they called the Diggers/Came to show the people’s will They defied the landlords/They defied the laws They were the dispossessed reclaiming what was theirs We come in peace they said/To dig and sow We come to work the lands in common/And to make the waste grounds grow This earth divided/We will makе whole So it will be/A common treasury for all Thе sin of property/We do disdain No man has any right to buy and sell/The earth for private gain By theft and murder/They took the land Now everywhere the walls/Spring up at their command They make the laws/To chain us well The clergy dazzle us with heaven/Or they damn us into hell We will not worship/The God they serve The God of greed who feed the rich/While poor man starve We work we eat together/We need no swords We will not bow to masters/Or pay rent to the lords We are free men/Though we are poor You Diggers all stand up for glory/Stand up now From the men of property/The orders came They sent the hired men and troopers/To wipe out the Diggers’ claim Tear down their cottages/Destroy their corn They were dispersed/Only the vision lingers on You poor take courage/You rich take care The earth was made a common treasury/For everyone to share All things in common/All people one We come in peace/The order came to cut them down Click the share button below to email/forward this article to your friends and colleagues.

The station had operated downtown for its entire 77-year history. On Sunday night, press workers at the Maryland Heights printing plant wiped down machines and posed for photos as trucks carrying Monday's pap… A price tag for the contract will now be negotiated, the airport director said Thursday. In the past few years the company has laid off hundreds of its corporate workers and last fall Panera replaced its board of directors' chair. The court filing Friday marks a potential turning point for one of downtown’s empty behemoths.

Getting a job was tough for many Americans in 2024. If a career shift is your New Year's resolution for 2025, you might still find it challenging. Job growth has slowed, unemployment has been historically low but rising, and unemployed Americans are staying jobless for longer. "Heading into 2025, it is going to be a little harder for job seekers across the board," Cory Stahle, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, said in December. "We've seen that just about every category on Indeed has come down year over year in terms of the number of job postings. So that suggests that employer demand has cooled." Nela Richardson, ADP's chief economist, described the labor market in 2024 as unusually stable and quiet. She pointed to steadily low layoffs and a drop in voluntary turnover amid cooler hiring. "The stasis is rather abnormal, and I think it's going to make it tough for workers who are looking for new opportunities to find them," Richardson said. Here's what economists expect when it comes to job searches, wages and promotions, and other aspects of work life in 2025. One reason it would be hard for job searchers to land a job is that employers may want to see which policies Donald Trump pursues early in his second term. "While business sentiment has picked up somewhat since the election, there is still a lot of uncertainty about future policy changes that will likely make businesses hesitant to ramp up hiring, particularly in the first half of 2025," Dante DeAntonio, a labor economist with Moody's Analytics, said in a written statement. A crackdown on immigration could affect industries with higher shares of immigrant workers, like the construction sector. DeAntonio said those industries "may find themselves scrambling for workers if material changes to immigration policy are enacted." DeAntonio identified the leisure and hospitality industry and agriculture as two others that have historically depended on immigrant labor and could be affected by changes. The new administration could also affect government workers and job seekers. Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, is figuring out suggestions for cutting federal spending and regulations. "A drastic reduction in federal regulations provides sound industrial logic for mass head-count reductions across the federal bureaucracy," Musk and Ramaswamy wrote in an op-ed article published by The Wall Street Journal. Employment growth in the federal government has cooled. From November 2022 to November 2023 the federal government added 77,000 jobs, but it added just 49,000 over the following year. "Depending on how things go with the new administration, we may see a lot of government workers either losing their jobs or quitting," said Brian Rose, a senior US economist for UBS's chief investment office. "This could be an opportunity for private-sector companies to pick up some skilled workers." Richardson said white-collar job seekers, like those searching for tech roles, should be ready to network and wait longer to get a job. "It's not that these jobs don't exist, and it's not that there's not opportunities out there, but the opportunities that people had gotten used to prior to 2024 have slowed," Richardson said. "This economy coming out of the pandemic really thrived on tech jobs." DeAntonio said white-collar industries were "likely to remain at the top of the list as difficult for job seekers to enter, as those firms have been some of the most cautious in terms of hiring." Stahle said lots of jobs were still available in construction and manufacturing, even if opportunities have slowed from a year or two ago. But Stahle said jobs in software development, marketing, and other knowledge work were "hit much harder" by the job-market slowdown. "I think it's going to continue to be kind of a divergence in the labor market where some job seekers will have an easy time next year, albeit a little harder than last year, and then some are going to have a harder time than they've had in a few years," Stahle said in an interview in 2024. Rose said the difficulty of landing work depended on a person's job experience and field of work. While hiring might be rough in finance and tech, construction is one industry that needs workers. Rose said construction and skilled workers for smaller companies were in high demand. He said he also thinks lower-paying jobs are in demand. "If you're in healthcare or the skilled trades, you're in the right place," Julia Pollak, the chief economist at ZipRecruiter, said. "If you're anywhere else, you might want to reevaluate your career choices and look into reskilling and broadening your search." Healthcare has had large job growth relative to other industries and has largely maintained its growth rate even as broader hiring has slowed. Richardson sees a hopeful outlook for the interest-rate-sensitive manufacturing sector, as the Federal Reserve has cut rates in its past few meetings. "As we're seeing the Fed continue to try to draw down rates, manufacturing might benefit from that, and new sources of technology and tech advancement, that leads to more hiring in the sector," Richardson said. In December, AT&T said it wanted its office workers fully back to the workplace. Amazon also told employees they needed to fully work from the office, but it has delayed the January 2 deadline for some. "We are likely to see a continuation of the mixed bag of workplace policy changes that occurred this year," DeAntonio said. "Some firms will undoubtedly make a stronger return-to-office push, especially now as workers seem less inclined to switch jobs as they have in recent years." Despite those moves, the share of white-collar employees working outside the office has risen. The Bureau of Labor Statistics found that 46% of workers in management, business, and financial-operations occupations worked remotely at least part of the time in November, up from 41% a year earlier. Stahle described the outlook for raises, compensation, and promotions as promising. But he added that "we don't want to see wages necessarily pick up to a point where they could fuel inflation." Stahle argued that hiring needed to pick up, particularly for roles that haven't had robust growth, to have a soft landing, where inflation slows to the Fed's 2% target while unemployment and layoffs stay steady. "We want to see people continuing to have decent wage growth, especially wage growth that keeps their purchasing power up and above inflation," Stahle said. The year-over-year increase in average hourly earnings was 4% in November, down from the growth rate in 2022 and the roughly 4.4% increase at the start of the year, though it has outpaced cooling inflation since mid-2023. Rose said he thought wage growth would most likely moderate further. "There's just better balance in the labor market so less need for companies to raise their wages to attract workers," Rose said. But DeAntonio said immigration policy changes could make the labor market even tighter, which would "increase leverage for employees in seeking bigger pay increases." Stahle said the job market could be challenging for young people. The unemployment rate for recent college graduates — people who are 22 to 27 — has been ticking up, but it falls short of the rate for those without a degree in this age group. Rose said he thought that "recent college grads who went to some private college and spent a lot of money and looking for a high-paying, entry-level job to justify that investment" were having a tough time in the job market.

With a net worth of over $420 billion, Elon Musk kicked off 2025 as the world's wealthiest individual, followed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who had $233.5 billion, according to Forbes' latest billionaire rankings. President- Donald Trump's first buddy witnessed a jump of $91 billion in net worth since 1 December 2024, mainly due to SpaceX's new valuation of $350 billion. Forbes' ranking shows a noteworthy rise in the net worth of the top 10 wealthiest individuals, with their combined wealth reaching $1.9 trillion, up from $1.8 trillion in December. Here's a look at the top 10 wealthiest people in the world according to Forbes: Net worth: $421.2 billion With a net worth of $421.2 billion, Elon Musk topped the Forbes list. Musk, who founded SpaceX in 2002 and serves as its CEO, also heads Tesla and holds stakes in social media platform X, AI company xAI, and tunnelling firm Boring Co. He owns 13% of Tesla. Before launching SpaceX in 2002 and joining Tesla in 2004, Musk co-founded PayPal, which was later sold to eBay. Net worth: $233.5 billion With a net worth of $233.5 billion, Amazon founder and Executive Chair Jeff Bezos ranked second on the list. Bezos founded Amazon in 1994 as an online bookstore and later expanded into cloud computing, entertainment, and more. He also owns Blue Origin, a private space company he founded and has invested billions in. Amazon's stock rose by 5% in December 2024, adding around $10 billion to his wealth. Net worth: $209.7 billion Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, who boasts a net worth of $209.7 billion ranked third on the list. He co-founded the company in 1977 and led as CEO until 2014. He now serves as chairman and CTO. Oracle’s stock dropped over 9% in December 2024, wiping out around $17 billion from his wealth - pushing him down to third spot from the second-richest. Net worth: $202.5 billion Mark Zuckerberg, founder, chairman, and CEO of Meta - the company that owns Facebook, the world's largest social media platform has a net worth of $202.5 billion according to Forbes. He owns about 13% of the company. His net worth rose by 3.8 billion USD in December 2024, driven by a 1.9% increase in Meta shares. Net worth: $168.8 billion Bernard Arnault who's the CEO and chairman of luxury goods giant LVMH has a net worth of $168.8 billion. LVMH's portfolio includes- Christian Dior Couture, Givenchy, Fendi, Celine, Kenzo, Tiffany, Bulgari, Loewe, TAG Heuer, Marc Jacobs, Sephora among others. Over the past month, his net worth rose by 8.5 billion USD, driven by a 7% increase in LVMH shares. Arnault was the world’s richest person for most of 2023 and part of 2024. Net worth: $156 billion Fueled by an 11% rally in Google parent Alphabet's stock price, Larry Page's net worth increased by $14 billion to $156 billion. Page cofounded Google with Sergey Brin in 1998 and served as CEO until 2001, and again from 2011 to 2015. He is now a board member of Google’s parent, Alphabet, and retains a controlling stake. Net worth: $149 billion Like his Google cofounder Larry Page, Sergey Brin's net worth also jumped $14.7 billion in the past month due to an increase in Alphabet’s stock price. This surge pushed him from 8th rank to 7th on the Forbes list of the world’s richest people. Net worth: $141.7 billion The Oracle of Omaha dropped from Rank 6 to Rank 8 after Berkshire Hathaway’s stock price slipped about 6% in December wiping off $8.9 billion from his net worth. Warren Buffett, storied for his value investment strategy owns major businesses such as insurer Geico, battery maker Duracell, and fast-food chain Dairy Queen. Net worth: 124.3 billion Steve Ballmer, a former classmate of Bill Gates at Harvard, was Microsoft's CEO from 2000 to 2014. After retiring from Microsoft, Ballmer purchased the Los Angeles Clippers for $2 billion. Presently, Forbes values the team at $5.5 billion. In December, Ballmer's fortune decreased by approximately $500 million. Net worth: $117.2 billion Jensen Huang, the cofounder and CEO of Nvidia, has seen his fortune soar as the company’s chips gained popularity within the AI sector. Thanks to the AI boom, Jensen Huang, the cofounder and CEO of Nvidia, saw a noticeable rise in his fortune. Despite a slight dip in Nvidia shares in December, Huang secured his spot in the top 10 richest.

Title: Wall Street’s Top Banks Just Abandoned a Once Popular Alliance

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- Within the span of a month, Wall Street’s biggest banks have quit what had been one of the most popular clubs inside global finance. Most Read from Bloomberg Is This Weird Dome the Future of Watching Sports? NYC Congestion Pricing to Take Effect After Years of Delays NYPD Seeking Gunmen After 10 People Wounded Outside Queens Venue NYC Congestion Pricing Takes Effect After Years of Delays Burned-Out Parents Need Better Public Spaces The Net-Zero Banking Alliance — a group dedicated to helping lenders reduce their carbon footprints — has in quick succession been abandoned by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp. and Morgan Stanley. JPMorgan Chase & Co., the largest US bank, looks to be next in line. The moves reflect US banks’ desire to shield themselves from increasing political pressure as Donald Trump returns to the White House, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations. And NZBA is bracing for more US exits, Secretariat Lead Sarah Kemmitt told members in a Dec. 31 letter seen by Bloomberg. She cited the “political environment.” At the same time, the real-world impact of the NZBA defections is unclear. According to data compiled by Bloomberg, banks have collectively stepped up their financing of the fossil-fuel industry since the alliance was formed in 2021. Membership of NZBA was likely more a case of “virtue signaling” than “meaningful climate impacts,” said Jill Fisch, a business law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. A spokesperson for NZBA declined to comment. Activists are now demanding that the government intervene to target Wall Street. Environmental Advocates NY, a nonprofit, says it’s urging New York state officials to introduce regulations and laws that would compel banks operating in the world’s biggest financial hub to take climate action. The wave of NZBA exits follows behind-the-scenes tensions that have been brewing for more than two years, Bloomberg’s reporting has shown. In 2022, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley were among banks pushing back against binding targets on climate finance. NZBA then watered down some requirements, and members stayed put. But as the Republican Party grows more hostile toward climate-friendly organizations, the finance industry is repositioning itself. Global temperatures are rising fast, yet banks continue to reap short-term profits by sticking with fossil fuel producers. It’s therefore both “distressing and unsurprising” that Wall Street is turning it’s back on net zero alliances, said Ken Pucker, who teaches sustainability at the Fletcher School at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts. The alliances were created in order to encourage the finance industry to take into account the longer-term cost of supporting oil, gas and coal. Back in 2021, when NZBA was formed, banks now leaving the alliance proudly touted their membership. BofA Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan spoke of a “commitment to net zero” in his role as co-chair of the Sustainable Markets Initiative, whose stated mission is to “build a coordinated global effort” to help green the private sector. And in an April 2021 statement announcing its agenda, the world’s biggest coalition for climate finance — the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero — said it would “require signatories to set science-aligned interim and long-term goals to reach net zero no later than 2050.” GFANZ ended 2024 by recalibrating its mission as banks flee and GOP attacks intensify. The group is distancing itself from the net zero alliances for which it had previously been an umbrella organization. Going forward, GFANZ will make its guidance available to financial firms, whether they’ve committed to a net zero alliance or not. A spokesperson for GFANZ declined to comment beyond the group’s public statements. Banks that sign up to NZBA still commit to transition their financed emissions to align with “pathways to net zero by 2050” at the latest, according to its website. They’re also required to provide 2030 targets to show they’re on track, and to document their progress. All banks exiting NZBA have made public statements to say they still recognize decarbonization as a worthy goal. But they’ve also made clear that their biggest duty is to serve the needs of their clients. None has provided an official reason for quitting the alliance. Wall Street is now navigating a world in which bankers and money managers suspected of being unsupportive of the GOP’s pro-fossil fuel agenda face a growing threat of litigation. Just weeks after Trump was re-elected in November, Texas led a move to sue BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. for allegedly breaching antitrust laws by adopting pro-climate strategies to suppress coal production. Then in December, the GOP-led House Judiciary Committee said it found “substantial evidence that a climate cartel of financial institutions” had engaged in “anticompetitive collusion” by demanding that companies “disclose, reduce and enforce” their net zero climate commitments. The committee, which is led by Ohio Republican Jim Jordan, singled out GFANZ and similar groups for leading what it described as a climate crusade. GOP members have made clear they feel increasingly emboldened. After hearing of the defections from NZBA, Republican Congressman-elect Riley Moore of West Virginia said via a spokesperson that he will keep trying to ban and block financial firms suspected of supporting “anti-fossil fuel ESG policies.” Meanwhile, Wall Street firms continue to earn considerably more from arranging fossil-fuel deals than their European counterparts. Last year, JPMorgan topped the league table of banks underwriting bonds and loans for oil, gas and coal companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was followed by Wells Fargo, TD Securities, BofA, RBC Capital Markets and Citigroup. The biggest underwriter of green bonds, meanwhile, was BNP Paribas SA, which is the largest bank in the European Union. European banks, which are subject to much stricter climate regulations than their US peers, have so far showed no sign of walking away from NZBA. And representatives of lenders with headquarters spanning London to Amsterdam to Frankfurt said they plan to stay put. “Our position is very straightforward, we have absolutely no intention of leaving the NZBA,” a spokesperson for Standard Chartered Plc told Bloomberg. ING Groep NV and Deutsche Bank AG have made similar statements. Global banks provided about $680 billion worth of fossil-fuel loans and bond deals in 2024, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s up from $667 billion in 2021, when NZBA was created. Banks that have stepped up such deals over the period include BofA and Goldman, the data show. Pucker of Tufts University draws parallels between the choices banks are making today, and those they made in the lead-up to the 2008 financial crisis. He says to understand banks’ thinking now, it’s worth recalling a 2007 comment by Charles O. Prince III, who was Citigroup’s CEO at the time: “‘As long as the music is playing, you’ve got to get up and dance’.” Global warming is now on track to race past the critical threshold of 1.5C, raising questions as to the value of having financial firms claim they can still align their operations with that target. “Banks merely reflect the real economy,” said Aniket Shah, head of sustainability and transition strategy at Jefferies Financial Group Inc. “So if the real economy remains a hydrocarbon economy, then banks will reflect that too.” Environmental Advocates NY says the state government must now consider forcing banks to impose financing limits to align with climate goals, including restrictions targeting fossil fuels. They also are calling for rules that would require banks to document the extent to which they’re lowering their so-called financed emissions. Vanessa Fajans-Turner, executive director at the nonprofit, said it’s clear Republicans have succeeded in their efforts to get Wall Street to retreat from climate commitments, “modest” as they were. “The banks won’t police themselves,” she said. “That’s why we need regulation.” (GFANZ is co-chaired by Mark Carney, who is chair of Bloomberg Inc. and a former Bank of England governor, and Michael R. Bloomberg, the founder of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP.) --With assistance from Alastair Marsh, Gautam Naik and Todd Gillespie. (Updates with comment from Jefferies in fourth-last paragraph.)

Title: How My 2024 Predictions Went – And Some Predictions for 2025

EditorEconomy Kurt Schlichter, The Burning Platform Guest Post by Kurt Schlichter The Burning Platform In my January 1, 2024, column entitled “Top Twenty Terrible Predictions for 2024,” I noted that, “Every year, I offer you my predictions for the coming trip around the Sun, and every year, I’m mostly wrong.” Back then, I predicted that “I think [2024] will be a disaster.” Shows what I know. Personally, I had two houses flood from broken plumbing and practically became a general contractor. That sucked. But in the macro, it was a pretty good year for America. I predicted that “Trump is not going to be subject to any federal trials this year…. The state cases might, but they are idiotic too.” I also predicted that “the 14th Amendment nonsense is going to get shot down. I thought Hunter would plead out. As expected, Joe Biden was “not held accountable for his crimes.” Then there was this: “I really like Ron DeSantis, but there’s a significant chance that Donald Trump is going to be the nominee.” Oh, but then I ruined it by predicting that “if he is the nominee, he picks Nikki Haley and, for reasons I will set out in an upcoming Townhall column, that’s a good idea…from his perspective.” Boy, did that column stir the pot! I also correctly predicted that “she’ll continue to spew consultant-generated corporate-friendly cliches and hack talking points as she seeks to turn back the clock on Republicanism twenty years.” I predicted that “Israel is going to rout Hamas,” but also that “there will be some sort of talks to resolve the Ukraine open wound.” I was right that “the Houthis will continue to humiliate America and will be on the receiving end of a few puny airstrikes.” At home, I foresaw leftist riots. Those did not happen. I predicted that “the border crisis will continue unabated,” and Biden pretended to abate it a little bit. I also correctly saw that “the GOP squish caucus will enter into a compromise to solve it.” Senator Jim Amnesty Lankford makes an appearance in my “Biggest Idiots of 2024” column. I was right that we would win the Senate but wrong when I predicted that “we will lose the House because we are Republicans and Republicans are stupid.” In fact, we won it, barely, because Republicans are stupid. I was wrong when I predicted a Supreme Court vacancy to be filled by “a pinko BIPOC differently-abled nonbinary two-spirit of heft.” I was right when I predicted that wokeness would peak and begin to decline. I was right that “the women’s Olympic medals will all be won by men, proving that men are better than women at everything, including being women.” I was also right that “the Regime Media will suffer more layoffs and bankruptcies, and there will be much rejoicing.” I expected the football guy to dump Taylor Swift. I don’t know whether that happened or not. I was doing pretty well until I got here: “Joe Biden is not going to be replaced, and he will be on the ballot in November. I’m not sure if he’ll know it, though. Man, picking Kamala Harris was the greatest insurance policy anybody ever took out.” I further opined that “the Democrats will win in November.” In my defense, I said that hoping “my track record of being wrong about my predictions holds up.” It held up, thankfully. Here’s what I think will happen in 2025: Once again, see you in 12 months, assuming these idiots have not caused a nuclear and/or civil war in the meantime so that I can give you some more inevitably wrong predictions for 2026.

Title: Why Performance Chasing Is an Investing Error
URL: https://www.acepnow.com/article/why-performance-chasing-is-an-investing-error/?singlepage=1
Time Published: 2025-01-04T07:30:00Z
Full Content:
I’m now eligible for my 401(k), and I need to pick which mutual funds to invest my contributions into. I’m not sure exactly how to do this, but I can see which ones had the best returns over the last one, three, and five years, so I just thought I’d put all my money into the top two or three of them so I’m diversified. Is that the right approach? “Performance chasing” is widely recognized by behavioral economists as a serious investing error. In fact, it’s such a bad idea that mutual funds are required by law to include a statement in their paperwork saying something to the effect that past performance is no guarantee of future results. I wish the statement were even stronger, saying something like, “Outsized past performance is highly likely to reverse in the near future.” But, alas, investing is a caveat emptor activity. Performance chasing is easy to do. It is often driven by FOMO—fear of missing out. We hear about our friends making money in ARK funds, meme stocks, Beanie Babies, or Bitcoin and pile in, only to suffer through the inevitable downturn inherent in popular investment booms. At that point, fear of loss usually kicks in and we sell low. “Buy high and sell low” is not a recipe for investment success. The truth is that the outperformance of a few mutual funds in your 401(k) is far more likely due to what they invest in than the skill of their managers. For example, over the last five to 10 years, U.S. stocks have generally outperformed international stocks, bonds, and real estate, especially the large cap “growth” and “tech” stocks, like NVIDIA, Meta (Facebook), Amazon, and Alphabet (Google). So any mutual fund that was invested heavily in those stocks will demonstrate excellent results over the last few years, no matter what their investment strategy. Chances are, the top two or three funds in your 401(k) are all invested in those same types of stocks, and buying three funds that all invest in the same stocks is just false diversification. The data are very clear that the outperformance of active mutual fund managers does not persist. Well, it may, but only among the worst ones. Some studies show that the top quintile of managers for a given year are no more likely to be in the top quintile the next year than any other manager, but the bottom quintile managers are actually more likely to be in the bottom quintile the next year. Sometimes their funds simply close and disappear from the historical record. A more recent study by the mutual fund gurus at Morningstar concluded: Over the long term, there is no meaningful relationship between past and future fund performance. In most cases, the odds of picking a future long-term winner from the best-performing quintile in each category aren’t materially different than selecting from the bottom quintile. The results strongly indicate that long-term investors should not select funds based on past performance alone. As a rule, the more you pay for an investment, the worse its future returns will be. If you can buy a rental property with a net income of $20,000 for $200,000, that will probably be a great investment. Not so much if you pay $600,000 for that same property. That’s exactly what is happening when you buy any other investment after a recent run-up in price. You’re paying more for every dollar of earnings it generates, and thus your return must be lower than that of an investor who bought it at a lower price. Any student of the markets will quickly see that there is a pendulum effect as different types of investments come in and out of favor. Sometimes growth stocks do well. Sometimes value stocks do well. Sometimes small stocks or Chinese stocks or utility stocks do well. Sometimes bonds or real estate perform well. Predicting which will do best in the near future is extraordinarily difficult. In my opinion, it’s so difficult that it is probably not worth trying to do so. Certainly, there is no evidence that just buying whatever did best in the last year, three years, or even five years is going to lead to investment success. But doing the opposite isn’t any more successful; you can’t just take a contrarian approach and buy whatever did most poorly last year, either. Sometimes stocks have gone down in value for a reason—because the company is en route to bankruptcy. Perhaps if it recovers, you will make out like a bandit by buying low. The company behind the stock often does not rebound; good or bad performance may persist longer than expected. So what should an investor do if they can’t just pick the best performing funds out of their 401(k)? How about creating a reasonable, written investment plan instead? Determine a priori how much of the portfolio will be invested into U.S. stocks, international stocks, bonds, real estate, and other investments. Then look “under the hood” at what the available funds in your 401(k) actually invest in and choose them based on the underlying investments. Among funds that invest in similar investments, the best predictor of future performance is low costs, so choose the one with the lowest expenses. These will usually be index funds. If you need help doing so, consider hiring a fiduciary, fee-only financial planner who provides good advice at a fair price. While this stuff is not that hard to learn, the consequences of doing it poorly (or not doing it at all) compound over time. It may be well worth paying a few thousand dollars to get started on the right foot. Alternatively, come to the ACEP-sponsored workshop the Saturday prior to ACEP24 in Las Vegas, and I’ll help you walk through the process of writing your own financial plan. Whatever you do, don’t just buy the hottest performing stock, mutual fund, or other investment available—that approach does not necessarily lead to long-term investing success.

Title: The Woes Of The 155th: A French-Trained Brigade's Problems Highlight Bigger Ukrainian Difficulties
URL: https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/ukraine/2025/01/ukraine-250103-rferl03.htm

By Yevhenia Kytaiva-Rusetska, Nataliia Semenova, Zoriana Stepanenko and Mike Eckel January 03, 2025 It was supposed to be at the vanguard of a modernized Ukrainian Army, trained in Western tactics by French instructors, armed with Western weaponry, equipped to take on a bigger Russian Army on the battlefield. That hasn't happened. Instead, the Ukrainian military's 155th Separate Mechanized Brigade has been roiled by desertions, incriminations, and now, scathing public criticism accusing commanders of incompetence. The brigade's commander was abruptly replaced last month just after the unit returned from training in France, and Ukraine's lead law enforcement agency is investigating reports that dozens, possibly hundreds, of its soldiers have gone AWOL, or absent without leave. The 155th's problems have burst into the open at a wrenching time for Ukraine, with its population exhausted from nearly three years of full-scale war and its military exhausted from relentless Russian offensives. The problems, and the public venting, also illustrate the wider issues that have plagued Ukraine's military for months, if not years -- and, experts say, have hampered its ability to wage an effective full-scale defense, or offense, against a larger, better-equipped Russian force. "The training that I imagined should happen in the third year of war, what it should have been like, is not there," one lieutenant, currently on unauthorized leave from the brigade, told RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service." "I, for one, do not know what I am supposed to do. I'm not ready to give up and execute any orders with untrained people. Plus, I'm untrained myself. I command 30-something people. I'm not ready to risk their lives." "In France, I was taught absolutely nothing," said the officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity since public criticism of the military can result in criminal prosecution. At least 59 soldiers from the brigade left the training grounds in France without authorization, the officer said, a figure that was echoed by Yuriy Butusov, a popular Ukrainian war correspondent who described the brigade as "complete organizational chaos." In an interview, Butusov said the decision behind the brigade's training and formation were more political than anything. "There is simply no point in creating such brigades that are not fully staffed, that have no time at all to train, as we see," he told RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service. "If we say we need a new brigade, then this is a matter that should take at least a year to complete. In addition to individual training, we need to ensure management at many levels." Inevitable Chaos? Western allies have poured billions of dollars into weaponry and equipment for Ukraine's armed forces, equipping them with modern technology to fight a bigger Russian Army with more weaponry as its disposal. They also sought to retrain Ukraine's armed forces, moving them away from the doctrine and tactics that its senior Soviet-trained officer corps grew up on, and introducing NATO-style thinking, such as combined arms warfare and emphasizing smaller brigades, rather than larger divisions. But aside from weaponry, Ukraine also faced a bigger problem: manpower. Critics in and out of Ukraine grumbled that Ukrainian authorities were failing to build a sustainable system of recruitment, mobilization, and training, to replenish depleted units. Ukrainian command created several new brigades. Some units were sent to Germany for training. Another unit was set up in France last year to great fanfare: the 155th Separate Mechanized Brigade was dubbed the "Anne of Kyiv" Brigade, named for an 11th century Kyiv princess who later became Queen of France. French President Emmanuel Macron announced the unit's creation during anniversary celebrations for the World War II Normandy invasion in June. Two months later, about 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers -- about the half the size of a standard NATO brigade -- were sent to France for training that included instruction on advanced French weapons systems; Macron later paid a highly publicized visit to the unit in October. When the 155th began rotating back to Ukraine in late November, Ukrainian forces had already been struggling for months trying to stave off accelerating Russian offensives in multiple places across the roughly 1,100-kilometer front line. On December 12, the brigade's commander, Colonel Dmytro Ryumshin, was replaced, just days before it was supposed to head into combat. The reason for Ryumshin's dismissal was unclear, but he posted a statement on the brigade's Facebook page thanking the unit's soldiers and officers for their "loyalty and professionalism." Days earlier, lawmaker Maryana Bezuhla criticized how the brigade was conceived, saying it was patched together haphazardly from other units, which in turn deprived other units of troop strength. "What happened to the 155th: even though the French attempted to make the brigade specialized, it wasn't spared from stupid military decisions, which tore the unit apart," she wrote on Facebook. "Within the brigade chaos reigns." That was echoed by Serhiy Sternenko, an activist and blogger who writes about public corruption and was previously affiliated with a far-right paramilitary group. "Why create a new brigade when the existing brigades were critically understaffed, if it was then divided up to assign people to the old brigades? What's the point?" Sternenko said in a post to X. "In addition to the blow to our image in French eyes, where part of the brigade was trained and equipped with equipment, we again suffered high losses and exhaustion." "This madness must be stopped before it completely undermines the army's ability to organize resistance," he wrote. 'I'd Rather Go AWOL' Despite the reported organizational problems, the brigade has deployed in part to help in the defense of Pokrovsk, a Donbas city that is under major threat of encirclement by Russian forces. Reports say the unit fielded German-made Leopard tanks and French artillery. But the brigade lieutenant who spoke to RFE/RL on condition of anonymity said some equipment they were provided was broken; excavators, for example, used to dig trenches and defenses. He also described some of the problems with command orders. "When we returned from France, some part of the brigade was already near Pokrovsk," he said. "Then we received an order to transfer to the infantry, and a lot of people went AWOL. Days later, we were sent to the Dnipropetrovsk region. And the next day, we received an order to go to a settlement 20 kilometers from the front line. "My commander wrote to me: 'Gather nine people. Tomorrow you're going to a specific place.' I asked him what we were supposed to do there. He said: 'I don't know'," the lieutenant said. "That is, the commanders are unprofessional, they haven't trained people." He said some soldiers think "I'd rather go AWOL. If I get caught, then at least, sooner or later, the prison door will open. The lid of a coffin will never open." Unconfirmed reports suggest that the brigade has suffered disproportionate casualties in the defense of Pokrovsk, something Butusov said was significant. "Most of the 155th soldiers on the front line are trying to fulfill their duties honestly," Butusov wrote in his December 31 Facebook post. "But due to a certain criminal attitude toward soldiers' lives, the 155th Brigade has suffered significant losses from the very first days" of deployment. Another brigade soldier, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said Butusov's criticism was largely true but was incomplete. "The situation with the formation was even worse than he described," the soldier said. The State Bureau of Investigation, Ukraine's lead law investigative agency, confirmed to RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service that it was investigating the reports of soldiers deserting. A brigade press officer declined to comment. Asked about the brigade's problems, France's presidential office, Elysee Palace, referred the question to the French Defense Ministry. "It was the Ukrainian Armed Forces that organized the selection of Ukrainian military personnel to form this brigade and manage the processes," the ministry said. "Also...the Ukrainian Armed Forces determine the conditions for the [brigade's] deployment in Ukraine."

Caoimhín Kelleher and Troy Parrott to lead the way at both ends of the pitch. 4. Europe head to Bethpage Black in New York for what promises to be a raucous Ryder Cup match against the United States. How many Irish players will make Luke Donald’s team? Who will win? Europe to cause an upset and a huge New York-based Irish crowd will be there cheering on Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry. 5. What would be your dream ticket to a sporting event in 2025? PDC Darts Final at the Ally Pally. 6. If you had the power to change one thing in any sport, what would it be? Soccer: A minimum shin guard size to be mandated that’s bigger than a match stick box. 7. One to watch in the sporting year ahead Erin King. Ireland women’s rugby team to kick on and make waves at the World Cup. 1. Who will win the GAA All-Ireland titles in football (men and women), hurling and camogie?

Have they any chance of making it out of the group? Which player has the potential to make it happen? This is a group that Ireland can get out of if they are ready to take advantage of opportunities that come their way. It won’t be easy and they will rely on Caoimhín Kelleher to make it happen. 4 Europe head to Bethpage Black in New York for what promises to be a raucous Ryder Cup match against the United States. How many Irish players will make Luke Donald’s team? Who will win? Two Irish players, Shane Lowry and Rory McIlroy. It will be close and the USA will likely hold on to win but Europe won’t give up without a tough battle. 5 What would be your dream ticket to a sporting event in 2025? Dream ticket would be to The Ryder Cup to see Shane Lowry on the final green claim the winning point for Europe. 6 If you had the power to change one thing in any sport, what would it be? Not to have pacemakers at every Diamond League meeting and limit the athletes to three per country in each race. 7 One to watch in the sporting year ahead Gout Gout, the teenage Australian 200 metre runner. Kevin Kilbane – 110 caps for the Republic of Ireland, football columnist 1 Who will win the GAA All-Ireland titles in football (men and women), hurling and camogie?

Which player has the potential to make it happen? Yes, Ireland have a chance and that’s precisely the attitude Heimir Hallgrimsson seems to be adopting but we all know we’re up against it. If we’re to qualify, Caoimhín Kelleher has to turn in some big performances. With more game time, I’m convinced Evan Ferguson can fulfil his huge potential. 4 Europe head to Bethpage Black in New York for what promises to be a raucous Ryder Cup match against the United States. How many Irish players will make Luke Donald’s team? Who will win? Two players. Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry. USA win on home soil. 5 What would be your dream ticket to a sporting event in 2025? I’d love to go to the Masters. Imagine walking the back nine on a Sunday with Rory and Shane both on the Leaderboard. 6 If you had the power to change one thing in any sport, what would it be? Easy one. Diving, play acting and cheating in football. It’s gone on too long it has now just become ‘part of the game’. 7 One to watch in the sporting year ahead Ruben Amorim. The Man United drama continues. Does he have the ability and courage to turn Man United around? One of the biggest stories to watch in 2025.

The Lions will win the Test series in a whitewash. 3 Ireland’s soccer team has been drawn in a World Cup qualifying group alongside Portugal or Denmark, Hungary and Armenia. Have they any chance of making it out of the group? Which player has the potential to make it happen? The chances of qualifying are close to nil. If Evan Ferguson gets a loan move in the second half of the season – ideally a confidence-boosting spell in the Championship – he could still be the catalyst for better days ahead. 4 Europe head to Bethpage Black in New York for what promises to be a raucous Ryder Cup match against the United States. How many Irish players will make Luke Donald’s team? Who will win? The United States will win. Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry will be the only Irish players. It is too soon for Tom McKibben while Seamus Power was playing better at this stage of the last Ryder Cup cycle. 5 What would be your dream ticket to a sporting event in 2025? The Open at Portrush – if it wasn’t on the same weekend as the All-Ireland hurling final. Which it is. 6 If you had the power to change one thing in any sport, what would it be?

He will only get better. Gavin Cummiskey – soccer correspondent 1 Who will win the GAA All-Ireland titles in football (men and women), hurling and camogie? Dublin double in football after Brian Fenton un-retires, Limerick to strike back in hurling and a Cork camogie three-in-a-row. 2 The British and Irish Lions head Down Under for the Test series. How many Irish players will be on Andy Farrell’s team? Who will win, the Lions or Australia? Eleven Irish starters for the first Test. Hugo Keenan, Garry Ringrose, Bundee Aki, Sam Prendergast and Jamison Gibson Park in the backline; Caelan Doris, Josh van der Flier, Joe McCarthy, Andrew Porter, Tadhg Furlong and Dan Sheehan in the pack. Joe Schmidt to engineer one win for the Wallabies but Lions to take series 2-1. 3 Ireland’s soccer team has been drawn in a World Cup qualifying group alongside Portugal or Denmark, Hungary and Armenia. Have they any chance of making it out of the group? Which player has the potential to make it happen? Hungary and Portugal/Denmark will aim to take six points off the Republic of Ireland. To make a play-off, Evan Ferguson needs to evolve into a prime Zlatan Ibrahimović. At least Heimir-ball has nine months to take hold. 4 Europe head to Bethpage Black in New York for what promises to be a raucous Ryder Cup match against the United States. How many Irish players will make Luke Donald’s team? Who will win? Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry. European banter and bonding to help engineer a crushing defeat of Team USA that brings the entire Ryder Cup Inc into question. 5 What would be your dream ticket to a sporting event in 2025? Witnessing Ireland qualify for the World Cup as group winners by beating Hungary in Budapest on November 16th would do just fine. 6 If you had the power to change one thing in any sport, what would it be? Introduce a 30-second shot-clock to Gaelic football when the attacking team crosses halfway. Force players to create scores under pressure. Problem solved. 7 One to watch in the sporting year ahead Mason Melia. Hopefully this sturdy 17-year-old reappears for St Patrick’s Athletic in February before a lucrative move abroad next summer. Brian O’Connor – racing correspondent 1 Who will win the GAA All-Ireland titles in football (men and women), hurling and camogie? Cork to win the hurling – at last! Dublin to get back on the horse in football. Cork for Camogie and a nice synchronicity then to Dublin in the football. 2 The British and Irish Lions head Down Under for the Test series. How many Irish players will be on Andy Farrell’s team? Who will win, the Lions or Australia? Let’s say eight, and with so many Irish in opposition, there will be no more motivated Aussie team with Joe Schmidt in charge. Home win. 3 Ireland’s soccer team has been drawn in a World Cup qualifying group alongside Portugal or Denmark, Hungary and Armenia. Have they any chance of making it out of the group? Which player has the potential to make it happen? Ireland look long shots. Hopes could be pinned to a rejuvenated Evan Ferguson. 4 Europe head to Bethpage Black in New York for what promises to be a raucous Ryder Cup match against the United States. How many Irish players will make Luke Donald’s team? Who will win? Two – McIlroy and Lowry. Another home win. 5 What would be your dream ticket to a sporting event in 2025? After a mammoth 20-year gap, Cork finally winning the hurling in Croke Park. 6 If you had the power to change one thing in any sport, what would it be? Recognition by the powers in Irish racing that government money can be used for the sport’s structural improvement rather than just pouring it into prize money. 7 One to watch in the sporting year ahead Red Letter won just one from three as a two-year-old. But as a physical type, Ger Lyons’s Frankel filly should only thrive with time. Enough perhaps to score at Group One level in 2025. Philip Reid – golf correspondent 1 Who will win the GAA All-Ireland titles in football (men and women), hurling and camogie? Tyrone look to have a fine influx of young players to mix in and could get their hands on Sam again while Dublin have the strength in depth to rebound and reclaim the Brendan Martin; in hurling, it’d be great to see Cork finally end their drought while, in camogie, the Rebels’ women can make it a three-in-a-row of titles and a double with the small ball for the Leesiders. 2 The British and Irish Lions head Down Under for the Test series. How many Irish players will be on Andy Farrell’s team? Who will win, the Lions or Australia? There were eight Irish on the 2021 touring squad so expect more this time with Andy Farrell in the coaching hot seat. 10 maybe (with Sam Prendergast as a wildcard)? Lions to win the series. 3 Ireland’s soccer team has been drawn in a World Cup qualifying group alongside Portugal or Denmark, Hungary and Armenia. Have they any chance of making it out of the group? Which player has the potential to make it happen? Realistically, the pathway to North America for 2026 must be through the playoffs. I can’t see Ireland topping the group – regardless of whether it’s Portugal or Denmark with top seeding – so it will be a target to finish second. For that to happen, Evan Ferguson has to be fit and scoring and hopefully Chiedozie Ogbene will be back. 4 Europe head to Bethpage Black in New York for what promises to be a raucous Ryder Cup match against the United States. How many Irish players will make Luke Donald’s team? Who will win? Well you can pencil Rory McIlroy in straight away so it will be a matter of Shane Lowry or Tom McKibbin doing enough to join him. Lowry has two Ryder Cups behind him and fully justified his captain’s pick from Luke Donald in Rome so just has to keep doing what he is doing and he should be in, either through qualifying off his own bat or a pick again. So, two Irish, but the US to win. 5 What would be your dream ticket to a sporting event in 2025? I’ll be at the Ryder Cup and – working, fortunately, so don’t have to fork out the outrageously high admission price – that, from a golfing perspective, should be some occasion in New York. Other than that, the All-Ireland football final (with Dublin in it!!). 6 If you had the power to change one thing in any sport, what would it be? As jaw-droppingly good as it is to see someone hit drives of 350 yards plus off the tee, the time has come for bifurcation of the golf ball in professional tournaments while leaving the golf ball as it is for amateurs. 7 One to watch in the sporting year ahead Tom McKibbin (again!), for a reason. He’s only just turned 22 but year on year has made the progression on a career path that has the makings of being something special. He’s graduated in turn from the Challenge Tour to the DP World Tour and in 2025 will play with a full PGA Tour card in the United States. His game (high ball flight, putting, temperament) bodes well for that next challenge. Gerry Thornley – rugby correspondent 1 Who will win the GAA All-Ireland titles in football (men and women), hurling and camogie? Galway to go one better in the men’s football, Kerry to retain their title in the ladies football, Clare to retain their crown in the hurling and Galway to win the camogie. 2 The British and Irish Lions head Down Under for the Test series. How many Irish players will be on Andy Farrell’s team? Who will win, the Lions or Australia? Maybe 14 Irish players in the travelling squad and eight in the match day 23. But that could be biased. And the Lions to roar Down Under! 3 Ireland’s soccer team has been drawn in a World Cup qualifying group alongside Portugal or Denmark, Hungary and Armenia. Have they any chance of making it out of the group? Which player has the potential to make it happen? Largely based on the convoluted and increased number of qualifying routes to the finals, Ireland probably have a better chance than has been the case for a while. If so, then Nathan Collins will surely be the rock on which the team is built. Sammie Szmodics looks a good, hard-working addition. 4 Europe head to Bethpage Black in New York for what promises to be a raucous Ryder Cup match against the United States. How many Irish players will make Luke Donald’s team? Who will win? Two, namely Rory and Shane. And, ugh, U-S-A!...U-S-A!...U-S-A!...U-S-A! 5 What would be your dream ticket to a sporting event in 2025? The Champions League final, and especially if Arsenal are in it. Munich swings this one. Never been. 6 If you had the power to change one thing in any sport, what would it be? The half-time or full-time TV analysis with studio pundits in rugby or football, and probably most sports, when all smug comments along the lines of “as we were saying beforehand” are outlawed, with repeat offenders to be imprisoned. Yes, we know this is your genius and this is why you have been hired, and the producers have told you to say this. 7 One to watch in the sporting year ahead The Connacht scrumhalf, Matthew Devine. Malachy Clerkin – member of Na Fianna GAA club 1 Who will win the GAA All-Ireland titles in football (men and women), hurling and camogie? Men’s football is a lucky dip until we see the new rules in action – possibly Donegal? Women’s football is ripe for a new name as well – maybe Armagh if the Mackins get back to full fitness. Men’s hurling will be all about Limerick getting their groove back – even without Nickie Quaid, I fancy them. Camogie will probably be Cork again. 2 The British and Irish Lions head Down Under for the Test series. How many Irish players will be on Andy Farrell’s team? Who will win, the Lions or Australia? There’ll presumably be plenty of Irishmen in the squad but I reckon the actual starting 15 will have fewer than people think. Four feels about right. They should win – Australia are getting better under Joe Schmidt but they’re still there for the taking. 3 Ireland’s soccer team has been drawn in a World Cup qualifying group alongside Portugal or Denmark, Hungary and Armenia. Have they any chance of making it out of the group? Which player has the potential to make it happen? There is no real evidence that success is just around the corner. It will come down to home and away fixtures against Hungary, most likely. Maybe Caoimhín Kelleher can see us into a play-off. That counts as getting out of the group, doesn’t it? 4 Europe head to Bethpage Black in New York for what promises to be a raucous Ryder Cup match against the United States. How many Irish players will make Luke Donald’s team? Who will win? Two – Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry will make it. The fact that it’s going to be such a bear pit means it probably comes a bit too soon for Tom McKibbin, although his first year on the PGA Tour is going to be worth watching. The Yanks will win. Nobody ever wins away any more. 5 What would be your dream ticket to a sporting event in 2025? Olympic Stadium, Tokyo, Thursday September 18th. Women’s 400m final at the World Athletics Championship. Rhasidat Adeleke is going to be an unmissable part of every Irish sporting year for the next decade (hopefully). Time for her first senior world podium. 6 If you had the power to change one thing in any sport, what would it be? I would find a way not to have to pay money to seven different companies to watch the sport that I want on my television. A floating sports fan needs to pay the TV licence, Sky, GAAGo, Premier Sports, Racing TV, Danz and Netflix these days just to keep up. No wonder dodgy boxes are all the rage. 7 One to watch in the sporting year ahead Sam Ewing looks set to be the main beneficiary of his friend Jack Kennedy’s terrible luck. Kennedy’s recent leg break – his sixth, incredibly – leaves Ewing with a great chance to be at the vanguard of Gordon Elliott’s spring campaign. Don’t rule out a tilt at the jockey’s title. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Defense Tech Scaling New Heights With Incoming Administration

Apex, a Shield Capital portfolio company, takes a selfie of its first space vehicle dubbed “Call to ... [+] Adventure” demonstrating its satellite subsystems working less than a year from design to satellite commissioning—the fastest deployment ever in its class. The recent run up in the stock market—especially for tech stocks—signals a stimulative business climate during the second Trump Administration which should fuel a continued rise for defense tech—the incorporation of new technologies such as AI, cyber, autonomy and space for military applications. The first Trump Administration saw an S&P 500 increase of 50%, a much larger tech stock increase of 138%, and 380% for the Magnificent 7 stocks. Looking forward, the combination of extended rate reductions in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017), a lighter regulatory environment, and likely lower interest rates with easing inflation all create a positive economic outlook. This economic outlook provides fertile ground for gains in the defense tech sector which has already been one of the most promising areas for venture investors. Since 2021, venture investment in defense tech totals more than $100 billion, 40% more than the previous seven years combined. The factors driving increased investment are likely to intensify during the next four years: first, rising geopolitical tensions and, second, the technologies which militaries need are increasingly developed by the private sector rather than government labs. NEW YORK, NY - AUGUST 16: Wall St. and Broad St. signs are seen by the New York Stock Exchange ... [+] (NYSE) building in the financial district of New York City, United States on August 16, 2021. (Photo by Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images) The first large-scale land war in Europe since World War II, renewed fighting in the Middle East, and China’s aggressive actions in the South China Sea all highlight simultaneous geopolitical conflicts. Further, America’s adversaries—China, Russia, Iran and North Korea—are collaborating more closely than ever in an axis of autocrats which enable them to combine strengths in their collective goal of weakening the United States. During Trump’s first term in office and most recent campaign, he advocated modernizing and strengthening our military. In this campaign, he began referring to the Reagan doctrine of “peace through strength” which recalls an era when the U.S. spent 6% of GDP on defense compared to today’s 3%—the lowest relative level in 75 years. The incoming chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. Roger Wicker, is on record calling for a generational investment in defense spending at 5% of GDP. Military superiority now depends to a large degree on commercial technologies such as AI, autonomy, cyber, space, and others being used in military applications. The war in Ukraine has shown the power of these new technologies such as commercial satellite imagery, small aerial drones, and maritime autonomy which enabled Ukraine to sink or disable one-third of the Russian Fleet without a regular navy. In the last 50 years, there has been a dramatic shift in the drivers of military technology from government labs to consumers and businesses; consequently, venture funding has become the primary financing mechanism and is two to three times the size of the Defense Department’s R&D budget. The positive landscape for defense tech investing builds on several developments during the Biden Administration. The Defense Innovation Unit, created to deliver more commercial technology to the Pentagon, now has a $1 billion budget (up 8 times since I led it in 2022) and whose director now reports directly to the Secretary of Defense. The Office of Strategic Capital now has the authority to make up to $1 billion in loans for component technologies, like batteries or quantum computing, important for national security. Last year, the Deputy Secretary of Defense announced the Replicator initiative with the goal of delivering thousands of attritable autonomous systems within 18 months and said recently that the Department appears on track to do so. LONDON, ENGLAND - MARCH 12: A L3Harris IVER4 900 Autonomous Undersea Vehicle (AUV) / Unmanned ... [+] underwater vehicle (UUV) during the Oceanology International 2024 at ExCel on March 12, 2024 in London, England. The event is the global forum where ocean industry, academia and government connect to discover innovative solutions, from ocean technology, marine science communities, improving strategies for exploring, protecting and sustainably operating in the world's oceans and waterways. (Photo by John Keeble/Getty Images) In addition, the U.S. Space Force announced its commercial acquisition strategy to buy more data from new satellite constellations that provide multi-modal sensors and ever-faster revisit rates. The U.S. Army’s autonomy program is on track to begin producing the Remote Combat Vehicle in 2027 while the USAF is developing a manned-unmanned teaming concept known as Combat Collaborative Autonomy to complement fighter jets. AI, cyber, autonomy and space technology, which my firm—Shield Capital—invests in, are increasingly applied to national security uses and this means more opportunity for a wider set of commercial vendors. In addition to the technology adoption, the Department has produced several studies on the defense industrial base including the first Industrial Strategy Implementation Plan and Supply Chain Risk Management, both of which identify the increased concentration of suppliers as a national security risk. There is a growing consensus that the supply base must broaden beyond the prime vendors which will create opportunities for more vendors. Given the importance of incorporating new technologies, growing the supply base and scaling new capabilities more quickly, there is tremendous upside for venture-backed companies which today supply only 1% of defense procurement. Some question whether the Department of Government Efficiency will dampen these trends. I believe this is highly doubtful since procurement was only 21% of the fiscal 2024 defense budget. There are richer opportunities for efficiency and reductions in the personnel budget (26% of the budget) and the maintenance of older ships, tanks and planes (35% of the budget). For example, staff positions in the Army have grown 40% since 9/11. Criticism of military procurement is likely to focus on the trillion-dollar programs such as the F-35 or Ford-class carriers. To modernize military capabilities as the U.S. did during the Reagan years means procuring newer technologies and weapons systems to replace aging fleets. CAPE CANAVERAL, FLORIDA - MAY 06: A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lifts off from Launch Complex 40 at Cape ... [+] Canaveral Space Force Station on May 06, 2024 in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The rocket is carrying 23 Starlink satellites into low Earth orbit. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images) As a result, I believe DOGE will accelerate the trends fueling defense tech. Elon Musk will be a proponent of fixed-price contracts rather than the cost-plus approach of defense primes. A great example of a fixed-price contract is SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket development which was only 10% of NASA’s projected development cost. Additionally, many of the designees for key positions in national security in the new Administration are from business or venture capital backgrounds, similar to DOGE leadership, and are likely to bring a reform mindset of doing things differently and incorporating more private sector incentives like fixed-price contracts. Rising geopolitical tensions, increasing use of commercial technologies in military applications, the growing need to diversify the defense supply base and the priorities of the incoming Trump Administration combine to create a better outlook than ever before for defense tech. These underlying trends will certainly benefit the defense unicorns such as SpaceX, Anduril and Palantir but they will also lead the way for an ever-growing set of new suppliers like Apex, Danti and Code Metal—three Shield Capital investments. Code Metal’s customer, Tigris Systems, benefits by the rapid deployment of AI algorithms to ... [+] intelligent edge sensor networks to ensure more reliable and predictable global transportation of goods. In the Cold War, Silicon Valley technologies helped make us more secure as a nation; history is repeating itself but with a whole new set of technologies and vendors which will equip our warfighters with the best the nation has to offer. Modernizing our force and expanding our warfighter capabilities from a greater number of suppliers will elevate defense tech to new heights. One Community. Many Voices.
