Title: ‘Fellas who were taking the piss are now looking for tips’: at home in the garden with Ireland and Munster rugby star Peter O’Mahony

Time Published: 2024-09-29T04:00:00Z

When Peter O’Mahony isn’t sinking his studs into the world’s greatest rugby pitches, he’s tending to the pristine grass on his own lawn. His love of gardening was brought to international attention during the World Cup when his mother, Caroline, held up a sign declaring she was watering his lawn while he was gone. So the question on everyone’s lips is: was it true? Did she water his lawn? “She did not,” he laughs. “She absolutely did nothing in my garden. I don’t know how she ended up with that sign, to be honest with you. I must get her doing some watering now after that.” The Munster and Ireland flanker’s interest in gardening is not a recent fad. As a child, he loved to help the gardener when he visited his grandmother Maura Conroy in Cork’s Richmond Hill. “They were my earliest memories of spending time in the garden,” he recalls. “Simple stuff, but I remember it being very enjoyable.” His grandmother died last year, but he has something to remember her by in his garden – a Japanese maple tree. “I moved it from her garden a few years ago. It has taken a while to settle in, but this is the first year it has really bloomed nicely.” The garden was one of the features that drew him and his wife Jessica to their home in Blackrock, Co Cork, 10 years ago. “We used to walk by the house a lot and say if it ever came up for sale we’d love to buy it, and all of a sudden it did.” Since then, they have been gradually redeveloping the house and garden. “It was a beautiful old cottage garden, a bit wilder than now, but lots of lovely stuff,” he recalls. When they moved in, he started with the lawn, naturally. “Some people find cutting grass a chore. I don’t. I enjoy it,” he says. As a child he mowed lawns for neighbours, including former Ireland and Munster rugby player Frankie Sheahan. “He used to give me a few bits of gear instead of money. I was delighted with the gear and chatting with Frankie at the time was great fun.” Taking on a mature garden of this size – about 200sq m (2,150sq ft) – was a daunting task, and on reflection he feels he rushed into the work. He would advise anyone in a similar situation to wait a season or two and watch how the garden grows. “But I’m quite impatient to be honest, so that was never going to happen.” Many people are now asking him for advice since he began posting about the garden on Instagram (@peteomahony), where he has amassed more than 300,000 followers. A video of him trimming the sides of the lawn on TikTok (@peteromahony6) has been viewed 5.3 million times. His Annabelle hydrangeas with their giant mophead flowers have garnered much envy. “They have taken over, to be honest with you,” he says. “I didn’t realise how big they were going to get, but it looks well in summer, that kind of block planting.” Weeded, edged, trimmed & seeded some patches. #lawncare But not everything succeeded. “I love wisteria, but I struggle with it. I tried it a couple of times in pots, but I think that’s a bad idea because it’s a hungry, vigorous plant that needs to be in the ground, so that failed a couple times,” he says. “I’ve let a couple things die, watering wise, unfortunately, being away.” Some of his plans for the garden have been held back by his heavy training schedule and travel demands. “I’d love to grow more food, but I don’t have the time at the moment,” he says. “You need to be on top of stuff all the time, but I need to be able to drop things and go for a week or two at a time. And during the summer things get crazy when you are growing food. I’ll definitely get stuck into it more when I finish playing.” But he still finds time to grow potatoes, beetroot and salad leaves. “We have some raspberries and other berries that come back every year. They need to be cut in spring and [we] try to get them picked before the birds get them. And we have a line of apple and pear trees, male and female, that pollinate themselves. Trees are foolproof once you give them the bit of pruning that they need.” He says the garden is starting to mature nicely now. “I was lucky to be able to put some mature shrubbery and plants in there that gave it some structure quite quickly.” It made a perfect backdrop when he and Jessica decided to get married in the garden during the Covid pandemic. “It was lovely. We had our immediate family in the garden and getting it ready gave me something to focus on.” While he’s happy to share his knowledge with other gardeners, he is also keen to learn from the experts. “I’ve always watched Gardeners’ World and I enjoy that. I like Adam Frost and Monty Don obviously is very enjoyable to watch,” he says. “I used to spend a lot of time in west Cork with my uncle who worked as a greenkeeper and grew a lot of his own stuff. He definitely taught me a lot.” And judging by the videos he posts on Instagram, his three children are now learning from him. Their youngest child, Ralph, seems to have inherited his father’s love of lawncare and is often seen pushing a toy lawn mower. “We have lots of songbirds and the kids have their books on recognising the different types of birds. Theo is definitely into the wildlife side of things. He’s very interested in bugs and bees and birds and fishing,” he says. “Indie then is very much into the neat and tidy stuff, keeping things where they should be. And Ralph just runs around trying to break everything up. If they want to get stuck into it, they’re more than capable of digging holes and damaging things.” Speaking of digging holes, his Ireland team-mate Bundee Aki had been threatening to damage his prized lawn for a long time. So when O’Mahony hosted a party after the Six Nations victory and Bundee grabbed a spade, he had good reason to worry. “Bundee put a few divot holes in it,” he says. “I do two or three days on the lawn every spring and autumn to level it and reseed it, so I knew that was coming up and I wasn’t too bothered. But I told him if he went near the flowers or the shrubs there would have been serious trouble.” When he first started posting about his garden on social media, a few team-mates seized the opportunity for some slagging. “But now a lot of the fellas who were taking the piss a bit are all of a sudden looking for tips on what to put where or should I put this in that pot, that sort of thing. There’s a lot of advice being requested.” With all eyes on his retirement plans now that he’s in his last season with Munster, will gardening play a role in that post-rugby future? “I certainly have plans,” he says. “I don’t know about a career, but I certainly have an interest in working on that side of things.” “I’ve always been lucky that I’ve done something that I have a huge passion for, and I have been paid well to do it so I don’t want to get stuck into something that I’m not very passionate about. I’m lucky that I am passionate about this. I’ll definitely do something in that space, but you’ll have to wait and see.” Watch out, Monty Don. There’s a new gardener in town. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Hollywood's big boom has gone bust

Michael Fortin was at the heart of Hollywood’s golden age of streaming. The actor and aerial cinematographer turned his hobby of flying drones into a profitable business in 2012 just as the streaming wars were taking off. For a decade, he was flying high above film sets, creating sleek aerial shots for movies and TV shows on Netflix, Amazon and Disney. Now he’s on the verge of becoming homeless - again. He was evicted from the Huntington Beach home he shared with his wife and two young children and now is being booted from the Las Vegas apartment they moved to because they could no longer afford to live in Southern California. “We were saving to buy a house, we had money, we had done things the right way,” he says. “Two years ago, I didn't worry about going out to dinner with my wife and kids and spending 200 bucks." “Now I worry about going out and spending $5 on a value meal at McDonald's.” For over a decade, business was booming in Hollywood, with studios battling to catch up to new companies like Netflix and Hulu. But the good times ground to a halt in May 2023, when Hollywood’s writers went on strike. The strikes lasted multiple months and marked the first time since the 1960s that both writers and actors joined forces - effectively shutting down Hollywood production. But rather than roaring back, in the one year since the strikes ended, production has fizzled. Projects have been cancelled and production was cut across the city as jobs have dried up, with layoffs at many studios - most recently at Paramount. It had a second round of layoffs this week, as the storied movie company moves to cut 15% of its workforce ahead of a merger with the production company Skydance. Unemployment in film and TV in the United States was at 12.5% in August, but many think those numbers are actually much higher, because many film workers either do not file for unemployment benefits because they’re not eligible or they’ve exhausted those benefits after months of not working. As a whole, the number of US productions during the second quarter of 2024 was down about 40% compared to the same period in 2022. Globally, there was a 20% decline over that period, according to ProdPro, which tracks TV and film productions. That means less new movies and binge-worthy shows for us. But experts say the streaming boom wasn’t sustainable. And studios are trying to figure out how to be profitable in a new world when people don’t pay for cable TV funded by commercials. “The air has come out of the content bubble,” says Matthew Belloni, the founder of Puck News, which covers the entertainment industry. “Crisis is a good word. I try not to be alarmist, but crisis is what people are feeling.” Part of the boom was fuelled by Wall Street, where tech giants like Netflix saw record growth and studios, like Paramount, saw their share prices soar for adding their own streaming service offers. “It caused an overheating of the content market. There were 600 scripted live action series airing just a few years ago and then the stock market stopped rewarding that,” Mr Belloni says. “Netflix crashed – all the other companies crashed. Netflix has since recovered – but the others are really struggling to get to profitability.” And along with the streaming bubble bursting, some productions are also being lured away from California by attractive tax incentives in other states and countries. Los Angeles leaders are so concerned about the slowdown that Mayor Karen Bass created a task force last month to consider new incentives for film production in Hollywood. “The entertainment industry is critical to the economic vitality of the Los Angeles region,” Bass said announcing the plan, explaining it is a “cornerstone” of the city’s economy and supplies hundreds of thousands of jobs. Recent data shows the entertainment industry contributes over $115bn (£86bn) annually to the region's economy, with an employment base of over 681,000 people, the mayor said. The writers' and actors' strikes lasted for months and resulted in union contracts that offer more money and protections against artificial intelligence. Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the chief negotiator with the Screen Actors Guild union, told the BBC that some consolidation in Hollywood was inevitable. He says he is optimistic that production will be ramping up soon. “What makes these companies special, what gives them their unique ability to create value is their relationship with creative talent,” he said while visiting a picket line outside a Disney office in September, where video game voice actors are currently on strike fighting for similar protections. Hollywood “always thinks it’s in crisis,” he says. “It is a town that constantly faces technological innovation - all kinds of change - which is part of the magic. Part of keeping content fresh is everyone having the idea that things don't always have to be the way they've been.” Mr Fortin’s drone company was operating nearly every day before the strikes. Now he’s flown the drones just 22 days in the year since the strikes ended. And as an actor - he often plays tough guys - he has worked just 10 days. He used to work as a background actor to get by, but the pay barely covers the gas money to get to Los Angeles from Las Vegas. “It was a great wave, and it crashed,” Mr Fortin said after a day flying his drones on the AppleTV+ show Platonic - his first gig with drones since April. “Things are coming in little by little,” he says in his van before driving back to Las Vegas for a court hearing to fight his eviction order. “Hollywood gave me everything,” he says. “But it feels like the industry has turned its back on lots of people, not just me.” The celebrated singer-songwriter was also famous for acting roles in A Star is Born and Blade. At least 105 people have died nationwide, as officials airdrop supplies to devastated areas of the US south-east. The proposed legislation would have imposed some of the first US regulations on artificial intelligence. The fire at a BioLab facility in Conyers has forced road closures and evacuation orders.

Title: Super Micro: Assessing the Potential Risk and Reward

Time Published: 2024-09-28T20:43:18Z

Super Micro Computer (SMCI) got off to an incredible start this year as shares more than quadrupled from January to mid-March. This surge made Super Micro eligible for S&P 500 inclusion, with the technology hardware stock (with links to AI) being added to the index on March 18, 2024. In hindsight, that would have been a great time to take profits or Short the stock, as shares are down by more than 50% since then. One of the major developments has been the report by Hindenburg Research, which contained worrying allegations about the company’s financial reporting. In assessing those allegations along with Super Micro’s fundamentals I hold a neutral rating on the stock. The Hindenburg report is actually the main reason I am neutral instead of bullish on SMCI stock, and I believe it has caused hesitancy among many AI stock analysts and investors. The accusations are pretty straightforward. According to Hindenburg, Super Micro engaged in accounting manipulation which included “sibling self-dealing and evading sanctions”. Anyone who thinks this sounds far fetched may wish to remember that the SEC charged Super Micro with widespread accounting violations in August 2020. Hindenburg’s report also argued that most of the people involved with that accounting malpractice are back on Super Micro’s team. Hindenburg’s team interviewed several Super Micro salespeople and employees when compiling their report. It doesn’t help that Super Micro delayed its 10-K filing to assess internal controls shortly after Hindenburg went public with its concerns. While this might simply be a coincidence, the timing is worrisome. Looking back several years, Super Micro had failed to file financial statements in 2018 and was briefly delisted from the Nasdaq as a result. Near the beginning of this month, Super Micro publicly issued a denial of the accusations, with CEO Charles Liang hitting back, stating that Hindenburg’s report contained, “misleading presentations of information”. Super Micro hasn’t provided any additional statements since then. Super Micro’s status as part of the fast moving world of AI is one of the few reasons that I am neutral instead of bearish SMCI stock. The exciting prospects for the company’s business and the serious nature of the Hindenburg allegations basically offset each other. It’s hard to know what’s real and what’s false here, but most people concede that the AI industry as a whole offers compelling growth prospects. Nvidia (NVDA) has been posting triple-digit year-over-year revenue growth for several quarters. Other tech giants have incorporated artificial intelligence into their core businesses and delivered impressive results for their shareholders. For instance, Alphabet (GOOGL) saw its cloud revenue rise by 28.8% year-over-year as many businesses rushed to create their own AI tools. The artificial intelligence industry is also projected to maintain a 19.3% compounded annual growth rate from now until 2034, according to Precedence Research. The AI industry should continue to grow, and that should lift Super Micro. The company should benefit from Nvidia’s growth, which is why the company posted exceptional revenue and net income growth during Nvidia’s ascent. That’s what we saw for several quarters. We just don’t know how accurate all the numbers were, if the allegations targeting the firm have merit. While it’s impossible to overlook Hindenburg’s allegations against Super Micro, it’s still worthwhile assessing the company’s previous quarterly results. Shares were dropping even before Hindenburg released its report. While in March 2024 I argued that SMCI stock faced risks, I felt that shares presented a tremendous buying opportunity in late-summer, until Hindenburg muddied that optimism. For its last reported quarter, Super Micro posted net sales of $5.31 billion, representing a 143% year-over-year jump. Meanwhile, net income rose by 82% year-over-year, reaching $353 million. At the time of the release, my primary concern was Super Micro’s declining net profit margin. Super Micro currently trades at a 20x trailing P/E ratio, seemingly enough to compensate for any further erosion in profit margins. SMCI stock has a ridiculously low 13.6x forward P/E ratio, but with the recent speedbumps (the Hindenburg report and DOJ investigation) investors seems reluctant to bid the valuation multiple any higher right now. We don’t yet have tangible proof that Super Micro has engaged in any wrongdoing, as alleged by Hindenburg. Their report, however, has certainly cast a black eye on the stock. I expect that Super Micro would have significantly outperformed its fiscal 2023 results even excluding any misdealings. The Super Micro controversy added a new chapter on September 26, as news crossed the wires that the U.S. Department of Justice is now probing the company. SMCI stock tumbled an additional 12% on this news, and shares were recently trading at less than one-third of their all time high in March. There’s a high risk/reward on the shares at this point, but the elevated risks have relegated me to the sidelines with a neutral rating. Super Micro shares bounced back by more than 4% on Friday, September 27, suggesting that many investors believe that the long-term potential for the business is worth the heightened uncertainty. Although the ratings for this stock could change quickly, Super Micro currently has 2 Buy ratings, 10 Hold ratings, and 1 Sell rating from the 13 analysts that cover the stock. The average price target for SMCI is $613.92, which implies potential upside of nearly 50%. Again though, it’s quite possible that several research brokerages have placed their SMCI ratings under review. SMCI stock does have a few low price targets including $454, $375 and $325 from CFRA, Wells Fargo (WFC), and Susquehanna respectively. All of these price targets were established before the DOJ probe was announced, so even they could drop lower. There’s an old adage that suggests, “You either die a hero or live long enough to be the villain”. That quote seems apropos for this company. Super Micro earned many investors hefty profits during its rise above a stock price of $1,000 per share. Those who entered the story late, including after SMCI stock was added to the S&P 500, have not fared well. Many investors are sitting on significant losses right now. Depending on what those investors do, it’s hard to tell how much more downside Super Micro shares may have until more clarity on the ordeals is available. If the company’s recent financials are accurate, SMCI shares look quite attractive here. Shares can surge quickly if the Hindenburg report loses relevance, although that outcome difficult to predict. I’m a big fan of Super Micro’s industry and business potential related to AI, which prevents me from being downright bearish. I have a neutral stance here. Meanwhile, I don’t expect shares of SMCI to rebound above $460 (the approximate price prior to news of the DOJ probe) without any resolution to the two main threats to shareholder value.

September 28, 2024 15:40 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike faced intense scrutiny on Capitol Hill on September 24 as lawmakers demanded answers for a catastrophic software update that crippled essential services across the nation. Hagens Berman urges CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD) investors who suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: Nov. 29, 2023 – July 29, 2024Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Sept. 30, 2024Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/CRWD Contact the Firm Now: CRWD@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mark Green (R-Tenn.) castigated the company's CEO, George Kurtz, for evading direct testimony and dispatching a subordinate to address the crisis. “This was a systemic failure with far-reaching consequences,” Green declared, “and we cannot let it happen again.” Adam Meyers, CrowdStrike’s senior vice president, offered a mea culpa for the incident, attributing the widespread outage to a faulty configuration update that caused a "Blue Screen of Death" on millions of Windows devices. However, his apology fell short of assuaging lawmakers' concerns. Congress’ interrogation of CrowdStrike comes on the heels of a September 12 report by SEMAFOR, wherein former CrowdStrike employees painted a picture of a company culture that prioritized speed over quality. Multiple sources described a workplace where mistakes were commonplace, and workers were often undertrained. One former manager even recalled warnings about the potential for catastrophic failures if the company continued to release untested products Securities Class Action Against CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (CRWD): The outage has also sparked litigation against CrowdStrike, with plaintiffs alleging that the company misled investors about the reliability of its flagship Falcon Sensor product. The complaint accuses CrowdStrike of failing to disclose significant risks associated with its update process and of downplaying the potential consequences of a major outage. The truth began to emerge on July 19, 2024, when CrowdStrike issued an automatic update for its flagship Falcon Sensor security product which contained a bug and caused a massive overnight outage that affected 8.5 million Windows computers around the world, disrupting businesses, airports, train stations, banks, broadcasters, and the healthcare sector. Many affected machines were unable to restart, instead showing a blue error screen sometimes called “the blue screen of death.” Then, on July 29, 2024, news outlets reported that one of CrowdStrike’s customers (Delta Airlines) which suffered more than 6,000 flight cancellations hired a prominent attorney to seek damages caused by the faulty update. These events have driven the price of CrowdStrike shares down nearly 16% since the outage.

Title: Bitcoin – THIS key signal suggests BTC’s next ATH will be in November

Bitcoin may be ready to climb to new levels over the next few months. Bitcoin (BTC) is once again at the forefront of the crypto market, driving momentum towards a much-anticipated bull market. At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $66k, sparking excitement for potential new all-time highs (ATHs) in the final quarter of the year. Here, it’s worth looking at historical data though. Particularly the 2-week Ichimoku Cloud indicator since it has accurately predicted Bitcoin’s ATHs in past cycles. With the current cycle progressing ahead of schedule, there’s probably no need to wait for the moving averages to cross. The leading spans show us when it will happen, indicating that a new high may be formed in November. Source: CryptoCon/X Many are now wondering if November will be the month Bitcoin hits new heights. Especially with institutions and traders keeping a close eye on this timeline. One key factor supporting this possibility is the repetition of the 2019 pattern. The Gaussian Channel on the 3-day BTC chart has turned red, which has historically occurred only twice – During the Covid crash and during Phase 2 of Bitcoin’s previous bull run. When this pattern last emerged during Covid 19, it led to a significant rally, pushing Bitcoin to new ATHs. If history repeats itself, Bitcoin could be poised for another major upwards move, and potentially new highs in November. Source: X However, market dynamics will ultimately determine the outcome, and it remains to be seen if this pattern will indeed lead to higher prices. Another factor that could propel Bitcoin higher is the impact of heavily borrowed USDT. Traders have been borrowing large amounts of USDT to buy Bitcoin. However, instead of pushing the price up, it initially led to a decline, causing over-leveraged traders to face losses. This type of market behavior often precedes a significant rally. Especially as retail traders are shaken out through liquidations. If the current trend continues, this will create a perfect setup for Bitcoin to surge to new highs, potentially in November. Source: Hyblock Capital Moreover, BlackRock’s continued accumulation of Bitcoin lends further confidence to the bullish outlook. Earlier this week, BlackRock (IBIT) purchased 4,460 BTC, worth $289 million, increasing its total holdings to over 362,000 BTC. This was followed by another purchase of 1,434 BTC worth $94.3 million. Recently, they added another 5,894 BTC, bringing their total holdings to 363,626 BTC, valued at $23.68 billion. BlackRock’s significant and ongoing investment in Bitcoin means that they foresee substantial price appreciation, possibly as soon as November. Source: Lookonchain/X With historical patterns, market dynamics, and institutional support all aligning, Bitcoin’s price could hit new highs in the near future. The potential for a bullish run remains strong, and traders and investors will be closely monitoring developments as November approaches. If these factors come together, Bitcoin may not only hit new ATHs but also establish itself firmly in higher price ranges for the rest of the year.

After less than a year of trading on Wall Street, U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are well on pace to surpass the estimated BTC stack of Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious inventor of the flagship cryptocurrency. Should this accumulation trend continue, the Bitcoin ETFs may collectively hold more Bitcoin than Satoshi by as early as this Christmas. In a recent post on X, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas observed that the nearly a dozen spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds now trading on American stock exchanges have amassed an astounding $17.8 billion in inflows in 2024 — representing a record-breaking year-to-date accumulation of 916,047 BTC. That is just about 84,000 BTC away from the coveted 1,000,000 BTC milestone. The ETFs are closing in on Nakamoto’s estimated 1.1 million BTC stash, which the world’s most elusive man mined in the infancy of Bitcoin and hasn’t touched after disappearing more than 13 years ago. And the spot Bitcoin ETFs now aren’t far behind. The January launch of the Bitcoin ETFs was one of the most successful ETF launches in history. Billions of dollars have hit the funds as investors previously scared off from crypto investing finally got a safe and regulated way to buy Bitcoin. The top three ETFs from BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale have accumulated 359,271 BTC, 287,153 BTC, and 254,677 BTC, respectively. In total, all the BTC ETFs need to load up on roughly 183,953 BTC to surpass Satoshi’s believed tally. If these funds continue increasing their Bitcoin reserves at the same rate, they could overtake Satoshi’s stockpile and kick him off the top. US bitcoin ETFs had good day yesterday pushing YTD flows to new high water mark of $17.8b. They’re now 92% of the way to owning 1million bitcoin and 83% of way to passing Satoshi as top holder. Tick tock.. pic.twitter.com/kTxlIzjJy6 Tolou Capital Management founder Spencer Hakimian shared Balchunas’s sentiment, predicting that “ETFs are going to be bigger than Satoshi by Christmas”, to which the Bloomberg pundit agreed, adding that BlackRock’s ETF alone will at some point top the list of Bitcoin holders. Meanwhile, a top crypto market analyst has recently posited that the fast-rising concentration of Bitcoin by spot ETFs is the main reason the United States is “regaining dominance in Bitcoin holdings,” compared to the rest of the world.

Title: How to Create AI Images: A Complete Guide With Expert Advice
URL: https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/how-to-create-ai-images-a-complete-guide-with-expert-advice/
Time Published: 2024-09-28T16:30:00Z

Here's what to know about creating AI-generated imagery, including the best programs, practical tips and legal considerations. AI image generators open up a world of creative possibilities. A picture is worth a thousand words. But with generative AI, you'll need to start with words to get that image. Generative artificial intelligence tech has exploded in the past few years, leading to a lot of creative services that can generate entire images and video clips. That's the "generative" aspect of gen AI -- it can produce content seemingly from just a simple text prompt. Of course, the actual process is more complicated. AI image generators rely on a database of existing content (text, images, videos, etc.), and/or scrape the open web for information to create new images to fulfill your request. They allow anyone with an account and a prompt to create almost any kind of image (usually within reason). There are a lot of AI image services available, but not all will deliver quality results or adequately protect your data. They also vary in price and features offered. While AI generators can be exciting to explore, getting started can quickly feel overwhelming. That's where this guide comes in handy. I've tested and reviewed multiple AI image generators for CNET and covered how the new tech affects digital creators. These services are certainly interesting and serve their purposes, but there’s a learning curve to them. While they're not good enough to replace human creators, they offer a range of creative possibilities. Here's how you can create custom AI images. I've had hands-on experience with many AI image generators and creative programs. The best program for you is going to depend on your project, budget and experience level. You can check out our full reviews and rankings, but these are my three program recommendations. CNET's Editor's Choice is Dall-E 3 by OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT. Dall-E boasts impressive prompt adherence, handling more complex prompts with ease. Its conversational flow -- meaning you can follow up easily by typing in the chat window -- allows for easy post-generation editing. Dall-E is also one of the more creative programs we've tested. You'll need a ChatGPT Plus account to access the program -- $20 per month -- and note that OpenAI may use your content for model training. But you can submit a request for it to stop training on your data. If you're looking for a free program, I recommend Leonardo AI. Canva recently acquired it, but you can still use it on its website. Leonardo offers a robust free plan, with more editing tools behind its paywall, and several artistic styles to choose from. It also provides a unique prompt improvement tool, which can take a simple idea and rewrite it, filling in details that make for beautiful end results. If you're really balling on a budget and have no creative experience, check out Canva's Magic Media generator. It's extremely intuitive and easy to navigate, which is great for beginners and non-creatives. Canva offers you 50 free credits for image generation (those are lifetime credits -- you'll have to upgrade for more credits on the paid Pro plan after using up your free tier allowance) and automatically opts you out of training its AI on your content. Once you've picked your program, create an account and make your way to the prompt window. Your best chance of success starts with a well-written prompt. Every prompt should include the basics of the characters, the setting, other elements and the image's dimensions. But to really hone in on the image you want, add descriptions of the artistic style you're looking to mimic, the aesthetic, vibe and specific colors. Leonardo might not understand a prompt that asks for "cottage core coastal grandma," but it does understand "rustic feel with blues and warm light." AI image generators rightfully have limitations around what you can generate. This is to prevent people from abusing these services to create illegal content and potentially dangerous or offensive content. For example, Dall-E 3 will decline to generate images that request public figures by name, like President Biden or Taylor Swift. Be sure to check out your service's safety policies before generating. Prompt engineering -- the process of writing the right prompt to get your desired results -- is something you get better at with practice. It also varies between each image generator. Canva, for example, tends to do better with simple prompts, whereas Dall-E encourages longer, more detailed prompts. Playing around with your program is the best way to get to know it. You can also check out my complete guide to image prompt engineering for more tips and tricks. Once you've got your best prompt, go ahead and generate! Even with the best generator, you're likely need to edit your images after they're created. Depending on the service you use, you may have access to editing tools or the ability to request changes. Be wary of over-editing your images. I've found that services can only handle so many changes before the image becomes too wonky, and ultimately unusable. Take this image I made in Midjourney as a cautionary tale of what happens when you over-edit. Sometimes it's best to start anew. Post-generation editing tools are one area where AI services tend to shine or fall flat. If your service doesn't offer them (or they don't work very well), try editing your prompt rather than the picture. In my experience, that's going to give you better odds of success rather than trying to incrementally edit existing images. It's extremely important to label your images as AI-created content. As AI image services improve, it's essential that all creators clearly identify the origins of an image, especially to distinguish it from human-created art and photography. In the bottom left corner, Meta AI watermarks all its AI-generated images. Some services automatically add a watermark or other marking indicating it's AI-generated, but too many don't, like Dall-E, Adobe Firefly, Midjourney, Canva and Leonardo. If you're sharing your image online, make sure to include the AI service you used in the caption, credit and/or alt text. You can also add a disclaimer to your posts if you're sharing on social media -- Meta might flag them as containing AI content on Instagram and Facebook, but adding a line to your caption will help ensure there isn't any confusion. As of publication, the use of AI image generators is legal. But there are important legal and ethical considerations you should be aware of when creating AI images. Here are a couple of quick frequently asked questions. AI image services like Midjourney and Dall-E rely on existing content to help them create pictures. This content, either in a database or on the open web, is typically created by humans. As such, some creators and artists have major concerns about how these programs are designed and trained. That's led to uproar in the industry and a couple of notable lawsuits, including an ongoing case against Stable Diffusion, an AI model used by popular generators. If you're worried about using a service that might potentially mistreat creators, pick one that clearly discloses how it trains its model. Some AI services rely on public databases, like Adobe Stock and Getty Images, where creators sign agreements with the companies to enter their work into those collections for specific uses. Adobe Firefly, for example, says it only uses content from its Adobe Stock public databases and images whose copyrights have expired. It also won't train on your content. As these AI services evolve, the legalities and ethics around them are poised to change as well. If you're going to be a regular AI art creator, make sure you stay up to date with the latest requirements, which we'll cover in our AI Atlas guide.

Ireland women’s head coach Scott Bemand has made two changes from the side that comfortably beat Australia 36-10 in Belfast recently for their opening WXV1 clash with New Zealand at BC Place in Vancouver on Sunday (7pm local time, 3am Monday Irish time) Stacey Flood comes in to start at fullback, with Eimear Considine switching to the right wing and Amee-Leigh Murphy Crowe retaining her place on the left wing. The other change comes in the pack with Fiona Tuite coming in for Ruth Campbell to join Dorothy Wall in the secondrow. Uncapped prop Andrea Stock has been named among the replacements. Edel McMahon will captain the side from the backrow as Bemand retains continuity from the six-try victory over Australia. “We’ve had a really good training week here in Vancouver, including a valuable hit out against France on Wednesday,” said Bemand on the eve of their opening game. “We’re facing into three matches against the top teams in the world, and New Zealand first up on Sunday present physical and ball movements threats, so the training we’ve done and the intensity of the session against France has let us tune into that. “In terms of selection, we’ve had some good competition for places in recent weeks which has led to some difficult conversations. We’re pleased with how the group are performing, and we feel we’ve got the right blend in our matchday Squad for the opening game of the campaign.” IRELAND (v New Zealand): Stacey Flood (Railway Union); Eimear Considine (UL Bohemian/Munster), Aoife Dalton (Old Belvedere/Leinster), Enya Breen (Blackrock College /Munster), Amee-Leigh Murphy Crowe (Railway Union/Munster); Dannah O’Brien (Old Belvedere/Leinster), Molly Scuffil-McCabe (Leinster); Niamh O’Dowd (Old Belvedere/Leinster), Neve Jones (Gloucester-Hartpury), Linda Djougang (Old Belvedere/Leinster); Dorothy Wall (Exeter Chiefs/Munster), Fiona Tuite (Old Belvedere/Ulster); Aoife Wafer (Blackrock College/Leinster), Edel McMahon (Exeter Chiefs/Connacht) (capt), Brittany Hogan (Old Belvedere/Ulster).

On Friday, BMO Capital adjusted its outlook on Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), raising the stock's price target from $950.00 to $980.00. The firm has maintained an Outperform rating for the retailer. The revision follows Costco's reported earnings for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2024, which showed strong performance indicators, including better-than-expected gross margin percentages and comparable sales. The company's recent earnings report highlighted a robust increase in global customer traffic, up by 6%, with a significant 11-12% rise on a two-year stack basis. The strong performance metrics have led to an above-average growth in earnings per share (EPS) for the fiscal year 2024. Despite this growth, BMO Capital projects a more conservative EPS growth rate in the coming years, taking into account Costco's pattern of reinvesting market funds incrementally (MFI) increases. Costco's momentum in E-commerce was also a notable point in the analysis by BMO Capital. The retailer's continued expansion in the digital space is seen as a positive driver of its business model. While acknowledging that the company's valuation has reached new heights, the firm still finds Costco's stock attractive, citing the slightly higher EPS revisions as a basis for the increased price target. The analyst from BMO Capital highlighted the company's solid underlying financials in the fourth fiscal quarter, which surpassed the firm's forecasts. The statement underscored the strength in gross margins and comparable sales, which contributed to the positive outlook. "We continue to be encouraged by COST's momentum in Ecommerce growth and while valuation has expanded to new highs, COST remains attractive in our view," said the analyst from BMO Capital. With the new price target set at $980, BMO Capital's stance reflects confidence in Costco's ongoing growth trajectory and its ability to maintain a strong position in the market. The firm's analysis suggests a belief in the retailer's strategic investments and its potential for sustained financial success. In other recent news, Costco Wholesale reported mixed results in its fourth-quarter earnings, with earnings per share (EPS) of $5.29 surpassing both Goldman Sachs and consensus estimates, but falling slightly short on its revenue target of $79.70 billion. Despite the slight miss, same-store sales witnessed a 6.9% increase, exceeding the anticipated 6.4%. In response to potential disruptions due to a possible strike at U.S. ports, Costco's CEO, Ron Vachris, outlined extensive contingency plans. The company's recent performance has led to varied reactions from analyst firms. Baird maintains an Outperform rating on Costco with a price target of $975, highlighting the company's strong comparable sales momentum and healthy membership key performance indicators. However, Roth/MKM, DA Davidson, and Citi have maintained a Neutral stance, while Truist Securities, Redburn-Atlantic have expressed valuation concerns, downgrading or maintaining neutral stances on the company's shares. Goldman Sachs remains optimistic, maintaining a Buy rating and raising the price target to $995. These are recent developments for Costco Wholesale. As BMO Capital raises its price target for Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), it's important to note some key financial metrics and insights that underscore the retailer's market position and valuation. According to InvestingPro data, Costco boasts a significant market capitalization of $399.64 billion, reflecting its substantial presence in the industry. The company's P/E ratio stands at a high 55.9, which, while indicative of investor confidence, also points to a premium valuation relative to near-term earnings growth. This is further emphasized by a PEG ratio of 2.86, suggesting that the market may be pricing in optimistic growth expectations. Costco's revenue growth remains healthy, with a 7.75% increase over the last twelve months as of Q3 2024, and a gross profit margin of 12.5%, which, although solid, may be considered modest in comparison to some industry peers. It's also noteworthy that Costco has maintained dividend payments for 21 consecutive years, with a recent dividend yield of 0.51% and a 13.73% dividend growth in the same period. This consistent return to shareholders reflects the company's financial health and disciplined capital management. InvestingPro Tips highlight that while Costco is trading at high earnings and EBITDA valuation multiples, it holds more cash than debt, indicating a strong balance sheet. Additionally, the company's cash flows can sufficiently cover interest payments, providing further evidence of its financial stability. For those seeking more in-depth analysis, InvestingPro offers additional tips, with a total of 15 tips available that delve into Costco's performance and market valuation. Costco's strategic positioning as a prominent player in the Consumer Staples Distribution & Retail industry, combined with its strong return over the last year, suggests that the company is well-equipped to navigate market challenges and capitalize on growth opportunities.

Title: Carlyle joins list of possible Thames Water rescue backers

Ofwat, the water industry regulator, will appoint an independent monitor to Thames Water as soon as next week as the utility inches closer to collapse, Sky News understands. City editor @MarkKleinmanSky Saturday 28 September 2024 16:09, UK Carlyle, the American investment giant, has become the latest global fund to weigh an investment in Thames Water as the stricken utility races to avoid being nationalised. Sky News has learnt that Carlyle, which has roughly $435bn in assets under management, is at the very preliminary stages of assessing whether an investment in Thames Water Utilities Limited (TWUL) would be viable. Britain's biggest water and wastewater company, which has about 16 million customers, is edging towards the brink of collapse after warning in recent days that its financial liquidity is set to expire months earlier than previously anticipated. It has also seen its credit rating downgraded further into junk territory by two leading rating agencies. Carlyle is one of a long list of prospective investors approached by Rothschild, the investment bank advising Thames Water's board, as the utility scrambles to raise more than £3bn in the coming months. This weekend, people close to the process confirmed that Carlyle had been approached but said it was "too early" to judge whether the firm might participate in a rescue deal through one or more of its funds. Among the others sounded out by Rothschild are Brookfield, the Canadian investment giant, and Global Infrastructure Partners, which is now owned by BlackRock. Uncomfortable truth is that Thames Water's fate may be out of existing management's hands Thames Water lines up court dates to push through huge debt restructuring Thames Water seeks 52% hike to bills by 2030 as industry criticises watchdog's curbs Many investors and industry analysts believe, however, that the Rothschild-led process is destined to fail given the massive financial restructuring which faces Thames Water. The company has about £16bn in debt, with approximately £10bn of that accounted for by a group of 90 funds which have appointed Jefferies and Akin Gump to represent them. That syndicate is now preparing its own rescue plan in the coming weeks, which is likely to include an enormous debt-for-equity swap that would wipe out the existing shareholders. Thames Water's future remains so shrouded in uncertainty because the industry watchdog, Ofwat, has rejected the company's initial spending plans for the next five-year regulatory period. The company is now engaged in discussions with Ofwat ahead of its final determination in December. A bridging loan of about £1bn is being contemplated by some of Thames Water's creditors, but some stakeholders remain sceptical that any new financing will be forthcoming without greater regulatory certainty. "Until the lenders know what they are bridging to, the concern deepens that they risk throwing good money after bad," said one fund. TWUL's board is said to have met in the last 48 hours to discuss the implications of its latest rating downgrades and impending liquidity shortfall. One creditor said that Ofwat was expected to appoint an independent monitor next week to scrutinise the company's progress against its turnaround plan. Ofwat, which signalled in August that it would make such an appointment, declined to comment. If new investment into Thames Water is not forthcoming before it runs out of cash, the government will have little choice but to sanction the temporary nationalisation of the company. This would be done through a Special Administration Regime (SAR), a procedure tested only once before when Bulb Energy collapsed in 2021. As part of its contingency planning for implementing a far-reaching restructuring, Thames Water has booked court dates in November to progress a rescue deal. A source close to the company said that Thames Water "continues to look at all options for extending its liquidity and raising new equity". "Reserving court dates is sensible forward planning and a part of keeping all options open."

(Tennessee Office of the Attorney General) Audrey Streb Audrey Streb is a member of the Young Leaders Program at The Heritage Foundation. As Tennessee’s attorney general for only two years, Republican Jonathan Skrmetti is racking up wins for conservatives in policy and law against the Biden-Harris administration and private sector actors. One of those successes looms at the U.S. Supreme Court, where in the term that begins Oct. 1 the justices are expected to take up the federal government’s attempt to kill a Tennessee law restricting gender transitions for children. In the case, called United States v. Jonathan Skrmetti, the high court will hear arguments and then decide whether the Tennessee law violates the Constitution in attempting to protect minors subjected to dangerous, life-altering medical procedures. “Twenty-five different states have enacted similar, and in some cases, identical laws,” Sarah Parshall Perry, a senior legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation, told The Daily Signal. The Tennessee ban is “very logical, very reasonable, and very constitutional,” Perry said, noting that Skrmetti is “working overtime to defend children.” The state law bans puberty blockers, hormones, and gender-transition surgeries for minors. In court filings, Skrmetti and other Tennessee officials argued that gender-reassignment surgery on minors has “exploded” in recent years and that these procedures are “unproven and risky.” Skrmetti, now 47, was sworn in as attorney general on Sept. 1, 2022. Married and the father of four, the Franklin resident previously was chief deputy attorney general under his predecessor, Herbert H. Slatery III, for three years. Mr. President, no matter the intention, changes to the law must come from Congress — not from agency bureaucrats.Separation of powers is the fundamental principle of American government. https://t.co/pyYWfs10HM Skrmetti also was chief counsel to Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, a fellow Republican. “His reputation is really stellar,” Heritage’s Perry said of Skrmetti, calling him “an excellent attorney general who is highly revered.” Skrmetti received degrees from George Washington University, the University of Oxford, and Harvard Law School. Unlike in other states, Tennessee’s chief law enforcement officer is appointed by the state Supreme Court for an eight-year term, rather than elected by voters for a four-year term. (The office, whose official title is attorney general and reporter, is thus part of Tennessee’s judicial branch rather than its executive branch.) Aides and other admirers say that as attorney general, Skrmetti has spearheaded successful lawsuits against the federal government, especially leading the charge against gender ideology mandates and government overreach. Here’s a look at what they characterize as some of his biggest challenges and successes. Skrmetti’s duties as attorney general include protecting the state’s consumers, and supporters say he has risen to that task. Skrmetti filed a lawsuit against one of the world’s largest asset managers, BlackRock Inc., in a “first-of-its-kind” consumer protection case. Tennessee successfully sued BlackRock over misleading statements about its use of ESG standards (for environmental, social, and governance considerations) in investments. Ordinary shareholders argue that ESG standards elevate over “social justice” and other progressive causes over profitability and good business practices. Skrmetti has been at the forefront of battles with progressives over gender ideology, most notably foiling the Biden-Harris administration’s proposed Title IX changes. The administration’s adjustments would have mandated that biological boys be allowed to play girls sports at school and to use girls’ restrooms and locker rooms, among other things. Despite facing several challenges from the Biden-Harris Justice Department, Skrmetti successfully defended Tennessee’s ban on so-called gender-affirming care for children. This is the case pending at the U.S. Supreme Court. The attorney general also won a U.S. District Court case against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which sought to mandate that medical providers perform, and insurers cover, some sex-change procedures. Skrmetti also went to the District Court as well as the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit to successfully defend Tennessee’s policy forbidding a change in the biological sex listed on birth certificates. Skrmetti also has had success in responding to the Biden-Harris administration’s undoing of border security measures imposed by the Trump-Pence administration. He sued the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which oversees border-related agencies, over its refusal to share records regarding the “catch and release” of illegal aliens who were transported to Tennessee. The case is called Tennessee v. Mayorkas, after DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, an appointee of President Joe Biden. Early this year, Skrmetti successfully sued the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission over its revised regulations implementing the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. The agency’s revision would have forced employers to pay for their employees’ abortions, he argued. “I’m proud to lead the coalition fighting to protect the rule of law against this unconstitutional federal overreach,” Skrmetti said in a public statement. “Congress passed the bipartisan Pregnant Workers Fairness Act to protect mothers-to-be and promote healthy pregnancies, and the EEOC’s attempt to rewrite that law into an abortion mandate is illegal.” When it comes to government and private sector policies focused on or mandating so-called DEI—diversity, equity, and inclusion—Skrmetti has been proactive in expressing concerns. The Tennessee attorney general last year co-led a 13-state letter that warned Fortune 100 companies about DEI practices setting up racial preferences in hiring, promotions, and other decisions. “As the Supreme Court recently emphasized, both our Constitution and our civil rights laws guarantee every American the right to be free from racial discrimination,” Skrmetti said in a press release. “The court’s reasoning means that companies, no matter their motivation, cannot treat people differently based on the color of their skin,” he said. “Corporate America continues to have many avenues to help disadvantaged people and communities of all races without resorting to crude racial line-drawing.

Subscribe now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor and "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains" in the aftermath of bitcoin's halving earthquake! The bitcoin price has more than doubled over the last year, pushed higher by the world's largest asset manager BlackRock's embrace of bitcoin and crypto—with a surprise BlackRock spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) price shock just around the corner. Now, as fears are swirling the U.S. dollar is on "the verge of a total collapse," BlackRock's USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (Buidl) is being used to back a new stablecoin, described as a "key milestone" in the "$16 trillion by 2030" race to tokenize finance. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink has helped spark a crypto revolution on Wall Street with his ... [+] embrace of bitcoin—pushing the bitcoin price sharply higher. Crypto company Ethena, which earlier this year launched a so-called synthetic U.S. dollar stablecoin called USDe that's swelled to a $2.6 billion circulating supply, has announced a new stablecoin called UStb that will invest its reserves in BlackRock's Buidl via real-world asset tokenization platform Securitize. "UStb will be fully backed by Blackrock Buidl in partnership with Securitize, enabling a separate fiat stablecoin product alongside USDe," Ethena﻿'s official X account posted. "As the largest tokenized U.S. Treasuries fund with over $522 million in assets, Buidl provides UStb with a secure foundation," Securitize's account posted. "This collaboration represents a key milestone in the evolution of tokenized finance, bringing together leading innovations in stablecoins and real-world asset tokenization." In May, BlackRock led a $47 million strategic investment in its Buidl partner Securitize, widely seen as a long-term bet on crypto, with the fund allowing investors within crypto ecosystems to earn dividends on the Treasury fund while keeping assets on-chain. BlackRock, which manages over $10 trillion globally on behalf of clients, led the campaign last year to bring a fully-fledged spot bitcoin ETF to the U.S., winning approval for its IBIT and a fleet of other spot bitcoin ETFs in January. In July, BlackRock's chief executive Larry Fink said he had been "wrong" about bitcoin when he'd previously dismissed it as "an index of money laundering," admitting bitcoin is "digital gold” and a "legitimate" financial instrument. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has surged this year, helped by BlackRock's embrace of bitcoin and crypto. Fink revealed last year that he believes the tokenization of assets on blockchains will drive a "revolution" on Wall Street, as everything—from stock markets, pre-IPO stocks, hedge funds, infrastructure projects, commodities, alternate investment instruments and private credit—becomes tokenized. "At BlackRock, we believe that tokenization has the potential to drive a significant transformation in capital markets infrastructure," BlackRock’s global head of strategic ecosystem partnerships Joseph Chalom told Fortune in May. "Our investment in Securitize is another step in the evolution of our digital assets strategy." Earlier this month, a report from crypto company Chainlink found the current value of tokenized assets is almost $120 billion, with ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin, holding 58% of all tokenized assets. In 2022, Boston Consulting Group found "the total size of illiquid asset tokenization globally would be $16 trillion by 2030," while in 2021, the World Economic Forum estimated that "$867 trillion of value is ready to be disrupted by tokenization."

September 28, 2024 08:07 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Sept. 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of Class A common stock of CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD) between November 29, 2023 and July 29, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important September 30, 2024 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased CrowdStrike Class A common stock during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the CrowdStrike class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=27534 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2024. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) CrowdStrike had instituted deficient controls in its procedures for updating its Falcon software platform, and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (2) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of the CrowdStrike’s customers; and (3) such outages could pose, and in fact ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to CrowdStrike. As a result of these materially false and misleading statements and omissions, CrowdStrike stock traded at artificially high prices during the Class Period. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the CrowdStrike class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=27534 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: ‘This is the last Bitcoin halving that matters’ – Exec

Time Published: 2024-09-28T12:00:59Z

Here’s why this crypto VC founder believes this might be last important BTC halving. Previous Bitcoin halving cycles have been followed by BTC’s price rallying explosively. This phenomenon has made most cycle analysts and the overall market expect a parabolic price rally after every event. According to a recent Blackrock report, BTC’s value has risen by 592x since its debut in 2009. Subsequent exponential returns were recorded after each of the past three halving events too. In 2013, for instance, BTC saw 555x returns, while in 2017, investors saw 104x gains. After the 2020 halving, it posted another 21x returns. And, the trend is expected to repeat after 2024’s event. Source: BlackRock However, Charles Edwards, founder of crypto VC firm Capriole Investments, believes this might be the last halving event that drives a parabolic BTC rally. He said, “This is the last Halving cycle that matters.” Edwards argued that the next halving cycle won’t impact BTC because it’s already the hardest asset, with a very low inflation rate below gold. “The next halving won’t matter much because the inflation rate of BTC is below gold. So, a massive price drop won’t affect it much.” Edwards acknowledged though that the current cycle is not yet priced amid potential nation-state adoption. However, he noted that the halving cycles will be irrelevant by 2028. “You’re not going to get massive price rallies because the halving events are so well known, and the BTC mining industry is so efficient now. I think the 4-year halving cycles will not be relevant in four years.” Here, it’s worth noting that market cycle analyst Stockmoney Lizards projected a possible price target of $200k—$260k per BTC for this cycle top. This could happen by Q4 2025. Source: X In short, there is still more room for BTC growth before it hit this cycle top. The world’s largest digital asset retested $66k on Friday and was valued at $65.9k at press time. That puts it only 8% away from its range-high at $71k.

U.Today - Michael Saylor, Bitcoin permabull and the co-founder of MicroStrategy juggernaut that stacks BTC, has published a tweet to highlight Bitcoin’s high performance, which has massively surpassed that of leading assets in conventional financial markets. Over the past few days, digital gold has demonstrated an increase of more than 5%, reclaiming the $66,000 price mark. As of September this year, BTC shows annual gains of 51%. The second largest after it comes the Magnificent 7 stocks index (which includes such monsters as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)) with 27%, followed by S&P 500 (14% rise), real estate (10% increase) and gold (7%). As for the market of bonds, it has entered the red zone, plunging by 4%. Highlighting Bitcoin’s success, Saylor tweeted, “Bitcoin is winning.” On Friday, Saylor reacted to Bitcoin recapturing $66,000 by publishing a tweet saying “Bitcoin is Storm-Proof.” He also responded to a tweet by a renowned investor Raoul Pal after Pal stated that his core crypto bets include SOL and DOGE. Saylor stated that “Bitcoin misses” Pal, to which the investor replied that while he still believes in Bitcoin 1,000%, he looks for assets that can bring large profits quickly, even if high risks are involved. Since Wednesday last week, Bitcoin has added more than 10%, soaring from $59,410 after the Fed Reserve announced a 50 basis point interest rate cut first time in the last four years. This was the initial driver of the Bitcoin price, followed by a similar announcement by the Central Bank of China and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) purchasing a mammoth amount of Bitcoin this week. In the past four days, its spot Bitcoin ETF IBIT has seen consecutive inflows of $388.19 million in total. This article was originally published on U.Today

Title: Meta Debuts the Quest 3S, Its Cheapest Mixed-Reality Headset

Meta announced several products at its Meta Connect 2024 event in California, but Quest 3S stood out for many reasons. It’s the company’s cheapest mixed-reality headset, featuring a similar chipset (Qualcomm’s Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2) and software functionalities as the older and pricier Meta Quest 3. Meta Quest 3S features a refreshed Meta Horizon OS that better supports 2D applications. Meta says the new OS will also deliver improved spatial audio and better Passthrough contrast and color. The new Quest 3S is compatible with all applications and games in the Meta Store. Also, the headset comes bundled with exclusive games (like Batman: Arkham Shadow) and Quest 3-specific performance updates. Despite sharing a similar form factor, the Quest 3S and Quest 3 have varying display quality, optical lenses, and camera setups. The new Quest 3S has its sensors and Fresnel lenses arranged in triangular clusters, while the Quest 3’s Pancake lenses and sensors have a pill-shaped setup. Additionally, Quest 3 has a better display (2,064 x 2,208 pixels per eye) and will provide more realistic graphics and sharper videos than the Quest 3S (1832 x 1920 pixels per eye). The Quest 3 remains Meta’s most powerful mixed-reality headset. However, the new Quest 3S doesn’t seem like a watered-down version, especially spec-wise. Quest 3S starts at $299.99 for the base (128GB) version and $399.99 for 256GB, while the 512GB version will retail for $499.99. Interested buyers can pre-order the Quest 3S from Meta’s website before it hits the shelves on October 15. In other news, the retail price for the 512GB Meta Quest 3 is dropping from $649.99 to $499.99. Meta is also discontinuing the Quest 2 and Quest Pro. The company says it’ll sell whatever’s left of both models through the end of 2024 or until they’re out of stock. According to Meta, the new Quest 3S will provide outstanding value “both for those new to VR and those looking to upgrade from Quest or Quest 2.

Title: Letter to the Editor: Gasparino vs. Tice

Wokeness is stuff that most Americans of all races and genders can't stand. If they ate this stuff up, Disney—which has been indoctrinating children in gender fluidity through its programming—wouldn't have a stock price that hasn't moved in eight years. Bud Light would still be the nation's No 1. beer, not No. 3, after featuring a trans woman activist in a commercial. BlackRock would be advertising its fealty to Environmental, Social, and Governance investing instead of running away from it. I would like to credit the conservative media with these wins. But a closer look at what is still a modest unwinding of woke—a sometimes overused term, but one that still so perfectly describes the progressive groupthink that seeks to remake the country and its culture into a left-wing hellhole—shows it has more to do with deep reporting by individual reporters (e.g., Chris Rufo), viral social-media moments, and everyday Americans simply exposing the perniciousness and idiocy of this ideology. The conservative media—on this issue and many others—is a little more than an opinion-generating machine, and all too often a negative feedback loop. It leaves the reporting to last and misses an opportunity to have the impact that the mainstream media still does in driving the political and cultural conversation. This may be a harsh conclusion, but it's the reason why I wanted to subject the subject to journalism in my latest book, Go Woke Go Broke: The Inside Story of the Radicalization of Corporate America. I hate the label "mainstream media," but for lack of a better word, this is a world I've occupied, working on the news side of the Wall Street Journal covering financial scandal, Newsweek when it was a major print magazine, at CNBC, where I covered the financial crisis and broke most of the major stories at that time. I've been at Fox and Fox Business with a regular column in the New York Post for the past 14 years. Some would call those outlets "conservative media," yet I never changed the way I do my job, nor do my supervisors want me to. I've written and reported all my books the same way, whether it's exposing Wall Street scams, insider trading, the roots and impact of the 2008 collapse, or how progressivism has become an integral and insidious part of corporate American culture. I engage subjects. I check facts. I question my underlying thesis throughout my reporting. I try to be fair to people I'm reporting on. My journalism moves stocks and has changed corporate behavior. In that spirit, I spent a lot of time speaking with someone at the center of corporate wokeness, a man named Larry Fink, the CEO and founder of BlackRock. Fink is maybe the most powerful financier in America given Blackrock's size: It controls more than $10 trillion in assets. That means from his office in New York City, Fink holds stocks in the world's biggest companies, currencies of every industrial power, stocks, crypto, you name it. He's also used his power to spread corporate wokeness through ESG techniques, and in the process has become a target of the conservative movement, so much so, he has backed off his allegiance to the investing technique. Why Fink initially wanted to change boardroom behavior to scale back oil drilling, proceeded to expand DEI, then reverted is a great story. To his credit, he came clean, and it makes for a fascinating read. I'm probably the only reporter who got Fink to fess up about why he went woke in the first place. Based on reader responses, my book is more compelling because of it. I did what good reporters do—I got inside the head of my subject and, in this case, explained how the most powerful man in finance arrived at the place where he shouldn't have been. But this publication's reviewer, Paul Tice, thinks this is an example of some sort of malfeasance ("Woke CEOs and the Financial Fear Factor," September 15, 2024). He accused me of using "kid glove treatment on Wall Street." I was blown away by that characterization. So was Fink, doubtlessly. (I'm told he doesn't share that view of the book's treatment of him. So too presumably was the reviewer for the Wall Street Journal, who writes, "Mr. Gasparino gives us entertaining (and informative) accounts of corporate blunders in the name of wokeness. ... Among the villains trying to ram ESG down our throats are Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock; Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase; David Solomon, the CEO of Goldman Sachs..." I don't know Mr. Tice, but I can use that invention called The Google, and here's what I found. He's a longtime Wall Street money manager. In 2009, BlackRock—yes Larry Fink's BlackRock—purchased the hedge fund he worked at. Mr. Tice remained at BlackRock until 2015. The head of the hedge fund that BlackRock purchased, Rick Rieder, stayed and is now one of the most powerful people at the firm as head of fixed income. Mr. Tice is now a critic of ESG, which is great, but his background of working at BlackRock, not for a minute, but for six years in a senior capacity, and maybe the circumstances of his departure, should have been disclosed to readers. It wasn't. He was merely described as a member of a think tank who teaches at New York University and wrote a book on ESG. Not a word about working at BlackRock and his experience working for Larry Fink. Yes, good journalism is not only about reporting, but also adding essential context. Charles Gasparino is a Fox Business Network senior correspondent, New York Post columnist, and author of Go Woke, Go Broke: The Inside Story of the Radicalization of Corporate America. Paul Tice responds: Rather than questioning my motives and qualifications for reviewing his new book, Charles Gasparino should address the substance of my criticism. In his book, Gasparino tries to make the case that Wall Street has embraced sustainability because ESG has made firms like BlackRock "uber-wealthy," even though such an argument directly contradicts the premise of his work. As his Go Woke, Go Broke title clearly states, companies that follow progressive environmental and social policies don't outperform financially and often destroy enterprise value, which necessarily means that investment firms cannot achieve better portfolio returns by pursuing ESG investment strategies. Gasparino never acknowledges this core cognitive dissonance in his book. In trying to make the case, moreover, that ESG has been a huge "moneymaker" for BlackRock—thereby causing every Wall Street competitor to follow suit—he fails to back up his argument with facts. While Gasparino correctly notes that funds carrying a sustainable label can charge higher fees, he ignores the reality that, despite all the hype, ESG funds still comprise a very small minority of assets under management (AUM) across the industry. At BlackRock, sustainable funds (excluding cash management accounts) equated to just 6 percent of total AUM at year-end 2023, with more than half of these comprised of passive ESG funds with skinnier fee structures. Nonetheless, Gasparino credits almost all the rise in BlackRock's share price over the past two decades to the firm's strategic focus on sustainability. As he writes, "It is no accident that BlackRock's stock price appreciated more than 500 percent since it offered its first ESG fund [in 2005], compared to a 272 percent rise in the S&P." Given BlackRock's transformational acquisition of Barclays Global Investors in 2009 and the protracted zero-interest rate market environment throughout the 2010s, this is a ludicrous statement. It should come as no surprise that a stock like BlackRock's with a beta well above 1.0 would significantly outperform the overall market during an extended bull run. Gasparino also attributes the sharp swing in BlackRock's AUM over 2022-2023 to changes in its public ESG stance, even though the firm's $1.5 trillion AUM round-trip over these two volatile years was entirely owing to moves in the financial markets. In 2022, when "the stench of ESG … turned off many customers" according to Gasparino, BlackRock still had $307 billion of net fund inflows, dwarfing the roughly $4 billion of capital that was publicly pulled by nine disgruntled red states that year. In 2023, Gasparino asserts that BlackRock's "assets began returning as it moved away from ESG messaging," even though no investment money had left the prior year because of ESG. Lastly, Gasparino tries to explain BlackRock's sustainability focus by highlighting the pressure placed on the firm by blue state pension fund clients such as the retirement accounts run by New York City Comptroller (and now Democratic mayoral candidate) Brad Lander. While it is true that BlackRock manages money for several progressively minded investors, Gasparino steps on his own line by using bad numbers to embellish the point. Contrary to Gasparino's claim, Lander does not play "a leading role in managing more than $20 trillion in pension money." The actual figure is $264 billion as of year-end 2023, so Gasparino is off by a factor of 75. The above nuggets provide context for my contention that Gasparino bends over backward in his book to rationalize the ESG behavior of Wall Street firms, although I was being kind when I described his analysis as hyperbole. But what do I know? I only worked in the financial industry for 40 years. I am no match for the journalism and reporting skills of Charles Gasparino.

Here's your firmware update for September 28, 2024 When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. What a week this was, folks. Meta Connect 2024 introduced us to a new VR headset, its first AR glasses prototype and slew of Meta AI upgrades – including an in-development skill to live dub Instagram reels. We also said hello to the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE, reviewed the new Legend of Zelda title, and prepared ourselves for heartbreak in 2025 with the arrival of The Last of Us season 2's first teaser trailer. In case you missed all that, we've rounded up all of these top tech news stories below so you can get up to speed on everything that happened in the last seven days. On Tuesday (September 24), Nothing unveiled its inaugural set of open-ear buds and TechRadar’s audio editor couldn’t help but share her initial thoughts. She’d already said she thought it was the best idea Nothing's had in ages (questionable ‘Ear Open’ moniker aside), and after slipping them on for a few hours, they didn’t disappoint. Ear Open are so very Nothing; their friendly praying mantis aesthetic is so very likeable. And just as the company's Nothing Ear (a) impressed for a competitive fee, these buds are likely to be a huge hit in the open-ear space. That's particularly true given that they cost just £129, ie. the same price as the flagship Nothing Ear (which means your US and Australian prices are almost certainly $149 / AU$249). Compare that to the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds, with their $299 / £299 / AU$449.95 price-point. See? Slip 'em on and they feel like nothing, too. The fit is excellent – even putting both on at the same time is a cinch. You get the trademark transparent-meets-monochrome-meets-titanium Nothing design language, plus on-ear pinch control, although there’s a knack to it now, purely because you need to locate where the old 'stem' idea is, to pinch. Oh, and the Advanced EQ setting? It's another level… We won't be surprised if not too many Nintendo fans are reading this, because right now they're probably all playing The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom. This highly anticipated entry in the long-running Nintendo franchise is something of a landmark, letting players explore Hyrule through the eyes of Princess Zelda for the first time. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. And the good news is that it's great. It combines elements from classic Zelda titles with a wealth of new mechanics for an adventure quite unlike anything that we’ve seen before. Tasked with closing sinister rifts that threaten the kingdom, you journey through a charming open-world and experiment with a suite of magical abilities. These let you create copies of certain objects whenever you need, which is just as fun as it sounds; a summoned bed might be good for a quick nap in isolation, but makes for the perfect bridge over a perilous chasm when multiplied and stacked. You can even spawn friendly versions of enemies to fight on your behalf. It’s all wrapped up in an adorable art direction, making everything from the characters to the world look like it was plucked straight from a cute diorama. Check out our review below. This week we were treated to our first new trailer for The Last of Us season 2, and we’re convinced it's going to be as emotionally devastating as the videogame it’s based on. Released as part of this year’s The Last of Us Day celebrations (September 26 is the day the Cordyceps infection ravaged the world of the game/show) we got both a two-minute S2 teaser and a confirmation that it’s coming sometime in 2025. The teaser gives us our first glimpse of characters players know from the games, including Abby and Ellie's love interest Dina, as well as providing hints at what Ellie and Joel have been up to following the 'five years of peace' that followed the events of season 1. Fans of the games know it’s not all sunshine and roses for the survivors, though, so we’re going to take these next few months to emotionally prepare ourselves for what The Last of Us has in store for us come 2025. Samsung launched the Galaxy S24 FE alongside the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra this week, and the new phone looks like it’ll prove the cheapest route into Samsung’s Galaxy AI ecosystem. Among the S24 FE’s hardware upgrades over the Galaxy S23 FE are a bigger 6.7-inch display, a new Exynos 2400e chipset, and longer battery life. But while that would be enough to make it a contender in the cheap flagship stakes, it's the phone's AI tricks that we're most excited about. Chief among them are its AI-powered ProVisual photography engine, which it inherits from the standard Galaxy S24 and which should bring improved low-light performance and optical zoom quality. In our hands-on Samsung Galaxy S24 FE review, we described Samsung’s new device as “a great value phone for its power and features,” so here’s hoping it lives up to that billing once we’ve put it through our full review process. 3. Meta’s affordable Meta Quest 3S broke cover The least surprising announcement of Meta Connect 2024 was nevertheless an exciting one – the much-leaked Meta Quest 3S. This affordable alternative to the Meta Quest 3 still packs a solid punch with its Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chipset, and 8GB of RAM, but only costs $299.99 / £289.99 / AU$499.99. In exchange you will have to accept a couple of downgrades – less sharp displays, a bulkier body, and the loss of the depth sensor – but by all accounts the Quest 3S is an impressive VR headset at its price, and looks like it could be perfect for people looking to dip their toes into XR as we head into the holiday season. We also saw Meta’s first fully functional AR glasses – the Orion prototypes. These aren’t something anyone will be able to buy (though some are being given out as developer kits to help software creators make apps for the official specs), but from what we’ve been shown Orion looks amazing. And it’s only set to get better, with Mark Zuckerberg promising the consumer pair will boast better displays, a more fashionable design, and a more affordable price. Although on that last point, Meta’s CTO Andrew Bosworth later clarified that Meta meant affordable in terms of smartphone and laptops rather than at “a Quest 3S price point, or even a Quest 3 price point.” It suddenly feels rather like 2020 all over again. That's because pre-orders for the forthcoming PS5 Pro and the limited-edition PS5 30th Anniversary Collection went on sale this week – with predictable results. Such as? Well, such as the official PlayStation Direct website quickly being inundated with would-be buyers all eager to get their hands on Sony’s upcoming consoles and kit. Many had to wait in digital queues for upwards of an hour, just to be in with a chance of pre-ordering the mid-gen refresh, and there were reports of crashes and timeouts and (inevitably) scalpers. Most PlayStation Direct stock sold out completely that same day; the 30th Anniversary Edition bundle was gone in minutes across the US and UK, while the limited-edition PS5 Slim, DualSense Edge and PlayStation Portal models were quick to follow. Some stock still held on, however, and at the time of writing, Sony’s website still has PS5 Pro units available to pre-order.

Title: Grayscale’s Bullish Forecast: The Top 20 Crypto To Watch In Q4
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/grayscales-bullish-forecast-the-top-20-crypto-to-watch-in-q4/
Time Published: 2024-09-28T05:00:30Z

Crypto asset manager Grayscale has published an in-depth report outlining sectors poised for bullish growth in the final quarter of the year amid a notable recovery in the cryptocurrency market, particularly for major players such as Bitcoin (BTC) and various altcoins, which have reached price levels not seen in over two months. In its Thursday report, Grayscale updated its Crypto Sectors Indexes, showcasing emerging themes within the digital asset industry. Key trends include the rise of decentralized artificial intelligence (AI) platforms, efforts to tokenize traditional assets, and the growing popularity of memecoins. Notably, Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency sector have outperformed other market segments in 2024, likely due to the successful launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) in the US earlier this year and favorable macroeconomic conditions following the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) interest rate cut on 18 September. While gaining 13% this year, Ethereum has underperformed Bitcoin but still surpassed many other cryptocurrencies. Grayscale’s Crypto Sectors Market Index (CSMI) has seen a slight decline of about 1% year-to-date, with the Smart Contract Platforms Crypto Sector Index down approximately 11%, making Ethereum’s performance relatively stronger than its peers. Despite its challenges, the asset manager finds that Ethereum remains the Smart Contract Platforms sector leader, boasting the highest number of applications, developers, and fee revenue. In producing its quarterly Top 20 list of cryptocurrencies, Grayscale thoroughly analyzes hundreds of digital assets. This list represents a diversified selection of assets with high potential for the upcoming quarter. Among those highlighted by the firm are standout performers such as Sui (SUI), Bittensor (TAO), Optimism (OP), Helium (HNT), Celo (CELO) and the UMA Protocol (UMA). However, below is the full list with other assets beyond these to which Grayscale pays particular attention. Sui, a third-generation blockchain created by former Meta engineers, has made waves following a recent network upgrade that enhanced its transaction speed by 80%, surpassing Solana’s capabilities. Optimism, an Ethereum Layer 2 solution, plays a critical role in scaling the Ethereum network. It has developed a framework called the “Superchain,” which is utilized by platforms like Coinbase’s Layer 2 BASE. Celo and UMA are capitalizing on unique trends, with Celo focusing on stablecoin use and payment solutions in developing regions, particularly in Africa. The platform recently surpassed Tron in stablecoin usage, while UMA serves as an oracle network for decentralized applications like Polymarket. Helium’s inclusion in the Top 20 reflects Grayscale’s preference for category leaders with sustainable revenue models. The project has established itself as a leader in decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), growing its network to over one million hotspots and generating significant fee revenues. Bittensor, which focuses on the intersection of AI and crypto, has recently gained recognition within Grayscale’s framework due to improvements in market structure, offering a decentralized platform for AI innovation. In this quarter’s adjustments, Grayscale has rotated out several assets, including Render, Mantle, ThorChain, Pendle, Illuvium, and Raydium. While Grayscale sees value in these projects, the revised Top 20 list aims to offer more compelling risk-adjusted returns for investors in the coming months. At the time of writing, the biggest winner across all time frames in Grayscale’s top 20 list is Bittensor’s TAO token, which has seen gains of 86% over the fourteen-day time frame and a substantial 841% year-to-date, resulting in a current trading price of $536.

Title: AIL: Terenure seek to back up impressive opening victory when they travel to Young Munster

There might only be two teams unbeaten after two rounds of the Energia AIL Division 1A come teatime this afternoon, namely the winners of the Clontarf-Garryowen and Young Munster-Terenure matches. All victorious on the opening day, Terenure will seek to back up their victory at home over the champions Cork Con when they travel to Young Munster, who themselves won away to UCD. However, Terenure last won at Tom Clifford Park in February 2017, and they travel without last week’s match-winner Fintan Gunne, due to his Leinster call-up, and also their go-to centre Peter Sylvester, who played his 50th AIL game for the club last week before moving to Miami. The experienced Alan Bennie and pacy Conor Phillips start, with Craig Adams shifting to midfield alongside Aran Egan, as the former Leinster back Chris Cosgrave is tried at 10. It’s a potent looking backline, if lacking Sylvester’s physicality. The fit-again Jordan Coughlan returns in a strong bench. Similarly, Young Munster are without last week’s double try-scorer, Shay McCarthy, as he is with Munster in Parma, injured fullback Patrick Buckley and suspended tighthead Paul Allen. Shane O’Leary, Jack Shaw and Peter Meyer come in. As Bryan Fitzgerald is also on Munster duty, Garryowen bring Jack Delaney into midfield in one of four changes for their trek to Castle Avenue, with fullback Jamie Heuston, winger Colm Quilligan and lock Oisin Cooke starting. With Aitzol King called up to the Leinster squad, Clontarf have brought in Sean Reilly, Victor Allen and Peter Maher, as Andrew Smith shifts to fullback behind an unchanged pack and halves. The other opening day winners, Ballynahinch, travel to Temple Hill where Con have brought in centre Eoghan Smith and the Munster loosehead Mark Donnelly. Lansdowne, at home to UCD, recall winger Cathal Eddy and promote flanker Paul Wilson, the Gonzaga captain in their Schools Cup win two seasons ago. The students’ suffered injuries to both scrumhalves, Rob Gilsenan and Michael Moloney, and flanker Mark Hernan. They make eight changes and two positional switches, as Bobby Sheehan moves from hooker to blindside. St Mary’s make four changes for their trip to Armagh, with Ethan Baxter replacing suspended captain Ronan Waters after his red card against Clontarf. In 1B last week’s five home winners are all on the road against sides who lost away. Nenagh Ormond travel to Blackrock while Shannon and Old Wesley, each beaten in the semi-finals last season, meet in a reprise of the promotion final two seasons ago which Shannon won, and UCC host Highfield in a Cork derby. Two of last week’s winners in 2A meet when Corinthians host Greystones. The promoted Galway club won 27-10 away to Ballynahinch last week with a pack whose oldest player is 24 and a backline, featuring double-try scoring 19-year-old Tomás Farthing, whose oldest player is 21. Free-scoring Instonians host Ballymena in their first home game in 2A for 12 years and Navan begin their centenary celebrations in earnest when hosting Old Crescent, while in 2C Sydney Parade hosts its first AIL game in 22 years when Monkstown entertain Bruff. Division 1A: City of Armagh v St. Mary’s College, Palace Grounds; Clontarf v Garryowen, Castle Avenue; Cork Constitution v Ballynahinch, Temple Hill; Lansdowne v UCD, Aviva Stadium Back Pitch; Young Munster v Terenure College, Tom Clifford Park.

Punishing: Gray Raven, the acclaimed cyberpunk anime game, has joined forces with another acclaimed cyberpunk franchise for its latest content update. Named Blazing Simulacrum, the patch sees Kuro Games’s visually impressive action-RPG playing host to BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER. Blazing Simulacrum is easily the most significant update since those momentous events. It consists of a new story chapter, new coatings and rerun SFX coatings, a ton of limited-time events, and a whole new A-Rank Omniframe. Her new exclusive coating—Elder Flame, will also be released during this patch. BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER is obtainable within 10 pulls, which makes her super new player friendly. She is armed with an exclusive Bladed Cannon weapon-★Rock Cannon, along with a host of skills and abilities, including the ability to deal damage while releasing her signature. She is a perfect choice for a fire team. Her weapon and skill action designs fully adhere to the original character’s style. The blue flame in her eye, the proficient use of “★Rock Cannon”, and the identical costume design to the original all highlight the meticulous effort put into this collaboration. Other updates about this patch There are old and new SFX coatings in the Blazing Simulacrum patch. Coatings like Solitary Dream for Bianca: Stigmata and Vox Solaris for Selene: Capriccio are making a comeback, while Snowbreak Bloom for Liv: Luminance and Nightbreaker for Lucia: Crimson Weave are appearing for the first time. Plus, the patch also boasts a neat Chessboard Realms roguelike gameplay mode. What’s Punishing: Gray Raven？ Some time in the future, the world falls victim to a terrible invasion. The invaders are an army of robots that have become warped and twisted by a biomechanical virus called The Punishing. Those cybernetic marauders are the Corrupted. Driven to the brink of annihilation, the last vestige of humanity has found shelter on the space station Babylonia. It is from this orbiting outpost that you, the leader of the Gray Raven special forces unit, must amass an army and reclaim your homeland. Punishing: Gray Raven has been updated numerous times since coming out in 2021, keeping the fast-paced ARPG gameplay fresh and the player base happy. In 2023, Kuro Games released a PC client, and in the same year the studio also created an English dub. There’s plenty to get your teeth into, then, and you can get started by downloading Punishing: Gray Raven for free right now on Android, iOS, or PC.

Title: ‘Every year the women’s AIL gets stronger’ – Railway Union’s Niamh Byrne determined to go one step further than last year

Photo: Seb Daly/Sportsfile Niamh Byrne and her Railway Union team-mates have a big incentive to go all the way in the AIL this year, having lost last year’s final to UL Bohs. Moving on wasn’t easy, but in time they came to appreciate what was a ground-breaking day for women’s rugby. It was the first time the AIL final was held in the Aviva Stadium, having previously taken place in Donnybrook, going ahead in conjunction with the men’s decider as a double-header. Byrne, the Railway Union captain and former Ireland sevens and Leinster player, says the landmark occasion is a testament to the progress being made in women’s club rugby. “The day itself was absolutely wonderful,” she says. “The first time the women got to play the AIL final at the Aviva and the first time it was a double-header with the men. “It was great to play a part in that. The weather was unbelievable, leading to a really great atmosphere. Getting the bus in, the whole works, it all made for a brilliant experience.” The game more than lived up to the occasion, producing 13 tries as UL Bohs edged the Sandymount club 48-38 in a rip-roaring thriller. The new season begins this weekend and Railway Union are eager to get off to a winning start in their clash with local rivals Old Belvedere. “We’ve a lot of new girls down, with a lot of the team returning from last year, too. We’ve worked hard in pre-season, in the gym and on the pitch. “Unfortunately for us, we didn’t get the win last year and that was tough to take, but in time, you look back and say it really was such a great day out, a great spectacle, and a brilliant showcase of the standard of women’s club rugby in Ireland.” On the ground, increasing numbers at underage level is a sign of positive momentum in the women’s club rugby scene. The make-up of the Railway Union squad is emblematic of the growth, where a number of 18-year-olds are taking their first steps in senior rugby, guided by more experienced team-mates, such as Irish rugby legend Lindsay Peat, still going strong at 43. Byrne is somewhere in the middle, having begun playing as a youngster in Mullingar. “Every year the women’s AIL gets stronger,” says the centre. “Underage structures are improving. “There are under-18s ready to come in which there wouldn’t have always been, and a lot of those girls make that jump to senior rugby, and we’ll always welcome them,” she stresses. “The boys in my class in Mullingar set up the girls' underage team. We were all dragged down the first night, had no intention of playing rugby, I used to swim and play hockey. “After a few sessions, I decided rugby was for me. [I] played Leinster underage and senior and was contracted to the sevens after college.” Byrne would encourage anyone to come down to the club and get involved, and now her focus is on regaining the crown they last won in 2022. Blackrock, Old Belvedere and last year’s champs UL Bohs look to be Railway Union’s main rivals again – no team outside of those four have won a title in the last 20 years – and Byrne is excited to renew acquaintances. “Two of those rivals are obviously very close neighbours to the Railway team [Blackrock and Old Belvedere], so you go into those games knowing it’s going to be a very physical game. “There’s a lot of work to be done between now and April, but the goal of every season is to win it. “Last year was great, but the result does stick in the mind and we want to make up for that.”

By Suzanne McGee (Reuters) - Assets in actively managed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) worldwide hit a record $1 trillion at the end of August, according to data provider ETFGI, boosted by easier regulations and a wave of product innovation. Active ETFs seek to outperform the indexes they are benchmarked to, including the S&P 500, the Nasdaq 100 and the Russell 1000 Growth Index. Bear Stearns launched the first active ETF in 2008. While they make up just 7% of all global ETFs, active ETFs have accounted for 30% of all inflows into the funds as a whole for the last several years, Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research at State Street (NYSE:STT) Research, told Reuters in the latest episode of Inside ETFs. A key growth catalyst, analysts said, was the 2019 regulation popularly known as the “ETF rule,” which streamlined the complex process of winning approval for active ETFs from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Assets in the active ETF category have grown about 10-fold since 2019, according to data from ETF.com. Growth has continued this year. As of Aug. 31, active ETF assets soared 42%, data from ETFGI showed. The more relaxed regulations have also fueled innovation, Bartolini said, encouraging issuers to take novel approaches to products as they vie for investor dollars. Active ETFs run the gamut from the plain vanilla, such as the BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Large Cap Value ETF to more niche offerings, like the AdvisorShares Vice ETF, which invests in shares of companies involved in the alcohol, tobacco and cannabis industries. "These regulatory rule changes have actually accelerated some of the more novel approaches that ETF issuers can bring to the marketplace," Bartolini said. Active ETFs include products that have been wildly volatile, such as Ark Innovation ETF, which soared 152% in 2020, only to slump 23% the following year. So far in 2024, it has lost 9.74%, compared with a 20% gain in the S&P 500. Some can also magnify risk, such as leveraged ETFs tied to the performance of individual stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Nor are all active ETF issuers faring well. The 10 largest issuers accounted for 75% of active ETF assets, according to a Morningstar report from earlier this year. The bottom half of active equity ETFs have only 3% of all the group's assets. "ETFs that repackage old-fashioned stock-picking have struggled to attract assets," said Jack Shannon, manager research analyst at Morningstar, in a report published on Tuesday. Tim Huver, senior vice president of ETF Servicing at Brown Brothers Harriman, said active ETFs may require investors to do more due diligence. Nonetheless, he believes the category has reached a turning point. A Brown Brothers survey found that more than 90% of ETF investors intended to increase their allocation to active ETFs, Huver said. "I think the second trillion is going to arrive much more rapidly than it took us to get to the first trillion," Huver said.

Title: Everything Meta Announced At Connect 2024
URL: https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-connect-2024-everything-announced/
Time Published: 2024-09-27T21:26:54Z
Full Content:
Meta announced so much at its Connect 2024 conference that you may have missed some of it. But never fear! Here's a brief summary of every important Meta Connect 2024 announcement. For full context and details, read the articles linked. Meta launched a new headset, simplified its Quest 3 lineup, discontinued Quest 2 and Quest Pro, and launched new official accessories. After months of leaks, Meta finally announced its new headset: Quest 3S. Effectively, Quest 3S is a cheaper Quest 3 with a bulkier design, inferior lens clarity, and lower resolution. Quest 3S has the same Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chipset and color passthrough mixed reality capabilities as Quest 3, but uses the old fresnel lenses and fixed single panel from Quest 2 to achieve a starting price of $300. All purchases of Quest 3S until May will come with Batman: Arkham Shadow. Meta is discontinuing the 128GB base model of Quest 3 and cutting the other 512GB model to its $500 price. Until stock is gone, the 128GB model is on clearance sale for $430. Like with Quest 3S, all purchases of Quest 3 until May will come with Batman: Arkham Shadow. Quest 2 and Quest Pro will no longer be available when stock runs out or at the end of the year, whichever comes first. Quest 2 was the first mainstream VR headset and Quest Pro was an innovative failure. Quest 3S will take Quest 2's place in Meta's lineup. But there's no direct replacement for Quest Pro. When it's gone, Meta will no longer offer a headset with eye tracking or face tracking. One aspect of Quest Pro that Meta will offer a replacement for is its open periphery design, because it's releasing an official Open Facial Interface for Quest 3. Instead of being a halo strap, the official Open Facial Interface still presses against your face. But the space between the interface and the headset itself is empty, allowing you to see the real world. Quest 3S is getting its own exclusive facial interface accessory. The "Breathable" Facial Interface makes the tradeoff of not being opaque to "help you keep cool while working out or playing intense games". You can now buy the Logitech MX Ink tracked stylus for Quest headsets. Logitech MX Ink is designed for both 2D drawing on a physical surface via its pressure-sensitive tip and for 3D creativity via full 6DoF positional tracking (via the headset cameras), multiple buttons, and a haptic feedback actuator. When Quest 2, Quest Pro, and the 128GB Quest 3 are gone, Meta's headset lineup will be: Official YouTube cowatching will finally launch as a beta next week. YouTube cowatching will take place in Horizon Home, meaning you'll see other people as their Meta Avatar alongside you. Quest 3 owners in the US can try photorealistic scenes via Meta's new Horizon Hyperscape demo app. UploadVR's Don Hopper tried Horizon Hyperscape and found it to be significantly higher quality than Gracia, with a "stark difference" in visual clarity. Amazon launched an all-new Prime Video Quest app that supports passthrough and downloads. Prime Video is the first major streaming service officially available on Horizon OS to support downloads, making it ideal for use on airplanes with the Travel Mode Quest headsets now have since May. Quest headsets will be able to extend Windows 11 laptops by just looking at them, without installing any software, later this year. Meta says this will be possible thanks to a partnership with Microsoft. Your laptop's screen will turn off and be replaced by a giant virtual screen, and you'll be able to spawn entirely virtual extra monitors. The new Meta Avatars system with overhauled graphics will launch on Tuesday. And some time next year, Meta will allow users to generate a new outfit by typing, leveraging generative AI. In Horizon Worlds, Meta says it will also support "fantastical avatars", non-human forms which users can unlock in specific worlds. In a surprise announcement, Meta revealed that it will give developers access to the passthrough cameras of Quest headsets via a new API next year. Meta hasn't yet said whether there'll be any restrictions to the Passthrough API, but we'll keep a close eye on the company for any further details of this exciting upcoming capability, which could unlock entirely new use cases for Quest headsets. Meta says Horizon Worlds creators will be able to add AI NPCs to their worlds next year. These AI NPCs will be able to "engage in conversations, help people out, and even compete in games". Meta teased "the future of Horizon OS", showing a concept of a complete redesign. Meta didn't give even a rough timeline for the new Horizon OS interface, and what was shown appears to be a concept. Triangle Strategy, a turn-based tactical RPG from Square Enix, is being adapted for VR this year on Quest. On Quest, Triangle Strategy's VR adaptation promises a "whole new look" across the battlefield, letting you reach out to units and issue commands directly. Home Sports is a new mixed reality multi-sports game that rolls five sports into one collection on Quest 3. An exact release date remains unconfirmed. Resolution states Home Sports "will be launching soon" for the Meta Quest 3 family. Supernatural Together is a new expansion that adds group-based workouts to the fitness app on Quest. Team Workouts feature special Challenge Zones and Victory Tunnels that "require teamwork and coordination to complete." Meta Horizon Store, the app store on Quest headsets, will allow developers to submit 2D Android apps. Meta will be hoping this brings some of the most useful and entertaining apps from the Google Play Store. However, the lack of Google Play Services will make it challenging for some apps to be ported. Meta Spatial SDK lets developers easily build apps for Quest's Horizon OS with traditional mobile development tools, without a game engine. It provides rendering, optional passthrough, controller and hand tracking, support for flatscreen and immersive media playback, physics, and spatial audio. The Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses are getting a swathe of new software features, as well as new transitions lenses styles. The following features are coming "soon": And these features are coming "later this year": Further, EssilorLuxottica and Meta launched new style options with Transitions lenses: Meta showed off integrated prototype AR glasses with a field of view that's remarkable given their form factor. However, the Orion glasses won't be sold as a product, as Meta admitted each costs on the order of $10,000 to produce. The company said Orion will be used as a demonstrator and internal development kit, describing it as "a time machine that lets us live in the future".

Title: 20 Geopolitical Events with Highest Impact on S&P 500
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-geopolitical-events-highest-impact-211037361.html
Time Published: 2024-09-27T21:10:33Z

In this article, we will look at the 20 geopolitical events with highest impact on S&P 500. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, go directly to the 5 Geopolitical Events with Highest Impact on S&P 500. The geopolitical events impact the financial markets across the world depending on the nature of the event. The assassination attempt on former US President Donald J. Trump is the latest geopolitical event investors have had to grapple with in recent years, alongside two major wars including Russia-Ukraine and ongoing Israel’s aggression on Gaza. Wars have far-reaching effects such as an impact on financial markets, in addition to enormous human toll. Geopolitics events that affect the economy drastically caution investors to look for safe haven investments or be out of the market until the situation comes to normal. According to JP Morgan Private Bank’s recent client survey, 34% of the investors were potentially worried about geopolitical risks, while 29% of investors were bothered by potential recession fears in 2024. Whereas, almost 90% of the geopolitical events have not changed the direction of the world economy, as per Citigroup Inc.’s Global Wealth Report 2024. Geopolitical events mostly have short-term impacts on global asset prices. However, World War II and the 1973 OPEC Oil Embargo had the gravest impact on the financial markets. The 1973 oil shock did have a lasting impact on equity returns. During the first 90 days, the S&P 500 plunged by nearly 13.04%, the highest among geopolitical events since 1940. The oil supply was limited for an extended period, leading to a macro state of ‘stagflation.’ In simple terms, high oil prices essentially stopped the economy from operating efficiently in the 1970s. On the other side, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine shocked global energy markets in 2022. However, additional oil supply limited the economic and market impact compared to its 1970s counterpart. Today, the US has a more secure oil supply compared to its heavy reliance on the Middle East. In recent times, the rising conflicts in the Middle East and the Russia-Ukraine war have had major consequences. The US has been aiding Ukraine and Israel with military assistance. According to the US State Department, the US government has provided more than $55.7 billion in military assistance to Ukraine to fight against Russian invasion since the war began in February 2022. Whereas, the US government has supported Israel through legislation providing at least $12.5 billion in military aid, as of April 2024. It has been a see-saw year for the global economies. The intensified conflict in the Middle East may impact oil prices with a potential disruption in regional supply. As of September 23, oil prices have been high as the conflicts soar, and due to last week's outsized US interest rate cut expectations. As reported by Reuters, Yeap Jun Rong, the market strategist at IG International, said: “Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East have edged up a notch between Israel and Hezbollah, which could leave oil prices well-supported on the risks of a wider regional conflict." Brent crude futures for November were up $0.60, or 0.8% at $75.09 per barrel, while the US crude futures for November were up $0.64, or 0.9%, at $71.64, as of September 23. In addition, both oil benchmarks soared over 4% last week due to the US rate cut, weaker demand sentiment in top oil importer China is capping the upswing, reported Reuters.

Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is one of the leading American multinationals in the oil and gas sector. The company engages in the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas both domestically and internationally. Exxon Mobil Corporation recently signed a MOU with an EV maker SK On. The oil and gas company has agreed to provide 100,000 metric tons of MobilTMLithium from its first planned project in Arkansas. This deal will help ExxonMobil’s goal of supplying lithium for almost 1 million EV batteries annually by 2030 and support the build-out of a US EV supply chain. For the second quarter of 2024, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) surpassed earnings estimates, reporting an EPS of $2.14, up by 6.51% compared to anticipated earnings of $2.02 per share. Exxon Mobil posted $9.2 billion in earnings, making its second-best Q2 performance in the past decade. The company achieved this feat following record production in Guyana and the Permian Basin, where the output reached 1.2 million barrels per day. The company’s revenue came in at $93.06 billion, exceeding estimated revenue of $89.68 billion. Alongside strong operational results, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) gave back $9.5 billion to shareholders, including $4.3 billion in dividends. XOM has more than 40 years of consistent dividend growth and averaged a 2.20% yield over the past five years. In addition, Exxon Mobil plans to invest between $20 billion and $25 billion annually in capital expenditures through 2027. With strong hedge fund sentiment, XOM is one of the 10 Best Affordable Stocks To Buy Right Now. Hedge fund interest in Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) soared from 81 in Q1 2024 to 92 in Q2 2024. Madison Dividend Income Fund pointed out regarding XOM in the Q1 2024 investor letter: “Our thesis on XOM is that it will grow production volumes of oil and gas moderately over the next few years, while limiting excessive capital investment that plagued the industry from 2014-2020. Production growth will come from its 2023 acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources, which is the largest producer in the Permian basin. XOM plans to double its Permian output by 2027, to 2 million barrels per day. Capital spending will be limited to $20-25 billion per yearthrough 2027, which should allow for significant amounts of cash to be returned to shareholders including a $35 billion share repurchase program and continued dividend increases. Higher oil prices would provide a tailwind to our thesis but are not necessary. We think XOM can grow earnings and cash flow if oil prices remain above $60 per barrel…” (Click here to read the full text) While we acknowledge the potential of XOM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

To communicate their focus on individualism, JBL worked with Nick Kosir (aka The Dancing Weatherman) who shared sightings of JBLiens, easily observable by their “ear-dividuality” as breaking news. A post shared by Nick Kosir (@nickkosir) They also worked with Flyana Boss, an American hip hop duo with nearly half a million YouTube subscribers. In addition to YouTube and Instagram, they also used TikTok. Katie A. Raymond, Director of Strategy, Content, Social Media and Paid Media at HARMAN International, JBL’s parent company, sums up the campaign’s success in a LinkedIn post as follows: “The campaign’s success was measured in how it drove the business, and also by the conversations it started, the community it built, and the path-to-purchase traffic it drove.” “The campaign’s success was measured in how it drove the business, and also by the conversations it started, the community it built, and the path-to-purchase traffic it drove.” Oscar Mayer, a Kraft Heinz brand that sells meat and cold cuts, brought home the bacon with the #OscarTakeMeToProm campaign. It’s a great example of how to combine: As part of their marketing efforts, Oscar Mayer uses an iconic wienermobile that gets driven around by their brand ambassadors across America. Each year, they receive several requests for rides in their wiener-on-wheels. These requests typically come from students. Oscar Mayer However, social listening revealed that teens thought that the Wienermobile would make a pretty cool ride to the prom. Oscar Mayer then turned to their group of brand ambassadors to create and share content via their official Oscar Mayer social accounts. Using paid and organic efforts, they launched a UGC contest on Instagram and TikTok. The campaign did exceptionally well on Instagram. It generated a 65% increase in reach on Instagram, while the content’s engagement rate exceeded the platform’s benchmarks more than 170%. For an example of how to use social media for a holiday campaign, there’s Lidl GB’s multi-channel Christmas activation. The discount retailer chain released a spoof of East 17’s only number-one single, “Stay Another Day”. The campaign parodies both the song and original music video. One of the reasons why this paid social campaign works is because the spoof also features Tony Mortimer, one of the English pop band’s original members. As Coolr, the social media agency behind this campaign, explains in their “Save Another Way (...the Lidl Way)” case study, his inclusion works on two levels. It improves the sense of familiarity among viewers as well as adds a type of endorsement. It also works because it combines social good marketing. Aside from promoting their rewards app, Lidl GB also donated £100,000 to NSPCC’s Childline service. The campaign was run on: It was particularly successful on TikTok and Instagram where it generated nearly 68 million impressions. To maximize reach and awareness on TikTok, the agency used the premium TopView placement on TikTok. The judges of the Global Social Media Awards commended it for its “social-first approach”. The content was created with social media in mind from the start. For example, the full, 4-minute music video was uploaded onto YouTube, while a shorter version was shared on TikTok, known for short-form video content. Plus, this way they could also encourage users who watched the short version on TikTok to go to YouTube to watch the longer version. The short version on TikTok generated nearly 1 million clicks to YouTube. PHD, one of the globe’s media agencies with the most awards (which includes being named Adweek’s Global Media Agency of the Year), created this campaign for Volkswagen to help them launch their new ID. Buzz. Electric vehicles might be quiet, but the market is noisy. With Volkswagen boasting only a 4.2% share in terms of unit sales, it needed a special force to create a buzz. To do this, they partnered with Disney and Star Wars to connect the automotive brand strategically with these iconic cultural elements. The social strategy used familiar and beloved characters like C-3PO, R2D2, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Ewan McGregor to improve electric vehicle consideration. McGregor also happens to have loved the VW brand since a kid and owns a couple of VW buses, elevating him to a level of brand ambassador. The strategy was adjusted for each social channel. For example, Meta was reserved for video-only campaigns using the platform’s available video placements. On TikTok, the agency could be slightly more playful. Here, they created a Star Wars community for fans. As two major brands were working together on this campaign and each had their own marketing agency, a solution was needed to collaborate without confidential info getting shared. The Force Is Strong, United! case study shared on The World Media Group’s website, explains how they created a Data Clean Room directly in PHD’s planning tool. This way, they could optimize all digital bidding strategies. Using an AI-powered automated process, data could be compared so that bids across both campaigns could be matched to prevent mutual high-bidding effects. The Warner Bros. Discovery’s “Did we do ‘Kenough’” campaign is another example of how the agency PHD UK used paid social effectively. PHD Linkedin post The strategy included: As a case study of this award-winning campaign explains, the challenge of this campaign was to change the movie’s perception. Unlike the actual dolls, the movie’s plot didn’t have the same target audience. As the movie had a broader appeal, it made PHD UK’s keyword audience strategy so much more effective. That said, while the plot tackled more serious topics like feminism, the agency found more than “kenough” room to add elements of playfulness. Plus, it also helped to set it apart from Oppenheimer, Barbie the Movie’s summer release competition sharing the same release date. To do this, all communication touchpoints had to place the movie and its trademark pink into pop culture and be positive. The Drum Like Volkswagen, Priceline also worked with a TV star, Kaley Cuoco, best known for her roles in The Big Bang Theory and The Flight Attendant, for their social media campaign. This way, they could also leverage the Emmy-nominated actress’ huge following on social media. In the ads created as a series of funny episodes, Kaley encourages her coworkers to book their dream vacation by using Priceline’s affordable travel options. As incentive, more than $5 million in hidden, interactive deals were made available exclusively via social ads, making the campaign a great example of how to add an element of gamification. MIRIMAR If that were not enough to grab attention, each episode features an original theme song. This theme song was also released on streaming platforms. In addition to streaming platforms and social media takeovers on Meta, TikTok, and YouTube, they also used audio and podcast ads. Combine these deals with the original music and travelers were given multiple reasons to break into song. In addition to illustrating the benefit of using elements like music and gamification, this campaign also highlights the importance of target audience research. A survey commissioned by Priceline revealed that 76% of US workers are happier when they travel, yet more than 50% identify price as a reason for not traveling. With this data, they could ensure that the core messaging of their campaign offers a solution to their target audience’s pain point. These 6 award-winning paid social marketing campaigns highlight a few tips that brands and their marketing teams can use. Here’s what they teach us: Understanding your target audience is crucial, even more so when you’re running a paid campaign. Social media platforms have exceptional audience targeting capabilities, but to use it properly you need to know and understand your audience. For example, in the case of the campaign for Barbie’s movie release, segmenting audiences based on demographics like age was essential. The movie was, in fact, aimed at teens and women, not tweens like the doll. Demographics, though, are only one criteria. The campaign created for Priceline illustrates how knowing your audience’s pain points are crucial too. You might know who your target audience is, but you can always get to understand them better. Plus, needs and interests change which can impact your campaign’s approach. In the case of Priceline, a simple survey already revealed key information regarding travelers’ pain points, but you can also use more robust audience research tools like: Depending on your budget, you can incorporate influencer-generated content. According to The Influencer Marketing Factory, 90% of influencer marketing campaigns include paid media. This way, you can add that element of trust and validation which are important to social media users. Another benefit is that you grow your reach. Your ads will grab the attention of the influencer’s followers too. You don’t necessarily need to use the likes of Ewan McGregor or Penny from The Big Bang Theory. In fact, our Influencer Marketing Benchmark Report 2024 found that mega/celebrity influencers are used least often. Only 12.9% of brands plan to use mega influencers in 2024, compared to 44% that plan to use mostly nano-influencers. Influencer Preferences Cost isn’t the only reason. Nano and micro-influencers in some instances have higher engagement rates. This is especially true if you plan on using Instagram or TikTok. Data shared by Captiv8 with EMARKETER reveals that Instagram influencers with fewer than 10,000 followers have the highest engagement rate at 6.23%. On TikTok, the picture looks similar. Here, nano-influencers also have the highest engagement rate, according to Statista’s numbers. Engagement rate of TikTok influencers worldwide What is essential when selecting influencers is that target audiences must align with the influencer’s followers. Ideally, there should also be a link between the influencer’s own interests and that of your product. In the case of Volkswagen’s campaign, the fact that Ewan McGregor is a longtime Volkswagen driver, helps to create that trust and validation that makes this form of marketing so effective. Crafting successful social ad campaigns requires more than just a budget and creativity. By leveraging analytics tools, you can gain profound insights into your target audience, ensuring your content resonates and engages effectively. Prioritizing social-first content tailored to each platform's unique environment can significantly boost your campaign's performance. For example, on TikTok and Instagram videos designed for mobile viewing are a must. And, if your budget allows it, combine your paid social efforts with influencer marketing. It can amplify your reach and credibility, making your social media ads more impactful. Facebook is considered one of the best social media platforms for paid advertising. It has advanced audience targeting features, various ad formats, and allows for different campaign objectives such as awareness, traffic, engagement, leads, app promotion, and sales. What’s more, Facebook is the most-used social media platform worldwide, offering a large and diverse audience for brands to reach.

Connected TV advertising platform MNTN is reportedly considering going public in early 2025. The firm, whose chief creative officer is actor Ryan Reynolds, selected Morgan Stanley to work on its initial public offering (IPO), Bloomberg reported Friday (Sept. 27), citing unnamed sources. Deliberations around the IPO are ongoing, and details could change, according to the report. MNTN did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comment. The company’s advertising software includes targeting, measurement and automated optimization technology designed to help brands promote themselves on connected TVs, according to the report. In 2021, MNTN acquired Reynolds’ creative agency, Maximum Effort, and raised $119 million in a Series D financing round, per the report. The company’s Series D round closed in the fourth quarter of 2021 and was announced by the firm in a February 2022 press release. The round was co-led by funds and accounts managed by BlackRock and Fidelity Management and Research Co. MNTN said in the release that the number of viewers making streaming their preferred way of watching television had exploded, that large advertisers were moving to connected TV because of this growth in consumption, and that MNTN’s software enables advertisers to buy connected TV inventory and measure its performance in real time. Patrick Pohlen, chief financial officer at MNTN, said in the release: “I’ve worked in venture and technology for over 25 years but this company and our new partners are special. Connected TV is transforming the advertising landscape and MNTN is leading the charge.” In a blog post announcing MNTN’s acquisition of Maximum Effort, MNTN CEO Mark Douglas and Reynolds wrote that the combination brought together tech and creative to simplify and accelerate advertising. “We believe the meteoric rise of Connected TV presents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to bring media and creative closer together,” they wrote. “The demand for easy-to-use tech and superb, fast-turn creative is certain to climb thanks to an increase in inventory and advertisers new to TV — many of whom can’t afford upfronts. Independently, our companies have embraced and excelled because of our commitment to simplicity and speed. Together, we think the opportunities are endless.” We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: From Land Grabbers to Carbon Cowboys: A New Scramble for Community Lands Takes Off

Time Published: 2024-09-27T18:04:13Z
Full Content:
In a recent interview with the New York Times, billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates was asked if there were types of projects that he would not invest in to offset his greenhouse gas emissions. “I don’t plant trees,” he replied, adding that planting trees to deal with the climate crisis was complete nonsense. “I mean, are we the science people, or are we the idiots? Which one do we want to be?”[1] Microsoft, the company he built his fortune on and, according to insiders, still actively advises, sees it differently. In June 2024, the tech giant bought 8 million carbon credits from the Timberland Investment Group (TIG), a fund owned by the Brazilian agribusiness lender BTG Pactual.[2] TIG is raising US$1 billion to buy and convert pasture lands to large-scale eucalyptus plantations across the Southern Cone of Latin America.[3] As these trees grow, they draw carbon from the atmosphere and store it in their roots, trunks and branches. TIG will estimate the amount of carbon removed and then sell it as carbon credits to Microsoft and other corporations. Each carbon credit that Microsoft buys from TIG is supposed to offset one tonne of the emissions Microsoft generates burning fossil fuels. This is one of the main ways that Microsoft and many other companies are planning on getting to “net zero” emissions, while still burning fossil fuels. Microsoft’s deal with TIG, reportedly the largest “carbon dioxide removal credit transaction” in history, is just one of many investments Microsoft is making in tree plantations as a way to offset its emissions.[4] The Dutch agribusiness lender Rabobank is another source of carbon credits for the tech company. It too is acquiring land in Brazil for tree plantations, in this instance with a local agribusiness family with a track record of illegal deforestation and fraud.[5] But most of the carbon credits Rabobank sells to Microsoft are from its programme to plant trees on the lands of small coffee and cacao growers in Latin America, Africa and Asia. This programme, called Acorn, uses satellites and a Microsoft digital platform to measure the number and size of shade trees that small farmers plant on their farms and then calculate the carbon they’ve removed from the atmosphere. It then sells the carbon to Microsoft as “carbon credits” for about US$38 a piece, taking a 20% cut for itself and its local partner, and paying farmers what’s left of the proceeds.[6] A big problem with Rabobank’s scheme, identified in an investigation of its project with cacao farmers in Côte d’Ivoire, is that it is vastly overestimating the carbon removed — in this case by 600%![7] What’s more, the Côte d’Ivoire government says Rabobank is likely double dipping as its project overlaps with a World Bank-funded scheme that has already generated and sold carbon credits from trees planted on small cacao farms in the same area. All of this “nonsense”, as Gates calls it, has not stopped an increasing number of corporations, governments and billionaires — not to mention a new industry of climate consultants and carbon brokers — from promoting the idea that emissions from fossil fuels can and should be offset by planting trees or other crops that sequester carbon. Such projects have a chequered history that goes back to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, but they really only took off after the 2016 Paris Climate Agreement, when governments endorsed the notion of offsets and carbon markets as an effective means to get corporations to cut their emissions.[8] Today, most offset projects are in the so-called “voluntary market”, where private companies from the global North manage the certification and sale of carbon credits to corporations that want to show they are taking action to deal with climate change. The projects, largely in the global South, can be for anything from the distribution of clean cook stoves in Malawi to the preservation of rainforests in Indonesia. The premise is that the project either prevents emissions that would have occurred without it, or that it leads to the removal of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. Cook stoves and rainforest preservation are examples of emissions avoidance. Planting trees, on the other hand, is the most popular form of removal. In a 2024 study, the World Rainforest Movement (WRM) says that the number of tree planting projects for carbon credits has tripled over the past three years.[9] WRM says the surge is partly driven by the large number of high-profile scandals in emissions avoidance schemes, known as “REDD+”.[10] Numerous projects to preserve forests have been withdrawn or suspended from carbon markets after investigations showed they were based on implausible stories about the threat of deforestation or that they caused human rights violations and other harms to local communities. As a result, WRM says corporations are turning their attention to tree planting as a source of “high-integrity” carbon credits. This is now spawning a mad rush to secure lands where trees can be planted. Activists and scientists have been warning for years that schemes to offset carbon emissions by planting trees or other crops would lead to a surge in land grabbing, especially in the global South.[11] These warnings are now proving true. GRAIN combed through the various registries of carbon offset projects to try and get a better sense of this new land grab and how it is unfolding. We identified 279 large-scale tree and crop planting projects for carbon credits that corporations have initiated since 2016 in the global South. They cover over 9.1 million hectares of land — an area roughly the size of Portugal. (See Box 1: What’s included and what’s not included in the land deal dataset) The deals (view the dataset here) add up to a massive new form of land grabbing that will only increase conflicts and pressures over land that are still simmering from the last global land grab spree that erupted in 2007-8 in the wake of global food and financial crises. They also signify that new sources of money are now flowing into the coffers of companies specialised in taking lands from communities in the South to enrich and serve corporations, mainly in the North. Box 1: What’s included and what’s not included in the land deal dataset What’s in? Our data covers projects from all the major voluntary offset project registries. These are: American Carbon Registry (ACR), Climate Action Reserve (CAR), Gold Standard (GS), Verra (VCS), BioCarbono (BC), Cercarbono (CV) and Plan Vivo (PV). It also includes cases on the website farmlandgrab.org that are not yet found in the registries. The projects in our dataset are limited to projects that: – involve the large-scale planting of crops and/or tree species on a combined area of land over 100 ha for the purpose of producing carbon credits; – are driven by companies from outside the communities; – were initiated since 2016 and up to 31 March 2024 (roughly post-Paris Agreement); and – are located in the global South. The projects involve either 1) the creation of large-scale plantations or 2) contract production with small farmers. But all the projects bind the use of the land to the terms of the project for 20 years or more. What’s not in? REDD+ projects, which aim to avoid deforestation, are not included. Some types of projects that produce carbon credits through tree planting or agriculture on large areas of land are not included either. These are: – projects to manage pasture lands, which affect the access to lands and traditional practices of pastoralists; – projects to restore or create mangroves, where large areas of coastline are taken over for the planting of mangrove trees; and, – projects which generate carbon credits by enrolling farmers to implement agricultural practices that are said to build up carbon in the soils, often called “carbon farming”. These projects are extremely important and can have equally severe impacts on communities, including land grabbing, but they are not covered here to keep the dataset manageable.[12] Our data also does not cover projects located in the global North, such as in New Zealand, Scotland and Australia, where national schemes that endorse tree planting for carbon offsets have led to a displacement in food production and undermined farmers’ access to land.[13] To date, 52 countries in the global South have been targeted by these projects. Half the projects are in just four countries: China, India, Brazil and Colombia, which are developing their own industries of carbon project developers. But projects in these countries account for less than a third of the total land area involved. The most affected region, in terms of land area, is Africa, with projects covering over 5.2 million hectares.[14] Many of the projects involve land deals to set up giant eucalyptus, acacia or bamboo plantations. Typically, these are pasture lands or savannahs that were used until now by local communities for grazing livestock or growing food. . . The money that investors plan to capture from these deals is immense. The projects we pulled from the Verra and Gold Standard registries alone will generate 2.5 billion carbon credits (1 credit = 1 tonne of CO2 removed) over their lifetime. With an average price of about US$10 per credit, that adds up to a potential bounty of US$25 billion.[15] While these projects are exclusively set up in rural areas with extremely low emissions per capita, it is quite the opposite when it comes to the companies orchestrating the projects. With the exception of what’s happening in India and China, most carbon projects are led by foreign companies in rich countries with atrocious emissions records — such as the Netherlands, the US, Singapore, Switzerland, the UK, France, Germany and the UAE.[16] There is a clear colonial dynamic at work, with companies and big NGOs from the North once again using the lands of communities in the global South for their own agendas and their own benefit. . GRAIN and UChicago Data Science Institute (click here for better resolution) . A good number of actors driving this new wave of land grabs are in fact repeat offenders from the global farmland grab that took off a decade and a half ago. This is especially the case in Africa. (See Box 3: Africa’s land grabbers are back in business) There are also several companies from the forestry sector with histories of land grabbing and conflicts with local communities. Much of the vast eucalyptus plantations of Brazilian paper giant Suzano, for example, which is involved in three large-scale carbon plantation projects, have been grabbed from Brazil’s indigenous and traditional peoples.[17] And a non-negligible number of project developers have records of illegal dealings and financial scandal. They include: The money being hustled by these carbon cowboys comes mainly from the world’s most polluting corporations, who are interested in buying carbon credits to greenwash their emissions. At the top of the list of credit buyers are fossil fuel companies (See Box 4: Tree planting for oil pumping). But there are also tech giants like Meta and Apple, food companies like Danone and Coca-Cola, and supermarket chains like Mercado Libre and Carrefour. Amazon and the philanthropic arms of its billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos, are heavily involved, too. Bezos both buys credits and funds the NGOs and companies running the plantations, through initiatives like the AFR100 fund, which aims to plant trees on 100 million hectares in Africa.[23] The same goes for development banks, like FMO of the Netherlands, the US International Development Finance Corporation or the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation, which provide cheap loans, political risk insurance and even equity investments to many carbon plantation companies. Box 2: Carbon colonialism On 15 April 2022, a group of about 150 farmers gathered outside the operations of Belgian supermarket Colruyt. Standing behind wheel barrows of soil, the farmers accused the company of “stealing lands” by buying up hundreds of hectares of the country’s scarce farmland, ironically as part of a campaign to buy local. “Each piece of land that Colruyt buys is a piece of land taken away from Belgian family farms,” they said.[24] Far away, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the supermarket chain is also acquiring land, but for decidedly not “local” reasons. In 2021, Colruyt got a 25-year, 10,656 ha concession in Kwango province — about 50 times the size of its Belgian farmlands. It plans to establish tree plantations to offset its emissions on these lands, which are currently used by local people for food crops, and to hire security guards to protect the trees from villagers and their “slash and burn” agriculture.[25] In neighbouring Uganda, the Swedish hamburger chain Max is also buying credits from a carbon plantation project, but with a different approach. Rather than displacing local farmers, it gets them to plant trees on their own lands. Participating farmers sign a contract stating that they will plant and maintain trees, get seedlings and a little training, and submit to periodic checks. In return, they get payments for the carbon credits bought by Max to offset its hamburgers. But when a team of journalists from the Swedish media site Aftonbladet visited the farmers in early 2024 they found a horror show.[26] The farmers said they had planted the trees as they were told, not knowing that these trees were offsetting a corporation’s pollution. Things started off fine, but the trees are fast growing and quickly started taking over their fields, sucking up all the sunlight, nutrients and water. The US$100 a year in payments from carbon credits did not cover the loss of food and income from their crops. Eight years into the project, the Swedish media crew found farmers starving — and some were chopping down the trees despite threats of prison for breach of contract by the project proponent. “I used to be something called a model farmer,” says Samuel Byarugaba, one of the farmers. “People came to me to learn about farming and I was proud to show our farm. We had enough food to feed ourselves and could sell the surplus. Now it’s all disappeared.” Corporations from the financial sector are also starting to get involved — a worrying sign that much more money could be mobilised. Rabobank and BTG Pactual are leading examples of financial players establishing specialised funds to invest in carbon plantations on behalf of pension funds, billionaires, sovereign wealth funds, university endowments, development banks and other institutional investors. Their investment in carbon plantations dovetails with the landholdings that many of these actors have already amassed through timber and farm land investments.[27] The Renewable Resources Group, for instance, is a US private equity firm whose investors include Goldman Sachs and the Harvard University endowment. It specialises in “monetising” water by buying up land in parts of the world where it can get access to cheap irrigation to produce high value crops for export, like grapes and berries. It has already acquired over 100,000 ha of agricultural lands in parts of Mexico, the US, Chile and Argentina where there are water scarcity issues.[28] Recently it established a “nature-based solutions” division through which it acquired the German-based private equity fund 12Tree. Since 2017, 12Tree has acquired 20,000 ha in Latin America and Africa to establish “regenerative” farms where it plants trees and generates carbon credits.[29] One big difference between earlier land grabs for food production and today’s land grab for carbon offsets is that the carbon deals are “certified”. Verra and Gold Standard, two of the top certifiers, are paid large sums of money to ensure that offset projects are done in consultation with local communities, avoid displacing them and even provide them with some benefits. It’s the kind of system that agencies like the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation and the World Bank have long claimed would solve the ills of the global farmland grab. Yet, our dataset and the growing number of investigations by academics, media and civil society into projects certified by these companies put the lie to such claims.[30] How could anyone expect that a market premised on acquiring lands from rural and indigenous communities in the global South, for the benefit of corporations in the global North, could amount to anything other than a massive land grab? No benefit-sharing mechanism, often baked into these carbon deals, alters that outcome. Box 3: Africa’s land grabbers are back in business The rush for land that followed the food and financial crises of 2007-8 hit Africa hard. Hundreds of communities were displaced from their lands to make way for large-scale industrial farms. Yet, even though many of these farms failed badly, the communities are still struggling to get back their lands.[31] Some culprits in that land rush (and near cousins) are now trying to get lands for carbon plantations. Below are some examples. Gagan Gupta: As President of agribusiness giant Olam International, this Singaporean businessman oversaw the company’s 300,000 ha land deal in Gabon in 2011 to build Africa’s largest oil palm plantation. The operation has been mired in conflicts with communities ever since. Now Gupta is running a UAE-based tree plantation company, Sequoia Plantation, which is in the process of securing 200,000 ha in Togo, Gabon and the Republic of the Congo for large-scale tree plantations with carbon offset components, despite protests from affected communities.[32] Kevin Godlington: This UK businessman orchestrated several failed large-scale land deals in Sierra Leone. One was an oil palm plantation in the District of Port Loko that cleared forest and displaced people from their lands before it went bankrupt. Undeterred, Godlington is now going after the same lands with a new venture listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange that claims to have lease rights to 57,000 ha to plant trees for carbon credits, some of which have already been bought by British Petroleum. As with the first round of land deals, no matter how things pan out, Godlington has already pocketed millions of dollars from the scheme.[33] Carter Coleman: This UK businessman built the infamous Kilombero Plantation Limited rice farm on 5,818 ha of contested community lands in the heart of Tanzania’s Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor. Despite heavy backing from foreign development banks and investors, it went bankrupt in 2019. Coleman is now back with a new company called Udzungwa Corridor Limited that will generate carbon credits by planting “rare tropical hardwoods” on a 7,500 ha stretch of land leased from local farmers along the Kilombero Nature Reserve.[34] Andrea Tozzi: This Italian businessman, CEO of his family’s company Tozzi Green, acquired 11,000 ha of land in three communes in the Ihorombe region of Madagascar in 2012 and 2018 to grow the biofuel crop jatropha. That project failed, and the company switched to growing maize for animal feed and essential oil crops. All the while the communities have been fighting to get their lands back, which they say they need to graze their cattle and grow food for their families. Tozzi is now trying to save his project by replacing the maize with plantations of acacia and eucalyptus for carbon credits — which communities, especially those in Ambatolahy, are still firmly resisting. [35] Karl Kirchmayer: This Austrian businessman, who spent years buying up 147,000 ha of farmlands in Eastern Europe, now has an African land grab venture, ASC Impact. It is partnering with a Senior Advisor to the President of Uganda and a Dubai businessman close to the royal family to sell 60 million tons of carbon credits to UAE companies from mangrove and tree plantation projects, mainly in Africa. ASC Impact is currently negotiating for 27,000 ha in Ethiopia, 25,000 in Angola and 270,000 in the Republic of the Congo! Frank Timis: This Romanian-Swiss businessman is the founder and majority shareholder of African Agriculture Holdings Inc, a US company listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange, that took over 25,000 ha of lands from a failed Italian company that local communities in Senegal have been fighting to get back for over a decade. His company is also responsible for the largest land deal in our database — a ridiculous pair of 49-year leases covering 2.2 million ha in Niger, where the company will produce carbon credits by planting pine trees. And while nine million hectares is already too much, things could get much worse. The UN climate negotiations are moving towards establishing an international carbon trading mechanism that would allow heavy polluting country governments and their companies to offset national emissions through deals for carbon projects in other countries, mainly in the global South.[36] If and when this happens, the value of carbon credits could surge, generating even higher demand for land to plant trees. Pressure is also coming from efforts to establish markets for biodiversity offsets, which will trigger a feeding frenzy among investors eager to make a buck from the territories of small farmers, indigenous peoples and pastoralists.[37] The idea that planting trees or other means of generating carbon credits can compensate for fossil fuels emissions is a dangerous distraction, incompatible with the real cuts to emissions that are required to deal with the climate crisis.[38] Consider, for instance, that even if the dubious emission removal estimates of the 279 projects in our dataset were true, they would only amount to 55 million tonnes of CO2 per year– not nearly enough to even cover last year’s 90 million tonne increase in global CO2 emissions from fossil fuels.[39] Social movements and organisations need to be relentless in exposing these contradictions, harms and frauds. We also need to get more information to the communities on the ground. They are often confused by what the project proponents tell them and not exposed about what other communities have experienced. They are almost never informed about how the projects are designed to enable big corporations to keep polluting and how this pollution is connected to the terrible impacts they are suffering from climate change. The hype about the money to be made, under the misnomer of benefit sharing, can create divisions within communities and draw some families into signing contracts they may soon regret. As all these carbon projects are premised on formal land ownership, they can also undermine community systems of land management. There are already cases where communities have faced violence and intimidation for resisting carbon offset projects and this is only going to escalate. It is therefore becoming increasingly urgent to share information and experiences about the carbon grabs – locally, nationally, regionally and internationally — so we can put a stop to them. The double threat to communities – both from climate change itself and from these criminal solutions to it — should not be allowed to play out. Box 4: Tree planting for oil pumping In September 2023, the oil company Shell shocked carbon markets when it abruptly cancelled plans to plant trees on 12 million hectares of land by 2030 – an area three times the size of its home country, the Netherlands.[40] There wasn’t much to celebrate, however, as the company also scrapped plans to reduce oil production.[41]It’s not clear if Shell was backing out entirely from the carbon offset industry, either. Shell still owns a controlling stake in a Dutch biodiesel company seeking to generate carbon credits by planting pongamia on 120,000 ha in Paraguay. Shell’s European cohorts have not yet lost their enthusiasm for carbon plantations. Italy’s Eni has a biofuel venture pursuing carbon credits in Kenya contracting farmers to grow croton plants on an initial 40,000 ha. British Petroleum (BP) paid Canada’s Carbon Done Right US$2.5 million earlier this year for carbon credits from a 57,000 ha tree plantation project the company is pursuing in Sierra Leone. And the French oil company TotalEnergies has a massive 38,000 ha acacia plantation project to offset its emissions in the Republic of the Congo. Investigations into all three projects point to severe impacts on local farmers.[42] Two of Japan’s top energy firms are also deep into carbon offset plantations. Marubeni has a 31,000 ha pine and eucalyptus plantation project in Angola with an Argentinian businessman.[43] Mitsui, through its Australian subsidiary New Forests, is erecting tree plantations for carbon credits on leased farmlands in northern Tasmania and, through its African Forestry Impact Platform, it recently acquired Green Resources AS, “a Norwegian plantation forestry and carbon credit company notorious for its history of land grabbing, human rights violations, and environmental destruction across Uganda, Mozambique, and Tanzania”.[44] * Click the share button below to email/forward this article to your friends and colleagues.

Title: BlackRock Buys Massive Amount of Bitcoin
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/blackrock-buys-massive-amount-of-bitcoin-3637037
Time Published: 2024-09-27T18:00:24Z
Full Content:
U.Today - As recently reported by Arkham Intelligence, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) - the giant hedge fund with over $10 trillion in assets under management - bought more Bitcoin (BTC) this week than any ETF issuer has sold in the past three weeks. The purchases were made for BlackRock's own IBIT spot Bitcoin ETF and totaled the equivalent of $388.19 million over the past four days. As of today, the hedge fund's total cryptocurrency holdings amount to 362,193 BTC, or the equivalent of $23.79 billion. For comparison, this is over 100,000 BTC more than the amount held by the nearest competitor, Grayscale. There is no mystery behind such groundbreaking activity from BlackRock's side toward the major cryptocurrency. As the fund's head of digital assets recently revealed, for them, Bitcoin is not a risky gamble, but rather a scarce, global, decentralized, nonsovereign asset that has no country risk and no traditional counterparty risk. From the perspective of a $10 trillion asset management firm, BTC is more like digital gold than a beta to the NASDAQ and tech stocks in general. BlackRock's interest in cryptocurrencies does not end there, however, as the fund recently launched its spot Ethereum ETF solution. These ETFs have not seen the same hype as those focused on Bitcoin, but the number of ETH in BlackRock's wallet is growing regardless. It remains to be seen if we will see the appropriate level of acceptance for Ethereum from the financial giant, but at least the trend seems to be there.

MNTN, a connected TV advertising platform that counts Hollywood star Ryan Reynolds as its chief creative officer, has picked Morgan Stanley to work on an initial public offering, according to people familiar with the matter. The firm is considering going public as soon as in early 2025, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information isn’t public. Deliberations are ongoing, details of the offering such as timing could change and more banks may be added to the lineup, the people said. A representative for Morgan Stanley declined to comment. An MNTN spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. MNTN builds advertising software that helps brands promote themselves through campaigns on connected TVs. Its MNTN Performance TV platform offers a suite of targeting, measurement and automated optimization technology, according to its website. The company acquired Reynolds’ creative agency Maximum Effort in 2021. The terms of the deal were not disclosed. MNTN raised $119 million in a Series D financing round in 2021 co-led by funds and accounts managed by BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Management & Research Co., which together invested about $110 million, according to a statement at the time. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Lack of sufficient computing power and AI chips limits AI advances, but OpenAI CEO Sam Altman reportedly has an "audacious plan" to bypass these issues. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. While Generative AI allows significant tech corporations like OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google to tap into new and unexplored opportunities, it demands a ridiculous computing power and cooling water. Reports indicate that the world could be on the brink of the most significant technological breakthrough with AI, but there won't be enough electricity to power its advances by 2025. Google and Microsoft consume more electricity than 100 countries to power their AI advances. Last year, we learned that Microsoft Copilot and ChatGPT use up to 1 bottle of water for cooling per query. Recent research by the University of California further built on this premise, revealing that OpenAI's GPT-4 model (often considered mildly embarrassing at best) consumes up to three water bottles to generate a mere 100 words. OpenAI and Microsoft have openly highlighted their plans to address some of the issues preventing further advancement in AI, including investing $100 billion in a new project dubbed Stargate to free themselves from an overreliance on NVIDIA for AI chips. Microsoft recently partnered with BlackRock to raise $100 billion to 'emancipate themselves from the shackles' of insufficient power and increase data centers for their ambitious AI dreams. Aside from looking at nuclear fusion as an alternative power source for AI advances, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has reportedly been curating an "audacious plan" to address the firm's computing power needs (via The New York Times). These plans are closely tied to investors in the United Arab Emirates and chip makers in Asia. According to sources with knowledge of Altman's ambitions, he reportedly pitched a multitrillion-dollar plan to investors, which would help build chip fabs and data centers worldwide. These plans would set OpenAI in a unique position to push its AI advances to the next level with unlimited computing power. As you may know, investors in the AI landscape recently raised concern over Microsoft's spending on AI efforts after its latest earnings call, citing difficulty in establishing a clear path to profitability in the category. Interesting;y, market analysts and experts claim OpenAI's reported bankruptcy claims in the next few months, with projections of $5 billion losses, are part of any startup's growing curve. With Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Apple lining up to participate in the ChatGPT maker's latest round of funding, pushing its market capitalization to over $150 billion, OpenAI could become the world's dominant AI company, given its unique enterprise and consumer position. As part of Sam Altman's plan to develop next-gen AI models, he'd require the United Arab Emirates to fund his ambitions by building multiple chip-making plants worldwide that cost up to $43 billion each. This plan would allow chipmakers like NVIDIA to meet the high demand for AI chips, especially in the Emirates, which has access to electrical power. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. To put Altman's plans into perspective, he told TSMC executives that it would "take $7 trillion and many years to build 36 semiconductor plants and additional data centers to fulfill his vision." According to a TMSC spokesman, the company is open to discussing expanding semiconductor development. However, it's more concerned about its current global expansion projects. TSMC execs reportedly found Altman's ambitions for AI absurd, branding him a "podcasting bro." An OpenAI spokesman responded to the claims that OpenAI pitches multi-trillion-dollar projects by refuting them and indicating that the firm isn't considering following that path for its AI ventures. What OpenAI is specifically exploring is on the scale of hundreds of billions," the spokesman added.

The rally comes amid market optimism driven by the Fed's rate cut, economic stimulus in China and sustained demand from institutional players in the US. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitcoin (BTC) surged past $66,000 on Sept. 27 as New York opened for trading, reaching a two-month high to record its best September performance on record. The rally comes amid economic stimulus measures in China and the US Federal Reserve policy decision to cut interest rates, which have helped sustain recent market optimism. The surge is also driven by sustained institutional demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs. According to CryptoSlate data, Bitcoin was trading at $66,200 as of press time after bears failed to pull the price back to lower levels immediately after the surge. However, the ensuing trading hours have seen subdued momentum, with a pullback to retest support at $65,000 likely in the coming hours. Institutional demand played a significant role in Bitcoin’s latest rally, with major asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity Investments recording significant increases in their holdings following the rate cuts. Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw inflows of $365 million this week, the highest in over two months, indicating a sustained appetite from investors seeking exposure to the digital asset. The demand for Bitcoin ETFs has surged as investors seek alternatives to traditional assets amidst economic uncertainty. Many institutions are positioning themselves ahead of potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts expected later this year. Several other institutional players have followed suit, with hedge funds and pension funds increasing their allocations to Bitcoin amid a broader search for yield and diversification. The appeal of Bitcoin as a store of value has strengthened as inflationary concerns grow and traditional assets such as bonds deliver lower returns. The upward pressure on Bitcoin’s price has also been supported by developments in China, where a wave of economic stimulus measures has boosted confidence in global markets. The Shanghai Composite Index recorded its best week since 2008, providing further momentum for Bitcoin’s rally. The digital asset has mirrored these gains, rising over 3% week-to-date, as capital flows from both institutional investors and favorable macroeconomic conditions continue to push its value higher. As traders speculate on the possibility of another Fed rate cut in November, optimism has grown across global markets, with the S&P 500 reaching new highs alongside Bitcoin’s rise. The CME Group’s FedWatch Tool places the odds of another 50-basis-point cut at 52%, boosting hopes of further liquidity in the market. Lower interest rates are seen as favorable for Bitcoin and other risk assets, as they reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets and inject more liquidity into financial markets. With institutional demand remaining robust and macroeconomic conditions continuing to evolve in favor of risk assets, Bitcoin’s strong September performance could pave the way for further gains in October, a month historically positive for the crypto market. Analysts remain bullish, with some pointing to familiar patterns of strong price action following periods of institutional accumulation. As economic uncertainty persists and both central bank policies and global financial markets remain in flux, Bitcoin’s recent price movement highlights its evolving role as a key player in the financial landscape. At the time of press 6:32 pm UTC on Sep. 27, 2024, Bitcoin is ranked #1 by market cap and the price is up 0.69% over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin has a market capitalization of $1.3 trillion with a 24-hour trading volume of $34.61 billion.

Title: Dell says sales team must work on-site 5 days a week to drive productivity
URL: https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/09/dell-says-sales-team-must-work-on-site-5-days-a-week-to-drive-productivity/
Time Published: 2024-09-27T17:37:57Z
Full Content:
Most members of Dell’s sales team will no longer have the option to work remotely, starting on Monday, Reuters reported this week, citing an internal memo. The policy applies to salespeople worldwide and is aimed at helping “grow skills,” per the note. Like the rest of Dell's workforce, Dell's salespeople have previously been allowed to work remotely two days per week. A memo, which a Reddit user claims to have posted online (The Register reported that the post “mirrors” one that it viewed separately), says that field sellers aren’t required to go into an office but “should prioritize time spent in person with customers and partners.” The policy doesn’t apply to “remote sales team members,” but Dell said to expect additional unspecified communications regarding remote workers “in the coming weeks.” Bloomberg reported that top sales executives Bill Scannell, Dell’s president of global sales and customer operations, and John Byrne, president of sales and global regions at Dell Tech Select, signed the memo, saying: … our data showed that sales teams are more productive when onsite. Dell is viewing mandatory on-site work as a way to maintain its sales team’s culture and drive growth, according to the memo, which mentions things like “real-time feedback” and “dynamic" office energy. Moving forward, remote work will be permitted as an exception, Dell said. Notably, the letter, which was reportedly sent to workers on Thursday, doesn’t give employees much time for adjustments. The memo acknowledges that workers have built schedules around working from home regularly but doesn’t offer immediate solutions. In a statement to The Register, a Dell spokesperson confirmed the policy change. “We continually evolve our business so we’re set up to deliver the best innovation, value and service to our customers and partners," they said. "That includes more in-person connection to drive market leadership." After permitting full-time remote work in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in February, Dell started requiring workers to go into the office 39 days per quarter (or about three days per week) or be totally remote. The latter, however, seemed discouraged, as Dell reportedly told remote workers they were ineligible for promotions in March. Still, nearly 50 percent of Dell workers chose to stay remote, Business Insider reported in June, citing internal Dell Data. Dell’s return-to-office (RTO) mandates have reportedly been enforced with VPN and badge tracking. Some employees have accused Dell of trying to reduce headcount with RTO policies. Other companies pushing workers back into offices have also been accused of this; there’s research showing that at least some companies have used RTO policies to lower headcount while avoiding layoffs. Dell laid off 13,000 people in 2023 and plans more layoffs. In August, it announced plans to lay off an undisclosed additional number of people. The company is expected to have 120,000 employees. Dell’s RTO change follows an announcement this week requiring Amazon employees to work on-site five days a week starting next year. Following the announcement, a survey of 2,585 US Amazon employees found that 73 percent of Amazon workers are “considering looking for an another job” in response. The memo, according to Reddit, acknowledges to workers, “Yes, this is a shift from current expectations.” Dell’s RTO push represents an about-face from previously stated positions on remote work from the company. In 2022, for example, CEO and founder Michael Dell wrote a blog that said Dell “found no meaningful differences” between remote and on-site workers, including before the pandemic. Dell COO Jeff Clarke made similar arguments in 2020. The idea that remote work hinders productivity has been a hot topic of debate, especially as companies grapple with their remote work policies following pandemic restrictions. Dell says that its decision to force sales workers back into offices is backed by data, and its claims of boosted productivity could potentially be true when it comes to this specific Dell division. However, there have also been studies suggesting that return-to-office mandates hurt productivity. For example, a Great Place to Work survey conducted in July 2023 of 4,400 employees concluded that “productivity was lower for both on-site and remote employees when their employer mandated where they work.” Workers with companies allowing employees to choose between remote and on-site work were more likely to give “extra effort," the survey found.

Title: Leaders That Mislead – Manipulators and the Manipulated

In modern times, governments joined at the hip with the ‘world order’ of mega-corporations and mega-banks have lost sight of what is actually needed for the wellbeing of the population. For decades, various ‘world order’ type policies emanating from the likes of the United Nations (UN) and the World Economic Forum (WEF); and debt-packages emanating from private international banking have been adopted by national governments Worldwide supposedly for the wellbeing of the populace. We are told this is to save us: However, these policies and economic ‘bailouts’ that were launched are more like chains around the neck, or ‘boats of stone’ that are slowly sinking, taking the general populace down with them. This is evident in policies that affect the lives of almost everyone on the planet. Policies that invariably mean you have to pay for the ‘fixing of the latest concocted problem’, via a new tax, a new regulation, or a change in your freedom or lifestyle. Take for example policies based on the bogus science of CO2-induced or methane-induced climate change; including the nonsense that dairy farmers must reduce cow numbers to combat climate change (i.e. reduce methane emissions). As more small farmers go bankrupt due to increased expense and regulation, mega-corporations buy more land and increase their control of the food system, unleashing more genetically-modified foods, while local farming, local resilience suffers. Who can forget the fake Covid-19 pandemic, the lockdowns and mass injurious vaccination that ensued, see also the book No Worries No Virus. Then there is the ongoing deceptive United Nations Sustainable Developments Goals involving Agenda 2030, which dictates how the entire world population should live their lives, and which ideologies they must accept. See also this article. There is also the fact that the Energy Returned on Energy Invested (EROEI) for solar and wind energy is too low to be viable in most locations and scenarios, and therefore to repurpose and rebuild the world energy and industrial system to de-carbonise the economy is a waste of vast amounts of fossils fuels (no wonder the sector seeks subsidies). Despite decades of government subsidies wind power provides less than 5% of the world’s energy, and solar just 1%. Another deception is in relation to electric cars, see also the article Electric Cars are Fake Environmentalism. Electric cars are still driven by electricity produced from fossil fuels and will most likely continue to be. The manufacture of potentially hundreds of millions of new electric cars and electric car batteries involves a continuation of widespread mining and processing of rare earth metals, such as lithium, rhodium and cobalt, which are a limited resource. The mining and processing of rare earth metals has been shown to be polluting to land, air, and water systems, such as rivers. Furthermore, there are even instances of electric cars going on fire and exploding, due to battery issues or short circuits, see these videos The Shocking Truth About EV Fires You Need to Know and How to Survive an Exploding Electric Car. Society has also experienced decades of economic trickery via debt money banking, as well as fake science or perverse ideology being taught in schools worldwide, etc. Europe and the western world has also been subject to decades of increasingly unvetted mass immigration, and masses of so-called asylum seekers being funded and planted into European countries from faraway countries where there is no war at all. What could possibly go wrong? See also this article describing the conflict Over Hundreds of ‘Unvetted Migrant’ Centres Being Planted Throughout Ireland and the UK. For more details on these hoaxes and deceptions see also the books available here on the Reality Distinguished From Illusion website. The boats of stones are built by ulteriors hidden from the public eye, and launched by unelected institutions such as the UN and the World Economic Forum. Then big-salaried national and international politicians (‘Yes’ men of the institutional moneyocracy) tell the public they must climb aboard the stone boats or drown. (Who can forget the Covid lockdown and vaccination mandates purported to save us all from impending death). Upon closer inspection, one can see that the underside of the boat is made of stone, however, hardly anyone wants to dive into the water and look underneath the boat, because everyone else is walking up the gangway, and a loudspeaker is blaring “Come aboard – get your free vaccination here, and we have great finance deals on new electric cars”. “Leaders who have fallen into ignorance and who mislead people by directing them to the path of destruction are in effect, boarding a stone boat, and so too are those whose who blindly follow them… those who mislead people go to hell… humanity must first give up false leaders who present boats of stone” – Ancient Vedic scripture (Srimad Bhagavatam Canto 6 Chapter 7 Text 14, translated from Sanskrit by Srila Prabhupada) While the mega-corporate elites enact material or political power plays that advance their economic domination and political power, much of the general populace becomes more confused, weakened, poverty stricken, controlled or frustrated by endless regulations or government policies. Yet, many are, understandably, reluctant to jump off the boat, or do not know how to swim, i.e. few people know how to live independently of the government and corporate ‘system’. Thus, almost everyone is dependent on the increasingly authoritarian and restrictive government ‘system’ that has been imposed upon them. I spoke with a local farmer recently who tells me he spends so much time doing nonsensical paperwork and spending money to meet ridiculous regulations that the profession is hardly worth his time anymore, and none of sons would consider taking on such a time- and labour-intensive profession. However, not all the people are fooled or manipulated by the manipulators. Those with a stronger consciousness see through the lies. Nothing significant occurs by chance in a corporate-controlled world. Without money, planning and organisation, none of the above events would be possible. It is a question of power. There are those who manipulate to advance a certain agenda or self interest, and those who allow themselves to be manipulated. This is most effective when the targeted people are not aware they are being manipulated. Voluntary cogs in the machine are easier to deal with than forced ones. Who were the key players or misleaders that promoted the climate crisis hoax? My books CO2 Climate Hoax – How Bankers Hijacked the Real Environment Movement and Transcending the Climate Change Deception Toward Real Sustainability delve into this topic, including the role of the private banking sector, President Obama, Al Gore, various institutions, and academics. Linked to this agenda are the deceptive UN Sustainable Development Goals. Also aligned with UN climate change agenda is the World Economic Forum ‘reset’ agenda that was officially launched in 2020. The WEF reset agenda has been sold as a solution to the fabricated problems of climate change and Covid-19. This is the Hegelian Dialectic tactic: fabricate a problem to be perceived, foster a public reaction, and then provide the solution. The solution is actually the implementation of original objectives that would have faced public resistance, but now the policy or agenda can be implemented publicly as the ‘solution’ to the ‘perceived problem’. Modern day governments subservient to mega-corporations and private mega-banks, rather than the people they are supposed to serve, have also become morally degraded. In modern times, the fabricated matrix of economy, government, banking and corporate power is a reflection of a dominator culture. The entire ‘mainstream reality’ is made up by the so-called elites who own or control the mega-corporate media, mega-banks, and the mega-corporate industry. Via government funded schooling, TV shows, and corporate control of mass media we have been indoctrinated into a type of corporate-communist-consumer culture. We are meant to become dependent on the system, via the work treadmill or social welfare, pay more taxes, and be shackled to debt, rather than become independently self-reliant in our communities and local regions. Self-reliant communities are a threat to the control culture of the socalled ‘powers that be’. Furthermore, we have been trained into accepting that certain aspects of our society are untouchable truths that should not be debated. Life is focused around the pursuit of illusions fed by bogus mantras, such as “we must reach net-zero by 2050”, or “becoming rich will bring you happiness”. The masses are compelled to enter the treadmill of the ‘rat race’ and wake, eat, work, sleep, repeat, die, without ever examining we are actually here on Earth, or what our true purpose in life actually is. Obedience to institutions and ideas, which are not at all what they seem, is ‘expected’. Being manipulated means that one is, unfortunately, part of the manipulation, having accepted that role within a contrived social construction without questioning it. A social construction that twists reality in order to twist you. When we try to change the current system for the better by forming adversarial political movements and seeking votes, however well-intentioned this may be, we are actually playing into a rigged game in which the money masters or so-called elites always win. This is because in current times the entire political democratic system itself is a sham, a sort of punch and judy show for the masses. Notwithstanding the various valid issues facing the populace, both the so-called left and so-called right of the political spectrum are also to a large extent manifestations of a divide and conquer strategy. When one follows the money one may see that both ‘sides’ are typically controlled, funded by, or beholden to, the same orthodoxy of money masters, private bankers, or financial elites that control the economy and the debt money system itself. In the U.S., this was exemplified when President Obama, a Democrat, administered over a massive bailout of private banks (read orchestrated muti-trillion transfer to private banks) in 2010; and then President Trump, a Republican, administered a multi-trillion bailout (wealth transfer to asset management corporation Blackrock) in 2020, under cover of a fake pandemic. In reality both are beholden to, not the voters, but to a private banking cabal. The books Demonic Economics and Transcending the Climate Change Deception also cover this topic. Furthermore, President Obama has been a champion of the Climate CO2 Hoax; and President Trump has been a champion and supporter of the Covid-19 vaccines, which have been injurious to many people. Injuries due to vaccination are documented in many articles including this article by Professor Michel Chossudovsky The Covid “Killer Vaccine”; and in my book No Worries No Virus. While politicians pay well scripted lip service to their respective voter bases with powerful scripted speeches and sound bites, the voters, understandably desperate for a hero, are led to believe if their party can just win the next election then everything will be change. Meanwhile, ‘behind the scenes’ ulteriors that have the actual political power implement their plans to shape society, regardless of which party gets elected. The elections are just window dressing, or a mirage of change. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article to your friends and colleagues.

Title: Hedge Funds Think NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) Is The Best Most Active Stock To Buy Now

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Most Active Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other active stocks. The economic landscape is currently marked by mixed signals. The Fed has indicated the potential for additional rate cuts due to weaknesses in the manufacturing sector, despite signs of recovery. While the overall economy remains strong, currency dynamics have shifted, with the US dollar weakening and the euro strengthening. Interest rate yields have fluctuated, suggesting potential changes in investor sentiment. Amidst this complex environment, the Dow continues to hover near record highs, reflecting cautious optimism among market participants. As stakeholders navigate these developments, they will need to carefully consider how they may influence investment strategies and market behavior in the coming months. CNBC's Rick Santelli recently covered this situation, which we talked about in our article on the 10 Best Performing Stocks in 2024. Here's an excerpt from it: “Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee has indicated that many more rate cuts may be necessary over the next year due to signs of weakness in the manufacturing sector. CNBC’s Rick Santelli, who was reporting on September 23, noted that while manufacturing has faced challenges, there are indications it might be recovering slightly, as evidenced by a recent production increase of 0.8%. He referenced comments.... that the economy is experiencing strong growth and robust consumer spending, which he believed contradicted the concerns raised by Goolsbee. Santelli pointed out that the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently at all-time highs, suggesting that market sentiment remains positive despite underlying economic weaknesses. Further discussing the economic landscape, he remarked on the currency markets, noting that the US dollar has fallen to its lowest level since March 2022. In contrast, the euro has reached its strongest level since April 2022. This shift in currency dynamics reflects broader economic trends...” However, a lot of analysts do not have an opinion as nuanced as that of Santelli. For instance, Michael Kantrowitz, Piper Sandler's chief investment strategist joined CNBC's 'Power Lunch' on September 23 to discuss why smaller businesses and consumers need the benefits from more rate cuts. In a conversation regarding the challenges facing US car manufacturers, it was noted that the biggest threat they encounter is the influx of Chinese automobiles into the US market. This concern contrasted with the insights from the President of the Bank of Chicago, who stated that ongoing rate cuts will continue to benefit smaller businesses and consumers who are currently adjusting to higher interest rates. Kantrowitz emphasized the significant impact that lower interest rates can have on the consumer economy, particularly given the substantial amount of debt tied to credit lines and credit cards. As adjustable-rate mortgages decrease, this easing of financial conditions is expected to be beneficial. Kantrowitz pointed out that before last week, financial conditions had been easing primarily for larger corporations, as evidenced by the S&P 500, which did not require a rate cut. However, small businesses and consumers, who are more closely tied to the prime rate set by banks, had not experienced similar relief until recently. The last report indicated that small businesses were paying an interest rate of 9.5% for 3-month borrowing. This recent easing represents a crucial first step for Main Street, although the strategist believes further cuts are necessary. He noted a broadening market trend following the July 11 CPI report, highlighting that commercial real estate has emerged as one of the best-performing sectors this quarter, alongside utilities and regional banks. However, it was emphasized that while rate cuts can benefit certain areas indirectly, such as those affected by lower tenure rates, they do not necessarily provide direct support. Looking ahead at interest rates, there was speculation about how low they might go in the next year. Kantrowitz suggested that policy rates could indeed fall into the 3% range but cautioned that markets might be overly aggressive in their expectations. The anticipated rise in unemployment will play a critical role in shaping equity and fixed-income markets; however, if unemployment increases at a slow and steady pace, as it has been, it may not pose significant challenges to market stability. Kantrowitz's opinion reflects a cautious optimism regarding economic conditions as stakeholders face uncertain conditions while keeping an eye on interest rates and their broader implications for various sectors within the economy.

We looked at the top 15 stocks to find the ones that were the most popular among elite hedge funds. We then narrowed down our list to the 10 stocks with high trading volumes and that were the most popular among hedge funds. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their trading volumes, as of September 23. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Volume: 120.458 million Average Volume (3-Month): 327.422 million Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 179 NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a technology company that designs, manufactures, and sells graphics processing units (GPUs), artificial intelligence (AI) chips, and other computing technologies. Its GPUs are widely used in gaming, professional visualization, and AI applications, and the company has been a pioneer in the field of GPU computing, with a significant role in the development of AI and deep learning. In FQ2 2025, the company's revenue was 122.40% from a year-ago period. Data center revenue was up 54% year-on-year, driven by strong demand for NVIDIA Hopper, GPU computing, and networking platforms. Cloud service providers contributed ~45% of data center revenue. Partnerships with healthcare institutions and increasing demand for AI-powered solutions in diagnostics have contributed to this strong financial performance. At its GPU Technology Conference earlier this year, the CEO estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion, with a potential total of $1-2 trillion over the next decade. The company won't dominate the entire market, but analysts estimate its market share between 2025 and 2029 will be over $950 billion. Elon Musk's AI startup, xAI, has brought Colossal, an AI training system, online. Powered by 100,000 H100 GPUs from NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Colossal is the most powerful AI training system in the world. Musk plans to double the size of Colossal by shifting to H200 GPUs in the coming months. Blackwell chips, which are even faster and more efficient, could further enhance Colossal's capabilities. The company faces pressure to launch new products to maintain investor confidence. Delays in Blackwell chip production and concerns about high GPU prices impact demand. The company's future success depends on effective AI monetization. By the end of fiscal year 2025, it aims to achieve 100% renewable electricity for its offices and data centers. Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA’s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock’s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia’s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today’s accelerated computing infrastructure.” Overall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the most active stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: WeightWatchers is struggling in the weight loss drug era — and now the CEO is out

WeightWatchers (WW) International said Friday that CEO Sima Sistani is stepping down immediately. She will be replaced by Tara Comonte, a board member and the former CEO of Shake Shack (SHAK), who was appointed as interim chief executive effective immediately. Sistani leaves the parent company of the once popular points-based weight loss program as it faces challenges in adapting to the growing popularity of weight loss drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound. “On behalf of the Board, I want to sincerely thank Sima for her leadership in advancing our strategy, for adding WeightWatchers Clinic to our offerings and for her unwavering commitment to our mission,” Thilo Semmelbauer, chairman of the WeightWatchers board of directors, said in a statement. “We wish her all the best in her future endeavors.” Sistani joined WeightWatchers in 2022 and led the company for about two-and-a-half years. Under her leadership, WeightWatcher acquired the the telehealth platform Sequence and started offering its members the highly-coveted weight loss drugs. But the bet hasn’t seemed to pay off yet. WeightWatchers stock is down more than 90% since the beginning of the year. In August, Sistani revealed that the struggling company would cut $100 million in costs over the next year by streamlining its operations and reducing its workforce, including a 40% cut in positions at the vice president level and above. The news comes at a time when a class of weight loss dugs known GLP-1 treatments have been putting pressure on WeightWatchers. These drugs, which mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar, have shown remarkable effectiveness in treating obesity and type 2 diabetes. Market leaders Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY), the pharmaceutical giants behind popular GLP-1 drugs Wegovy and Zepbound, respectively, have seen their stock prices soar as a result. Novo Nordisk stock has climbed 39% over the past 12 months, while Eli Lilly shares have surged 68%. Media mogul Oprah Winfrey, who has acknowledged taking weight loss drugs, left her spot on the WeightWatchers board earlier this year. She had been a member of the board since 2015. At the time, Winfrey said she was donating all her WeightWatchers shares to the National Museum of African American History and Culture. WeightWatchers said it supported Winfrey’s decision, which it added would “eliminate any perceived conflict of interest around her taking weight loss medications.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: What fueled this week’s record-breaking stock rally | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: The stock market is racking up record highs again. Investors are wasting no time moving into riskier assets from bitcoin to tech stocks after last week’s long-awaited rate cut from the Federal Reserve. Last week, the S&P 500 and Dow surged to new highs after the Fed said it is cutting interest rates by half a point, marking a pivot from the aggressive hiking cycle that brought rates to a 23-year high. CNN’s Fear & Greed Index, which measures seven barometers of market sentiment, is at a “greed” reading. Strong economic data this week has kept the party going. The S&P 500 on Thursday marked its 42nd record high close in 2024, while the Dow marked its 32nd record high close of the year on Friday. All three major indexes notched a positive week. The Dow gained 0.6%, the S&P 500 added 0.6% and the Nasdaq Composite climbed about 1%. The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, showed that the prices consumers paid for goods and services rose 2.2% last month on an annual basis, down from 2.5% in July. The reading was below expectations from economists polled by FactSet, and is a step closer towards the Fed’s 2% inflation target. Related article A dual win for consumers: Inflation cooled last month, paving way for borrowing costs to come down more Fresh data this week has offered further encouragement that the economy is on solid footing. The third estimate for second-quarter gross domestic product showed that the US economy expanded at a solid 3% clip from the prior year. “What seems to be unfolding before our eyes is a soft landing scenario that only the most optimistic could dream of,” wrote Gregory Daco, chief economist of EY, in a Thursday note. A soft landing is a scenario in which inflation comes down without the economy entering a recession. Elsewhere, the average rate on a standard, 30-year fixed mortgage fell to its lowest level since September 2022 this week, according to Freddie Mac data, providing relief for Americans stung by the tough housing market. Applications to refinance a mortgage soared 20% last week from the prior week, according to Mortgage Bankers Association data. The housing market is known for being sensitive to the ebbs and flows of the economy. Investors are now looking to the September labor report due next Friday. Employers added an estimated 142,000 jobs last month, up from July’s dismal number, while the unemployment rate ticked lower, to 4.2%, offering hope that the labor market is weakening but still on solid footing. With the Fed’s focus now squarely on keeping the labor market healthy, Friday’s report will likely offer clues for the Fed’s next move at its November policy meeting. Related article Americans are fretting over the job market Meanwhile, tech shares continued to gain this week on rate cut optimism and strong earnings from Micron. Nvidia shares jumped 4.6%, Tesla shares rose 9.3% and Meta Platforms shares added 1.1%. In China, stocks ripped higher this week after the central bank introduced a package of measures aimed at stimulating its struggling economy, including lowering interest rates. Oil prices fell for the week. The national average price of gas is about $3.21, according to GasBuddy. The Financial Times reported Thursday, citing anonymous sources, that Saudi Arabia is planning to scrap its $100 a barrel price target for oil. Gold futures retreated from a fresh record high reached Thursday, the latest in a string of records it has set this year. Gold has notched repeated record highs this year, driven by central bank buying of the yellow metal and worries about the US economy’s health. Bitcoin popped this week. The price of the cryptocurrency was last trading at about $65,747 a coin. As stocks settle after the trading session, levels might change slightly.

Title: These 5 Stocks Grew More than Bitcoin Over the Last Year
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/stocks-that-grew-more-than-bitcoin-8716756
Time Published: 2024-09-27T15:44:00Z

While Bitcoin's 130% surge grabbed headlines this past year, a select group of stocks outpaced the cryptocurrency behemoth. AppLovin (APP), MakeMyTrip (MMYT), NVIDIA (NVDA), Powell Industries (POWL), and TG Therapeutics (TGTX) all rode waves of market demand to deliver eye-popping returns. These five companies found remarkable success in their sectors, from AI breakthroughs to fronting an industrial boom. Moreover, their stellar performance wasn't just a flash in the pan. Standing behind their stock price increases are robust fundamentals and impressive metrics like revenue growth and return on equity (ROE), which suggest these stocks could keep outshining Bitcoin, one of the most volatile assets. Below, we dig into how they did it. Over the past year, BTC has had one of its best years, more than doubling in price. This was driven by the start of trading for spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), market sentiment, and other major financial catalysts. In late October 2023, BTC pierced the $30,000 level in a rally spurred by anticipation of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approving the spot BTC ETFs. The approval of ETFs from BlackRock and Fidelity significantly increased the institutional demand for BTC, increasing demand for the cryptocurrency. By January 2024, BTC's price surged to $49,000. There was also anticipation for the upcoming BTC halving event. However, the cryptocurrency didn't climb upwards all year. In late January 2024, BTC corrected, dipping 20% to a low of $38,500. This was only a pullback, and by mid-February 2024, the cryptocurrency had rallied past $50,000. The BTC spring halving was another major catalyst for the cryptocurrency, as halving events reduce BTC's supply by cutting mining rewards in half, usually leading to a spike in its price. By mid-March 2024, BTC reached an all-time high of $73,835, fueled by solid demand, particularly from ETFs. Despite this peak, BTC began consolidating, trading between $49,000 and $73,895 for the following months. In the preceding 12 months, the price of Bitcoin rose 150%. The gauges for the stocks selected below are as follows: Below, we discuss the criteria further, but let's get to our analysis first: Among the top performers, APP led the pack with an impressive one-year return of 227.6%, supported by robust revenue growth of 37.3%. NVDA was close on its heels, delivering a 180.7% price return, kickstarted by extraordinary revenue growth of 194.7%. This was primarily thanks to surging demand in AI and data center sectors. TGTX stood out with its remarkable revenue growth of 1,341.6%, though its one-year price return of 160.1% was comparatively modest. POWL Industries and MMYT had consistent performance, with one-year returns of 179.7% and 182.1%, respectively. POWL's growth was particularly noteworthy at 44.8%. Regarding profitability and valuation metrics, NVDA emerged as a leader with an impressive return on equity (ROE) of 123.77% and a strong price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, indicative of its market dominance. TGTX was also quite strong, with a high ROE of 87.8%, though its P/B ratio at 21.0 was more modest. AppLovin's ROE of 70.7% was solid, but its particularly high P/B of 52.2 suggests investors are placing a significant premium on its expected growth. POWL appears lower in risk as a stock, given its P/B of 5.9 and steady ROE of 34.2%. MakeMyTrip rounded out the group with an ROE of 22.2% and a relatively high P/S of 14.4, reflecting a balanced growth trajectory and investors' optimism about its future in the expanding Indian travel market. AppLovin Corporation specializes in mobile app development and marketing products. The company provides a platform where developers can review metrics on their growth, work to increase user engagement, and review their mobile app revenues. AppLovin has demonstrated strong growth, with its stock price increasing by 228% over the past year. Several factors have driven this performance: AppLovin's high P/B ratio suggests that investors are placing a premium on the company's assets, likely because of its strong growth prospects and market position in the mobile app industry. That said, the company is in the highly competitive mobile technology sector. Its suite of tools and strong AI capabilities have positioned it as a leader in helping developers monetize their apps, particularly game developers. Holders of APP shares should be aware of potential risks: Despite these potential drawbacks, AppLovin's recent performance and strategic position have made it a standout in app development, allowing it to outpace even the impressive gains seen in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin over the past year. MakeMyTrip is a major online travel company primarily serving the Indian market. Founded in 2000 and based in Gurgaon, India, the company offers the typically comprehensive range of travel-related services travelers expect from today's major platforms. MakeMyTrip has shown significant growth, with its stock price increasing by 182% over the past year. Several factors have driven this performance: MakeMyTrip is a dominant player in India's online travel space, benefiting from the country's large and growing middle class, increasing internet availability, and rising disposable incomes. The company's strong brand recognition and wide service offerings have helped it maintain a leading position in a competitive market. The company's high P/S and P/B ratios suggest that investors are optimistic about its future growth in the rapidly expanding Indian travel market. However, investors should consider the following risks: Despite these risks, MakeMyTrip's strong market position and the robust growth of India's travel sector have contributed to its impressive stock performance, NVDA is one of the dominant companies producing advanced computer graphics processors, chipsets, and multimedia software. Founded in 1993 and based in Santa Clara, California, the company plays a significant role in AI, autonomous technology, and high-performance computing, helping to shift the evolution of visual computing and AI. NVIDIA has achieved record-breaking quarters recently, which has been driven by several key factors: NVIDIA is dominant in the GPU market, particularly in AI and high-performance computing. The company's technology is driving advances in many industries, including autonomous vehicles, healthcare, and scientific research. However, investors should be aware of potential risks: Despite these risks, NVIDIA's strong market position and growing demand for AI and high-performance computing products have contributed to its exceptional stock performance, outpacing even the significant gains seen in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin over the past year. Powell Industries, Inc., based in Houston, Texas, develops, designs, and manufactures custom-engineered systems and products for the energy and industrial sectors. The company is known for providing engineered products for electrical power infrastructure. Powell Industries has seen significant growth driven by several factors: The company's focus on custom products for critical infrastructure has helped it maintain a competitive edge. However, investors should consider the following risks: Despite these risks, Powell Industries' strong performance in recent quarters and its strategic position in essential infrastructure markets have contributed to its impressive stock performance. TG Therapeutics, Inc., founded in 1993 and based in North Carolina, is a biopharmaceutical company that acquires, develops, and brings to market therapies for B-cell malignancies and autoimmune diseases. TG Therapeutics has had excellent growth, driven by several key factors: The company's focus on novel therapies for B-cell-mediated diseases positions it well in areas where critical medical needs are unmet. However, investors should be aware of the following risks: Despite these risks, TG Therapeutics' recent commercial success and strong pipeline have contributed to its impressive stock performance. In identifying the stocks that outperformed bitcoin in the past year, we used measures that would highlight companies with strong growth potential, financial health, and market performance. By focusing on the key indicators below, we pinpointed stocks that showed both impressive past performance and had the strength in fundamentals to continue their upward trajectory: Market Capitalization Greater Than $300 million (Small Cap and Higher) Companies with the market capitalization described above are established but still have significant potential for growth. Small-cap and mid-cap stocks often outperform larger companies because of their potential for rapid revenue growth while still being large enough to withstand some economic changes. This ensures that the stock is less prone to extreme volatility when compared with microcaps, which can be highly speculative. In addition, larger companies provide more liquidity, making buying and selling shares easier. TTM Revenue Growth More Than 25% Consistent high revenue growth is a crucial indicator of a company's ability to expand its market share, innovate, and meet consumer demand. Revenue growth of more than 25% yoy indicates that the company is rapidly increasing its earnings. Strong revenue growth often leads to growth in earnings and stock price increases. TTM ROE Greater Than 15% ROE measures a company's profitability relative to its equity. An ROE of over 15% is an excellent figure, showing that management effectively turns shareholder equity into profits. High ROE companies are typically well-managed, competitive, and able to reinvest earnings effectively. P/B of 5 and Above A high P/B typically signals that investors are willing to pay a premium for the company's assets because they believe it will continue to generate superior returns. While a lower P/B is considered more value-driven, a higher P/B reflects increased expectations for growth and market confidence in the company's future performance. In high-growth stocks, a P/B of 5 or more suggests the company is well regarded for its potential. 1-Year Performance of More Than 150% A one-year price appreciation of over 150% demonstrates strong momentum, indicating that the stock has significantly outperformed the broader market. High performance over a year is often driven by strong earnings, revenue growth, and positive investor sentiment, all of which are necessary when selecting stocks that could outpace BTC's gains. Investors should focus on strong and consistent revenue growth and profitability metrics such as return on assets and ROE to identify stocks that may outperform cryptocurrencies like BTC. You should also review valuation ratios that show market confidence in future growth, such as high P/E or P/B ratios. Targeting industries with disruptive potential, such as AI or green energy, and selecting stocks with strong momentum and positive analyst reports are also worthwhile when selecting high-growth investments. Indeed, investing in stocks that could outperform BTC carries several risks, such as above-average market volatility. Valuation risks can also arise when stocks with high P/Es or P/Bs become overvalued. Industry-specific risks, such as regulatory challenges in sectors like technology and biotech, may hinder growth. In addition, stocks are sensitive to economic shifts like changes in interest rates and inflation. Company-specific or idiosyncratic issues, such as poor management or legal challenges, increase risk, requiring investors to look carefully before investing and diversifying their portfolios once they do. To diversify an investment portfolio with stocks and cryptocurrencies, investors should pick their holdings based on risk tolerance. Most investors will want to hold much of their portfolios in stable blue-chip stocks and other safer assets, with only a small portion for volatile cryptocurrencies. Over the past year, APP, MMYT, NVDA, POWL, and TGTX have had exceptional growth, outpacing even the stellar 150% rally in bitcoin's prices. Key drivers for these companies include strong revenue growth, high ROE, and market momentum. NVDA, in particular, capitalized on AI demand, while TGTX succeeded with its Briumvi therapy. APP and MMYT leveraged strategic new products, and POWL benefited from industrial sector growth, positioning these stocks as strong performers with robust fundamentals across very different sectors of the economy.

While Bitcoin's 130% surge grabbed headlines this past year, a select group of stocks outpaced the cryptocurrency behemoth. AppLovin (APP), MakeMyTrip (MMYT), NVIDIA (NVDA), Powell Industries (POWL), and TG Therapeutics (TGTX) all rode waves of market demand to deliver eye-popping returns. These five companies found remarkable success in their sectors, from AI breakthroughs to fronting an industrial boom. Moreover, their stellar performance wasn't just a flash in the pan. Standing behind their stock price increases are robust fundamentals and impressive metrics like revenue growth and return on equity (ROE), which suggest these stocks could keep outshining Bitcoin, one of the most volatile assets. Below, we dig into how they did it. Over the past year, BTC has had one of its best years, more than doubling in price. This was driven by the start of trading for spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), market sentiment, and other major financial catalysts. In late October 2023, BTC pierced the $30,000 level in a rally spurred by anticipation of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approving the spot BTC ETFs. The approval of ETFs from BlackRock and Fidelity significantly increased the institutional demand for BTC, increasing demand for the cryptocurrency. By January 2024, BTC's price surged to $49,000. There was also anticipation for the upcoming BTC halving event. However, the cryptocurrency didn't climb upwards all year. In late January 2024, BTC corrected, dipping 20% to a low of $38,500. This was only a pullback, and by mid-February 2024, the cryptocurrency had rallied past $50,000. The BTC spring halving was another major catalyst for the cryptocurrency, as halving events reduce BTC's supply by cutting mining rewards in half, usually leading to a spike in its price. By mid-March 2024, BTC reached an all-time high of $73,835, fueled by solid demand, particularly from ETFs. Despite this peak, BTC began consolidating, trading between $49,000 and $73,895 for the following months. In the preceding 12 months, the price of Bitcoin rose 150%. The gauges for the stocks selected below are as follows: Below, we discuss the criteria further, but let's get to our analysis first: Among the top performers, APP led the pack with an impressive one-year return of 227.6%, supported by robust revenue growth of 37.3%. NVDA was close on its heels, delivering a 180.7% price return, kickstarted by extraordinary revenue growth of 194.7%. This was primarily thanks to surging demand in AI and data center sectors. TGTX stood out with its remarkable revenue growth of 1,341.6%, though its one-year price return of 160.1% was comparatively modest. POWL Industries and MMYT had consistent performance, with one-year returns of 179.7% and 182.1%, respectively. POWL's growth was particularly noteworthy at 44.8%. Regarding profitability and valuation metrics, NVDA emerged as a leader with an impressive return on equity (ROE) of 123.77% and a strong price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, indicative of its market dominance. TGTX was also quite strong, with a high ROE of 87.8%, though its P/B ratio at 21.0 was more modest. AppLovin's ROE of 70.7% was solid, but its particularly high P/B of 52.2 suggests investors are placing a significant premium on its expected growth. POWL appears lower in risk as a stock, given its P/B of 5.9 and steady ROE of 34.2%. MakeMyTrip rounded out the group with an ROE of 22.2% and a relatively high P/S of 14.4, reflecting a balanced growth trajectory and investors' optimism about its future in the expanding Indian travel market. AppLovin Corporation specializes in mobile app development and marketing products. The company provides a platform where developers can review metrics on their growth, work to increase user engagement, and review their mobile app revenues. AppLovin has demonstrated strong growth, with its stock price increasing by 228% over the past year. Several factors have driven this performance: AppLovin's high P/B ratio suggests that investors are placing a premium on the company's assets, likely because of its strong growth prospects and market position in the mobile app industry. That said, the company is in the highly competitive mobile technology sector. Its suite of tools and strong AI capabilities have positioned it as a leader in helping developers monetize their apps, particularly game developers. Holders of APP shares should be aware of potential risks: Despite these potential drawbacks, AppLovin's recent performance and strategic position have made it a standout in app development, allowing it to outpace even the impressive gains seen in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin over the past year. MakeMyTrip is a major online travel company primarily serving the Indian market. Founded in 2000 and based in Gurgaon, India, the company offers the typically comprehensive range of travel-related services travelers expect from today's major platforms. MakeMyTrip has shown significant growth, with its stock price increasing by 182% over the past year. Several factors have driven this performance: MakeMyTrip is a dominant player in India's online travel space, benefiting from the country's large and growing middle class, increasing internet availability, and rising disposable incomes. The company's strong brand recognition and wide service offerings have helped it maintain a leading position in a competitive market. The company's high P/S and P/B ratios suggest that investors are optimistic about its future growth in the rapidly expanding Indian travel market. However, investors should consider the following risks: Despite these risks, MakeMyTrip's strong market position and the robust growth of India's travel sector have contributed to its impressive stock performance, NVDA is one of the dominant companies producing advanced computer graphics processors, chipsets, and multimedia software. Founded in 1993 and based in Santa Clara, California, the company plays a significant role in AI, autonomous technology, and high-performance computing, helping to shift the evolution of visual computing and AI. NVIDIA has achieved record-breaking quarters recently, which has been driven by several key factors: NVIDIA is dominant in the GPU market, particularly in AI and high-performance computing.

Title: Why Nvidia stock could soar over 500% by the end of the decade, former consulting exec says

Nvidia is headed for a meteoric run-up by the end of the decade, according to one former consulting exec. Phil Panaro — a former senior advisor at Boston Consulting Group who also served as CEO of a BCG subsidiary — says shares of the AI chipmaker will reach $800 by 2030. That implies another 545% upside for the stock, which traded around $122 a share mid-day Friday. The Jensen Huang-led firm will benefit from the artificial intelligence revolution, as well as migration from Web2 to Web3, Panaro predicted, referring to the idea that the internet's next era will be denominated by blockchain technology. Those developments could result in big spending from Nvidia's customers, he said, pointing to estimates from Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley that Web3 could fuel trillions of added value in the market. "Nvidia powers all of the accelerated computing, to make that happen, so they're going to have a major share of that," Panaro said in an interview with Schwab Network on Thursday. He later estimated that the firm's revenue could scale by a factor of 10, from $60 billion in the last fiscal year to $600 billion by 2030. Investors may not have to wait long to see some of those gains. Panaro foresees a "huge explosion" in the stock after Nvidia releases Blackwell, its next-gen AI chip, though he didn't specify his short-term price target. "Not to sound overconfident — it's actually inevitable provided that they can continue to make these chips," he later added of the firm's upside potential. "The AI penetration in the economy right now is literally less than 1%. So you still have all the corporates, the cities, the municipalities, the governments, the military, that are going to be spending money to make sure they leverage AI effectively. So tons of money still to be spent." Some strategists have been skeptical over Nvidia's rally, with the stock up a monster 2,733% over the last five years. Analysts have attributed some of that growth to "hyperscalers," a small group of Big Tech firms buying Nvidia's chips in large quantities. But despite concerns those customers could eventually pull away, the small group of buyers is actually a good sign Nvidia's business will scale, Panaro said. "That's actually the best case for why it's actually going to go up. Because if you look at all the other customers they're not getting to, there's 490 other Fortune 500 firms that haven't really adopted AI to the fullest because they don't understand it. You have all these cities and governments that are going to be redoing all their infrastructure from Web2 to Web3, and you then have the AI arms race, with countries and their militaries, which Nvidia hasn't penetrated for the most part," Panaro said. He continued: "The stock can go to the moon, essentially, provided that they deliver." Panaro's prediction leans on the extreme end of forecasters, but Wall Street is generally feeling bullish about the chipmaker's stock, which has climbed 152% since the start of the year. Analysts have issued an average price target of $152 a share for the stock, according to Nasdaq data, implying around 25% upside from current levels. Indices Commodities Currencies Stocks Jump to

Title: Bitcoin breaks $66K as it records its best September in history

Share this article Bitcoin surged to $66k today, setting a fresh two-month high and marking its best performance ever in September. This rally comes as global economic factors and institutional demand combine to drive the token price upward. Bitcoin’s price increase mirrors the sharp rise in Chinese stocks, fueled by China’s recent economic stimulus measures. The Shanghai Composite Index recorded its best week since 2008, thanks to the stimulus, which also boosted BTC by 3% week-to-date. “This feels frighteningly familiar,” commented trading resource The Kobeissi Letter on the sudden market rise. In the US, the FED’s recent 50-basis-point rate cut, announced on September 18, provided further momentum. The S&P 500 has set repeated all-time highs following the announcement, while the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Index print for August met market expectations. The next Fed meeting in November could see another rate cut, with the odds of a 50-basis-point cut standing at 52% according to the CME Group’s FedWatch Tool, further fueling market optimism. Institutional demand remains strong. BlackRock has purchased more Bitcoin this week than any ETF has sold in the past three weeks. Positive inflows continue across other institutions offering Bitcoin ETFs, with yesterday’s ETF inflows reaching $365 million—the highest in over two months. Adding to the bullish sentiment, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) will be released from jail today. With China printing money, the Federal Reserve cutting rates, and institutional interest at an all-time high, Bitcoin’s strong September could pave the way for continued bullish action in October, which has historically been the best month for Bitcoin.

jeffbullas.com Win At Business And Life In An AI World Topics: If we put all the data we have collected in the past year from our expanding digital universe into books, we would have created 80 quadrillion books. If we stacked them (assuming a thickness of 2.5 cm), it would reach the sun 13,333 times.Or 211 light years into space. But the irony is that with all that information, we are still struggling to find wisdom. Isaac Asimov said this about the mountains of data collected by technology:“The saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom.” The conundrum. More information and data does not lead to better decisions. So we need to pose questions that matter: One answer is applying “mental models.” A mental model is a simplified, conceptual framework that helps us understand and interpret the world, make decisions, and solve problems. It represents how certain things work, allowing us to predict outcomes based on past experiences, knowledge, or logic. One example of a mental model is applying the compounding effect. This can be used to accumulate wealth and knowledge over a lifetime. Example 1: Compounding effect of a long term approach to investing to build “wealth“—by investing in high-quality businesses or the stock market index that consistently grow earnings, reinvesting profits over decades to create exponential wealth. This was the mental model used by Warren Buffet to make his company the 8th most valuable business in the world at $982 billion. Example 2: Compounding effect of life term learning and “knowledge.” Learning something new every day adds to your knowledge and over a lifetime it can produce enormous benefits to life and business. This is one of Bill Gates key mental models and in an information world, knowledge is wealth. Microsoft is now valued at over $3 Trillion. Mental models help us cut through complexity and distill that into simplicity. They help us make sense of all the noise that overwhelms us and allow us to focus on the key principles that govern situations. And the proof of the “mental model” approach can be found in many successful people that have used that approach—these include Richard Branson, Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. If you want to see what their mental models are you can jump to the bottom of this post. Mental models can be applied to every aspect of life. The biggest decisions in life often shape our personal happiness, relationships, and long-term fulfillment. These include choosing a life partner, who you hang out with and where you have your home and how you invest your money. On the “who you hang out with,” I have a simple piece of advice:“If you want to fly like an eagle don’t hang out with turkeys.” I have told my children this many times. I hope they are listening. Here are some key decisions that we all face in life and some mental models that can help guide your thinking around them: Mental models: Mental models: Charlie Munger lived to the age of 99 and died in 2023. He, with Warren Buffet built the Berkshire Hathaway company to a valuation of $982 Billion and is the 8th most valuable company in the world after starting in 1965. He published a book titled “Poor Charlie’s Almanac” that was a distillation of all the information he had gathered over his lifetime that was instrumental in building a trillion dollar business. In it he revealed one of his secrets about how he did that. He distilled that information into wisdom using over 90 mental models, some he revealed in that book and others are still to be unearthed. In looking at his life, his mental models and his success it would suggest a strong correlation between age and experience producing wisdom. But he is not alone and there are many famous people that have developed wisdom and mental models from their life experiences to find success. Many top entrepreneurs and famous individuals utilize mental models as key tools for decision-making, problem-solving, and life optimization. Here are a few prominent figures who are known for applying mental models and the specific frameworks they employ in business and life: Sheryl Sandberg is an influential business executive, philanthropist, and as of 2023, her net worth is estimated to be around $1.6 billion, primarily derived from her stock holdings and compensation from her time at Meta, as well as her investments in other ventures. She is best known for her role as the Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Facebook (now Meta), where she helped grow the platform into one of the largest social media companies in the world. Sandberg is also the author of the bestselling book Lean In, which advocates for women’s empowerment and leadership in the workplace, and founded the Lean In Foundation to support gender equality initiatives. Here are 3 of her mental models and frameworks. The most powerful mental model here for me is the framework of “taking charge” and owning your future rather than one of victimhood. That is expanded on in her best selling book “Lean In.” Warren Buffet built the Berkshire Hathaway company to a valuation of $982 Billion that is now the 8th most valuable company in the world after starting in 1965. Invest as early as possible and let compounding make you rich over time. $10,000 invested in the USA sharemarket when you were 30 becomes $237,000 when you’re 60. Going deeper In a recent AFR publication there was a chart that revealed the power of compounding returns using an example of investing in stock markets. It compared the different stock markets total return if you invested $10,000 30 years ago. It displays the power of compounding and how a small change in return can produce a much bigger result from the power of compounding. This powerful visual comparison shows that $30,000 invested in the Australian Stock market 30 years ago vs the same $30,000 invested in the USA stock over the same period. Result Total value of $10,000 over 30 years with all dividends reinvested and no withdrawals. To put that in perspective a relatively small investment of $10,000 in the USA markets when you were 30 became $237,318 at the age of 60 but only worth $135,165 in Australia. That is a $100,000+ difference The other revelation was what a difference it made when there was only a 2% difference. Australia had a 9.1% return and the USA was 11.1%. Ray Dalio is a financial success as the founder of Bridgewater which is one of the worlds largest hedge funds. And his biggest mental model is “radical transparency” within his organization. It is a model that works for him and his business. It may not work for you. But it may. A good mental model will be what makes sense to you and your experience in life. It will be the intersection of your skills, life journey and curiosity. You need to own it. Make it yours. Sometimes I find road testing different ideas is a good first step. Here are some of Ray’s mental models to reflect on. Feedback loops make a lot of sense to me.They can be seen as using information and data to find what works and what doesn’t as quickly as possible. It can be very data driven and objective or more nuanced and subjective. Jeff saw a vision of an online bookstore in 1995. 30 years later he has grown Amazon into a trillion dollar company and with a personal wealth of $211 billion dollars is the second wealthiest person in the world. He plays the long game and one of his prioritized models is long-term thinking. The regret minimization model is something worth looking deeper at. This starts to become more obvious and apparent when you’re older. And many of us live with regret.It is a great question to keep asking yourself. Maybe try putting yourself a bit further into the future and take the time to reflect on your current situation and ask better questions. Charlie Munger was Warren Buffets sidekick at Berkshire Hathaway. The reality was that he was much more than that and it was a synergistic partnership that lasted 58 years. But they both had their own mental models and agreed on others. Charlie died in 2023 and had used 90 plus mental models to help him make wise decisions. The inversion mental model is counterintuitive as it makes you look at the consequences of the opposite of what you want to achieve. Instead of focusing on what would make a project successful, you think about what could cause it to fail, and then work to avoid those pitfalls. Example: Suppose you want to improve customer satisfaction in your business. Instead of asking, “What can we do to make our customers happier?”, you ask, “What are we doing that could be making our customers unhappy?” then take specific actions to eliminate these issues, thereby indirectly improving overall customer satisfaction. I don’t need to introduce Steve Jobs except to say that his birthday on February 24 was on the same date of the year as mine. So we are both Pisces. Let’s leave the comparison there. Finding or creating “Simplicity” in the middle of all the noise and complexity takes time and effort. So…simplicity takes hard work. Winston Churchill said it well. “I would have written you a shorter letter but I didn’t have the time.” To go back to comparisons between Steve and me. I love finding the simplicity in complexity. Let me say: Less is more. The founder of Facebook (now known as Meta) has maybe created the most information in the world by getting people to sign up to his social media platform and making it easy for the world to share their information without creating any of his own. That is “scaling economics” at its smartest. Key takeaway As competitors entered the market Mark quickly realized that he didn’t have to innovate all the time but buy or copy. Instagram and WhatsApp threatened to steal traffic, users and attention from Facebook so he bought them. And to show the middle finger to Elon Musk at Twitter (Now known as X) he copied Twitter and started “Threads”. In just a few months Threads had acquired 100 million users. Innovator’s dilemma solved. Elon is currently the world’s richest person. And Tesla and SpaceX are his biggest contributors to that wealth. And he didn’t get there without some clever thinking and using some powerful mental models that helped him. Long-term vision is one of his superpowers and one of his mental models. Going to colonize Mars is as long term as it gets! It’s not in my vision as I quite like the beach and I have heard that there are no beaches and sand there. But what is interesting is that this mental model is also one of the key mental models of Warren Buffet and Jeff Bezos. No more needs to be said. Bill along with Charlie Munger and Warren Buffet spends a lot of time reading. I am not talking about superficial reading (also known as doom scrolling) on Instagram, Facebook or TikTok. As the founder of Microsoft that he started in the 1980’s (that is now worth $3.22 trillion) he has certainly earned the right to give himself the permission to read, and gain knowledge. “Compounding” is not just something reserved for financial wealth. It also applies to knowledge wealth. Taking a long term approach to gaining knowledge and hopefully wisdom is one of Bill Gates approaches and frameworks for life. Take the time to keep feeding your mind with deep knowledge and the compound effect of that will surprise you. Richard Branson had trouble reading as he was dyslexic. But that didn’t stop him succeeding as he had the ability to choose the right people to hire and partner with. I surround myself with people that do the things I hate and I am bad at. That includes cleaners, accountants and tax advisers. So realizing that you are not good at something and choosing people to help you is leaning into the mental model of “People over process” Many of these models can be adapted to our big decisions in our personal life. They can also be applied to business and investing. The challenge is that there are many mental models and that alone will produce complexity and anxiety. Your next task is to create a mental model list and distill them into which ones are relevant for you and make a shorter list. And then start applying them and testing them. Ideas without action are just noise. Share this post: © Jeff Bullas. Privacy Policy

Title: Wall Street SWOT: NVIDIA stock rides AI wave amid tech sector challenges
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/wall-street-swot-nvidia-stock-rides-ai-wave-amid-tech-sector-challenges-93CH-3636297
Time Published: 2024-09-27T14:02:27Z
Full Content:
NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues to dominate the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market, leveraging its strong position in graphics processing units (GPUs) to capitalize on the growing demand for AI infrastructure. As the company prepares to report its July quarter earnings, analysts remain bullish on NVIDIA's prospects, despite concerns about product delays and increasing competition in the AI chip space. NVIDIA's data center segment has been the primary driver of the company's recent growth, with revenues expanding significantly year-over-year. The strong demand for NVIDIA's Hopper GPU computing platform, coupled with growth in InfiniBand and Ethernet for AI revenue, has propelled the company's financial performance. Analysts expect this trend to continue, with some projecting NVIDIA's earnings per share (EPS) to exceed $10 by 2030. The company's full-stack ecosystem positions it to capture 70-80% of the value in the parallel processing era, according to some analysts. This dominance is supported by NVIDIA's CUDA software platform and deepening system software capabilities, which are seen as key differentiators in sustaining its growth trajectory. NVIDIA's product roadmap includes the ramp-up of its next-generation GPU architecture, Blackwell, which is expected to contribute significantly to revenue in the coming quarters. Despite reports of a slight delay in Blackwell's production, analysts remain confident in NVIDIA's ability to meet demand through increased shipments of its current Hopper architecture. The company is also focusing on expanding its presence in enterprise and edge computing markets. NVIDIA's AI Foundry and NIMs (NVIDIA Inference Microservices) offerings aim to simplify AI rollouts for enterprises, potentially opening up new revenue streams as businesses increasingly adopt AI technologies. While NVIDIA maintains a dominant position in the AI chip market, competition is intensifying. Traditional semiconductor companies like AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) are ramping up their efforts in the AI space, while major tech giants such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are developing custom silicon solutions for their AI needs. Despite these competitive pressures, analysts believe NVIDIA's technological lead and ecosystem advantages will allow it to maintain its market leadership in the near term. The company's ability to introduce new SKUs and adapt to changing market demands, such as developing the H20 product to meet export control requirements for the Chinese market, demonstrates its agility in responding to challenges. NVIDIA's financial projections paint a picture of robust growth. Analysts estimate the company's revenue to grow from $60.92 billion in fiscal year 2024 to $203.42 billion by fiscal year 2027. Similarly, EPS is expected to increase from $1.15 to $4.85 over the same period. The company's strong balance sheet, with improving financial ratios such as net debt/EBITDA moving into negative territory, provides NVIDIA with flexibility to invest in research and development and pursue strategic initiatives. Recent reports of delays in NVIDIA's next-generation Blackwell GPU architecture have raised concerns about potential impacts on the company's competitive edge. While analysts generally view these delays as short-term issues, they could provide an opening for competitors to gain ground in the rapidly evolving AI chip market. If NVIDIA fails to execute its product roadmap effectively, it may face challenges in maintaining its dominant market share and meeting the growing demand for AI computing power. NVIDIA's global operations, particularly its reliance on manufacturing partners in Asia, expose it to geopolitical risks and potential export controls. The company has already faced challenges in selling certain high-performance chips to China due to U.S. government restrictions. While NVIDIA has developed products like the H20 to comply with these regulations, further tightening of export controls could significantly impact its ability to serve key markets. This geopolitical uncertainty adds a layer of risk to NVIDIA's growth prospects and could affect investor confidence in the long term. NVIDIA's CUDA software platform and extensive ecosystem of developers and applications create a significant moat around its business. This ecosystem advantage makes it challenging for competitors to replicate NVIDIA's full-stack offerings, potentially locking in customers and developers for the long term. As AI applications become more prevalent across industries, NVIDIA's established ecosystem could drive sustained growth and market leadership, even in the face of increasing competition. While NVIDIA is best known for its GPUs in gaming and data centers, the company is actively expanding into new markets such as automotive, healthcare, and robotics. These diversification efforts could provide additional growth vectors and reduce NVIDIA's reliance on any single market segment. If successful, this strategy could help NVIDIA maintain its growth trajectory even if its core markets face temporary headwinds or increased competition. The company's efforts in areas like autonomous driving and AI-powered medical imaging could open up substantial new revenue streams in the coming years. NVIDIA Corporation continues to navigate the complex landscape of the AI and semiconductor industries, balancing strong growth prospects with emerging challenges. As the company moves forward, its ability to maintain technological leadership, expand into new markets, and manage geopolitical risks will be crucial in determining its long-term success. Investors and analysts will be closely watching NVIDIA's upcoming earnings report and guidance for further insights into its trajectory in the rapidly evolving AI market.

In the decade to fiscal year 2024, India’s refining capacity increased by 42 million tons to 257 million tons, or to 5.16 million bpd. Refiners boosted capacity to meet the growing domestic consumption, as exports remained range-bound at around 1.3 million bpd over the period, the rating agency said in a report. By the end of fiscal 2030, India is set to add up to 40 million tons, or over 800,000 bpd, to its refining capacity and push up the installed base capacity to 295 million tons, or 5.92 million bpd, according to Crisil Ratings. The rise in capacity would be necessary to address the expected growth in consumption as the current capacities are already being optimally utilized, Crisil Ratings noted. “Most of the capacity addition would be brownfield expansions to cater to demand for end products, thus lowering the project risks,” said Adds Joanne Gonsalves, Associate Director, CRISIL Ratings. “Further, the sector benefits from its strategic importance to the government”. Over the past decade, India’s domestic consumption of petroleum products rose by 4% per year, with transport fuels, accounting for around 56% of consumption, growing by 4% each year, according to Crisil. “We expect overall petroleum product consumption to slightly moderate and register ~3% CAGR over the next six years, primarily due to slower growth of 2-3% in transport fuel consumption,” said Anuj Sethi, Senior Director, CRISIL Ratings. India will drive up to 35% of global energy demand growth over the next 20 years, petroleum minister Hardeep Puri said at the Gastech conference in Houston last week. “If you say that global demand is increasing by one percent, ours is increasing by three times that,” Puri said. “In the next two decades, 35% of the increase in global demand will come from India.” By Charles Kennedy for Oilprice.com More Top Reads From Oilprice.com Join the discussion | Back to homepage Previous Post Pemex Oil Output Dips as Outgoing Mexican President Fails to Bolster State Giant Next Post WTI Houston Crude Prices Gain Prominence as U.S. Oil Exports Jump Charles is a writer for Oilprice.com More Info Saudi Arabia Cuts Oil Prices Oil Net Short For First Time in History Africa’s Top Refinery Could Soon Upend Global Gasoline Markets Chinese Refineries Go Bankrupt Amid Plummeting Margins The Refining Supercycle Is Coming to an End ADVERTISEMENT Oil Prices Plunge on OPEC+ Production Cut Speculation The Harsh Reality of the Global Energy Transition European Oil Majors Are Set to Struggle as a Supply Glut Looms WTI Breaks Below $70 as Concerns Over Oil Demand Persist © OilPrice.com The materials provided on this Web site are for informational and educational purposes only and are not intended to provide tax, legal, or investment advice.

The milestone comes after the $9 trillion asset manager recently acquired another $35 million worth of Bitcoin and $6.4 million of Ethereum earlier this week. With the latest acquisition, the asset manager’s Ethereum reserves now stand at 350,000 ETH, worth around $989 million, according to data from blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence. BlackRock’s BTC holdings are managed primarily through its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which allows institutional investors direct exposure to Bitcoin. BlackRock's holdings now represent approximately 1.70% of the total available Bitcoin. BlackRock’s recent acquisitions have set it apart from other major asset managers, particularly Grayscale, which currently holds around 258,671 BTC valued at $16.45 billion. However, Grayscale continues to hold a stronger position in Ethereum, with over 2.104 million ETH valued at roughly $5.45 billion—more than five times that of BlackRock’s current Ethereum holdings. On Sept. 25, BlackRock saw a surge of $184.4 million in inflows into its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), the highest single-day inflow of any fund during the month, according to Farside data. This influx came shortly after the Federal Reserve’s decision to reduce interest rates by 50 basis points—a move that has been a focal point of the financial markets throughout 2024, potentially influencing crypto investment and sentiment. While BlackRock’s increased crypto investments signal growing institutional interest, some observers have raised questions about the physical custody of these assets. Rumors have circulated online alleging that Coinbase, the exchange serving as a custodian for BlackRock and several other Bitcoin ETF issuers, is not acquiring the actual Bitcoin requested by the funds but instead issuing "paper Bitcoin" or IOUs. Baldilocks here. Not sure what this is all about TBH. All ETF mints and burns we process are ultimately settled onchain. Institutional clients have trade financing and OTC options before trades are settled onchain. This is the norm for all our institutional clients. All funds… — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) September 14, 2024 To address these concerns, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong took to Twitter to clarify that all transactions involving the ETF are settled on the blockchain. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas further confirmed that BlackRock maintains its own blockchain node and consolidates its Bitcoin balances nightly, which are then reported to Coinbase Prime.

Title: Bitcoin ETF inflows cross $365.7 mln – Did China help?

What is driving the recent surge in Bitcoin ETFs and Bitcoin’s price? After facing weeks of uncertainty, Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs are once again gaining momentum. Despite September’s bearish reputation for BTC, both the cryptocurrency and its associated ETFs have defied expectations with a trend reversal. As of the most recent data on the 26th of September, total inflows for all Bitcoin ETFs have reached an impressive $365.7 million. Leading the charge was Ark’s ARKB with $113.8 million, followed by Blackrock’s IBT at $93.4 million. Fidelity’s FBTC recorded $74 million, while Bitwise’s BITB sits at $50.4 million. VanEck’s HODL, Invesco’s BTCO, and Franklin’s EZBC also contributed inflows of $22.1 million, $6.5 million, and $5.7 million, respectively. Although two more smaller ETFs showed modest inflows below $5 million, the overall surge underscores the renewed investor confidence in BTC ETFs. Notably, on the 25th of September, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, witnessed an extraordinary surge of $184.4 million in inflows for its spot Bitcoin ETF, making it the highest single-day inflow of the month for any fund. This spike comes amid growing market speculation, potentially influenced by developments in Asia. For those unaware, Chinese stocks rallied following reports that the Chinese government may inject up to ¥1 trillion($142 billion) into its major state banks, aimed at boosting an economy that has faced challenges recently. Earlier in the week, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) took easing measures by cutting the reserve requirement ratio for mainland banks by 50 basis points and lowering the seven-day reverse repo rate by 20 basis points to 1.5%. These actions have seemingly fueled optimism, which may be playing a role in the inflows seen in global markets, including Bitcoin ETFs. Remarking on the matter, Ki Young Ju, Founder and CEO of CryptoQuant, said, Source: Ki Young Ju/X He further added, “The U.S. is regaining dominance in #Bitcoin holdings. Its ratio compared to other countries is rising, driven by spot ETF demand. Only known entities are included.” Source: Ki Young Ju/X Meanwhile, on the price front, BTC’s price action has shown remarkable resilience. After struggling to break past the $60,000 barrier for days, the leading cryptocurrency surged, reaching $65,642. This marked a 2.89% gain in the last 24 hours. As the month draws to a close, Bitcoin has exhibited a strong bullish trend with an impressive monthly rise of 10.98%, signaling sustained upward momentum in the market.

"We now have a Labour government whose number one priority is wealth creation," U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin in an exclusive broadcast interview Thursday. "We are a Labour party that is proud to say we are pro business just as much as we are pro worker." In July, Starmer became the first leader from the center-left Labour party to win a U.K. national election since Tony Blair — ending 14 years of Conservative rule. Since being elected, he has said his top priority is economic stability. During his visit to New York City amid the United Nations General Assembly, Starmer met with business leaders including Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, Citi CEO Jane Fraser, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, Microsoft President Brad Smith, and Blackstone President Jonathan Gray. This week, Blackstone committed to investing $13 billion to build a data center in the northeast of England. The investment aims to create 4,000 jobs and lead to one of the largest data centers in Europe to power the surging demand for artificial intelligence. "It's a big signal of confidence," Starmer told Sorkin about the deal. "It's also in the northeast of England, which matters to us, because I want economic drive outside of London." Starmer said the industries in particular he's working to attract investment in include renewables, artificial intelligence and life sciences. This call for investment comes as the Labour government is getting ready to unveil its budget plan in October, while dealing with a stagnant economy. Starmer's government, in the early days of its tenure, flagged a £22 billion ($29 billion) financing shortfall after his administration performed an audit. Former Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt, for the Conservative Party, in July wrote to Simon Case, the head of the British civil service, labeling Labour's claims about the public finances "deeply troubling." Starmer has, more recently, been accused of being too negative on the U.K economy, and Labour's plans to ax the U.K.'s non-dom tax regime has also been criticized. "We will stabilize the economy," said Starmer Thursday. "There are going to be more hard decisions to be made when it comes to the budget." Earlier this week, Starmer's plan to cut payments that offset fuel costs for pensioners was rejected by his own party in a symbolic vote at the Labour Party's Annual Conference. "No one wants to change the winter fuel allowance for pensioners. But by doing that, we stabilize the economy," Starmer told Sorkin. "We can commit to what we call the triple lock, which means that they get more money year-on-year." The U.K.'s "triple lock" is where the state pension rises each year by either 2.5%, the inflation rate, or earnings growth — whichever is highest. Got a confidential news tip?

The Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation is due this morning; U.S. stock futures are steady after Thursday's jump and the S&P 500's record close; Costco Wholesale (COST) shares are slipping in premarket trading after disappointing quarterly revenue numbers; almost 1.2 million electricity customers are without power in Florida as Helene slams the state as a Category 4 hurricane; and Intel (INTC) reportedly rebuffs a bid by Arm Holdings (ARM) for its product division. Here's what investors need to know today. Market watchers will be focused on the Fed's preferred inflation measure to gauge the future path of interest rates, after last week's half-percentage-point cut signaled the central bank's view that price pressures are easing. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index is expected to have risen 2.3% year-over-year in August, down from 2.5% in July, according to a survey of economists by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal, but the "core" number is expected to have risen to 2.7% from 2.6%. U.S. stock futures are little changed after major indexes surged Thursday, with the S&P 500 closing at a record high after a strong earnings report from Micron (MU) sent chip stocks sharply higher and shares of companies with exposure to the Chinese economy jumped on reports of additional government stimulus. The Nasdaq finished higher for a fourth straight session yesterday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched closer to another record high of its own. Costco Wholesale (COST) shares are slipping 1% in premarket trading after the warehouse retailer's quarterly revenue missed analysts' expectations as growth slowed. The company's fiscal fourth-quarter sales growth was just 1% year-over-year, offsetting earnings that topped forecasts. Investors will be watching how higher membership fees could affect the company’s results going forward. Hurricane Helene landed in Florida as a Category 4 storm Thursday night with wind speeds of around 140 miles per hour, with about 1.2 million customers losing power in the state, according to PowerOutage.us. Helene weakened to a tropical storm as it moved farther inland over Georgia, but a "life-threatening storm surge, winds, and heavy rains continue," the National Hurricane Center said. Troubled chipmaker Intel (INTC) has rejected a bid by chip designer Arm Holdings (ARM) for its product division, Bloomberg reported late Thursday. Earlier this week, the news outlet reported that Apollo Global Management had offered to invest as much as $5 billion in Intel, days after The Wall Street Journal said that Qualcomm (QCOM) had made a "takeover approach" for it. Intel shares, which are little changed in premarket trading, are down more than 50% this year. American depositary receipts (ADRs) of Arm are edging lower.

Title: Spot Bitcoin ETFs record best day since July with $365 million inflow

Ark's ARKB ETF leads with $113.8 million inflow, marking a significant turnaround. On Sept. 26, Bitcoin ETFs recorded substantial inflows totaling $365.7 million, marking the highest single-day inflow since July 22, when $530 million entered the market. According to Farside data, Ark’s ARKB ETF led with $113.8 million, marking a significant shift after recent outflows seen earlier this month. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF added $93.4 million, while Fidelity’s FBTC ETF reported inflows of $74 million. Bitwise’s BITB ETF also saw strong participation with $50.4 million, and VanEck’s HODL ETF contributed $22.1 million. Invesco’s BTCO and Franklin’s EZBC reported smaller additions of $6.5 million and $5.7 million, respectively. Grayscale’s GBTC continued its trend of outflows, losing $7.7 million, while its smaller BTC ETF gained $2.9 million. Ethereum ETFs experienced net outflows of $0.1 million, continuing the recent trend of mixed investor sentiment in the Ethereum space. Grayscale’s ETHE fund saw the most significant movement with outflows of $36 million, contrasting with BlackRock’s ETHA and Fidelity’s FETH, which brought in $15.3 million and $15.9 million, respectively. Inflows were also recorded for Bitwise’s ETHW, Invesco’s QETH, and 21Shares’ CETH, albeit in smaller amounts. Other funds, including those from VanEck and Franklin, remained relatively flat. The contrasting flows highlight evolving trends. Bitcoin ETFs attract substantial inflows across major funds, mainly driven by Ark and BlackRock, while Ethereum ETFs face continued outflows, primarily from Grayscale. The flows coincided with Bitcoin also breaking $65k for the first time since August. Also known as "Akiba," Liam is a reporter, editor and podcast producer at CryptoSlate.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / SEPTEMBER 27 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO ofRelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 82 – Why Apple Could be the Key to Intel’s Future – The latest Arm Neoverse announcement further cements our opinion that its architecture, business model and ecosystem execution are defining a new era of computing; and leaving Intel in its dust. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explain why and how Apple could hold a key to saving Intel’s (and America’s) semiconductor industry leadership position. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 81 – A Digital Skills Gap Signals Rebound in IT Services Spend – Recent survey data from ETR shows that enterprise tech spending is tracking with projected U.S. GDP growth at 6% to 7% this year. Many markers continue to point the way to a strong recovery including hiring trends and the loosening of frozen IT project budgets.

Episode 79 – Moore’s Law is Accelerating and AI is Ready to Explode – Moore’s Law is dead right? Think again. While the historical annual CPU performance improvement of ~40% is slowing, the combination of CPUs packaged with alternative processors is improving at a rate of more than 100% per annum. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is going to unveil some data that suggests we’re entering a new era of innovation where inexpensive processing capabilities will power an explosion of machine intelligence applications. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 78 – Arm Lays Down the Gauntlet at Intel’s Feet – Exactly one week after Pat Gelsinger unveiled plans to reinvent Intel, Arm announced version 9 of its architecture and put forth its vision for the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings. The company beat consensus earnings on both top line and EPS last quarter. But Investors didn’t like Oracle’s tepid guidance and the stock pulled back..but is still well above its pre-Barron’s article price. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 74 – Breaking Analysis: NFTs, Crypto Madness & Enterprise Blockchain – When a piece of digital art sells for $69.3M, more than has ever been paid for works by Paul Gauguin or Salvador Dali, making its creator the third most expensive living artist in the world, one can’t help but take notice and ask: “What is going on?” The latest craze around NFTs may feel a bit “bubblicious,” but it’s yet another sign that the digital age is now fully upon us. In this Breaking Analysis Dave wants to take a look at some of the trends that may have observers and investors scratching their heads, but we think still offer insight to the future — and possibly some opportunities for young investors. And we’ll briefly touch on how these trends may relate to enterprise tech. Watch the full video analysis.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / SEPTEMBER 27 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO ofRelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare.

Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings. The company beat consensus earnings on both top line and EPS last quarter. But Investors didn’t like Oracle’s tepid guidance and the stock pulled back..but is still well above its pre-Barron’s article price. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 74 – Breaking Analysis: NFTs, Crypto Madness & Enterprise Blockchain – When a piece of digital art sells for $69.3M, more than has ever been paid for works by Paul Gauguin or Salvador Dali, making its creator the third most expensive living artist in the world, one can’t help but take notice and ask: “What is going on?” The latest craze around NFTs may feel a bit “bubblicious,” but it’s yet another sign that the digital age is now fully upon us. In this Breaking Analysis Dave wants to take a look at some of the trends that may have observers and investors scratching their heads, but we think still offer insight to the future — and possibly some opportunities for young investors. And we’ll briefly touch on how these trends may relate to enterprise tech. Watch the full video analysis.

Title: The Hollywood Cuts Keep Comin’ As Disney Does Another Worker Cleanse

Time Published: 2024-09-27T10:11:14Z
Full Content:
(Photo by AaronP/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images) As if Hollywood needed any more reminders why the mantra “Stay Alive Until 2025” is going to be difficult for many industry workers, Disney embarked this week on another 300 layoffs, on top of thousands of other reductions there and across the industry. This set of layoffs in the Burbank, Calif.-based Disney largely hit corporate workers in divisions such as legal, human resources, finance and communications, Deadline reported. All told, CEO Bob Iger has targeted 8,000 jobs for elimination. Some 4,000 of those cuts landed in April of last year, but more keep coming. In May, Disney’s Pixar laid off 175 workers amid a sustained box-office slump for the animation unit’s films. Even the subsequent record-setting performance of Inside Out 2 this summer wasn’t enough to fend off the Mouse House reaper. The Disney reductions, part of at least $7.5 billion in spending cuts that CEO Bob Iger instituted beginning late last year, haven’t spared sports either, even though that sector has been the most watched and lucrative remaining corner of broadcast and cable. This week, for instance, Disney’s ESPN division continued to lay off on-air talent, this time with NBA reporter and podcast star Zach Lowe. His departure follows recent exits by Robert Griffin III and Sam Ponder, who both, like Lowe, made more than $1 million a year. Five behind-the-camera executives, including Head of Content Operations Stephanie Druley, also have departed as part of a reorganization that Burke Magnus, ESPN’s President, Programming and Original Content, told staff in a recent memo will make the company “more strategic, collaborative and nimble” while resulting in “new positions or promotions for people who are expanding their responsibilities or taking on new challenges.” Basically, the survivors will get to do more with less. The cuts come amid the unexpected retirement of NBA scoop-meister Adrian Wojnarowski, who earlier this month walked away from an estimated $20 million remaining in his ESPN contract to become general manager of the men’s basketball team at his alma mater, tiny St. Bonaventure’s University in upstate New York. Disney is, of course, far from the only Hollywood media giant getting buffeted by the industry’s many changes. Paramount Global is headed toward a sale to a group led by Skydance CEO David Ellison and his father, Oracle founder Larry Ellison. That deal likely won’t close until well into 2025. Nonetheless, Paramount’s three-headed Office of the CEO is proceeding with 15% cuts across its operations, which are far smaller (and less profitable) than Disney’s. The latest cuts wiped out entire offices, such as the communications unit for Paramount+, the company’s main streaming service. All gone, Deadline reported Friday. Similarly, the streaming service’s eight-person content strategy team was wiped out, perhaps further indication that the strategy for Paramount+ is to stop operating on a stand-alone basis after the merger finally closes. Given the debt crunch Paramount and controlling shareholder Shari Redstone were facing, deep cuts were inevitable, especially given the many overlapping operations with Skydance in film, TV and animation production. But it’s all of a piece with larger layoff waves washing over the industry. Debt-saddled Warner Bros. Discovery has undergone seemingly endless cuts, layoffs and closures since it was created 2.5 years ago from a merger between Discovery and WarnerMedia (and still more cuts during AT&T’s spotty previous stewardship). Even Comcast may be vulnerable, especially as the price of NBCUniversal’s new $2.5-billion-per-year NBA rights deal starts to bite next year, even though its parts include the eponymous cable provider, a burgeoning wireless carrier, and theme parks. It’s useful to view the imminent (and entirely self-driven) retirement of beloved Today Show Hoda Kotb this week, with her $20-million-a-year contract, as just one example of what’ll be happening with NBC News salaries for on-air personalities as contracts come up for negotiation. More big names are likely to move on, or eat a pay cut or minimal pay hike in the new era. Disney told the New York Times in a statement that it is looking to manage resources and costs “more effectively” to “fuel the state-of-the-art creativity and innovation that consumers value and expect from Disney.” Hollywood’s biggest media company is hardly alone in that search. The streaming wars proved ruinously expensive — even for relative winners such as Disney+ and Hulu, which Disney now fully controls. Losses just from subscription streaming-video operations have topped $11 billion across the industry, according to SEC filings by the various contenders. That total doesn’t include any losses at Apple TV+ and Amazon Prime Video, their programming and operating costs subsumed within (and unreported by) the vast mass of their far more lucrative main businesses, though even they are reportedly tightening program spending and operational costs. The mediacos are feeling Wall Street pressure to turn streaming services into profitable operations, a process made more complicated by the accelerating swoon in customers watching the companies’ legacy cable and broadcast operations. Cord-cutting has nearly halved the cable subscription footprint to a little more than 50 million U.S. households. All the streaming operations, even those owned by Netflix and tech giants Apple and Amazon, have been cutting or re-prioritizing their spending on entertainment properties. Even industry leader Netflix is spending differently, even as it continues to generate billions in cash flow. The company has spent around $17 billion a year on programming the past few years, executives have repeatedly said in earnings calls. Now it’s reportedly reconsidering the cost-plus approach to its talent deals, going back to a modified version of a flat fee with an actual back-end for successful projects (only). But now Netflix is spending more on live events, like The Greatest Roast of All Time: Tom Brady, which proved to be one of the company’s most-watched shows of 2024’s first half, according to Netflix’s recent release of viewership statistics. Netflix also recently announced a deal to carry two NFL games this Christmas Day. That’ll likely be huge for Netflix viewership, but also means the reported $150 million paid for the two games’ rights won’t be spent on, say, five run-of-the-mill rom-coms or a couple of mid-level action comedies. For that matter, Netflix has also been profitably licensing more and more old shows from its erstwhile competitors, who after a few years of streaming wars freezeouts, once again are welcoming the found money of a Netflix deal for a library show such as Suits. While that’s good money for the owners and creators of those older shows, that’s also money that won’t be spent making new shows, either at Netflix or at the production studios. All of that has also translated to deep problems at Los Angeles production, post-production, visual-effects and other corners of the industry that regularly do projects with the studios. Keeping a job in film and television seemingly has never been more difficult.

Title: BlackRock Highlights Bitcoin’s Unique Properties as Approved IBIT Options Could Cement Risk-Off Status
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/27/blackrock-highlights-bitcoins-unique-properties-believes-btc-is-risk-off-in-the-long-term/
Time Published: 2024-09-27T09:51:00Z
Full Content:
Election 2024 coverage presented by BlackRock released a report last week, titled "bitcoin as a unique diversifier." The investment giant identified four key points from the report. First, how to analyze bitcoin (BTC) in relation to traditional financial assets due to its fundamental properties, such as not having a quarterly earnings report or a CEO. Second, bitcoin's high volatility can be perceived as a "risky" asset, which contributes to the discussion that whether it is a "risk-on" or "risk-off" asset. The token could be considered a flight-to-safety option because it is scarce, non-sovereign, and decentralized. Lastly, BlackRock pointed out that the long-term adoption of bitcoin may come from global instability. Bitcoin's realized volatility continues to trend downwards over time, indicating increased stability. In the early years of bitcoin, its realized volatility used to trade over 200%; however, as the asset matured, so did the volatility. Since 2018, realized volatility has not exceeded 100% and is currently at 50%. As realized volatility decreases and liquidity increases through financial instruments such as the spot and futures market, this may bring in more sophisticated investors such as options traders. This seems to be on the horizon with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) approval of physically settled options tied to BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF. BlackRock also asked the question: Is bitcoin risk-on or risk-off? While short-term trading may suggest that bitcoin behaves like a risk-on asset, the data reveals a different narrative over a longer time horizon. According to data from bitcoin custody service Unchained, "almost all holders (99%+) are in profit if they held for just three years. All bitcoin holders in this class are in profit if they held for at least 5 years". We can see this type of mentality on-chain among investors, where over 65% of the circulating bitcoin supply has remained unmoved for more than one year, according to Glassnode. This trend suggests that many investors tend to hold bitcoin because they believe in its store-of-value narrative and view it as a risk-off asset, even though bitcoin has faced multiple 20% corrections in 2024. BlackRock also showed that bitcoin has a very low correlation to U.S. equities. A graph shows the trailing 6-month S&P 500 correlation with bitcoin; the average correlation is 0.2 since 2015. Sometimes, assets will trade near one-to-one with one another due to external macro factors, most likely in risk-off or liquidity events. The report notes, "These episodes have been short-term in nature and have failed to produce a clear long-term statistically significant correlation relationship." Continuing with the theme of having a long-term time preference, BlackRock noted that bitcoin tends to outperform other risk-on assets after 60 days following a major geopolitical event. The U.S.- Iran escalation in 2020 saw bitcoin return 20% after 60 days, outperforming gold and S&P 500. This was also the case for Covid-19, the 2020 U.S. election challenges, the Russian Invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. regional banking crisis, and most recently, the Yen Carry trade unwind on Aug. 5. During the recent Yen carry trade unwind on Aug. 5, which was now 53 days ago, major assets experienced declines on the day. However, bitcoin has risen by 22% since then, with gold and the S&P 500 up roughly 11%. Edited by Parikshit Mishra.

Title: Google to invest $3.3 billion building two data centers in South Carolina
URL: https://www.neowin.net/news/google-to-invest-33-billion-building-two-data-centers-in-south-carolina/
Time Published: 2024-09-27T07:52:02Z
Full Content:
Google has announced its plans to invest $3.3 billion in two new data centers in South Carolina. The news comes as rivals, including Microsoft and Amazon, have started investing heavily in infrastructure upgrades for use in AI, as they provide the necessary computing power, data storage, and network connectivity, all essential for processing vast amounts of data efficiently. Out of the $3.3 billion, a significant portion of the investment, $2 billion, will be allocated for campuses at Pine Hill Business Campus in Ridgeville and Winding Woods Commerce Park in St. George. The other $1.3 billion would be used to expand Google's existing data center in Berkeley County and is expected to create 200 operational jobs in the region. Google is not the only big tech company that is expanding its data centers. Microsoft recently announced a massive $30 billion fund to invest in AI infrastructure which includes building data centers, energy projects, and more, in partnership with BlackRock and an investment firm. Google is itself investing €1 billion (around $1.1 billion) in expanding its data center in Finland and $2 billion in an AI data center in Malaysia. Amazon is also investing $11 billion in new data centers in Indiana and even includes four solar farms and a wind farm, with a combined capacity of more than 600 MW for the data center's energy needs. Energy demand is likely to soar as big tech companies continue to build and expand energy-hungry data centers across the globe to meet their AI capabilities. However, they are likely to be run on green energy in the near future. A notable example is Microsoft's recent announcement to revive the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania. The facility, infamous for a significant nuclear accident in 1979, will now supply 835 megawatts of power to support Microsoft's data centers, as the company aims to run all its data centers on clean energy by 2025.

Hi, what are you looking for? From disinformation campaigns to soaring scepticism, plummeting trust and economic slumps, the global media has been hit with blow. By Published From disinformation campaigns to soaring scepticism, plummeting trust and economic slumps, the global media landscape has been hit with blow after blow. World News Day, taking place on Saturday with the support of hundreds of organisations including AFP, aims to raise awareness about the challenges endangering the hard-pressed industry. – ‘Broken business model’ – In 2022, UNESCO warned that “the business model of the news media is broken”. Advertising revenue — the lifeline of news publications — has dried up in recent years, with Internet giants such as Google and Facebook owner Meta soaking up half of that spending, the report said. Meta, Amazon and Google’s parent company Alphabet alone account for 44 percent of global ad spend, while only 25 percent goes to traditional media organisations, according to a study by the World Advertising Research Center. Platforms like Facebook “are now explicitly deprioritising news and political content”, the Reuters Institute’s 2024 Digital News Report pointed out. Traffic from social to news sites has sharply declined as a result, causing a drop in revenue. Few are keen to pay for news. Only 17 percent of people polled across 20 wealthy countries said they had online news subscriptions in 2023. Such trends, leading to rising costs, have resulted in “layoffs, closures, and other cuts” in media organisations around the world, the study found. – Eroding trust – Public trust in the media has increasingly eroded in recent years. Only four in 10 respondents said they trusted news most of the time, the Reuters Institute reported. Meanwhile, young people are relying more on influencers and content creators than newspapers to stay informed. For them, video is king, with the study citing the influence of TikTok and YouTube stars such as American Vitus Spehar and Frenchman Hugo Travers, known for his channel HugoDecrypte. – Growing disinformation – The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has renewed concerns about disinformation — rife on social platforms — as the tool can generate convincing text and images. In the United States, partisan websites masquerading as media outlets now outnumber American newspaper sites, the research group NewsGuard, which tracks misinformation, said in June. “Pink slime” outlets — politically motivated websites that present themselves as independent local news outlets — are largely powered by AI. This appears to be an effort to sway political beliefs ahead of the US election. As part of a national crackdown on disinformation, Brazil’s Supreme Court suspended access to Elon Musk’s X, formerly known as Twitter. The court accused the social media platform of refusing to remove accounts charged with spreading fake news, and flouting other judicial rulings. “Eradicating disinformation seems impossible, but things can be implemented,” Reporters Without Borders (RSF) editorial director Anne Bocande told AFP. Platforms can bolster regulation and create news reliability indicators, like RSF’s Journalism Trust Initiative, Bocande said. – Alarming new player – AI has pushed news media into unchartered territory. US streaming platform Peacock introduced AI-generated custom match reports during the Paris Olympics this year, read with the voice of sports commentator Al Michaels — fuelling fears AI could replace journalists. Despite these concerns, German media giant Axel Springer has decided to bet on AI while refocusing on its core news activities. At its roster, which includes Politico, the Bild tabloid, Business Insider and Die Welt daily, AI will focus on menial production tasks so journalists can dedicate their time to reporting and securing scoops. In a bid to profit from the technology’s rise, the German publisher as well as The Associated Press and The Financial Times signed content partnerships with start-up OpenAI. But the Microsoft-backed firm is also caught in a major lawsuit with The New York Times over copyright violations. – ‘Quiet repression’ – With journalists frequently jailed, killed and attacked worldwide, “repression is a major issue,” said RSF’s Bocande. A total of 584 journalists are languishing behind bars because of their work — with China, Belarus and Myanmar the world’s most prolific jailers of reporters. The war in Gaza sparked by Palestinian militant group Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel has already left a “terrible” mark on press freedom, Bocande added. More than 130 journalists have been killed by Israeli airstrikes since October 7, 2023, including 32 while “in the exercise of their duties”. She said a “quiet repression” campaign is underway in countries around the world, including in democracies — with investigative journalism hampered by fresh laws on national security. With 2,400 staff representing 100 different nationalities, AFP covers the world as a leading global news agency. AFP provides fast, comprehensive and verified coverage of the issues affecting our daily lives. Cameron Moseley hopes never to return to jail thanks to a pioneering scheme in London that aims to cut reoffending by training former prisoners. Large swathes of eastern and central Nepal have been inundated since Friday with flash floods reported in several rivers and extensive damage to the... The United States said Sunday that it had a strong military presence in the Middle East after deploying reinforcements. The focus is with crafting an individualized home that enhances both efficiency and the daily living experience. COPYRIGHT © 1998 - 2024 DIGITAL JOURNAL INC. Sitemaps: XML / News .

Dell Technologies has announced a significant shift in its work policy for global sales team employees. According to an internal memo obtained by sources, starting September 30, staff members who can work from company offices will be required to do so five days a week, as per a report by Bloomberg. The tech giant's decision aims to foster a more collaborative environment and enhance skill development among its sales force. The memo emphasised the importance of in-person work, stating, “Working remotely should be the exception rather than the routine,” as quoted by Bloomberg. Field representatives are expected to divide their time between customer and partner interactions and office presence, totalling five days a week. This marks an increase from the previous three-day in-office requirement, per the report. However, the company has made provisions for certain employees, noting, “Remote sales team members who can't go into a Dell office should continue to work remotely,” Bloomberg reported. Dell has promised to provide additional information regarding remote workers shortly. In August, Dell announced a significant restructuring of its sales division, including layoffs, as part of its efforts to streamline operations and prioritise artificial intelligence. According to an internal memo sent to staff on August 6, the company said it plans to consolidate its sales teams and establish a new unit focused on AI, Business Insider reported. While Dell has not disclosed the exact number of employees affected, estimates suggest that around 12,500 workers, representing roughly 10% of the company's total workforce, may be impacted, according to a report from Newsbyte. Dell's move comes amid a broader trend of tech companies reevaluating their remote work policies established during the COVID-19 pandemic. While many firms have embraced hybrid models, some are pushing for a more substantial office presence. In a similar vein, e-commerce giant Amazon recently announced plans to require employees to work from company offices five days a week starting next year, a stricter policy compared to their previous three-day mandate. Dell has recently faced challenges in its core personal computer business, which has not rebounded as strongly as expected following a prolonged downturn. The tech giant's latest financial report, released on August 30, revealed a decline in revenue for its fiscal second quarter. The company posted $12.4 billion in revenue, representing a 4% decrease compared to the same period in the previous year and falling slightly short of market projections. The report highlighted a stark contrast between Dell's PC business segments. While sales of business-oriented computers remained relatively stable, the consumer PC division experienced a significant downturn, with revenue plummeting by 22 per cent year-on-year. In response to these financial headwinds, Dell signalled its intention to implement strategic cost-cutting measures in a regulatory filing submitted on September 11. “We remain committed to disciplined cost management in coordination with our ongoing business transformation initiatives and will continue to take certain measures to reduce costs."

Title: Is Satoshi Nakamoto’s position as top Bitcoin holder at risk?

Bitcoin ETFs have now accumulated about 83% of Satoshi’s holdings. Can it surpass Satoshi Nakamoto by year-end? After a period marked by minimal activity, BlackRock’s Bitcoin [BTC] ETF (IBIT) has regained momentum, recording substantial inflows starting on the 23rd of September. Notably, on the 25th of September, IBIT saw an impressive influx of $184.4 million, while the total inflow across all Bitcoin ETFs amounted to $105.9 million. In contrast, Grayscale’s GBTC, which usually experiences outflows, reported zero movement on the same day. However, Fidelity’s FBTC and Ark’s ARKB experienced outflows of $33.2 million and $47.4 million, respectively. This resurgence in ETF activity has propelled the U.S. BTC ETF to an astounding $17.944 billion in inflows for 2024, marking a record-breaking year-to-date accumulation of 916,047 BTC—only about 84,000 BTC shy of the coveted 1,000,000 BTC milestone. Seeing this impressive growth, Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg’s Senior ETF Analyst took to X and noted, “U.S. bitcoin ETFs had good day yesterday pushing YTD flows to new high water mark of $17.8b. They’re now 92% of the way to owning 1million bitcoin and 83% of way to passing Satoshi as top holder. Tick tock..” Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, is estimated to hold approximately 1.1 million BTC, a figure that institutional BTC ETFs are rapidly approaching. Recent data indicates that these ETFs have now accumulated about 83% of Satoshi’s holdings, and if the trend of increasing inflows continues, it could soon surpass him. Currently, Satoshi Nakamoto leads the list of the top Bitcoin holders, closely trailed by Binance with 673,783 BTC. Notably, major asset managers like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale collectively hold a significant 901,101 BTC through their ETF products, with individual holdings of 359,271 BTC, 287,153 BTC, and 254,677 BTC, respectively. Source: Eric Balchunas/X In contrast, the remaining five asset managers with BTC ETFs possess a combined total of just 14,946 BTC. Sharing a similar line of thought was Spencer Hakimian, Founder of Tolou Capital Management who said, “ETF’s going to be bigger than Satoshi by Christmas Day.” Meanwhile, MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, ranks sixth with 252,220 BTC and is on a path to potentially join the top tier of Bitcoin holders. Thus, as BTC ETFs continue to capture attention, Bitcoin itself has seen a resurgence in price. After facing challenges in breaking through the $60,000 barrier, BTC was trading at $64,358, reflecting a modest increase of 0.91% over the past 24 hours.

We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. BlackRock made headlines by purchasing 2,913 Bitcoin, worth $184.3 million. This marked their highest single-day acquisition in September. The news shows a renewed demand for Bitcoin, especially in the exchange-traded fund (ETFs) market. With this purchase, BlackRock solidified its position as the leading Bitcoin holder, surpassing other firms. BlackRock’s latest acquisition represents a significant shift in market dynamics. The firm now holds a total of 359,279 BTC, valued at approximately $23 billion. This amount far exceeds holdings by other firms like MicroStrategy, which has 107,059 BTC less than BlackRock. This massive investment also signals a rebound in the Bitcoin ETF market. The U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs debuted in January, sparking a wave of demand. Bitcoin ETFs recorded a massive single-day inflow of $1.05 billion in March and a total net asset of $62.5 billion in June. However, the market saw a decline in demand during July. Interestingly, recent trends show that inflows into Bitcoin ETFs have picked up again. According to Farside Investors, BlackRock’s $184.3 million Bitcoin Purchase contributed to $105.8 million in single-day inflows for U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BIBT) experienced positive inflows that day. BIBT saw a net inflow of $2.07 million, while other funds like the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) sold 525 BTC, worth $33.2 million. Also, the Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) offloaded $47.41 million in Bitcoin. Other issuers, such as Grayscale, reported zero inflows. Amid these developments, an X user shared that the 30-day flow indicator for Bitcoin ETFs has turned positive. This is a welcome change after a period of negative trends, and it shows that issuers have seen an average net inflow over the past month. #Bitcoin spot ETF demand has rebounded, with the 30-day net change in total holdings turning positive. pic.twitter.com/c0C8BaFPDq — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) September 26, 2024 These funds have received new money for five days, totaling almost $500 million. Additionally, they have received more money in nine out of the last ten days. “The U.S. is regaining dominance in Bitcoin holdings. Its ratio compared to other countries is rising, driven by spot ETF demand,” says Ki Young Ju. Historically, the U.S. has dominated Bitcoin holdings among public firms. The recent surge in inflows has helped restore that dominance, which had dipped due to previous lackluster performance. The renewed interest in the market is evident in BTC’s price. On September 25, Bitcoin declined to $62,700. However, after this BlackRock purchase, BTC’s price has now been around $64,000. Also, BTC is trading above its 50-day and 200-day SMA lines, suggesting a bullish sentiment. Looking at its chart, BTC is closer to breaking its primary resistance at $64,700. A cross above this level will boost the bullish momentum in the market. Your email address will not be published.

Title: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) CEO Lisa Su Announces That Their Next Phase Would Not Be A Transition Away From GPUs But Rather A Broadening Beyond Them

We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News You Shouldn't Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other AI stocks you shouldn't miss. AI presents significant benefits for investors, primarily through increased efficiency, automation, and the potential for high returns in specific sectors. It leads to higher profitability and efficiency. For example, AI-driven automation enhances efficiency in trading, portfolio management, and operations, helping investors achieve better returns. According to a report by PwC, financial institutions that adopt AI could reduce operational costs by 22% in the short term, which directly improves profitability. Hedge funds, for instance, have seen an increase in efficiency, particularly in areas such as algorithmic trading and risk management. A report by McKinsey suggests that AI-driven trading algorithms can outperform traditional investment strategies by identifying patterns and trends that are hard for human analysts to spot. This advantage could increase returns by 2-3% annually, which can compound into significant gains over time. Read more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave. AI tools also provide real-time data analytics and insights, giving investors a competitive edge in making informed decisions. According to a study by Deloitte, 63% of financial executives believe that AI can dramatically improve investment decision-making by providing better market forecasts and risk assessments. AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data quickly, allowing investors to capitalize on short-term market movements with greater precision. Similarly, the explosion of generative AI and machine learning has led to a surge in stocks related to AI technology. Several AI-focused exchange traded funds (ETFs) have outperformed the broader market, providing investors with opportunities for growth. For instance, the Global X Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF has returned close to 30% in the past year, significantly outperforming traditional tech funds. Tom Kehoe, a top researcher at Alternative Investment Management Association, an investment firm in the United Kingdom, has emphasized that AI is poised to revolutionize investment management, offering greater efficiency and precision in decision-making. Similarly, Larry Fink, the CEO of investment titan BlackRock, believes that AI will be a transformative force for wealth management, allowing firms to personalize portfolios and scale operations efficiently, which in turn create immediate value for investors. Fink was quoted by Financial Times as saying that the collapse of productivity had been a central issue in the global economy. Per Fink, AI had the huge potential to increase productivity, and transform margins across sectors, as it may be the technology that brought down inflation.

Our Methodology For this article, we selected the latest and most important AI news by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close up of a complex looking PCB board with several intergrated semiconductor parts. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 108 Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) operates as a semiconductor manufacturer. Lisa Su, the CEO of the firm, recently said that graphic processing units (GPUs) might not be the architecture of choice for companies working on AI within the next five years because they did not offer the level of programmability tech firms wanted. The CEO was contextualizing earlier statements in which she said that GPUs right now were the architecture of choice for large language models, because they were very efficient for parallel processing. Su further noted that the next phase would not be a transition away from GPUs but rather a broadening beyond them. Custom AI chips, tailored to company-specific AI tasks, are already gaining traction in the tech world, highlighting the broadening away from GPUs. Overall AMD ranks 7th on our list of the AI stocks you shouldn't miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Netflix co-CEO Peters sells shares worth over $3.1 million
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/insider-trading-news/netflix-coceo-peters-sells-shares-worth-over-31-million-93CH-3635279
Time Published: 2024-09-27T00:03:09Z
Full Content:
In a recent transaction, Gregory K. Peters, the Co-CEO of Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), sold 4,392 shares of the company's common stock, netting over $3.1 million. The sale occurred on September 25, with the shares being sold at a price of $725 each. This sale was part of a prearranged trading plan under Rule 10b5-1, which allows company insiders to set up a trading plan for selling stocks they own. On the same day, Peters also acquired the same number of shares, 4,392, at a price of $155.35 per share, totaling approximately $682,297. This transaction was related to stock options exercised under the company's stock option plan. Following the sale, Peters still owns a substantial number of Netflix shares, with 13,090 shares remaining in his possession. These transactions indicate a significant trading activity by a top executive within the company, which can often be of interest to investors and market watchers. Netflix, a leading streaming entertainment service, has seen its stock price fluctuate in recent times, and transactions of this nature often draw attention to the company's stock performance and insider confidence. Peters' position as Co-CEO makes his trading activities particularly noteworthy to those following the company's financial developments. Investors and analysts often look to insider buying and selling as a signal of leadership's belief in the company's future prospects. However, it's important to note that there can be many reasons for insiders to sell shares, and such transactions don't necessarily indicate a lack of confidence in the company. The transactions have been publicly filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, providing transparency and allowing the investing public to stay informed about significant insider trades at Netflix. In other recent news, Netflix has announced the date for its Q3 2024 earnings release, scheduled for October 17, 2024. The entertainment services leader has also been making significant strides in its advertising business, with JPMorgan predicting that Netflix's ad revenue could account for more than 10% of total revenue by 2027. Additionally, TD Cowen has reiterated a Buy rating for Netflix, indicating faith in the company's advertising growth trajectory. On another front, the proposed merger between Disney and Reliance's Indian media assets faces regulatory hurdles due to concerns about monopolizing cricket broadcast rights. The companies may need to sell some of their cricket broadcast rights or commit to advertisement price caps for cricket matches to address these antitrust concerns. Evercore ISI has shown confidence in Netflix's potential, raising its stock target and maintaining an Outperform rating. This comes in the wake of Netflix's surge in upfront advertising commitments, largely due to the addition of NFL games on Christmas Day. These are the recent developments highlighting the growth and challenges faced by these companies in their respective markets. As investors digest the recent insider trading activity by Netflix Co-CEO Gregory K. Peters, it's worth considering the broader financial context provided by InvestingPro. Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) currently boasts a market capitalization of $309.67 billion, underscoring its substantial presence in the entertainment industry. The company's P/E ratio stands at 43.56, reflecting a valuation that is high relative to near-term earnings growth, a point that is also highlighted by one of the InvestingPro Tips. This may suggest that investors are expecting continued growth and are willing to pay a premium for the company's earnings potential. Another InvestingPro Tip indicates that Netflix operates with a moderate level of debt, which can be a reassuring sign for investors concerned about the company's financial leverage. Moreover, the company's strong return over the last year, with a price total return of 88.41%, demonstrates its robust performance in the market. Additionally, with a high gross profit margin of 43.84% over the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, Netflix shows its ability to efficiently translate sales into profits.

URL: https://www.investing.com/news/insider-trading-news/netflix-director-leslie-kilgore-sells-shares-worth-over-598000-93CH-3635277
Time Published: 2024-09-26T23:59:15Z
Full Content:
Leslie J. Kilgore, a board member at Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), has recently sold a total of 828 shares of the company's common stock, according to the latest SEC filings. The transactions, which took place on September 24 and 25, resulted in a total sale amount exceeding $598,000. On the first day, Kilgore sold 426 shares at a price of $720 each, and on the following day, another 402 shares were sold for $725 apiece. These sales are part of a pre-arranged trading plan under Rule 10b5-1, which allows insiders to sell shares at predetermined times to avoid concerns about insider trading. In addition to the sales, Kilgore also acquired shares through the exercise of options on both days. The options were exercised at prices ranging from $146.92 to $155.35, with a total transaction value of $125,038 for the acquisition of 828 shares. The recent transactions have adjusted Kilgore's holdings in the video streaming giant, although the exact number of shares owned following the transactions was corrected due to an administrative error in previous filings. The corrected total reflects no omission of reportable transactions from prior filings. Investors often monitor insider trading activity as an indicator of executives' confidence in their company's prospects. Transactions by high-level insiders can provide valuable insights into the company's performance and strategic direction. Netflix continues to be a key player in the competitive streaming market, and the transactions by its executives are closely watched by investors seeking to understand the company's internal perspective. In other recent news, Netflix has announced the date for its Q3 2024 earnings release, scheduled for October 17, 2024. The company will also hold a live video interview with its co-CEOs and CFO following the release. In other developments, Netflix has been making significant strides in its advertising business. Analyst firms JPMorgan and Evercore ISI have maintained an optimistic stance on the company, predicting that Netflix is set to become a major player in the advertising sphere as its ad-supported tier continues to gain traction. They also project that the streaming giant's ad revenue could account for more than 10% of total revenue by 2027. TD Cowen has reiterated a Buy rating for Netflix, indicating faith in the company's advertising growth trajectory. The firm predicts that advertising will represent 13% of Netflix's total revenue by 2029. Meanwhile, the proposed merger between Disney and Reliance's Indian media assets is facing regulatory hurdles due to concerns about monopolizing cricket broadcast rights. These are the recent developments highlighting the growth and challenges faced by these companies in their respective markets. As Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) continues to navigate the competitive landscape of the streaming industry, recent insider trading activity has caught the attention of investors. Leslie J. Kilgore's transactions are a normal part of executive stock management, but they also provide an opportunity to delve into Netflix's current financial standing through real-time data and expert analysis. InvestingPro data reveals that Netflix is trading at a high earnings multiple with a P/E ratio of 43.56, reflecting investor confidence in the company's earnings potential. Despite this high multiple, an InvestingPro Tip suggests that Netflix is trading at a low P/E ratio relative to its near-term earnings growth, indicating that its current earnings growth may justify the higher multiple. Furthermore, the company's revenue growth over the last twelve months stands at 13.0%, showcasing its ability to expand its top-line financials in a challenging market. Another noteworthy InvestingPro Tip is that Netflix's cash flows can sufficiently cover interest payments, which is a positive sign of financial health, especially when considering the company's moderate level of debt. This aspect of Netflix's financials is crucial for investors who are assessing the company's ability to sustain and grow in the long term. For those interested in a deeper analysis, InvestingPro offers additional insights into Netflix's financial performance and projections. There are currently 15 more InvestingPro Tips available for Netflix at https://www.investing.com/pro/NFLX, providing a comprehensive look at the company's valuation multiples, profitability, and market position.

Shares in electric utility Vistra (VST), the biggest gainer in the S&P 500 this year, hit another record high in early trading Thursday before losing ground to close lower.

Vistra hit a new high of $122.01 early Thursday, before retreating to finish 4.1% lower at $114.16. The stock had risen nearly 6% on Wednesday. Below, we take a closer look at Vistra's chart and use technical analysis to point out important price levels to watch out for. After completing a 12-month trending move higher in May, Vistra shares traded within a symmetrical triangle for several months before staging a breakout above the pattern earlier this month. In recent weeks, the stock has continued to make an impulsive move higher on above-average volume, indicating strong buying conviction. The relative strength index (RSI) confirms bullish price momentum with a reading above the 80 threshold, but also warns of extremely overbought conditions that could give rise to near-term profit taking. Looking ahead, investors should monitor several key levels on Vistra’s chart likely to attract attention. During retracements, the shares could initially retest the $107 level, where they may find support around the prominent late-May peak, which also marks the start of the symmetrical triangle. Further selling could see the shares fall to the $95 region, a location on the chart where investors may seek entry points near a trendline connecting comparable trading levels from May to July with the Sept. 19 pre-gap high. A deeper retracement in the shares could bring the $76 level into play. This area, sitting just below the symmetrical triangle’s lower trendline, would likely encounter buying interest near the April swing high and this month’s swing low. To project a price target for the stock’s current trending move, investors can use the measuring principle. To do this, we calculate the distance between the symmetrical triangle’s two trendlines near the start of the pattern and add that amount to the breakout point. For example, we add $50 to $85, which forecasts an upside target of $135. The comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

Title: Newly Reduced Quest 3 Price and Quest 3S Pre-orders Now Available on Amazon
URL: https://www.roadtovr.com/meta-quest-3s-new-price-amazon-pre-order-release-date/
Time Published: 2024-09-26T22:10:24Z
Full Content:
The newly discounted Meta Quest 3 (512GB) is now available on Amazon, along with pre-orders of the new Quest 3S (128GB) and (256GB), with that sweet, speedy Prime shipping. All now include the promised bundle that includes Batman: Arkham Shadow and a three month subscription to Meta Quest+. It wasn’t initially clear exactly when the newly reduced Quest 3 price would hit—would we have to wait until Quest 3S actually launches on October 15th? Turns out, nope! The newly discounted Quest 3 (512GB) is now available on Amazon for $500. Just yesterday the headset was listing at its original price of $650. It also now includes a bundled copy of Batman: Arkham Shadow (releasing October 22nd) and a three month subscription to Meta Quest+. The Quest 3 (128GB) model is being phased out, with its own price reduced to $430 while stock remains. At the time of writing, Amazon says it’s already out of stock. But it’s currently offering an even further discounted refurbished Quest 3 (128GB) for just $380. The refurbished unit does not appear to include the Batman Arkham Shadow and Meta Quest+ bundle. As for Meta’s new Quest 3S, both models can be pre-ordered on Amazon ahead of the October 15th release date, with the (128GB) model for $300, and the (256GB) model for $400. Both include a bundled copy of Batman: Arkham Shadow (releasing October 22nd) and a three month subscription to Meta Quest+. Important note: right now the Quest 3S (128GB) is showing delivery from Amazon right around release date, but the Quest 3S (256GB) isn’t expect to deliver until the end of November. It’s unclear if this is a fluke. We’ll be keeping our eye on the date, but in the meantime it looks like ordering the (256GB) headset direct from Meta may mean an earlier delivery. Other places to check for Quest 3S stock and favorable delivery dates include Best Buy, Newegg, Walmart, and Target. Not sure if you should get Quest 3 or Quest 3S? Compare the specs and get our take right here. This article may contain affiliate links. If you click an affiliate link and buy a product we may receive a small commission which helps support the publication. More information. Meta finally getting the website-wide coverage. Glad to see no scams, over promising and under delivering, kickstarter swindels, no humble bundle sales etc on front page. I checked the 128GB Quest 3 on their site and Amazon right after the live Connect conference ended and it was out of stock already. Sounds like they're holding units back so people get the 512GB model instead, but that's just my speculation. Either way, what a lineup. 3S isn't for me (after 3's pancake lenses, I can't go back to fresnel) but it will definitely help VR in the same way Quest 2 did. What a nothingburger of a show …. ILMI remains eerily silent. No HorizonOS update. Not even any new Home enviornments. *sigh* But these reduced prices should push VR ahead nicely during the Christmas shopping season. 8^ ) 512GB is nice, but I still have more then enough room free on my Pico 4 128GB (and I'm still using it as standalone as my wifi setup and PC are still too old to do proper wireless PCVR, still use my HTC Vive Pro/wireless module for that), so 512GB is still overkill for me at the moment, maybe with the next generation it might make sense for me to buy a headset with more GB's.

Major U.S. equities indexes pushed higher as the latest estimates from the Bureau of Economic Analysis showed that U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) growth slightly outpaced expectations in the second quarter of 2024. The S&P 500 added 0.4% on Thursday, printing a new all-time closing high. The Dow gained 0.6%, ending just below the level of Tuesday's record close. The Nasdaq was also up 0.6%, boosted by strength in the tech sector and solid gains from semiconductor stocks. Micron Technology (MU) shares secured Thursday's top performance in the S&P 500, skyrocketing 14.7% after the memory chip maker beat revenue estimates and provided higher-than-expected sales guidance for the current quarter. The Nvidia (NVDA) partner nearly doubled its revenue from the year-ago period, with strong artificial intelligence (AI) demand helping underpin the strong sales growth. The firm's CEO said Micron's competitive positioning has reached its highest point in company history. Circuit board manufacturer Jabil (JBL) also reported strong quarterly results, topping sales and profit estimates for its fiscal fourth quarter. Like Micron, Jabil benefitted from strong AI demand during the quarter. The electronics manufacturer and Apple (AAPL) supplier also approved a $1 billion share repurchase plan and announced several cost-cutting initiatives. Jabil shares jumped 11.7% on Thursday. Shares of beauty products company Estée Lauder (EL) popped 10.0% higher following the announcement of an economic stimulus in China. The makeup maker generates around a third of its revenue from the Asia/Pacific region. However, in its most recent earnings report, Estée Lauder pointed to softness in the prestige beauty market in China as a key factor behind its 2% year-over-year decline in organic net sales. Any improvement in consumer sentiment that results from the stimulus could flow through to increased consumer spending and help drive a sales recovery for Estée Lauder in the key market. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) shares plunged 12.2%, falling further than any other S&P 500 stock on Thursday. According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has launched an investigation into the server and data storage provider's accounting practices. News of the DOJ probe follows a report published last month by activist short-selling firm Hindenburg Research alleging that Supermicro had engaged in accounting manipulation. Crude oil futures prices fell more than 3% amid reports that Saudi Arabia and other major producers are prepared to increase oil output in December, pressuring oil and gas stocks. Diamondback Energy (FANG) stock slid 6.5%, with news that insiders sold more than $2.3 billion worth of in the exploration and production company. Softness in natural gas prices also dragged on companies in that part of the energy sector. Shares of natural gas players Targa Resources (TRGP) and Oneok (OKE) were down around 5.9%.

JPMorgan and Jefferies analysts said Meta's (META) AI and metaverse ambitions make it a top pick after the tech giant's Connect event keynote Wednesday, where Meta unveiled several new products and AI features. The analysts said the event showcased Meta's progress in monetizing AI and made them more bullish on the stock, with JPMorgan analysts writing Thursday that they believe Meta has "earned the right to spend big on AI," given its "early AI benefits in both engagement and monetization." Jefferies analysts added that Meta's "proven ability to successfully scale & monetize new products" added to their confidence in Meta's "new AI future." JPMorgan lifted its price objective for Meta's stock to $640 from $610, while Jefferies maintained its target of $600, representing about a 5.7% to 12.7% premium above Thursday's closing price of $567.84. Both targets were higher than the analyst consensus of $587.66 compiled by Visible Alpha, though all but one of the 31 analysts surveyed held a "buy" or equivalent rating for the stock. Meta shares finished slightly lower Thursday after hitting a record intraday high earlier in the session. They've gained about 60% since the start of the year.

Title: Mark Zuckerberg seems to have stuck the landing at Meta Connect

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg needed less than an hour to wow Wall Street. He took the stage at Meta Connect in a T-shirt dedicated to himself and delivered a keynote that Wall Street seems to be responding well to. In fact, his showing was a "massive flex" for Zuckerberg, according to Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives. Zuckerberg introduced a new lineup of Meta Quest headsets, some impressive AI features coming to the company's smart glasses, and gave the public a glimpse of the highly anticipated Orion holographic glasses. He even managed to sneak in one of the many memes about his stylish new look. Meta's stock jumped more than 2%, though did even out in the day following his big announcements. Over the last year or so, Zuckerberg has shown that he's not the 20-something CEO who burst onto the scene with Facebook anymore. He's turned 40, stepped up his style, and has morphed into a Meta influencer on Instagram. His confidence appears to have paid off onstage Wednesday, Stratechery founder Ben Thompson remarked. He compared Zuck's spirited keynote to that of the late Apple cofounder Steve Jobs. "I thought Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg delivered one of the best tech keynotes in years," Thompson wrote. That's saying something, considering 2024 has been all about the buzzy events from Big Tech. Still, Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, said on X that Meta's stock fading after the keynote is likely because Orion is "years away and overall there was not much new from the event." And Thompson, who described the holographic glasses as "spectacular," gave a similar caveat. "The glasses that I tried felt like a consumer-ready product, but they reportedly cost $10,000 each, and Meta has decided to hold off on shipping a consumer version until they can bring the price down," Thompson said in a Thursday blog post. Consumers may not line up for $10,000 glasses, but reactions to Meta's vision of the future suggest they're open to a new tech frontier. A frontier that might include fewer smartphones and more chunky glasses. Jump to

Title: Where Is Amazon's Stock Price Heading In 2025?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/where-is-amazon-amzn-stock-price-heading-in-2025/
Time Published: 2024-09-26T18:50:34Z

Copyright 2022 The Associated Press. All rights reserved Where is Amazon's (AMZN) stock price heading next year? Let's formulate a prediction by running through the key factors, including the company's current position, primary growth drivers, potential challenges and strategic initiatives in play. Amazon has leading market share in two industries, e-commerce retail and cloud computing, plus a third-place share in U.S. digital advertising. Here are the numbers, according to Statista: Amazon has been a strong growth story for investors since 2010. In that period, AMZN stock grew from a split-adjusted $6 to nearly $200. The climb has not been linear, however. Shareholders benefited from a big spike in late-2020, which largely held until 2022. Like several of its tech counterparts, AMZN shed value in that year, dipping enough to walk back two years of gains. After falling to nearly $80 in December 2022, AMZN stock made a rocky climb to eclipse $200 in July of this year. Investors have since pulled back from that peak and the stock now trades at just over $190. Much more than breaking news, our diverse reporting digs deeper with unparalleled insights that empower you to make better informed decisions. Become a Forbes member and unlock unlimited access to cutting-edge strategies, actionable insights, and updated analysis from our network of leading finance experts. Likely sources of growth for Amazon going forward include AWS, which will benefit from the AI boom, e-commerce sales and the rollout of advertising on Prime Video. Amazon is working to establish AWS as the first platform of choice for AI computing. That initiative involves offering customers a range of hardware and software choices at different price points. To do that, Amazon developed its own AI training and inference chips, called Trainium and Inferentia, respectively. The first generation of the in-house chips has been well-received, and Amazon expects to release updated versions later this year. As well, the company continues to enhance its software stack for AI developers. That stack includes machine-learning platforms Amazon SageMaker and Amazon Bedrock plus the generative AI coding assistant Amazon Q, among other things. On the retail side, Amazon has been working to improve delivery speed, keep prices low and expand product selection. These initiatives are gaining traction, with more customers turning to Amazon for essential goods, such as deodorant and toilet paper. This category is important because customers buy these items repeatedly. Going forward, the company is focused on reducing costs across its fulfillment network through automation and AI. Lower fulfillment costs support the three customer-oriented outcomes—faster delivery, lower costs and broader selection—that can fuel sales growth. Amazon started showing ads on Prime Video content earlier this year. The change could be an ongoing source of advertising and subscription revenue growth. The company says its ad technology can link Prime Video ad spending to sales and other outcomes, which has historically been challenging for TV advertisers. The same measurement technology can also reveal opportunities to optimize ad content for better performance. Prime subscribers can upgrade to an ad-free experience for $2.99 monthly.

Elevate your journey by becoming a Forbes member. Unlock unlimited access to premium journalism plus exclusive members-only events gathering leading business minds that shape tomorrow. Risks to watch for Amazon include rising competition in retail and cloud computing, plus a pending antitrust lawsuit filed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Amazon was the first to offer free shipping with a subscription, but others have followed suit. The closest Prime competitor currently is Walmart+. This program includes free shipping and delivery from Walmart stores, plus discounts on gas, entertainment and fast food. The annual price of $98 undercuts Prime's yearly rate of $139. Target also launched a paid membership product this year, called Target Circle 360. Members primarily get free two-day shipping. There are additionally many other discount online retailers that compete with Amazon, either comprehensively or in specific categories. Examples include eBay, Temu and Flipkart plus Newegg for electronics and Shein for clothes. Amazon holds the top spot in cloud computing now, but Microsoft has been moving closer. The AI boom is a strong motivation to close the gap. Building out the best cloud offering for AI computing will require continued investments in infrastructure and innovation. All three of the top providers—Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet—have deep pockets, which sets the stage for an ongoing competitive battle. In September 2023, the Federal Trade Commission and 17 state attorneys general sued Amazon for illegal, anti-competitive actions in its e-commerce business. Amazon has publicly defended its practices as being in the customer's best interest. The case could ultimately force Amazon to change its business practices or restructure. Fortunately, any damaging outcomes are likely years away, which means the process is more of a concern today than the result. If the case drags on for years, it could become an expensive distraction for Amazon. According to Amazon's second quarter 2024 earnings call, strategic priorities for next year include: Analyst predictions for Amazon characterize it as one of the best stocks to buy right now. Across 41 covering analysts, 24 rate AMZN stock a strong buy. The remaining 17 are buy ratings. There are no hold, sell or strong sell ratings. The stock currently trades at about $193 per share. Analyst price targets range from $145 to $265, with a consensus of $220.59. The midpoint represents upside of about 14%. In terms of financial results, analysts expect nearly 13% revenue growth and 66% EPS growth this year. The outlook for 2025 is about 11% revenue growth and 23% EPS growth. Amazon stock has bounced back from a tough 2022, notching roughly 60% growth over the past two years. Investors have been largely positive on AMZN in 2024, except for a dip after a disappointing jobs report in early August. The S&P 500, Amazon's tech peers and many of the best ETFs followed similar trajectories. The current stock price is about 4% below AMZN's July high point of $201.20. Amazon has momentum in AWS and retail sales, which collectively provide much of its revenue and operating income. Assuming the Fed continues to lower interest rates and the U.S. economy responds well to those changes, AMZN stock could see a double-digit lift in 2025. Additionally, several of Amazon's valuation metrics are below their five-year averages, which provides an extra margin of safety. The company's P/E ratio, for example, is 46.27. That compares favorably to the five-year average P/E of 75.63. Amazon has a pesky lawsuit in play and potentially stiff competition for cloud computing and retail sales. Even so, the tech giant has business momentum that could drive double-digit appreciation over the next 12 months. Add in reasonable valuation ratios and it's easy to argue that now may be the time to add Amazon to your portfolio. Amazon's stock price in 2025 will be affected by its success in establishing AWS as the top platform choice for AI computing. Operational execution of the Project Kuiper satellite internet project may also sway investors to trade AMZN stock. Analysts generally see more upside in Amazon's stock price than Microsoft or Apple. Nvidia and Alphabet, however, are predicted to outpace Amazon over the next year. The Federal Trade Commission has filed an antitrust lawsuit against Amazon. A quick settlement is not likely, so the suit may consume resources and be a major distraction for the e-commerce retailer and cloud provider. AWS is a key profit driver for Amazon, now and in the future. Over the last 12 months, AWS contributed 16% of Amazon's net sales and 60% of the company's operating income. Amazon is a good buy for long-term investors. The stock is volatile in the short term, but the diversification of Amazon's business model and brand recognition within multiple sectors are positives.

Copyright 2022 The Associated Press. All rights reserved Where is Amazon's (AMZN) stock price heading next year? Let's formulate a prediction by running through the key factors, including the company's current position, primary growth drivers, potential challenges and strategic initiatives in play. Amazon has leading market share in two industries, e-commerce retail and cloud computing, plus a third-place share in U.S. digital advertising. Here are the numbers, according to Statista: Amazon has been a strong growth story for investors since 2010. In that period, AMZN stock grew from a split-adjusted $6 to nearly $200. The climb has not been linear, however. Shareholders benefited from a big spike in late-2020, which largely held until 2022. Like several of its tech counterparts, AMZN shed value in that year, dipping enough to walk back two years of gains. After falling to nearly $80 in December 2022, AMZN stock made a rocky climb to eclipse $200 in July of this year. Investors have since pulled back from that peak and the stock now trades at just over $190. Much more than breaking news, our diverse reporting digs deeper with unparalleled insights that empower you to make better informed decisions. Become a Forbes member and unlock unlimited access to cutting-edge strategies, actionable insights, and updated analysis from our network of leading finance experts. Likely sources of growth for Amazon going forward include AWS, which will benefit from the AI boom, e-commerce sales and the rollout of advertising on Prime Video. Amazon is working to establish AWS as the first platform of choice for AI computing. That initiative involves offering customers a range of hardware and software choices at different price points. To do that, Amazon developed its own AI training and inference chips, called Trainium and Inferentia, respectively. The first generation of the in-house chips has been well-received, and Amazon expects to release updated versions later this year. As well, the company continues to enhance its software stack for AI developers. That stack includes machine-learning platforms Amazon SageMaker and Amazon Bedrock plus the generative AI coding assistant Amazon Q, among other things. On the retail side, Amazon has been working to improve delivery speed, keep prices low and expand product selection. These initiatives are gaining traction, with more customers turning to Amazon for essential goods, such as deodorant and toilet paper. This category is important because customers buy these items repeatedly. Going forward, the company is focused on reducing costs across its fulfillment network through automation and AI. Lower fulfillment costs support the three customer-oriented outcomes—faster delivery, lower costs and broader selection—that can fuel sales growth. Amazon started showing ads on Prime Video content earlier this year. The change could be an ongoing source of advertising and subscription revenue growth. The company says its ad technology can link Prime Video ad spending to sales and other outcomes, which has historically been challenging for TV advertisers. The same measurement technology can also reveal opportunities to optimize ad content for better performance. Prime subscribers can upgrade to an ad-free experience for $2.99 monthly.

Risks to watch for Amazon include rising competition in retail and cloud computing, plus a pending antitrust lawsuit filed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Amazon was the first to offer free shipping with a subscription, but others have followed suit. The closest Prime competitor currently is Walmart+. This program includes free shipping and delivery from Walmart stores, plus discounts on gas, entertainment and fast food. The annual price of $98 undercuts Prime's yearly rate of $139. Target also launched a paid membership product this year, called Target Circle 360. Members primarily get free two-day shipping. There are additionally many other discount online retailers that compete with Amazon, either comprehensively or in specific categories. Examples include eBay, Temu and Flipkart plus Newegg for electronics and Shein for clothes. Amazon holds the top spot in cloud computing now, but Microsoft has been moving closer. The AI boom is a strong motivation to close the gap. Building out the best cloud offering for AI computing will require continued investments in infrastructure and innovation. All three of the top providers—Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet—have deep pockets, which sets the stage for an ongoing competitive battle. In September 2023, the Federal Trade Commission and 17 state attorneys general sued Amazon for illegal, anti-competitive actions in its e-commerce business. Amazon has publicly defended its practices as being in the customer's best interest. The case could ultimately force Amazon to change its business practices or restructure. Fortunately, any damaging outcomes are likely years away, which means the process is more of a concern today than the result. If the case drags on for years, it could become an expensive distraction for Amazon. According to Amazon's second quarter 2024 earnings call, strategic priorities for next year include: Analyst predictions for Amazon characterize it as one of the best stocks to buy right now. Across 41 covering analysts, 24 rate AMZN stock a strong buy. The remaining 17 are buy ratings. There are no hold, sell or strong sell ratings. The stock currently trades at about $193 per share. Analyst price targets range from $145 to $265, with a consensus of $220.59. The midpoint represents upside of about 14%. In terms of financial results, analysts expect nearly 13% revenue growth and 66% EPS growth this year. The outlook for 2025 is about 11% revenue growth and 23% EPS growth. Amazon stock has bounced back from a tough 2022, notching roughly 60% growth over the past two years. Investors have been largely positive on AMZN in 2024, except for a dip after a disappointing jobs report in early August. The S&P 500, Amazon's tech peers and many of the best ETFs followed similar trajectories. The current stock price is about 4% below AMZN's July high point of $201.20. Amazon has momentum in AWS and retail sales, which collectively provide much of its revenue and operating income. Assuming the Fed continues to lower interest rates and the U.S. economy responds well to those changes, AMZN stock could see a double-digit lift in 2025. Additionally, several of Amazon's valuation metrics are below their five-year averages, which provides an extra margin of safety. The company's P/E ratio, for example, is 46.27. That compares favorably to the five-year average P/E of 75.63. Amazon has a pesky lawsuit in play and potentially stiff competition for cloud computing and retail sales. Even so, the tech giant has business momentum that could drive double-digit appreciation over the next 12 months. Add in reasonable valuation ratios and it's easy to argue that now may be the time to add Amazon to your portfolio. Amazon's stock price in 2025 will be affected by its success in establishing AWS as the top platform choice for AI computing. Operational execution of the Project Kuiper satellite internet project may also sway investors to trade AMZN stock. Analysts generally see more upside in Amazon's stock price than Microsoft or Apple. Nvidia and Alphabet, however, are predicted to outpace Amazon over the next year. The Federal Trade Commission has filed an antitrust lawsuit against Amazon. A quick settlement is not likely, so the suit may consume resources and be a major distraction for the e-commerce retailer and cloud provider. AWS is a key profit driver for Amazon, now and in the future. Over the last 12 months, AWS contributed 16% of Amazon's net sales and 60% of the company's operating income. Amazon is a good buy for long-term investors. The stock is volatile in the short term, but the diversification of Amazon's business model and brand recognition within multiple sectors are positives.

On Thursday, Baird reaffirmed its positive outlook on BlackLine (NASDAQ:BL), maintaining an Outperform rating and a price target of $65.00. The firm highlighted BlackLine as a bullish Fresh Pick, anticipating potential share price growth towards the end of the year. The optimism is partly based on the upcoming analyst day, which is expected to serve as a significant event for the company. The analyst day could reveal new medium- to long-term financial goals that may include an acceleration in revenue growth and ongoing margin expansion. These expectations are supported by recent industry checks which suggest a slight improvement in spending on financial suites and internal advancements within BlackLine. Baird's stance on BlackLine comes amid a cautious market sentiment, with the firm acknowledging that the company is not entirely "out of the woods." However, due to the current low expectations and valuation of the company's shares, Baird sees a path for upside potential. The firm's reiteration of the Outperform rating and price target reflects a belief in the company's ability to overcome present challenges. BlackLine's analyst day is being closely watched as a potential turning point for the company's financial trajectory and stock performance. In other recent news, BlackLine, Inc. reported a significant growth in its Q2 2024 earnings, with a revenue of $161 million and a non-GAAP net income of $43 million. The company's strategic product portfolio, particularly in consolidation and financial analytics, had a strong quarter. In addition, BlackLine appointed David Henshall to its Board of Directors, a move expected to strengthen the company's strategic direction and governance due to Henshall's extensive background in enterprise software and financial management. In terms of investment activity, Soros Capital Management sold off its stakes in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), while Jana Partners established a new position in BlackLine Systems, owning nearly a 2% stake in the company. The Saudi Public Investment Fund added call positions in PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), Microsoft, and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), increasing the value of its U.S. stock holdings to roughly $20.7 billion. Looking ahead, BlackLine expects a total GAAP revenue for Q3 to be between $162 million and $164 million, indicating an 8% to 9% growth. These are the recent developments in the company's financial performance and strategic initiatives. As always, this information is based on the analysis of independent sources and does not contain personal opinions or predictions. As BlackLine (NASDAQ:BL) approaches its analyst day with Baird maintaining an Outperform rating, InvestingPro data underscores some financial metrics worth considering. The company's market capitalization stands at $3.15 billion, with a Price/Earnings (P/E) ratio of 25.66, indicating investor expectations of future earnings growth. Notably, BlackLine's revenue growth over the last twelve months as of Q2 2024 has been 11.94%, reflecting a consistent upward trajectory in its financial performance. Two InvestingPro Tips that align with Baird's positive outlook include BlackLine's high shareholder yield and the expectation that net income will grow this year. With analysts predicting the company will be profitable this year, these tips further support the optimism surrounding BlackLine's financial outlook.

Title: A weight loss drug developer's stock soars after a $198 million IPO

Time Published: 2024-09-26T18:36:00Z

Shares of BioAge Labs (BIOA), a biopharmaceutical company focused on obesity drugs, opened 25% above its initial public offering (IPO) price on Thursday. The Richmond, California-based company set the price for its IPO at $18 a share Wednesday evening. The company aimed to raise nearly $200 million by offering 11 million shares at this price in an upsized IPO, according to a press release. BioAge initially said that it planned to only offer 7.5 million shares between $17 to $19 each. The company’s stock initially surged 24% to over $22 per share Thursday. It is trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol “BIOA.” The IPO comes amid a surge of investor interest in a new class of weight loss medications known as GLP-1s. These drugs, which mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar, have shown remarkable effectiveness in treating obesity and type 2 diabetes. Market leaders Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY), the pharmaceutical giants behind popular GLP-1 drugs Wegovy and Zepbound, have seen their stock prices soar as a result. Over the past 12 months, Novo Nordisk’s stock has climbed 39%, while Eli Lilly’s has surged 68%. These gains reflect investors’ bullish outlook on the future of the obesity drug market. Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts anticipate the global market for GLP-1 drugs will reach $105 billion by 2030. BioAge is now trying to get in on the action. In an SEC filing, the company said it is targeting obesity and diabetes drugs due to their “high prevalence and resulting potential for impact on population health” and “outsized commercial opportunities.” BioAge’s leading drug candidate is azelaprag, a pill that mimics apelin, a peptide released during exercise that decreases with age. Early clinical trial results suggest that taking azelaprag along with an injectable weight loss drug results in increased weight loss and prevents muscle mass loss, a side-effect of current weight loss drugs. BioAge started a phase 2 clinical trial this year of azelaprag in combination with tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Eli Lilly’s Zepbound. The company plans to start a second phase 2 trial of the drug next year to see how it works with semaglutide, the drug behind Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy and Ozempic. BioAge’s IPO comes just months after it raised $170 million in financing this past February. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Baird raises Meta Platforms stock target on ad checks

On Thursday, Baird, a financial services firm, updated its outlook on Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:META), increasing the price target to $605 from the previous $530. The firm has maintained an Outperform rating on the stock. The adjustment comes after Baird's review of the company's advertising performance, which showed a positive trend, particularly in September when compared to August. The analyst from Baird expressed confidence in the near-term estimates for Meta Platforms, based on the Q3 advertising checks. The firm's decision to raise the 2025 growth target for Meta is attributed to steady macroeconomic trends and anticipated contributions from messaging, devices, and AI-driven platform enhancements. These factors are expected to bolster the company's growth trajectory. Despite projecting slightly lower operating margins than the consensus due to anticipated higher networking and depreciation costs associated with infrastructure development, Baird's revised price target is based on sector multiples that align with the industry. The firm believes this new target offers a substantial upside potential for Meta Platforms. Baird's analysis indicates that while the firm anticipates increased costs in building out Meta's infrastructure, the overall outlook remains positive. This is due to the company's robust advertising checks and the expected growth from new initiatives and enhancements to the platform. In other recent news, Meta Platforms Inc. has seen a price target increase to $640 from JPMorgan, emphasizing the company's advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). Meta's AI, with substantial user engagement, is projected to become the world's most-used AI assistant by 2024. The company's significant investment in AI and the Metaverse, despite substantial projected losses, is backed by its strong operating results and early benefits of AI in user engagement and monetization. Oppenheimer maintains an Outperform rating for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., despite Meta's unveiling of its lightweight AR glasses prototype, Orion, which has not posed a significant threat to Apple's rumored Apple Vision Pro. Meanwhile, Citi maintains a Buy rating for Meta, highlighting the company's potential in AI innovation. JMP Securities has also raised its price target for Meta, lauding the company's AI-powered Orion glasses as revolutionary. Meta is also actively engaging with the European Union regarding the upcoming enforcement of the AI Act, though it has chosen not to immediately join the European Union's AI Pact. In a move towards environmental responsibility, Meta has secured up to 3.9 million carbon offset credits, marking a significant step towards achieving net-zero emissions by 2030. As Baird sets a higher price target for Meta Platforms Inc., investors might find the real-time metrics from InvestingPro to be a valuable addition to the analysis. With a substantial market capitalization of $1.44 trillion, Meta's financial health and market position are critical to understanding its potential. The company's P/E ratio stands at a competitive 28.42, indicating a reasonable valuation relative to its earnings. Moreover, the adjusted P/E ratio for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024 is slightly lower at 26.66, which could signal a favorable investment opportunity when paired with the company's near-term earnings growth. InvestingPro Tips highlight Meta's perfect Piotroski Score of 9, reflecting strong financial conditions, and the fact that the company holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, providing financial flexibility. These factors, combined with Meta's impressive gross profit margins of 81.49%, underscore the company's efficiency in generating income relative to its revenue. Additionally, Meta is trading at a high Price / Book multiple of 9.17, which investors may interpret as a sign of the company's robust assets and growth potential. For those interested in further insights, InvestingPro offers additional tips, providing a comprehensive outlook on Meta's financial health and market prospects. With the next earnings date slated for October 23, 2024, market participants will be keen to see if Meta's performance aligns with Baird's positive projections and whether the company can sustain its momentum in the competitive Interactive Media & Services industry.

Editions: En/basketball/nba ESPN cuts ties with Zach Lowe Zach Lowe is a well-known figure in the basketball world, celebrated for his sharp analysis and insightful commentary on the NBA. As a senior writer for ESPN, he built a reputation over his more than ten years with the network, having first joined Bill Simmons' Grantland in 2012. Lowe's journey through the world of sports journalism has been marked by his keen understanding of the game, as well as his ability to break down complex strategies in a way that fans can appreciate. He also hosted the popular Lowe Post podcast and frequently appeared on NBA Today, making him a familiar face to basketball enthusiasts everywhere. Unfortunately, the latest buzz in sports media reveals that Lowe is no longer with ESPN. According to Andrew Marchand from The Athletic, Lowe's dismissal was part of a wave of layoffs that has recently hit the network, which also saw notable departures like Robert Griffin III and Samantha Ponder just before the football season kicked off. Reports suggest that Lowe's salary-over a million dollars a year-was a significant factor in the decision to let him go. As one insider noted, "His salary was the biggest factor in his dismissal from ESPN," highlighting the tough choices networks face in today's changing media landscape. Despite this setback, there might be a silver lining for Lowe. With NBC and Amazon ramping up their NBA coverage in anticipation of new rights agreements in 2025, opportunities could be on the horizon. Both networks are keen to bring in top-notch talent, and Lowe's experience and credibility in the field make him a prime candidate for their future plans. Interestingly, this shake-up in the sports media world comes on the heels of a surprising announcement from another basketball luminary, Adrian Wojnarowski. Woj, ESPN's lead NBA reporter, revealed his departure to become the general manager of St. Bonaventure's men's basketball team. In a heartfelt message posted on X, he shared, "This craft transformed my life," expressing his appreciation for the journey that sports journalism has taken him on. As for Lowe, while the road ahead may seem uncertain, his contributions to the NBA discourse have been invaluable, and his passion for the game will surely lead him to new and exciting ventures. The basketball community will be watching closely to see where this talented writer lands next. © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U. All rights reserved. Follow us

Title: Kazakhstan's Fintech Giant Kaspi.kz Embroiled in Sanctions Controversy

We provide what many… More Info Kazakhstan has defended the country's second-largest lender as being "fully" compliant with sanctions against Russia after a scathing report saw around 20 percent wiped off the Nasdaq-listed Kaspi.kz's stock price. A September 19 report published by Culper Research poured doubt on the claim by fintech giant Kaspi that it lacks exposure to sanctions-struck Russia and raised concerns about the group's past affiliations to a relative of former President Nursultan Nazarbaev who was convicted by a Kazakh court of major embezzlement in 2022. In a September 19 statement, Kaspi.kz called Culper's report "misleading" and "inaccurate." The report, Kaspi.kz (KSPI): The NASDAQ-Listed Fintech Moving Money For Criminals And Kleptocrats, focused on Kaspi.kz's issuance of bank cards to Russians, tens of thousands of whom arrived in Kazakhstan in the wake of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. "As the U.S. and other nations continue to broaden sanctions against those found to be aiding Russia's wartime economy, we believe Kaspi now risks secondary sanctions," the report warned, justifying its "short" position on the company. Kaspi.kz is widely viewed as a success story in Kazakhstan, going from a relatively obscure bank to the country's leader in mobile payments and online marketplace services in some 20 years. SEE ALSO: In a September 23 statement, Kazakhstan's Agency for Regulation and Development of Financial Markets called Kaspi "one of the country's systemically important and steadily developing banks, demonstrating sustainable growth and a high level of transparency." "The bank fully complies with the sanctions regime of the U.S., the European Union, and other foreign countries," the agency said, referring to the sanctions imposed on Russia over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The main shareholders in Kaspi.kz are Kazakh billionaire Vyacheslav Kim, Georgia-born Mikhail Lomtadze, and Baring Funds, part of a Commonwealth of Independent States-focused private equity investor. Kaspi.kz listed in 2020 on the London Stock Exchange to become the its largest international tech public offering that year. In January it joined the Nasdaq in an initial public offering that saw the business valued at $17.5 billion. "Being the first company from Kazakhstan to successfully list on Nasdaq has obviously raised our profile amongst short sellers," Kaspi.kz said in its statement. Nazarbaev's nephew, Kairat Satybaldy, who once held a stake of around 30 percent in Kaspi, exited the company prior to the successful listings. In August, Lomtadze, who is CEO of Kaspi.kz, declared the company's intention to compete in the forthcoming privatization of Humo, neighboring Uzbekistan's state-backed payment system. In May, Lomtadze was revealed as the new owner of Wycombe Wanderers, a third-tier English soccer club.

Title: Volatile Month for Nvidia Stock Continues

Time Published: 2024-09-26T17:57:54Z
Full Content:
The volatile month for shares of Nvidia (NVDA) continued Thursday, as the stock surged in early trading only to slip into negative territory in the afternoon. The chip-maker’s shares, the year’s second-best performers in the S&P 500, rose more than 3% in the opening minutes of Thursday's session to trade near $127. That put them substantially above the roughly $119 at which they finished August, marking a recovery from September intraday lows near $101. In recent trading, however, the stock was down about 0.2% near $123, as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite also came off their earlier highs. The early move Thursday came as earnings from Micron (MU), a Nvidia partner, came in better than expected, sending chip stocks higher across the board. Micron pointed to "robust AI demand" as it issued a rosy revenue outlook. Bank of America analysts in a Thursday note said Micron’s results pointed to “a positive read-across” for Nvidia and other semi stocks. Wall Street analysts are still broadly bullish on Nvidia’s shares. Nearly all of the analysts currently tracking the stock have “buy” ratings on it, according to Visible Alpha data, while their mean price target of $152.52 represents a more than 20% premium to Wednesday’s closing price. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang earlier this week reported the conclusion of a planned sale of some $700 million in company stock.

Title: Amazon Employees Are Overwhelmingly ‘Dissatisfied’ With CEO Andy Jassy’s RTO Mandate

Time Published: 2024-09-26T17:49:07Z
Full Content:
The majority of Amazon (AMZN) employees are overwhelmingly unhappy with CEO Andy Jassy’s new return-to-office (RTO) mandate and are considering looking for new jobs, according to a recent survey conducted by Team Blind, an anonymous social platform for verified tech workers. A poll of more than 2,500 Amazon employees found that 91 percent are “dissatisfied” with the new five-day in-office policy, which will come into effect in January 2025. “My morale for this job is gone,” one said in a post. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. Like most other tech companies, Amazon embraced remote work during the pandemic and has since reverted to a three-day in-office policy. Now, in an effort to rebuild the company’s culture and boost collaboration, Jassy’s RTO measure will only allow employees to work from home under extenuating circumstances like illnesses. The change will help ensure Amazon operates “like the world’s largest startup,” according to the CEO. Amazon employees don’t appear to share Jassy’s sentiments. Blind’s survey was conducted between Sept. 17 (a day after Jassy announced the RTO mandate) to Sept. 19 and found that three quarters of polled workers are considering looking for another job because of the new policy, while 32 percent said they know someone who has quit recently in response to Jassy’s mandate. Amazon’s HR is scrambling to fill the void. “I just had an Amazon recruiter blow up my phone and inbox five times in the last 24 hours to get me to provide my availability for an onsite interview,” said a Microsoft (MSFT) employee on Blind, adding that the recruiter said hiring managers are frustrated by the amount of Amazon candidates who have dropped out of interview processes in response to the news. For Amazon employees who were hired remotely, some are viewing the mandate as a thinly veiled strategy to cut headcount. The company’s workforce reportedly surged by nearly 75 percent between March 2020 and September 2021 alone. “Many of those folks are concerned that they don’t live anywhere close to an office, and they were hired with the expectation of being remote,” Rick Chen, Blind’s head of public relations, told Observer. Only a small percentage of employees are okay with RTO, with 9 percent saying they are “satisfied” with Jassy’s mandate. “There were some defenders of the policy, folks that prefer to work in the office and disliked remote work,” said Chen, who noted that a few Amazon employees also suggested that the end of remote work was caused by a few “bad apples'” who “ruined it for everyone by taking quiet vacations or slacking off.” Another trending response to Amazon’s RTO policy is concern amongst other Big Tech workers that their company is next. In addition to worried employees from Apple (AAPL), Meta (META) and Google (GOOGL), all of which also currently have a three-day in-office policy, Microsoft professionals—who are allowed to work remotely 50 percent of the time—have overwhelmingly voiced concerns that Microsoft will follow Amazon’s lead, according to Chen. This could be due to a geographic connection, as both Amazon and Microsoft are based near Seattle, Wash., he said. Such comments echo those made in 2022 and 2023 when large tech companies announced layoffs one after the other, said Chen. “The was a feeling among professionals then, and it’s resurfacing now, that these companies are moving in lockstep with one another.” Blind has noticed an unusual uptick in search volume for the term “RTO” since Jassy’s announcement. While the phrase was previously searched by 500 employees on a daily basis at the beginning of 2024, that figure has since doubled this month to 1,000, Chen said. Other keywords like “remote work” and “flexible work” have also gained popularity in lieu of previously common search terms like “layoffs,” “manager” and “promotion.” “It’s a very extreme shift in terms of what is capturing Amazon professionals’ mind space right now,” said Chen.

In the past year-plus, ESPN has made some massive changes to their NBA coverage team. A year ago, Jalen Rose, Jeff Van Gundy, and Mark Jackson were all let go as part of company-wide layoffs. Doc Rivers stepped in to the lead booth along with Doris Burke but left for the Bucks head coaching job midseason. JJ Redick was elevated into Rivers’ spot, but promptly took the Lakers job at the end of the season. Most recently, the league’s top newsbreaker, Adrian Wojnarowski, announced his shocking retirement to go work for his beloved alma mater, St. Bonaventure. With Woj already gone, another bomb dropped on Thursday when The Athletic’s Andrew Marchand brought word that ESPN was also laying off its top NBA writer and podcaster, Zach Lowe. Per Marchand, Lowe being let go falls in line with the Robert Griffin III and Samantha Ponder departures earlier this year, as Lowe made north of seven figures annually and was fired for budget reasons. Lowe was the most prominent NBA writer not only on ESPN’s staff, but arguably in the entire league. Beyond his written work, Lowe’s podcast, The Lowe Post, has been extremely popular and he has been a regular contributor on TV with NBA Today and other studio shows. Lowe had been at ESPN for more than a decade, starting his career at Grantland and then moving over to the dot com after they shuttered the Bill Simmons-led site. As such, many would expect the Ringer to be a potential landing spot for Lowe, who immediately becomes the most sought after free agent in the NBA writing and podcasting space. He also could be in play for NBC and Amazon, as they both get set to be new national broadcast partners of the NBA in 2025-26. As for ESPN, they are now tasked with not only reshaping their NBA coverage on the TV side, still needing to figure out their lead booth and the potential domino effect that will have on their other game broadcasts, but also their written coverage with Lowe and Woj both gone.

Title: What’s up with… Deutsche Telekom & Meta, SpaceX, AT&T

Sep 26, 2024 In today’s industry news roundup: Giant German telco accuses Meta of “twisting the facts” in the duo’s ongoing peering payments row; SpaceX is courting Vietnam, where it wants its Starlink operation to become a major broadband service provider, with talk of a $1.5bn investment; AT&T has deployed plug-and-play IT stacks to support its MVNO operations; and more! Deutsche Telekom has hit back at Meta’s decision, announced on 25 September, to end its direct peering relationship with the giant German telco, a move that might degrade the quality of service that DT’s mobile customers might experience when using popular applications, such as Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook and Messenger. Meta accused DT of “putting the open internet at risk and undermining net neutrality principles” and of “using its market power to put its subscribers in Germany behind a de facto paywall, potentially restricting their access to internet services that do not pay Deutsche Telekom” by asking Meta to pay for feeding traffic onto the telco’s networks. Now the telco has responded, saying that Meta is “once again twisting the facts,” and noting that historically Meta has paid a peering fee but stopped its payments during the Coronavirus lockdowns and is failing to renegotiate peering terms. According to DT, by ending its direct connection to the German operator, Meta is “once again abusing its overwhelming bargaining power to discredit legitimate concerns of the European telecommunications industry and consumers in order to avoid fair payment. This is not just about a difference of opinion between two companies,” it added, “but about the question of whether the power of the strongest prevails on the internet or whether there is a fair balance between all participants. We hope that this debate will not be carried out on the backs of the citizens. Even a company like Meta is not above the law.” Let’s hope this ultimately gets settled amicably and that millions of German users don’t end up suffering a degraded service. Deutsche Telekom and Meta aren’t the only ones currently engaged in a war of words. AT&T and Broadcom, which now owns US telco VMware, are locked in a legal battle over the terms of VMware’s licence agreement, as reported earlier this month. AT&T claims that Broadcom, which shifted VMware to a subscription model from its traditional perpetual licence model, is failing to honour a contract agreed with VMware before the chip giant closed its $61bn acquisition of the cloud platform vendor. Now, according to Ars Technica, Broadcom has responded with claims that AT&T has no case as it knew VMware was heading towards a subscription model before it was acquired by Broadcom, adding that the telco is resorting to “sensationalism by accusing Broadcom of using ‘bullying tactics’ and ‘price gouging’. Such attacks are intended to generate press [coverage] and distract the court from a much simpler story.” This dispute will be closely watched by many telcos and other large VMware customers, which have found themselves having to deal with a less economic cost model in recent months. Elon Musk’s SpaceX plans to invest $1.5bn in Vietnam, the satellite company’s senior VP for global business and government affairs, Tim Hughes, told Vietnam’s State President Tô Lâm during a meeting in New York this week, state-backed Viet Nam News has reported. “The Vietnamese government is weighing the investment proposal” and is “asking SpaceX to closely coordinate with relevant Vietnamese agencies and partners to complete investment procedures,” the news agency noted. SpaceX’s low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite broadband service provider, Starlink, has been seeking clearance to provide services in Vietnam and it seems clear from the report that the Vietnamese government is open to having Starlink provide data connectivity in rural and remote areas and, in doing so, help the government respond to natural disasters more effectively. Starlink is currently in negotiations about how it can provide its services while meeting Vietnam’s foreign ownership rules: The country recently liberalised its digital infrastructure ownership regulations and that has resulted in growing interest and investments in the country as a hub for datacentres – see Vietnam now a magnet for datacentre developers. AT&T has become the first US operator to achieve ‘Running on ODA’ accreditation from industry body the TM Forum. Running on ODA status is awarded to network operators that have built software stacks that conform with the forum’s open digital architecture (ODA) and open APIs, which enable a more modular, plug-and-play approach to telecom IT operations. AT&T adopted an ODA approach for the back-office operations of its MVNx Ecosystems unit, enabling mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) that use AT&T’s mobile network to reach their customers “to offer their own branded mobile services without having to invest in the expensive infrastructure typically required to operate a mobile network. ODA is a critical foundation for delivering this service, providing a common framework on which AT&T’s customers can innovate and offer new experiences by integrating network capabilities into their products and services,” noted the TM Forum in this announcement. “I’m delighted that AT&T has further demonstrated its commitment to ODA and open API standards by gaining Running on ODA accreditation for its MVNx Ecosystems group,” noted Andy Tiller, EVP of member products and services at the TM Forum. “By embracing ODA, AT&T is making it easier and faster for its partners to build and launch new services, leveraging the power of AT&T’s network. This means more innovative offerings and greater choice for consumers,” added Tiller. For more on ODA see DT, Orange et al join the ‘running on ODA’ club. Not for the first time, large language model (LLM) developer OpenAI, best known for its Chat GPT generative AI (GenAI) application, has suffered a top management meltdown. The company nearly imploded late last year when CEO Sam Altman was sacked, appeared to be hired by OpenAI investor Microsoft, and was then reinstated as head honcho of OpenAI. Now, just as the company is in discussions for a fresh round of funding – reportedly $6.5bn at a valuation of $150bn – OpenAI’s influential CTO, Mira Murati, quit suddenly on Wednesday, announcing her departure via a post on X. Murati was not alone – VP of research Barret Zoph and chief research officer Bob McGrew also quit the company which, according to Reuters, might be shifting from ‘not-for-profit’ governance to a ‘for-profit’ model. The trio’s departure marks something of an ongoing brain drain at OpenAI: In August, co-founder John Schulman joined rival AI firm Anthropic, and another co-founder, Greg Brockman, announced he was taking a sabbatical until the end of 2024. Earlier in the year, another co-founder, chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, left the company. As you might expect, seasoned industry analyst Richard Windsor is not impressed with recent development at OpenAI: “How this [company] is worth $150bn is beyond me,” he noted in his latest Radio Free Mobile blog. Orange’s decision to delist from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and voluntarily deregister with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), announced on Wednesday, is simply a matter of reducing the telco’s administrative workload, a spokesperson for the telco told Reuters after the announcement resulted in a dip in the company’s share price on the Paris stock exchange. Orange noted in its official announcement about the decision that the move “is in line with the group’s aim to improve internal simplification and efficiency, while maintaining the highest standards of corporate governance and transparent financial reporting. Orange remains fully committed to an open and frequent dialogue with US investors. This decision is expected to have no impact on Orange’s clients and partners or its commercial presence in the US.” Ericsson and optical networking module developer Nubis Communications used this week’s ECOC trade show, held in Frankfurt, to propose the use of co-packaged optics in future radio access network (RAN) architectures. “Co-packaged optics can enable high capacity at low energy consumption in future RAN networks, but dedicated developments are needed,” noted Ericsson in this blog. “In a demo at ECOC 2024, Ericsson and Nubis showcased the ability to operate at high temperatures commonly found within radio units, compatibility with standard optical fibres, and implementation of automated eye-safety mechanisms. This can be very beneficial in the networks of the future, including 6G,” stated the vendor, pointing out that such technology is not currently used in RAN deployments as pluggable optics are currently meeting network operators’ needs. However, data traffic growth will put a strain on pluggables, the partners suggested. To find out more about the case for co-packaged optics in the RAN, check out this blog. – The staff, TelecomTV Sep 27, 2024 Sep 26, 2024 Sep 25, 2024 Sep 25, 2024 Sep 25, 2024 Sign up to receive TelecomTV's top news and videos, plus exclusive subscriber-only content direct to your inbox.

Berenberg has maintained its Hold rating on Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) (NYSE: NVO) shares with a price target of DKK975.00. The firm's stance comes in light of investor sentiments around the potential impact of the Phase 3 (P3) trial results for CagriSema, an investigational therapy by Novo Nordisk. Market response to unfavorable trial outcomes is anticipated to have a greater effect on the company's stock value compared to positive trial results. The firm acknowledges the growing uncertainty in the competitive landscape and pricing dynamics within the industry, which were previously addressed in Berenberg's report titled "Embracing the curves of obesity." These factors, combined with the pivotal nature of the CagriSema trial results, are expected to keep a lid on Novo Nordisk's stock performance for the foreseeable future. Novo Nordisk is a global healthcare company with a focus on diabetes care and other serious chronic conditions. In other recent news, Novo Nordisk has been in the spotlight with its CEO, Lars Jorgensen, testifying on drug pricing before the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. The focus of the hearing was the pricing of the company's weight-loss and diabetes medications, Wegovy and Ozempic. Novo Nordisk has also been investing heavily in research and development, with $4.2 billion spent in 2023 on diabetes and obesity alone. In parallel, BMO Capital Markets maintained an Outperform rating on Novo Nordisk, despite the mixed results from the phase 2a trial of Monlunabant, a weight loss drug. The trial exhibited a 5.8% placebo-adjusted weight loss at 16 weeks, which surpassed the performance of previous CB1 receptor antagonists at the 52-week mark. Despite the drug's strong efficacy, increasing the dosage beyond 10mg did not yield significant additional benefits. Additionally, a lawsuit against the U.S. law mandating drug price negotiations for Medicare was revived by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. This could potentially impact Novo Nordisk, as its diabetes medication, Ozempic, is under scrutiny for potential inclusion in the 2027 Medicare price negotiations. Despite disappointing results from the Phase II obesity trial of monlunabant, TD Cowen maintained its Buy rating on Novo Nordisk's shares. The trial showed a weight loss of approximately 6-7% at the 16-week mark, with some mild to moderate neuropsychiatric side effects noted. Lastly, Novo Nordisk's shares experienced a significant drop following the release of underwhelming trial results for its obesity pill, monlunabant. The trial results showed that monlunabant led to a weight loss of 6.5% after 16 weeks of treatment, which fell short of the anticipated 15% weight loss. As investors weigh Berenberg's hold rating and the potential outcomes of Novo Nordisk's CagriSema trials, it's crucial to consider the company's financial health and market position. According to InvestingPro data, Novo Nordisk boasts a robust market capitalization of $560.71 billion, reflecting its significant presence in the pharmaceuticals industry. The company's gross profit margin stands impressively at 84.53% over the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, indicating strong profitability in its operations. InvestingPro Tips highlight Novo Nordisk's consistent dividend payments, with a track record of maintaining these for 36 consecutive years and raising them for the past 7 years. This could be a reassuring sign for investors looking for stability amidst the uncertainties surrounding the trial results. However, it's noteworthy that the company is trading at a high earnings multiple with a P/E ratio of 41.96, suggesting a premium valuation that may already reflect high expectations from the market. For those seeking deeper insights, InvestingPro offers additional tips on Novo Nordisk, which could help investors make more informed decisions. With the next earnings date slated for November 6, 2024, keeping an eye on these metrics and the broader industry context could be pivotal. For further details and analysis, investors are encouraged to explore the full range of InvestingPro Tips available for Novo Nordisk.

Title: A risk-averse sustainable perishable food supply chain considering production and delivery times with real-world application
URL: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308332
Time Published: 2024-09-26T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
In recent years, a relatively novel paradigm known as sustainable development has been introduced in response to concerns regarding the adverse impact of industrial activities on the environment and society. Managers in the food sector have been attempting to incorporate the principle of sustainable development in their supply chains owing to the paramount importance of social and environmental considerations in creating a competitive advantage for food products. To this end, we propose a multi-objective linear mathematical model considering the three dimensions of sustainability, i.e. economic, environmental, and social, to design a sustainable food supply chain. Given today’s volatile business environment, we employ a robust optimization model by incorporating Conditional Value-at-Risk into the configuration of two-stage stochastic programming to tackle uncertainty and take up a risk-averse strategy in supply chain design. The model aims to identify the optimal production and delivery times of the products, investigate the effects of their perishability characteristic on inventory decisions, and assess the financial and environmental advantages of transportation decisions to improve the sustainability of logistics operations. A novel version of fuzzy goal programming approach is applied to solve the proposed model. Next, the applicability of the proposed model and its solution method is verified based on computational experiments on a real-world case study of a processed food company. Lastly, conflicts between the sustainability aspects are examined, and several sensitivity analyses on risk-aversion parameters are performed to provide managerial insights for industry executives seeking to optimize their network concerning sustainability issues and well-performance under worst-case scenarios.

A supply chain (SC) is a set of processes and flows that take place within and between different network components, including all parties directly or indirectly involved in fulfilling customers’ demands. The food supply chain (FSC) is perceived as critical infrastructure as it ensures the wellbeing and food security of customers and yields profit for the firms involved [1]. According to projections, the global food demand is expected to rise by 50% by 2030 [2]. The food industry has experienced enormous challenges in recent decades. The COVID-19 pandemic, for instance, has caused a worldwide spike in food demand over the last four years. Consequently, optimal decisions and efficient SC management are needed to respond to the continuously growing food demand [3]. Researchers and practitioners often classify SC decisions according to the length of the planning horizon into three categories: strategic, tactical, and operational [4]. Supply chain network design (SCND) comprises a set of crucial strategic decisions that determine the number, location, and capacity of facilities as well as the flow between them [5]. Through its influence on tactical and operational decisions, SCND significantly affects product quality, service level, material flow, customer satisfaction, and return on investment [6]. Typically, SCND in the food industry involves a high level of complexity due to the unique characteristics of foodstuff, such as perishability [7, 8]. Unlike many types of commodities, the demand for food is directly affected by the age and freshness of the products. Hence, failure to provide customers with high-quality, fresh food products often leads to a decrease in demand and thereby a dramatic decline in profitability [9]. Therefore, the perishable nature of food products imposes additional costs on the SC and requires continuous monitoring and replenishment of inventory levels in facilities to keep the inventory fresh and consumable [10]. Sustainability is among the significant issues to consider in the network design of FSCs. A SC is considered sustainable when the SC management policies and innovations of the organization are aligned with the principles of sustainable development. Achieving sustainable development requires balance between economic growth, environmental protection, and social welfare [11]. Sustainable Development Goals are a set of interconnected objectives proposed by the United Nations that call for emphasis on developing sustainable FSCs and effecting fundamental changes to improve the current food systems by 2030 [12]. The World Health Organization reports that FSCs release a significant amount of pollutants which are responsible for an estimated 20 to 30 percent of all environmental impacts [13]. Also, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), over one-third of all food produced annually is wasted. So, food waste is the biggest threat to global food security, and reducing food waste is essential to achieving global food security and sustainable development [14]. On the other hand, risk management in the field of SCND has drawn increasing interest among scholars and industry practitioners [15]. There is a high degree of interdependence between network nodes in any type of SC. Therefore, the risks generated in one node often spread quickly to others and negatively impact their operational and sustainability performance [16]. The occurrence of risks is widely believed to reduce the profitability and efficiency of the SC. In the case of FSCs, risks may also accelerate the products’ deterioration rate, adversely affecting the environment and the firm’s reputation [17]. In this regard, effective risk management is essential to ensure sustainable operations [18]. SC risk refers to potential losses in terms of the objectives resulting from uncertainties in the features of the SC that can arise when a triggering event occurs [19]. In general, two types of risks can be associated with SCND problems: disruption risks and operational risks [20]. Disruption risks, including natural disasters (e.g. floods, earthquakes, and storms), human-made crises (e.g. wars and terrorist attacks), and technological malfunctions (e.g. equipment failure), can significantly undermine the performance of SCs. Operational risks, on the other hand, arise due to uncertainties in parameters such as supply, demand, transportation costs, etc. in dynamic business environments. To be precise, this type of risk is caused by the deviation of stochastic parameters from their expected values, leads to potential financial losses, and hampers the company’s efforts to meet its objectives [21, 22]. The risk-averse approach was developed to cope with uncertain parameters and guide managers when making decisions under uncertain conditions [23]. When addressing FSC problems, it is important to consider the above-mentioned concerns simultaneously. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is among the first attempts to investigate a comprehensive risk-averse sustainable FSC design problem. In this regard, we model the risk aversion approach using the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), a well-known risk measure to tackle random outcomes, volatility, and the inherent uncertainties of SCs. The proposed multi-period multi-objective programming model considers the perishability of food products based on the production and delivery times of the products and their shelf-life. Also, by addressing three objective functions, the economic, environmental, and social pillars of sustainable development are taken into consideration. We use preemptive fuzzy goal programming (PFGP), a novel multi-objective method, to solve the model. Lastly, we test the applicability of the mathematical model through computational experiments conducted on a numerical example and provide a number of managerial insights into some of the model’s critical parameters. The primary contributions, and novelty of this research can be summarized as follows: The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the literature review of the subject. Section 3 describes the problem and its mathematical formulation. Section 4 presents the solution approach of the proposed model. Section 4 is devoted to the real-world case study, computational results and sensitivity analyses on some crucial parameters. Section 5 discuses some managerial insights and practical implications. Eventually, Section 6 provides conclusions and suggestions for future research. In this section, we review the relevant prior research from three different perspectives: (1) food supply chain network design (FSCND) problems, (2) sustainable SCND problems, and (3) risk-averse SCND problems involving risk measures and uncertainty. For the works reviewed in each subsection, we provide a brief summary and then mention the contributions of our study in that regard. Finally, at the end of this section, the details of the relevant prior research and the proposed study are summarized in Table 1 to clarify research gaps. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t001 Due to the growing importance of food, there has been an increasing number of studies on the subject of FSCND in recent years. Mohammed and Wang [24] proposed a multi-objective model to design and plan a meat SC. The researchers used three different methods to solve the multi-objective model and, in the end, opted to use the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to obtain the optimal solution from the Pareto frontier. Mohammed et al. [25] expanded the aforementioned approach by presenting a multi-objective model that used stochastic programming to deal with uncertainty. The authors employed the monitoring system known as Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) to satisfy the objectives of their model. Mohammed and Wang [26] presented another mathematical model to improve the distribution system of their earlier meat SC model. Aras and Bilge [27] presented a mixed-integer linear programming model to design a FSC in Turkey. The authors utilized the minimax regret approach to deal with uncertain demand. Mohebalizadehgashti et al. [28] formulated a meat SC with the objective of minimizing the total cost and CO2 emission, as well as maximizing the capacity utilization rate of the facilities in the network. Patidar and Agrawal [29] introduced a mixed-integer non-linear programming formulation to optimize the total cost of an agricultural SC. The results indicated that the expenses incurred by farm-to-market transportation were responsible for 85% of the total SC cost. To mitigate this defect, they proposed that the farmers be classified into clusters such that their crops would be aggregated in cluster centers and transported to the market from there. Gholami-Zanjani et al. [30] developed a two-stage scenario-based model with uncertain demand and disruptions caused by an epidemic. The researchers incorporated a number of resilience strategies into the core model to design a resilient FSC. Arabsheybani and Arshadi Khasmeh [31] proposed a robust bi-objective model to design a resilient FSC with the objectives being to maximize the total profit and total resilience score. Relying on four criteria to enhance the resilience of the SC (robustness, agility, leanness, and flexibility). Gholami-Zanjani et al. [13] developed a new framework to configure a resilient green meat SC. The authors implemented two resilience strategies to hedge the network against disruptions and solved the model by applying the sample average approximation and lexicographic weighted Tchebycheff methods. The concept of sustainability has gained popularity in the last few years since it demonstrates that a SC’s competitive advantages cannot only be achieved through optimizing its economic aspects [32]. Sustainability is more emphasized in some industries, such as the food industry, due to the specific characteristics of their products. In this subsection, we survey some of the studies on sustainable SCND problems. Allaoui et al. [2] came up with a hybrid two-stage methodology to optimize a sustainable SC in which sustainable suppliers are selected using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Yakavenka et al. [33] presented a distribution network design problem for perishable food products considering the three dimensions of sustainability. The proposed model’s objectives were to minimize the total cost, total emission of transportation modes, and transportation times. Mohammadi et al. [34] developed a sustainable multi-objective model for a processed food company. The decisions made by proposed model included facility location, aggregating the flow of materials between facilities, and selecting the type of product delivery (either directly from plants or indirectly from distribution centers). Jouzdani and Govindan [35] introduced a non-linear mathematical model to design a sustainable perishable FSC. In this study, the perishability of the products followed the Weibull distribution and was affected by the use of vehicle refrigerator. Goodarzian et al. [36] formulated a bi-objective mixed-integer non-linear programming model to design a citrus fruit supply chain network. The contribution of this paper is the development of a mathematical model for designing a three-echelon network that takes into account coefficient water, CO2 emissions, and time window concurrently. Kalantari and Hosseininezhad [12] developed a sustainable model considering four risk factors: delays, fluctuation of exchange rates, quality of raw materials and production. The authors used the cross-entropy method to solve the model for large instances using the optimization software GAMS. Momenitabar et al. [37] introduced a sustainable closed-loop supply chain network that minimizes total and environmental costs, including energy consumption and pollution emissions, and maximizes employment opportunities. To reduce the environmental impacts, the circular economy concept has been addressed in this study. Momenitabar et al. [38] developed a mathematical model for designing a sustainable bioethanol supply chain network. In order to determine the best method to predict the actual amount of demand, they compared three popular machine-learning methods. In addition, the authors considered two meta-heuristic algorithms to find pareto optimum solutions for the large-scale problem. Goodarzian et al. [39] investigated a novel multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model to establish a sustainable citrus closed-loop supply chain network. The authors included the circularity strategy and the triple bottom lines of sustainability into their model. Mohammadi et al. [40] presented a mixed-integer non-linear programming model to design a sustainable FSC for perishable products. To show the validity of proposed model, they conducted several sensitivity analyses on crucial parameters and applied the model in a food company. Lastly, Momenitabar et al. [41] integrated machine-learning algorithms with quantitative optimization modeling to design a sustainable bioethanol supply chain. In this work, three machine-learning approaches have been applied to forecast the bioethanol demand as model inputs. A few studies have considered risk-aversion in SCND and their mathematical models, some of which are presented in this subsection. Noyan [42] used two-stage stochastic programming (TSSP) to design a disaster management SC under disruption and operational risks. In order to address the variability of non-deterministic parameters, the author incorporated the CVaR measure into the stochastic programming framework. Ahmadi-Javid and Seddighi [43] developed a location-routing optimization model under disruption risks to design a SC consisting of manufacturers and distributors in which a single type of commodity is distributed to several consumers. The problem was formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming model under three risk measurement policies: optimistic, cautious, and pessimistic. The authors utilized the expectation, CVaR, and worst-case risk measures to calculate the risk under each policy. Soleimani and Govindan [44] used a risk-averse TSSP method to plan and design a reverse SC in which the CVaR was used to evaluate the risk associated with the uncertainty in prices and demand for returned products. Govindan and Fattahi [45] proposed a multi-period optimization model under demand uncertainty with the goal of minimizing the total SC cost. The problem was formulated by incorporating TSSP and the CVaR into the model to address risk-aversion. Rahimi and Ghezavati [46] developed a mixed-integer linear programming model to design and plan a sustainable reverse logistics network under uncertainty. The authors applied a risk-averse TSSP approach, utilized the CVaR to cope with the deviation of demand and investment rate from their expected values, and solved a numerical example to obtain potential managerial insights. Rahimi et al. [47] investigated risk-averse SCND by proposing a mixed-integer non-linear programming model to configure a sustainable SC in which the CVaR risk measure was assimilated into the model. This paper contributes mainly by offering various discount policies for selling products to customers. Lotfi et al. [48] developed a model to design an antifragile, sustainable, and agile network that integrates these concepts taking into account several factors such as resilience, risk, robustness, and environmental issues. The authors incorporated the Entropic Value at Risk (EVaR) measure into the stochastic programming framework to address risk-aversion. The cost function of this model encompasses the expected value, maximum, and EVaR. Lotfi et al. [49] proposed a novel hybrid method of robust optimization which employs a stochastic approach to address uncertainty and risk management. The objective function of the model given involves maximizing the coefficients of mean and minimum profits under multiple scenarios, while considering an energy-aware constraint. Lotfi et al. [50] introduced a novel viable SC in which robust stochastic optimization is combined with CVaR as risk criteria to ensure an optimal approach. The objective function of their model minimizes the expected value, maximum, and CVaR of cost. Lotfi et al. [51] presented a new data-driven robust optimization in viable supply chain network design by utilizing Open Innovation (OI) and Blockchain Technology (BCT). The authors employed a robust stochastic optimization technique and assimilated the CVaR measure into the model to effectively tackle uncertainty as well as risks. As our review of the literature reveals, several studies have investigated sustainable FSCND, but no comprehensive study has been conducted on risk-averse SCND while developing a sustainable FSC at the same time. To address this gap, we present a sustainable risk-averse FSC by incorporating the CVaR into our model to develop a robust network in an uncertain environment. Moreover, a few papers have considered the specific characteristics of food products, such as perishability, in their proposed FSCs (e.g. [13, 30, 34]). Therefore, we also incorporate perishability and its implications into our model by considering the shelf-life of foodstuff to prevent the decay of finished products along the SC. We discovered that making inventory and transportation decisions based on integration of production and delivery times may bridge a significant gap in the literature on FSCND. Furthermore, in the majority of the research papers on sustainability, the only instance of social impact addressed by the authors appeared to be job creation, and other factors such as safety had been largely neglected. Our research methodology outlining the steps undertaken is summarized by the flowchart presented as Fig 1, acting as a guide for the research process. In light of the gap analysis presented in this subsection, and based on Table 1, the present study may contribute to the literature in the following ways: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.g001 In this study, we develop a risk-averse sustainable FSC considering the perishability of the food products. The proposed SC is multi-echelon, multi-period, and multi-product, and consists of raw material suppliers, manufacturers, distribution centers (DCs), and retailers with uncertain demand. The process of material flow begins by purchasing raw materials from the suppliers. Next, the products are manufactured in the factories and shipped to the retailers through the DCs by transportation modes. Fig 2 graphically illustrates the structure of the proposed FSC. To design the aforementioned network, a two-stage multi-objective programming model is presented. In this model, the three dimensions of sustainability are introduced in the form of three objective functions. In the first objective, the economic dimension of sustainability is addressed by minimizing the total costs of the network composed of the first stage costs, second stage costs, and CVaR costs. The environmental dimension of sustainability is the second objective function which minimizes the total environmental effects of the network. Total environmental effects of the SCN are comprised of carbon released by establishing facilities, production, handling processes and transportation. Lastly, social dimension of sustainability is considered in the third objective which represents the social aspect of the SC and aims at maximizing the total social effects of the network, which includes of created job opportunities and worker’s lost days multiplied to their given weight.

In this type of framework, decisions are made over two sequential stages. In the first stage, decision-makers should make scenario-independent decisions that typically determine the number, location, and capacity of facilities. Scenario-independent decisions are made before the realization of uncertain parameters (e.g. demand, supply, transportation costs, etc.) and generate the first-stage (a.k.a. design stage) costs. In the second stage, scenario-dependent decisions (e.g. material flow, inventory level, production rate, etc.) are made regarding the second stage (a.k.a. planning stage) costs after the values of uncertain parameters have been realized [52]. Eq (1) gives the first objective function, i.e. economic sustainability, which aims to minimize total cost of the SC, consisting of first-stage, second-stage, and CVaR costs. The components of Eq (1) are formulated as follows: (2) (3) (4) Eq (2) obtains the fixed costs of establishing manufacturers and DCs. Eq (3) calculates the second-stage costs, consisting of the costs of purchasing raw materials, production, distribution, inventory holding in manufacturers and DCs, transportation, and lost demand in retailers, with respect to the set of scenarios. The last component of Eq (1) relates to the costs of the CVaR, which is defined as Eq (4) [22]. Eq (5) states the second objective which represents environmental sustainability and minimizes the total environmental impacts of the proposed SC, comprising the carbon emitted in the processes of establishing the facilities, production, handling, and transportation of the products. The terms of Eq (5) are presented as follows: (6) (7) (8) (9) Eq (6) computes the amount of carbon emitted in the process of establishing the manufacturers and DCs. Eqs (7) and (8) compute the environmental impacts of production and handling processes in the manufacturers and DCs, respectively. Eq (9) determines the amount of carbon emitted from the transportation of products. The first term of Eq (9) states the environmental impacts of transporting raw materials from suppliers to manufacturers, while the second term represents the environmental impacts of transporting the finished products from manufacturers to DCs. The last term of Eq (9) calculates the environmental impacts of transporting the products from DCs to retailers. Eq (10) concerns social sustainability and aims to maximize the total social impacts of the proposed SC which consists of the number of job opportunities created and workers’ lost days multiplied by their weight. The components of Eq (10) are defined as follows: (11) (12) The first component of Eq (10) states the number of jobs created by establishing manufacturers and DCs, presented as Eq (11). The second component, calculated by Eq (12), pertains to the number of lost days caused by work-related damages during the process of establishing manufacturers and DCs. Eqs (13) and (14) ensure that each manufacturer and DC can be established only at one capacity level. Eq (15) indicates the amount of raw material purchased from suppliers. Due to the fact that food products are inherently perishable, inventory management and transportation decisions between network nodes require applying more constraints compared to other products. Therefore, in this paper, by considering the shelf life, production and delivery times of products individually, we intend to prevent the perishability of products along the network. In fact, the level of products inventory and the amount of products flow between network nodes are associated with the optimal production and delivery times as well as shelf life of the products. To address this issue, Eqs (16) to (29) have been defined in the proposed model. Eqs (16) to (18) calculate the inventory level of products according to their shelf-life for each manufacturer at different periods. Eqs (16) and (17) show the level of on-hand inventory at time periods shorter than the shelf-life of the product. However it is worth mentioning that in the first period, no inventory is added from the previous period. Therefore, the inventory levels of the products in each manufacturer for t = 1 < slp and 1 < t < slp are calculated separately using Eqs (16) and (17), respectively. Eq (18) computes the inventory level at time periods longer than the shelf-life of the product. Eqs (19) and (20) compute the flow of each product from a manufacturer to a DC considering its production period. As mentioned in Eqs (16) to (18), the product flows between the relevant nodes are formulated differently for t < slp and t ≥ slp. Eqs (21) and (22) present the inventory balance of products in each manufacturer based on their production period. Similar to Eqs (16) to (18), the inventory levels of products in the DCs for different intervals of t are calculated by Eqs (23) to (25). Eqs (26) and (27) define the flow of each product from a DC to a retailer based on its production time. Eqs (28) and (29) determine the inventory levels of DCs based on their delivery periods. Eq (28) indicates when the delivery period is equal to the time period, the inventory level of DCs is equal to the quantity of products delivered from manufacturers to DCs subtracted by the flow of products to retailers. Eq (29) states that when t − e < slp, the current inventory level is equal to the inventory level of the previous period subtracted by the flow of products to the retailers. Eq (30) determines the quantity of products shipped to retailers as well as the quantity of shortage. Eq (31) defines the raw material procurement capacity of suppliers. Eq (32) presents the production capacity of each manufacturer at each time period. Eqs (34) and (35) express the maximum throughput capacity of each manufacturer and DC, respectively. Eqs (35) to (37) show the capacity constraint of the transportation modes. Eqs (38) to (40) state the decision variables whose values should be zero. Eq (41) calculates the deviational value that exceeds the value-at-risk. Finally, Eqs (42) and (43) express the types of the decision variables. In the process of solving real-world problems, there is often more than one objective function, each offering a specific solution if optimized separately. Such circumstances require that a trade-off be established among the objective functions and multi-objective optimization approaches were originally conceived precisely to solve such problems. One of the most commonly-used optimization approaches, introduced by Charnes et al. [53], is known as goal programming. In this approach, decision-makers define an expectation level for each objective function as its goal and try to minimize the deviation from these expectation levels [54]. Ostensibly, decision-makers should accurately determine the expectation level of each objective; however, in reality, the uncertainty of the available information makes it nearly impossible to assign perfectly accurate levels to the objectives. Fuzzy sets theory, introduced by Zadeh [55], is regarded as an effective approach to decision-making under uncertainty. Arikan and Güngör [56] then combined fuzzy set theory and goal programming to create the fuzzy goal programming (FGP) approach. Recently, a novel extension of FGP, known as preemptive fuzzy goal programming (PFGP), was proposed by. The model was developed with different priorities and had the advantage of largely eliminating the limitations of the original approach. One such limitation was that decision-makers were required to set a precise lower bound for the satisfaction degree of the objectives. Moreover, it was often the case that in order to achieve the minimum satisfaction degree for one of the objectives, a better total satisfaction degree for all objectives had to be eliminated. The new model identified and mitigated this issue, accepting solutions that have a higher satisfaction degree while taking into account the priority of the objectives in question. In this approach, the goals are prioritized and the satisfaction degree of the first priority should be greater than the others. By adding certain equations to constraints that illustrate the importance of each goal, this priority structure is taken into account. PFGP is applicable to multi-objective problems that involve uncertainty and objectives with different importance degrees [57]. In the present study, we adopt the PFGP method as it eliminates the requirement that a fixed value be determined for both the objective function and the satisfaction degree. It also takes uncertainty into account when determining the goal of each objective. Using this method, decision-makers can easily adjust the priority of the objective functions and observe the results of the optimal solution [58]. The notations of PFGP are as follows (Table 3): https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t003 Using the notations presented above, the mathematical model based on PFGP can be expressed as follows: (44) s.t. Eq (44) expresses the goal of the PFGP approach which is maximizing the total satisfaction degree. In Eq (45), hc(X) represents the constraints of the main model. Eqs (46) and (47) determine the satisfaction degrees of the goals for minimization objectives, where ∀i = (1, 2,…, ii) is the set of minimization objectives. Eqs (48) and (49) calculate the satisfaction degrees of the goals for maximization objectives, where ∀i = (ii + 1,…, i) is the set of maximization objectives. Eq (50) relates to the priority of the goals, stating that the most important objective should achieve a satisfaction degree greater than or equal to the other objectives. Finally, Eq (51) defines the type of the decision variables of the PFGP model. In this section, we introduce the case study used in this research and the input data of its parameters. The problem is then solved using PFGP, and the analysis results are presented at the end. Due to the constantly evolving lifestyles of consumers, the processed food industry plays a significant role in providing the population’s needs by producing and distributing a variety of products, also appearing to be on a growing trajectory. In this study, we investigate a processed food company as a real-life case study to measure the effectiveness of our model. The manufacturing plant is located in Tehran province, Iran, and the products are sold on domestic and international markets. The manufacturer procures its required raw materials, mainly chicken and beef, from multiple suppliers. In the proposed model, we consider only two types of finished products: hamburger 80% beef, and sausage 70% chicken. Because of their perishability, the products are transported by refrigerated trucks. The network size of the case study detailed in Table 4. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t004 In this study, we focus on three three modes of transportation: light truck, medium truck, and heavy truck. The data used in the present research on the capacities of transportation modes and the quantities of CO2 emissions have been retrieved from Mohammed et al. [25] and Nayeri et al. [59] (see Table 5). Three levels of capacity: low, medium, and high, with different costs, carbon emissions, and job opportunities have been considered for establishing facilities in potential locations. Tables 6 and 7 show the values of the parameters related to each manufacturer and DC with different capacity levels. Also, we examine three prominent demand scenarios for each retailer in our case study: the most pessimistic, the most probable, and the most optimistic. Numerous studies in the literature on SCND problems have repeatedly implemented the same three demand levels to generate their scenarios and have subsequently attested to the reliability and efficiency of the method (e.g. [22, 60, 61]). According to the historical data obtained from the case study as well as the experts interviewed for the purposes of this paper, the occurrence probability of scenarios are estimated at 0.25, 0.5, and 0.25, respectively. Tables 8 to 11 detail the costs of the model, including the fixed cost of establishing facilities, operational cost, raw material purchasing cost, and holding cost of finished products. Since the finished products discussed in this study have different raw material consumption rates, weights, shelf-lives, and production processes, the production capacity and costs associated with each type of product vary, as well (see Table 12). In addition, Table 13 provides the data on the corresponding values of each retailer’s demand under each scenario. The environmental parameters are presented in Tables 14 to 16. We have gathered the data on environmental parameters from several sources, including the food carbon footprint calculator, an online platform provided by MyEmissions.green, and also from academic articles (e.g. [62]). The values of the social parameters can be found in Tables 17 and 18. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t005 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t006 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t007 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t008 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t009 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t010 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t011 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t012 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t013 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t014 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t015 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t016 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t017 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t018 The proposed mathematical model is solved by the optimization software GAMS using the case study parameters. Furthermore, λ1 > λ2 > λ3 is the fuzzy satisfaction degree reflecting the importance degrees of the objective functions according to the experts’ opinions. Table 19 details the output generated from solving the model. In addition, the numerical results of some analyses performed on the model are presented in the following subsections. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t019 The majority of stochastic programming models addressing food supply chain (FSC) under uncertainty are usually designed to be risk-neutral. In this paper, a risk-averse two-stage stochastic programming is aiming to trade off the expected total cost and risk cost, based on a predetermined level of responsive risk aversion employing CvaR as a coherent risk measure. The purpose of this subsection is to compare the main risk-averse problem (considering CvaR) and risk-neutral problem (without considering CvaR). The comparison of the economic objective function of the proposed model between risk-averse and risk-neutral problems is illustrated in Fig 3. As can be seen, the value of economic objective function in risk-averse problem is 8.65% more than risk-neutral one. Since it overcomes the variability of the uncertain parameters, provides more robust solutions compared to a risk-neutral problem in presence of uncertainty, and assist decision makers when faced decisions with uncertain outcomes. It is worth noting that decision-makers can achieve higher levels of risk aversion by increasing the value of network costs, which will cause the model to behave more conservatively and generate better solutions in worst-case scenarios. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.g003 In this subsection, we intend to examine the service level of the SC in terms of lost demands. In the long run, unmet demands can result in customer dissatisfaction which, in turn, could negatively affect the firm’s reputation. Consequently, we can conclude that the more the level of service provided by the SC, the less lost demand will occur. In simple terms, lost demand is a consequence of increasing the total cost with the purpose of establishing balance between economic, social, and environmental sustainability. Table 20 details our analysis of the total value and percentage of lost demands for finished products under each scenario. The finished products in each scenario have varying amounts of unfulfilled demands in which the abovementioned reason is mainly responsible for them. Another noteworthy point inferred from the table is that when the demand for the finished products rises by 50% in the in probable scenario, the quantities of lost demand for the two products increase by 32.1% and 35.7%, respectively. It may thus be concluded that insufficient production capacity is the most likely culprit for the resulting unmet demand. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t020 This section is dedicated to sensitivity analyses on the sustainability dimensions. For this purpose, we solve the proposed model in three different types: economic, green, and sustainable, and then proceed to discuss the results. In the economic type, only the economic objective function is addressed in the model; in the green type, both the economic and environmental objective functions are addressed simultaneously; and in the sustainable type, the problem is solved by considering the economic, environmental, and social objective functions, i.e. all three dimensions of sustainability. According to Table 21 and Fig 4, solving the problem in the economic type leads to the economic and environmental objective functions to take their best and worst values, respectively. However, focusing solely the economic dimension obtains the best value for the economic objective function. In the green type, by adding an environmental dimension to the problem, the opposite of the results of the economic type is obtained. That is, the economic and environmental objective functions take their worst and best values within the specified cases, respectively. Based on this observation, we may conclude that the green type increases the value of the economic objective in order to ensure a better value for the environmental objective. In the sustainable type, in order to establish a balance between the three dimensions of sustainability, economic and environmental objectives both gain values that lie between the values they were assigned in the economic and environmental types. Moreover, Table 19 indicates that the sustainable type results in a 9% increase in the total cost, as well as a 28.3% decrease in the environmental impacts, and a 53.6% increase in the social impacts compared to the economic type. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.g004 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t021 In the PFGP approach, the influential factor is the priority of objective functions, which is defined by their fuzzy satisfaction degrees (λi). Therefore, we solve the model in six cases to assess the impact of changes in the objective functions’ priority on the problem. Table 20 shows the results of solving the model in the presented cases. Based on Table 20 and Fig 5, the conflicts between the economic and environmental goals are evident. In case 1, when the economic objective function takes the highest priority, it is assigned the best value, while the environmental objective function is assigned the worst. In Case 2, in which the priority of the second objective function is higher than the other two, the environmental impact is given the best value, with the economic objective function getting the worst. In case 3, where both the environmental and economic objectives are equally important, the value of both objective functions is squarely between their worst and best values. Table 22 and Fig 6 illustrate the conflict between the economic and social objective functions. In case 4, when the economic objective has the highest priority, it is assigned the best possible value. Conversely, the social objective function receives the worst value among all the cases. Based on case 5, when the social objective function becomes the top priority, it gets the best value, while the economic objective function has the worst value. Finally, in Case 6, in which the social and economic objectives share the top priority, the value of both objective functions is between their lowest and highest. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.g005 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.g006 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t022 In this section, we assess the risk-aversion parameter in order to clarify how it may affect the objective functions of the proposed model and the obtained solutions. Consider an experiment with four different β values where the value of θ = 0.5 remains fixed to better comprehend how β impacts the model. Table 23 and Fig 7 show that as β grows larger, the value of the economic objective function increases, as well. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.g007 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t023 Since CVaR measures the mean value of the worst (1 − β) % of the total expected cost, when the value of β increases, the risk aversion behavior of the proposed model improves. Hence, the model behaves more conservatively and the CVaR concentrates on the greater realization of total cost. Total costs are comprised of the first-stage costs, CVaR costs, and second-stage costs. It is also important to note that, the first- stage costs and consequently the number of established facilities do not change in response to varying risk parameters since they are not a function of CVaR. In other words, CVaR costs affect the second-stage costs. In general, we may draw the conclusion that a high risk-aversion strategy would result in higher levels of the second-stage costs and the total costs. To better comprehend this mechanism, we need to examine how β influences the environmental and social objective functions. As previously mentioned, by raising the value of β and giving the model a risk-averse attitude, the value of the economic objective function increases and the model should become more conservative, resulting in an upward trend in the value of the environmental impact and a downward trend in social impacts. This conflict can be clearly observed in Table 23 and Fig 8. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.g008 To examine the impact of changes in demand on the value of the objective functions, we solve the model in five demand modes: -30%, -15%, 0%, +15%, and +30%). The results of the sensitivity analyses are shown in Fig 9. As expected, rising demand values increase the total SC costs. This may be a consequence of establishing new high-capacity facilities, increased raw material procurement and production of finished products, as well as transportation between the network nodes to satisfy the demand. Furthermore, as more high-capacity facilities are activated and transportation between facilities is raised, which leads to the use of higher capacity transportation modes, the adverse environmental impacts of the network increase. In addition, as the demand grows, the model tends to create more jobs by establishing more facilities and activating higher capacity levels to meet the retailers’ demand. In case of a significant increase in demand, the proposed model tries to keep the total SC costs at a minimum by not establishing new facilities. This is because the costs of opening new facilities to fully meet the demand outweigh the costs incurred by lost demands. Therefore, the model prefers to avoid establishing new facilities, activates lower capacity levels, and only partially satisfies the demand. This results in a less steep upward trend in total cost and social impact. As Fig 9 indicates, the reaction of the economic, environmental, and social objective functions in the proposed model to changes in demand under different modes complies with the above-mentioned explanations, indicating the proper logic of the model. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.g009 Taking into account the current situation of the case study, which consists of one medium-capacity manufacturer and two high-capacity DCs, the values of the economic, environmental, and social objective functions are 1999168 × 107, 79453400, and 529.2, respectively. In accordance with the opinions of the case study experts, the potential locations for construction of new facilities were selected based on the company’s revision plans regarding its supply chain to gain a larger market share. The results of solving the proposed model for the economic, environmental, and social objective functions are 1952306 × 107, 75179800, and 491.4, respectively. Fig 10 compares the proposed and current conditions of the case study and displays the values of the model’s objective functions. As can be observed, compared to the current situation, the model proposed in this research causes a 2.3% drop in costs, a 5.4% drop in adverse environmental impacts, and a 7.1% drop in social impacts. This is achieved by constructing a medium-capacity manufacturers along with one medium-capacity and two low-capacity DCs. Thus, it can be said that the proposed model, whose candidate locations for the company’s future plans were selected by the experts, improves the current situation in terms of costs and environmental impacts. In addition, considering the high priority of the total SC costs, the downward trend of the social objective function in favor of the economic objective function seems logical. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.g010 In this study, we developed a sustainable risk-averse model to design a SC for processed food products under uncertain conditions. To this end, a multi-period multi-objective model was presented to make decisions on facility location, optimal sourcing, transportation mode selection, capacity planning, and inventory management. The resulting model addresses three dimensions of sustainability as economic, environmental, and social objective functions, thereby minimizing the total cost and carbon emissions and maximizing the number of job opportunities created and safety of the FSC. The main contribution of this research to the literature may lie in our decision to incorporate a risk measure into the design of a sustainable FSC; an innovation that has never been attempted by previous researchers. Furthermore, we applied a scenario-based TSSP approach to cope with the uncertainty of demand for finished products and utilized a novel PFGP multi-objective method to solve the mathematical model. Also, we compared our proposed model with a situation in which the CvaR risk measure was not taken into account. Finally, results show that the value of cost function in risk-averse problem is 8.65% more than risk-neutral one. Because it behaves more conservatively and offers more resilient solutions in the presence of uncertainty compared to a risk-neutral problem. Practitioners and academics can achieve significant outcomes by solving real-world case studies aligned with distinctive industry characteristics. Selecting the processed food industry in Iran and optimizing FSC, which contributes to all dimensions of sustainability, can be beneficial for food industry executives. Several useful managerial insights can be drawn from the analysis of the numerical results, including the following: This research advances the field of FSC by addressing perishability in inventory decisions based on the production and delivery times of the products. A scenario-based TSSP approach that incorporates CvaR as a risk criteria into the objective function is employed to ensure a robust network in an uncertain environment. Finally, investigating a real case study in processed food industry, several strategic decisions including facility location, supplier selection, capacity planning, and transportation mode selection are made in the proposed FSCN. Based on sensitivity analyses on crucial parameters, findings of our research are as follows: The limitations of the research are obtaining optimal solutions on a large scale and within an acceptable timeframe. To address this issue, we recommend applying exact and evolutionary algorithms in combination with novel heuristic and meta-heuristic algorithms, such as those put forward by [63–65]. Finally, the authors would like to recommend the following as potentially promising subjects for further investigation. It is possible to experiment with different quality levels for raw materials and suppliers can place various purchase discounts based on the quality and quantity of the raw materials required by manufacturers. Additionally, exploring global SC issues and factors may be a highly relevant research route, as most leading SCs in various sectors operate globally today. Furthermore, incorporating other risk criteria, such as Entropic VaR (EVaR) and Robust CvaR (RCVaR) may provide significant benefits for conservative decision-makers as future research, aiming to enhance the robustness of the model’s performance and enable it to effectively handle fluctuations [66]. Utilizing alternative methods, like stochastic, fuzzy, and robust optimization techniques that incorporate data-driven uncertain parameters can offer risk-averse decision-makers a more accurate representation of the situation, enabling them to make optimum decisions while reducing risks [64, 66, 67].

Title: Moody’s Corporation (MCO): Warren Buffett’s Best Stock Performer of 2024

We recently compiled a list of the 10 best performing Warren Buffett stocks in 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) stands against the other Top-Performing Warren Buffett Stock of 2024. Warren Buffett has etched his name as the most successful investor on Wall Street by steering a small company into a trillion-dollar empire. The milestone stems from the billionaire investor’s value investing strategy that has always focused on undervalued stocks with tremendous upside potential. In a year where the overall market has been on an upward trajectory thanks to solid financial results amid a resilient economy and expectations of interest rate cuts, Buffett has outperformed the overall market. His investment firm gaining more than 28% compared to a 17% gain for the S&P 500 over the same period underscores Buffett’s competitive edge in picking and investing in market-beating stocks. READ ALSO: 14 Worst 52-Week High Stocks to Buy According to Short Sellers and 12 Best Forever Stocks To Buy Now. Buffett, who rose to prominence in the 1960s, has transformed his investment firm into a conglomerate with stakes in companies in the insurance, railroad, retail, manufacturing, and energy sectors. According to Andrew Kligerman, TD Cowen’s Berkshire analyst, Buffett’s performance in 2024 is a testament to his stock-picking skills focused on businesses trading at relatively lower valuations. Nevertheless, the billionaire investor has been in defensive mode despite the stellar performance for the better part of 2024. Concerned by valuations getting out of hand amid the high interest rate environment and deteriorating economic conditions, Buffett has dumped massive amounts of stocks in companies whose valuations got out of hand. With the massive sale of stakes, the billionaire has successfully generated significant value as most of the stocks had gained significantly amid the bull run in the market. The stock sale has also allowed the billionaire investor to raise the cash pile in his investment firm to a record $277 billion. Source: pexels Although Buffett has previously argued against diversification, it’s understandable why his firm decided to reduce stakes in some of the companies. The investments had been a huge success for his firm, locking profits with the overall market at all-time highs. The fact that Buffett invests through a conglomerate structure, often considered archaic, underscores his edge in the highly competitive investment world. At 94, the ‘Oracle of Omaha’ has started showing signs of slowing down. The appointment of Greg Abel as his successor signals he may not have a significant say in investment decisions in the near future. What might come as a surprise is that the best-performing Warren Buffett stocks in 2024 are not among the big names that account for the biggest share of Buffett’s portfolio. Instead, they are companies that have remained resilient amid the high interest rate environment that has rattled the stock market. Additionally, they boast of stocks well positioned to benefit as the macroeconomic environment improves, with the US Federal Reserve cutting interest rates by 50 basis points. The US economy is avoiding recession as the Fed continues to tweak its monetary policy, which should allow the companies to generate more shareholder value and, therefore, continue powering high. Buffett’s investment portfolio also includes companies with tremendous potential and ability to generate free cash flow owing to resilient core businesses. Consequently, the companies have emerged as a source of passive income, allowing Buffett to generate billions of dollars in dividends. Last year alone, the Oracle of Omaha raked $4.36 billion in dividends from his investments. Our Methodology We analyzed Berkshire Hathaway’s Q2 2024 portfolio and picked the best-performing stocks on a year-to-date basis, as of September 20. The list is sorted in ascending order of the year-to-date performance of the stocks. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Warren Buffett’s Q2 2024 Stake: $10.38 Billion Year to Date Gain as of September 20: 28.36% Number of Hedge Fund Investors In Q2 2024: 59 Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) is one of the best-performing Warren Buffett stocks in 2024 in the financial service sector. It specializes in providing a range of products and services that support the risk management activities of institutional participants in financial markets. It is one of the oldest holdings in Buffett’s portfolio and continues to generate significant value in share price gains and dividend offerings. Its competitive edge stems from operating two robust businesses. Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) runs a business that evaluates the creditworthiness of different bond issuers, including companies and governments. It holds a significant market position, facing competition primarily from S&P Global and Fitch Ratings. Additionally, it has an analytics division that employs data to assess risk. Record-low interest rates have encouraged companies and government bodies to issue debt for over a decade. This has sustained the importance of Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO)’s core operating division. Booming businesses have seen the stock sentiments receive significant powering to record highs. Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) has moved to strengthen its business empire and reach the market. The firm revealed its purchase of Praedicat, a company that focuses on analytics for the casualty insurance industry. This deal is anticipated to improve Moody’s data and analytical capabilities, especially in the areas of casualty and liability risk assessment, but it is not expected to affect Moody’s financial performance for the year 2024 significantly. The company delivered solid second-quarter results, with revenues increasing 22% to $1.8 billion. On the other hand, earnings came in at $600 million or $3.02 a share, up from $2.05 a share last year. Growth in the underlying core business and solid financial results is the catalyst behind the stock rallying by 28.36% and outperforming the 18% gain of the S&P 500. In Q2 2024, 59 out of the 912 hedge funds monitored by Insider Monkey purchased shares of the firm. The largest hedge fund investor in Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) is Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which holds shares valued at $10.38 billion. Overall MCO ranks 10th on our list of 10 best performing Warren Buffett stocks in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of MCO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Wall Street is looking at a higher open Thursday, led by surging tech stocks after memory chipmaker Micron delivered a better-than-expected quarter and upside guide. Micron shares jumped 18%. China stocks rallied again — this time on signs the Chinese government is prepared to add fiscal stimulus to this week's central bank monetary stimulus. The commentary out of China supported global markets. 2. Micron said high bandwidth memory sold out for calendar year 2024 and 2025. Personal computers set to have a better second half of 2025 as artificial intelligence PCs gain momentum. Micron's smartphone unit growth expected to continue in 2025. Jim Cramer said on X: "If you bought Micron off of our suggestion from our [Mad Money] Gameplan last Friday I would not sell it. That was some forecast for every business in 2025. It also affirms AMD and NVDA outlooks." Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices are Club stocks. 3. Starbucks was upgraded to an outperform buy rating at Bernstein. Even after the stock's 27% move since Brian Niccol was named CEO, the analysts think the valuation of the Club stock "does not fully appreciate the earnings power that Starbucks could unlock." Starbucks also was getting a bump on the fiscal stimulus commitment from the Chinese government. 4. GE Healthcare was downgraded to sell at UBS on concerns about rising competition from Chinese competitors. The analysts' pessimism seems overblown. The company has a strong relationship in China and has been manufacturing there for 30 years. Health-care stimulus packages in China have been slow to roll out, and that's weighed on the Club-owned maker of MRI machines. Here's our screen on China exposure for all of our 32 portfolio stocks. 5. Bank of America raised its Meta Platforms to $630 per share from $563, representing 10% upside to Wednesday's close. JPMorgan took its PT on Meta to $640. The fresh bullish commentary followed the wearable showcase at the company's Connect 2024 product and developer conference. CEO Mark Zuckerberg brought out prototype AR glasses that received rave reviews, including a stamp of approval from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. 6. Southwest Airlines upped its third quarter forecast and announced a $2.5 billion share repurchase program and other changes at its investor day on Thursday. The carrier is making the moves as it battles activist investor group Elliott Management. 7. Truist started First Solar and power play GE Vernova with buy ratings. For the Club, our solar and renewable play is Nextracker, whose technology makes sure solar panels are always facing the sun. We also own Eaton as a way to benefit from the growing complexity of energy infrastructure in the age of AI. 8. Jefferies Financial dropped on a quarterly profit and revenue miss. The results provided an early look into investment banking and capital markets activity before the big banks, including Club names Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley, report in a couple of weeks. Jefferies said IB was strong and capital markets were only down a bit compared to tough comps. 9. JPMorgan raised its DraftKings price target to $54 per share from $48 and kept its overweight buy rating. The analysts said positive comments at online betting and iGaming platform Flutter Entertainment's Capital Markets Day is good news for DraftKings. Flutter is FanDuel's parent company. 10. Hershey was downgraded to an underperform sell by Jefferies research analysts on chocolate snacking concerns. The analysts said that "everyday chocolate is being bought less frequently, especially by low-income consumers," because prices are so high. — Sign up for Jim Cramer's Top 10 Morning Thoughts on the Market email newsletter for free (See here for a full list of the stocks at Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

LONG BEACH, Calif. - Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ: RKLB), a prominent player in launch services and space systems, has announced the completion of testing and integration of its second Pioneer spacecraft for Varda Space Industries, Inc. The spacecraft is designed to support Varda's mission of pharmaceutical processing and hypersonic Earth re-entry logistics in space. The first Pioneer spacecraft for Varda was launched in June 2023, and it successfully crystallized the HIV drug Ritonavir in orbit. The resulting re-entry capsule was recovered in the Utah desert in February 2024. Varda has now secured a second reentry license from the FAA under a Part 450 license, marking it as the only company to obtain this license twice. The Pioneer spacecraft, constructed at Rocket Lab's Spacecraft Production Complex in Long Beach, California, is equipped to provide power, communications, propulsion, and attitude control for Varda's 120 kg reentry capsule. Rocket Lab's vertically integrated approach to spacecraft production utilizes in-house components such as star trackers, reaction wheels, solar panels, flight software, and radios. Sir Peter Beck, Founder and CEO of Rocket Lab, emphasized the benefits of the collaboration, stating that it enables the creation of high-value products in microgravity and their return to Earth. Will Bruey, CEO and co-founder of Varda, highlighted the partnership's role in advancing the orbital economy and the significance of each reentry as a step towards routine space operations. The Pioneer spacecraft is a configurable medium delta-V platform capable of supporting large payloads and dynamic space operations. Rocket Lab's Electron launch vehicle is recognized as the second most frequently launched U.S. rocket annually, with over 197 satellites delivered to orbit for various partners. This news is based on a press release statement and provides an overview of the ongoing collaboration between Rocket Lab and Varda Space Industries, as they continue to push the boundaries of in-space manufacturing and logistics. In other recent news, Rocket Lab USA, Inc. has made several significant developments. The company reported a 71% increase in Q2 revenue, reaching $106 million, primarily attributed to the success of its Electron rocket. However, Q3 revenue is projected to slightly decrease, estimated between $100 million and $105 million. Rocket Lab has also announced the appointment of Frank Klein as its new Chief Operations Officer, a move set to boost the company's manufacturing capabilities. Additionally, the company has named Kenneth Possenriede, a former Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) executive, to its Board of Directors, bringing extensive aerospace and defense industry experience to the table. The company has set the launch date for its 53rd Electron mission, 'Kinéis Killed the RadIOT Star,' which aims to enhance global Internet of Things connectivity. Furthermore, Rocket Lab has completed the shipment of two spacecraft, Blue and Gold, designed for NASA's Mars mission, part of the Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers (ESCAPADE) project. KeyBanc Capital Markets maintained its Overweight rating on Rocket Lab, reflecting confidence in the company's market position and growth prospects. These are recent developments in Rocket Lab's journey in the aerospace industry. Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ: RKLB), with its recent achievements in the space industry, has certainly caught the attention of investors and industry observers alike. The company's stock has experienced a significant return over the last six months, with a 112.32% increase, signaling a strong performance in the market. These robust returns are reflective of Rocket Lab's operational milestones and its expanding role in the burgeoning space economy. An InvestingPro Tip worth noting is that analysts are anticipating sales growth for Rocket Lab in the current year, which aligns with the company's ongoing projects and future plans, such as the successful completion of its second Pioneer spacecraft for Varda Space Industries. This anticipated growth is also mirrored in the company's revenue growth of 40.95% over the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, showcasing Rocket Lab's expanding financial footprint in the space sector. From a financial health perspective, Rocket Lab holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, an InvestingPro Tip that indicates the company's solid liquidity position to support its ambitious projects and potential expansions. Additionally, the company's liquid assets exceed its short-term obligations, further underscoring its financial resilience.

September 26, 2024 08:30 ET | Source: Biodexa Pharmaceuticals PLC Biodexa Pharmaceuticals PLC September 26, 2024 Biodexa Pharmaceuticals PLC (“Biodexa” or the “Company”) Interim results for the six months ended June 30, 2024 Biodexa Pharmaceuticals PLC (Nasdaq: BDRX), an acquisition-focused clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing a pipeline of innovative products for the treatment of diseases with unmet medical needs, today announces its unaudited interim results for the six months ended June 30, 2024 which will also be made available on the Company’s website at www.biodexapharma.com OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS The Company announced the following in the six months ended June 30, 2024: Post period end: FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Post period end: Commenting, Stephen Stamp, CEO and CFO, said “It was a busy first half for Biodexa. Licensing in eRapa, a Phase 3 ready asset with access to $17 million of non-dilutive grant funding, is an enormous step forward. The second half will be about executing on our lead programs. We already have approval from Health Canada for the IIT Phase 2a study of tolimidone in Type 1 diabetes and we are working diligently to set up a global Phase 3 registrational study of eRapa in FAP so we can begin recruiting early next year.” For more information, please contact: Biodexa Pharmaceuticals PLC Stephen Stamp, CEO, CFO Tel: +44 (0)29 2048 0180 www.biodexapharma.com About Biodexa Biodexa Pharmaceuticals PLC (listed on NASDAQ: BDRX) is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing a pipeline of innovative products for the treatment of diseases with unmet medical needs. The Company’s lead development programs include eRapa, under development for Familial Adenomatous Polyposis and Non-Muscle Invasive Blader Cancer; tolimidone, under development for the treatment of type 1 diabetes; and MTX110, which is being studied in aggressive rare/orphan brain cancer indications. eRapa is a proprietary oral formulation of rapamycin, also known as sirolimus. Rapamycin is an mTOR (mammalian Target Of Rapamycin) inhibitor. mTOR has been shown to have a significant role in the signalling pathway that regulates cellular metabolism, growth and proliferation and is activated during tumorgenesis. Tolimidone is an orally delivered, potent and selective activator of Lyn kinase. Lyn is a member of the Src family of protein tyrosine kinases, which is mainly expressed in hematopoietic cells, in neural tissues, liver, and adipose tissue. Tolimidone demonstrates glycemic control via insulin sensitization in animal models of diabetes and has the potential to become a first in class blood glucose modulating agent. MTX110 is a solubilised formulation of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, panobinostat. This proprietary formulation enables delivery of the product via convection-enhanced delivery (CED) at chemotherapeutic doses directly to the site of the tumor, by-passing the blood-brain barrier and potentially avoiding systemic toxicity. Biodexa is supported by three proprietary drug delivery technologies focused on improving the bio-delivery and bio-distribution of medicines. Biodexa’s headquarters and R&D facility is in Cardiff, UK. For more information visit www.biodexapharma.com.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW Our primary focus in the first half of 2024 was on assimilating tolimidone, licensed in December 2023, into our portfolio and searching for additional clinical-stage assets to diversify and advance our pipeline which ultimately led to the licensing of eRapa in May 2024. eRapa License In line with our strategy to build a sustainable therapeutics company in rare/orphan diseases, we continue to search for opportunities to broaden and diversify our development pipeline. On April 25, 2024, we entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement (“LCA”) with Rapamycin Holdings, Inc. (d/b/a Emtora Biosciences), relating to the license of eRapa, an oral formulation of rapamycin (also known as sirolimus) for use in all diseases, states or conditions in humans. Under the LCA, we obtained an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable right to develop, manufacture, commercialize, or otherwise exploit products containing rapamycin. Pursuant to the terms of the LCA, the Company and Emtora established a joint development committee to monitor and progress the development of eRapa. Emtora has conducted a Phase 1 study of eRapa in prostate cancer, a Phase 2 study in FAP and has an ongoing Phase 2 study in Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer. Preparations are under way for a registrational Phase 3 study of eRapa in FAP. In consideration for the license, we made an upfront payment of 378,163 ADSs (equal to five percent of our then outstanding Ordinary Shares, calculated on a fully-diluted basis). In addition, we are also responsible for up to an aggregate $31.5 million in sales milestones within the first six months of commercial sale of a first-approved indication of eRapa in certain markets with decreasing milestones for subsequent approvals for additional indications. There is also a one-time $10.0 million milestone payable upon cumulative net sales of $1.0 billion. Further, we are also obligated to pay Emtora single digit tiered royalties on net sales of eRapa, in addition to honouring Emtora’s legacy royalty obligations and paying Emtora fees related to income derived from sublicensing and partnering of eRapa. In addition, a promissory note previously issued by Emtora in favour of the Company in the amount of $0.25 million was forgiven. We also made an additional $0.5 million payment which was used for a match to an advance from the CPRIT. Emtora had secured a grant of $17.0 million from CPRIT to support the Phase 3 study of eRapa in FAP. The grant requires a 1 for 2 match and Biodexa was expected to fund the match of up to $7.5 million, being 50% of the remaining CPRIT grant, which was completed in September 2024. Grant funding is available once the match payment has been certified and CPRIT has approved eligible trial expenses. In certain instances, CPRIT may advance payments before eligible trial expenses have been incurred. Upon a change of control of the Company, we will issue Emtora a warrant exercisable for 1,604,328 ADSs. The LCA also provides us with the exclusive option to acquire all of the capital stock of Emtora on commercially reasonable terms in the 90 days after acceptance of the filing of an NDA by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”). R&D update Following the in-licensing of eRapa, our development pipeline has not only advanced in terms of clinical stage but expanded to six programmes overall, four of which are orphan indications: eRapa eRapa is a proprietary oral formulation of rapamycin, also known as sirolimus. Rapamycin is an mTOR (mammalian Target Of Rapamycin) inhibitor. mTOR has been shown to have a significant role in the signalling pathway that regulates cellular metabolism, growth and proliferation and is activated during tumorgenesis1. Rapamycin is approved in the US for organ rejection in renal transplantation as Rapamune®(Pfizer). Through the use of nanotechnology and pH sensitive polymers, eRapa is designed to address the poor bioavailability, variable pharmacokinetics and toxicity generally associated with the currently available forms of rapamycin. eRapa is protected by a number of issued patents which extend through 2035, with other pending applications potentially providing further protection beyond 2035. Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (“FAP”) FAP is an orphan indication characterized by a proliferation of polyps in the colon and/or rectum, usually occurring in mid-teens. There is no approved therapeutic option for treating FAP patients, for whom active surveillance and surgical resection of the colon and/or rectum remain the standard of care. If untreated, FAP typically leads to cancer of the colon and/or rectum. There is a significant hereditary component to FAP with a reported incidence of one in 5,000 to 10,000 in the US1 and one in 11,300 to 37,600 in Europe2. eRapa has received Orphan Designation in the US with plans to seek such designation in Europe. Importantly, mTOR has been shown to be over-expressed in FAP polyps – thereby underscoring the rationale for using a potent and safe mTOR inhibitor like eRapa to treat FAP. An open-label Phase 2 study (NCT04230499) was conducted by Emtora in seven U.S. centres of excellence in 30 adult patients. Patients were sequentially enrolled into three dosing cohorts of 10 patients each for a 12-month treatment period: 0.5mg every other day (Cohort 1), 0.5mg daily every other week (Cohort 2), and 0.5mg daily (Cohort 3). Upper and lower endoscopic surveillance occurred at baseline and after six months. Primary endpoints were safety and tolerability of eRapa and percentage change from baseline in polyp burden, as measured by the aggregate of all polyp diameters. In May 2024, results of the Phase 2 study at six months were presented at the prestigious 2024 Digestive Disease Week annual meeting in Washington D.C. by Carol Burke, MD, the Principal Investigator. In summary, at six months, eRapa appeared safe and well-tolerated with a significant 24% reduction in the total polyp burden at six months compared with baseline (p=0.04) and an overall 83% non-progression rate. In June 2024, results of the Phase 2 study at 12 months were presented at the bi-annual InSIGHT meeting in Barcelona by Dr Burke. Overall, 21 of 28 (75%) patients were deemed to be non-progressors at 12 months with a median reduction in polyp burden of 17%. In Cohort 2, the likely dosage regimen for Phase 3, eight of nine (89)% of patients were deemed non-progressors at 12 months with a median reduction in polyp burden of 29%. Over the course of 12 months, there were four related Grade 3 or higher and one related Serious Adverse Event reported during the trial and 95% compliance rate at 12 months. One patient was removed from the trial due to non-compliance. The Phase 3 registrational study is planned to be a double-blind placebo-controlled design recruiting approximately 150 high risk patients diagnosed with germline or phenotypic FAP. The primary clinical endpoint is expected to be the first progression free survival event which will comprise composite endpoints including major surgery. A ‘Type C’ meeting with the FDA is planned for 4Q24 to finalise the protocol and related matters. A $17 million grant from CPRIT will support this study. Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (“NMIBC”) NMIBC refers to tumors found in the tissue that lines the inner surface of the bladder. The most common treatment is transurethral resection of the bladder tumor followed by intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (“BCG”) with chemotherapy depending upon assessment of risk of recurrence. NMIBC is the fourth most common cancer in men with an incidence of 10.1 per 100,000 and 2.5 per 100,000 in women3. Our ongoing multi-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study in NMIBC is expected to enrol up to 166 patients with primary endpoints of safety/tolerability and relapse free survival after 12 months of treatment. The Phase 2 study, which is supported by a $3.0 million non-dilutive grant from the National Cancer Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health, is expected to read out in mid-2025. MTD228 – Tolimidone Tolimidone was originally discovered by Pfizer and was developed through Phase 2 for the treatment of gastric ulcers. Pfizer undertook a broad pre-clinical program to characterize the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, metabolism and toxicology of tolimidone. Pfizer discontinued development of the drug due to lack of efficacy for that indication in a Phase II clinical trial. Tolimidone is a selective activator of the enzyme Lyn kinase which increases phosphorylation of insulin substrate-1, thereby amplifying the signalling cascade initiated by the binding of insulin to its receptor. Type 1 Diabetes (“T1D”) Tolimidone’s potential utility in T1D has been demonstrated by several ground-breaking preclinical studies conducted by the University of Alberta, where Lyn kinase was identified as a key factor for beta cell survival and proliferation in in vitro and in vivo models. Most importantly, tolimidone was able to induce proliferation in beta cells isolated from human cadavers. From a mechanism of action perspective, tolimidone has been shown to both prevent beta cell degradation and to stimulate beta cell proliferation. In a meta analysis of 1,202 articles and 193 studies, the incidence of T1D was shown to be 15 per 100,000 with a prevalence of 9.5 per 10,000 of the population4. As a first step in the continued clinical development of tolimidone, a Phase 2a Investigator Initiated Trial (IIT) at the University of Alberta Diabetes Institute is designed to establish the minimum effective dose of tolimidone in patients with T1D. The study, which was approved by Health Canada in July 2024 is expected to recruit 12 patients initially across three dose groups. The study will measure C-peptide levels (a marker for insulin) and HbA1c (a marker for blood glucose) after three months compared with baseline and the number of hyperglycemic events. MTX110 MTX110 is a solubilised formulation of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, panobinostat. This proprietary formulation enables delivery of the product via convection-enhanced delivery (CED) at chemotherapeutic doses directly to the site of the brain tumor, by-passing the blood-brain barrier and potentially avoiding systemic toxicity. All three types of brain cancer being studied are orphan. Recurrent Glioblastoma (“rGBM”) Our Phase 1 MAGIC-G1 study (NCT05324501) of MTX110 in rGBM completed the dose escalation part of the study with the recruitment of the fourth patient in Cohort A. In February 2024 we announced Patient #1, who had received sub-optimal infusions of 60µM of MTX110 had survived for12 months from the start of treatment (OS=12). GBM universally recurs and once it does median overall survival according to a retrospective analysis of 299 patients reported in the Journal of Neuro-Oncology is 6.5 months. Post period end, we provided an update on the status of cohort A in the MAGIC-G1 study: patients #1 and #2 have deceased with overall survival (OS) since start of treatment of 12 months and 13 months, respectively. Patients #3 and #4 remain alive with progression free survival (PFS) since the start of treatment of 6 and 9 months, respectively and OS thus far of 12 and 11 months respectively. GBM virtually always recurs with median Progression Free Survival of 1.5–6.0 months and median Overall Survival of 2.0–9.0 months5. Diffuse Midline Glioma (“DMG”) In February 2024 we announced headline data from a Phase 1 IIT study conducted by Columbia University in newly diagnosed patients with DMG. As this was the first ever study of repeated infusions to the pons via an implanted CED catheter, the primary objective of the study was safety and tolerability and, accordingly, the number of infusions was limited to two, each of 48 hours, 7 days apart in nine patients. One patient suffered a severe adverse event assessed by the investigators as not related to the study drug. Although not powered to reliably demonstrate efficacy, median overall survival (OS) of patients in the study was 16.5 months compared with median survival rate in a cohort of 316 cases of 10.0 months (Jansen et al, 2015. Neuro-Oncology 17(1):160-166). Study investigators subsequently presented the results of the trial at the 21st International Symposium on Pediatric Neuro-Oncology (ISPNO 2024) in Philadelphia. Medulloblastoma An IIT Phase I study of MTX110 in medulloblastoma remains ongoing at the University of Texas. Financing As a pre-revenue biotech company, securing adequate finance to fund operations to an out-licensing and/or partnering event is a constant focus. On the back of the eRapa in-licensing and the subsequent announcement of positive 6-month and 12-month data of eRapa in FAP, we accomplished two financings; the first in May 2024 and the second post period end in July 2024. May 2024 Warrant Exercises On May 22, 2024, we raised $6.05 million of gross proceeds from the exercise of previously issued warrants following an agreement between the Company and several accredited investors to exercise existing Series E warrants and Series F warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 4,358,322 ADSs. The warrant holders agreed to exercise the Series E and/or Series F warrants at an exercise price of $1.50 (reduced from $2.20) per ADS. In consideration for the immediate exercise of the Series E and/or Series F warrants for cash, we issued one replacement warrant for each Series E warrant exercised in the form of a Series G warrant, and one replacement warrant for each Series F warrant exercised in the form of a Series H warrant. The Series G and Series H warrants are exercisable for five years and one year, respectively, at $2.50 each. July 2024 Registered Direct Offering and Private Placement On July 22, 2024, we utilised our capacity under our Registration Statement on Form F-3 to raise $5.0 million in gross proceeds in a Registered Direct Offering with certain institutional investors for the sale of an aggregate of 5,050,808 ADSs and 278,975 pre-funded warrants at a price of $0.94 per ADS. In a concurrent Private Placement, we issued and sold to the Investors (i) Series J warrants exercisable for 5,329,783 ADSs, and (ii) Series K Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 5,329,783 ADSs. The Series J and Series K warrants are exercisable for five years and one year, respectively, at $1.00 per ADS each. 1. https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/familial-adenomatous-polyposis/ 2. https://www.orpha.net/en/disease/detail/733#:~:text=FAP%20has%20a%20birth%20incidence,colorectal%20cancer%20(CRC)%20cases. 3. Cassell et al., World J Oncol. 2019 Jun; 10(3): 123–131. 4. National Library of Medicine, Mobasseri et al., published online 2020 Mar 30. doi: 10.34172/hpp.2020.18 5. Birzu et al. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7794906 1H24 FINANCIAL REVIEW The unaudited results for the six months ended June 30, 2024 are discussed below: Key performance indicators (KPIs): Biodexa’s KPIs focus on the key areas of operating results, R&D spend and cash management. These measures provide information on the core R&D operations. Additional financial and non-financial KPIs may be adopted in due course. Revenues Total revenue for the six months to June 30, 2024 was £Nil compared to £0.30 million in the first six months of 2023. The R&D collaboration with Janssen, which represented the entire revenue in 1H23, concluded in September 2023. Research and Development R&D costs in 1H24 reduced by £0.06 million, or 3%, to £2.19 million compared with £2.25 million in 1H23. The percentage of R&D costs as a percentage of total operating costs increased to 52% in the period from 50%. The reduction in R&D costs in 1H24 reflects a reduction in spend of £0.54 million on the MAGIC-G1 study in rGBM, the termination of legacy drug delivery projects and lower personnel costs offset by the addition of MTD228 (tolimidone) and MTX230 (eRapa) for a combined expenditure of £0.65 million in 1H24. Administrative Costs Administrative costs in 1H24 decreased by £0.26 million, or 11% to £2.03 million from £2.29 million in 1H23. The decrease in administrative costs in 1H24 is a result of a positive reversal in foreign exchange of £0.23 million and a reduction in professional fees of £0.14 million offset by increases in share-based payment charge of £0.12 million and sundry other costs. Finance Income and Expense Finance income in 1H24 and 1H23 included gains in respect of an equity settled derivative financial liability of £0.75 million (1H23: £0.39 million). The gains arose as a result of the fall in the Biodexa share price. In addition, the Company earned interest on cash deposits. Finance expense in the period related to lease liabilities and discounted interest on deferred consideration. Cash Flows Cash outflows from operating activities in 1H24 were £4.81 million compared to £3.88 million in 1H23, driven by a net loss of £3.31 million (1H23: £3.57 million) and after negative working capital of £0.87 million (1H23: positive £0.21 million) and other negative non-cash items totalling £0.63 million (1H23: negative £0.52 million). Net cash used in investing activities in 1H24 of £0.75 million in 1H24 resulted from the purchase of eRapa licence for total consideration of £3.07 million including cash consideration of £0.85 million (1H23: £Nil) offset by £0.10 million of interest received (1H23: £0.02 million). Net cash generated in financing activities in 1H24 was £4.65 million (1H23: inflow £6.25 million), which was driven by receipts from share issuances, including warrants, net of costs of £4.74 million offset by payments on lease liabilities of £0.09 million. Overall, cash decreased by £0.92 million in 1H24 compared to an increase of £2.39 million in 1H23. This resulted in a cash balance at June 30, 2024 of £5.06 million compared with £5.23 million at June 30, 2023 and £5.97 million at December 31, 2023. Going concern Biodexa has experienced net losses and significant cash outflows from cash used in operating activities over the past years as it develops its portfolio. For the six months to June 30, 2024, the Group incurred a consolidated loss from operations of £3.31 million (1H23: £3.57 million) and negative cash flows from operating activities of £4.81 million (1H23: £3.88 million). As of June 30, 2024, the Group had accumulated deficit of £147.88 million. The Group’s future viability is dependent on its ability to raise cash from financing activities to finance its development plans until commercialisation, generate cash from operating activities and to successfully obtain regulatory approval to allow marketing of its development products. The Group’s failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on its financial condition and ability to pursue its business strategies. The Group's consolidated interim financial information has been presented on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As at June 30, 2024, the Group had cash and cash equivalents of £5.06 million. The Directors forecast that the Group currently has enough cash to fund its planned operations into the first quarter of 2025. If the Company does not secure additional funding before the first quarter of 2025, it will no longer be a going concern and would likely be placed in Administration. The Directors have prepared cash flow forecasts and considered the cash flow requirement for the Group for the next three years including the period 12 months from the date of approval of this interim financial information. These forecasts show that further financing will be required before the first quarter of 2025 assuming, inter alia, that certain development programs and other operating activities continue as currently planned. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities or additional equity securities, it could result in dilution to our existing shareholders, increased fixed payment obligations and these securities may have rights senior to those of our ordinary shares (including the ADSs) and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations and potentially impair our competitiveness, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Any of these events could significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects. On August 27, 2024, the Company received notification from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC advising that the Company was not in compliance with the minimum bid requirement set forth in NASDAQ’s rules for continued listing of its securities. The Company has requested a Hearing Panel which has paused any suspension or delisting action pending the hearing. If the Company's ADSs are delisted, it could be more difficult to buy or sell the Company's ADSs or to obtain accurate quotations, and the price of the Company's ADSs could suffer a material decline. Delisting may impair the Company's ability to raise capital. In the Directors’ opinion, the environment for financing of small and micro-cap biotech companies continues to be challenging. While this may present acquisition and/or merger opportunities with other companies with limited or no access to financing, as noted above, any attendant financings by Biodexa are likely to be dilutive. The Directors continue to evaluate financing options, including those connected to acquisitions and/or mergers, potentially available to the Group. Any alternatives considered are contingent upon the agreement of counterparties and accordingly, there can be no assurance that any of alternative courses of action to finance the Group would be successful. This requirement for additional financing in the short term represents a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt upon the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. Should it become evident in the future that there are no realistic financing options available to the Group which are actionable before its cash resources run out then the Group will no longer be a going concern. In such circumstances, we would no longer be able to prepare financial statements under paragraph 25 of IAS 1. Instead, the financial statements would be prepared on a liquidation basis and assets would be stated at net realizable value and all liabilities would be accelerated to current liabilities. The Directors believe there are adequate options and time available to secure additional financing for the Group and after considering the uncertainties, the Directors consider it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these financial statements. Our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors, including the timing of clinical trials. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. If we lack sufficient capital to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

Going Concern – material uncertainty Biodexa has experienced net losses and significant cash outflows from cash used in operating activities over the past years as it develops its portfolio. For the six months to June 30, 2024, the Group incurred a consolidated loss from operations of £3.31 million (1H23: loss £3.56 million) and negative cash flows from operating activities of £4.81 million (1H23 £3.88 million). As of June 30, 2024, the Group had accumulated deficit of £147.88 million.

If the Company does not secure additional funding before the first quarter of 2025, it will no longer be a going concern and would likely be placed in Administration. The Directors have prepared cash flow forecasts and considered the cash flow requirement for the Group for the next three years including the period 12 months from the date of approval of this interim financial information. These forecasts show that further financing will be required before the first quarter of 2025 assuming, inter alia, that certain development programs and other operating activities continue as currently planned. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities or additional equity securities, it could result in dilution to our existing shareholders, increased fixed payment obligations and these securities may have rights senior to those of our ordinary shares (including the ADSs) and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations and potentially impair our competitiveness, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Any of these events could significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects. On August 27, 2024, the Company received notification from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC advising that the Company was not in compliance with the minimum bid requirement set forth in NASDAQ’s rules for continued listing of its securities. The Company has requested a Hearing Panel which has paused any suspension or delisting action pending the hearing. If the Company's ADSs are delisted, it could be more difficult to buy or sell the Company's ADSs or to obtain accurate quotations, and the price of the Company's ADSs could suffer a material decline. Delisting may impair the Company's ability to raise capital. In the Directors’ opinion, the environment for financing of small and micro-cap biotech companies continues to be challenging. While this may present acquisition and/or merger opportunities with other companies with limited or no access to financing, as noted above, any attendant financings by Biodexa are likely to be dilutive. The Directors continue to evaluate financing options, including those connected to acquisitions and/or mergers, potentially available to the Group. Any alternatives considered are contingent upon the agreement of counterparties and accordingly, there can be no assurance that any of alternative courses of action to finance the Group would be successful. This requirement for additional financing in the short term represents a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt upon the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. Should it become evident in the future that there are no realistic financing options available to the Group which are actionable before its cash resources run out then the Group will no longer be a going concern. In such circumstances, we would no longer be able to prepare financial statements under paragraph 25 of IAS 1. Instead, the financial statements would be prepared on a liquidation basis and assets would be stated at net realizable value and all liabilities would be accelerated to current liabilities. The Directors believe there are adequate options and time available to secure additional financing for the Group and after considering the uncertainties, the Directors consider it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these financial statements. Our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors, including the timing of clinical trials. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. If we lack sufficient capital to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The LCA entered into with Emtora meets the definition of a Joint Arrangement under IFRS 11, specifically related to the FAP program. A jointly controlled escrow account was established on completion of the LCA. All FAP program transactions are processed through the escrow account, including the Company’s deposits of matching funds, as set out in the agreement, the receipt of grant funding from CPRIT and the payment of eligible R&D expenses. Although the CPRIT grant and R&D supplier contracts are with Emtora, the joint arrangement nature of the LCA results in Emtora being deemed to be acting as the Company’s agent. Accordingly, the Company recognises 100% of the grant and 100% of the R&D expenditure. The CPRIT grant recognised is on a 1 for 2 match. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policy, the grant, as it is the re-imbursement of directly related costs, is credited to R&D costs in the same period in The Statements of Comprehensive Income. The escrow account is recognised within prepayments, CPRIT grant received in advance is recognised within deferred revenue and any grant not yet received is recognised in accrued income. In 1H24 the company recognised R&D costs of £0.2 million on the FAP project, this was made up of expenditure of £0.5 million netted against CPRIT grant of £0.3 million. The balances as at June 30, 2024 were as follows in relation to the FAP project: Prepayments £1.2 million Deferred revenue £0.1 million The gain on the equity settled derivative financial liability in 1H24 and 1H23 arose as a result of the fall in the Biodexa share price. Income tax is recognised or provided at amounts expected to be recovered or to be paid using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the Group Statement of Financial Position date. Research and development tax credits are recognised on an accruals basis and are included as an income tax credit under current assets. The research and development tax credit recognised is based on management’s estimate of the expected tax claim for the period and is recorded within taxation under the Small and Medium-sized Enterprise Scheme. Basic loss per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net loss for the period from continuing operations, attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent company, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. As the Group made a loss for the period the diluted loss per share is equal to the basic loss per share. The Company has considered the guidance set out in IAS 33 in calculating the denominator in connection with the issuance of Pre-Funded, Abeyance Shares, Series A, Series B and Series C warrants as disclosed in note 8. Management have recognised the warrants from the date of grant rather than the date of issue of the corresponding Ordinary Shares when calculating the denominator. The Group has made a loss in the current and previous periods presented, and therefore the options and warrants are anti-dilutive. As a result, diluted earnings per share is presented on the same basis as basic earnings per share. The individual intangible assets which are material to the financial statements are as follows: *asset is not yet in use and has not started amortising On April 25, 2024 the Company entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement (LCA) with Rapamycin Holdings, Inc. (d/b/a Emtora Biosciences), relating to the license of eRapa. In consideration for the License, the Company made an upfront payment of 378,163 ADSs (equal to five percent of our then outstanding Ordinary Shares, calculated on a fully-diluted basis). In addition, a promissory note previously issued by Emtora in favor of the Company in the amount of $0.25 million was forgiven and certain historical liabilities relating to their on-going FAP and NMIBC programs were settled. The Company is also obligated to make quarterly payments to Emtora of $0.25 million less 75% of any research sales by Emtora until the handover trigger event occurs. The obligation meets the definition of a financial liability in accordance with IAS32 and is measured at fair value in accordance with IFRS9. Management have estimated the expected liability to be $3.1 million and the present value as $2.5 million. In addition, the Company is also responsible for up to $31.5 million in sales milestones within the first six months of commercial sale of a first-approved indication of eRapa in certain markets, with decreasing milestones for subsequent approvals for additional indications. There is also a one-time $10.0 million milestone payable upon cumulative net sales of $1.0 billion. Further, the Company is also obligated to pay Emtora single digit tiered royalties on net sales of eRapa, in addition to honouring Emtora’s legacy royalty obligations and paying Emtora fees related to income derived from sublicensing and partnering of eRapa. The LCA also provides the Company with the exclusive option to acquire all of the capital stock of Emtora on commercially reasonable terms in the 90 days after acceptance of the filing of an NDA by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”). If the Company does not exercise the option, it would be required to make additional quarterly payments, as disclosed in note 7, until the first commercial sale of the product. The Company is obligated to make quarterly payments to Emtora of $0.25 million less 75% of any research sales by Emtora until the handover trigger event occurs. The obligation meets the definition of a financial liability in accordance with IAS32 and is measured at fair value in accordance with IFRS9. Management have estimated the expected liability to be $3.1 million and the present value as $2.5 million. This financial liability is measured on Level 3, the fair value is derived using a discounted cash flow approach. The discount rate applied to the obligation was 11.64% (2023: n/a). A 1% increase or decrease in the discount rate would decrease or increase the liability by approximately £0.03 million (2023: n/a) and £0.03 million (2023: n/a), respectively. An increase in the liability would result in a loss in the revaluation of financial instruments, while a decrease would result in a gain. There were no transfers between Level 1 and 2 in the period. Equity settled derivative financial liability is a liability that is not to be settled for cash. No warrants recognised as equity settled derivatives were exercised in 2023. The Company issues warrants exercisable into ADSs of the Company as part of registered direct offerings and private placements in the US. The number of ADSs to be issued when exercised is fixed, however the exercise price is denominated in US Dollars being different to the functional currency of the Company. Therefore, the warrants are classified as equity settled derivative financial liabilities recognised at fair value through the profit and loss account (‘FVTPL’). The financial liability is valued using the Black-Scholes model. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on re-measurement recognised in profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any interest paid on the financial liability and is included in the ‘finance income’ or ‘finance expense’ lines item in the income statement. A key input in the valuation of the instrument is the Company share price. Details of the warrants are as follows: May 2024 warrants In May 2024 the Company issued 2,359,012 Series G ADS Warrants and 3,695,218 Series H ADS Warrants as part of the Warrant Inducement Transaction. The exercise price per ADS is $2.50. December 2023 warrants In December 2023 the Company issued 3,000,063 Series E ADS Warrants and 3,000,063 Series F ADS Warrants as part of the Registered Offering in the US. The exercise price per ADS is $2.20. May 2023 warrants In June 2023 the Company issued 276,689 Series D ADS Warrants as part of a registered direct offering and private placement in the US after securing shareholder approval. The exercise price per ADS was $16.00. May 2020 warrants In May 2020 the Company issued 838 ADS warrants as part of a registered direct offering in the US. October 2019 warrants In October 2019 the Company issued 392 ADS warrants as part of a registered direct offering in the US. Warrant re-price On May 22, 2024 the Company entered into agreements with several accredited investors to exercise existing Series E warrants and Series F warrants, issued in December 2023, to purchase up to an aggregate of 4,358,322 ADSs. The warrant holders agreed to exercise the Series E and/or Series F warrants at an exercise price of $1.50 (reduced from $2.20) per ADS. Warrants and Dara share options The Group also assumed fully vested warrants and share options on the acquisition of DARA Biosciences, Inc. (which took place in 2015). The number of ordinary shares to be issued when exercised is fixed, however the exercise prices are denominated in US Dollars. The warrants are classified equity settled derivative financial liabilities and accounted for in the same way as those detailed above. The financial liability is valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The exercise price of the outstanding options is $1,903.40. The following table details the outstanding warrants and options over ADSs and ordinary shares recognised as equity settled derivative financial liabilities as at June 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and also the movement in the year: Fair value hierarchy The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities; Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly; and Level 3: techniques which use inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data. The fair value of the Group’s derivative financial liability is measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The following table gives information about how the fair value of this financial liability is determined. Changing the unobservable risk-free rate input to the valuation model by 10% higher while all other variables were held constant, would not impact the carrying amount of shares (2023: nil). There were no transfers between Level 1 and 2 in the period. The financial liability measured at fair value on Level 3 fair value measurement represents consideration relating to warrants issued in May 2024, December 2023, June 2023, May 2020 and October 2019 as part of Private Placements, Registered Direct offerings and the Warrant Inducement Transaction. During the period the Company issued the following warrants over ADSs, and these were recognised in the warrant reserve until exercise: The Series A, Series B and Series C warrants are exercisable on an ‘alternative cashless basis’ effectively allowing the holders to exercise for nil consideration. Ordinary and deferred shares were recorded as equity. The Directors consider there to be no related party transactions during the periods reported other than Directors Remuneration. The Company entered into an Arrangement Agreement with Bioasis on December 13, 2022 as amended on December 18, 2022. Under the agreement the Company agreed to acquire the entire issued share capital of Bioasis for consideration of, in aggregate, approximately C$7.4 million (c£4.4 million). The agreement was subject to shareholder approval. On January 23, 2023 at the General Meeting to approve the Arrangement Agreement none of the special resolutions were passed and, accordingly, the acquisition of Bioasis did not proceed. Under the agreement the Company agreed to reimburse Bioasis US$225,000 for expenses relating to the transaction should the Company’s shareholders not approve the transaction. On March 3, 2023 the Company advised Bioasis that it would offset this liability against the $500,000 loan it advanced to them during December 2022 and January 2023. As at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 the Company had a contingent liability of $225,000 in relation to this potential liability. On July 22, 2024, the Company utilised its capacity under its Registration Statement on Form F-3 to raise $5.0 million in gross proceeds in a Registered Direct Offering with certain institutional investors for the sale of an aggregate of 5,050,808 ADSs and 278,975 pre-funded warrants at a price of $0.94 per ADS. In a concurrent Private Placement, the Company issued and sold to the Investors (i) Series J warrants exercisable for 5,329,783 Depositary Shares, and (ii) Series K Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 5,329,783 Depositary Shares. The Series J and Series K warrants are exercisable for five years and one year, respectively, at $1.00 per ADS each. On August 27,2024, the Company , received a Staff Determination letter (the “Letter”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying the Company of the Staff’s determination to delist the Company’s securities from The Nasdaq Capital Market because the Company’s securities have had a closing bid price below $1.00 for 30 consecutive business days, which triggers a notice of delisting pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the “Rule”). Normally, a company would be afforded a 180-calendar day period to demonstrate compliance with the Rule. However, pursuant to Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A)(iv), the Company is not eligible for any compliance period specified in Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) because the Company effected reverse stock splits over the prior two-year period with a cumulative ratio of 250 shares or more to one. Accordingly, and as described in the Letter, unless the Company timely requested a hearing before a Hearings Panel (the “Panel”), the Company’s securities would be subject to suspension/delisting. Accordingly, the Company requested a hearing before the Panel. The hearing request will automatically stay any suspension or delisting action pending the hearing and the expiration of any additional extension period granted by the Panel following the hearing. On September 19, 2024, the Company announced a ratio change on its ADSs from one (1) ADS representing four hundred (400) ordinary shares, to the new ratio of one (1) ADS representing ten thousand (10,000) ordinary shares (the "Ratio Change"). The effective date of the Ratio Change is expected to be October 4,2024. vv Attachment

Title: Nvidia is back in the $3 trillion club — and Jensen Huang is $2 billion richer

Nvidia (NVDA) chief executive Jensen Huang is $2.3 billion richer thanks to a recent bump in Nvidia stock. Shares of the chip giant were up more than 2% in pre-market trading, after closing up about 2% at $123.51 apiece Wednesday. The uptick in the company’s stock brought its market capitalization back above $3 trillion, recovering ground from recent losses and bringing Nvidia back into the coveted club. Huang’s net worth now stands at $108 billion, making him the 13th-richest person in the world, according to Forbes. The CEO has a roughly 3% stake in Nvidia, which makes up the majority of his net worth. This current uptick in Nvidia stock may be driven by Bain’s annual technology report, released Wednesday, that predicted that the market for AI products could reach as much as almost $1 trillion by 2027. The consulting firm predicted that companies will need to make “unprecedented levels of investment in technology infrastructure” to remain on top — a positive signal to investors that mass funding of data centers and other critical AI infrastructure will remain strong. “If large data centers currently cost between $1 billion and $4 billion, costs for data centers five years from now could be between $10 billion and $25 billion,” the report said. Nvidia is one of the world’s largest semiconductor manufacturers, and has become a bellwether for excitement and demand for artificial intelligence. The company has seen its bottom line balloon on demand for chips that can power the AI boom, like its Blackwell and H200 chips. It was also the first chipmaker to reach a $2 trillion market cap in February, snagging the title of third-most valuable company in the world in March. It was briefly the most valuable company in the world this summer. But shares have been largely trending downward for the past month. Despite an earnings beat that saw record second-quarter revenue of $30 billion for fiscal year 2025 — up 122% from a year ago — Nvidia stock is still down 2% over the past month. Shares fell as much as 12.55% in the days following the its earnings report on Aug. 29. Still, the chipmaker’s shares have climbed around 156% so far this year. And compared with a year ago, Nvidia’s stock is up over 190%. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Elon Musk is $100 billion richer than in April thanks to Tesla's stock surge — and worth more than McDonald's or Pepsi

Elon Musk is riding high again after a rough start to the year. The Tesla CEO's net worth crashed from $229 billion at the start of January to $164 billion by late April, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The $65 billion decline was fueled by Tesla stock tanking more than 40% in that period. However, shares of the EV maker have surged by over 80% from their April low, driving a more than $100 billion increase in Musk's wealth to $270 billion at Wednesday's close. That includes an almost $50 billion rise since August 7, when Musk's fortune stood at an estimated $223 billion. The epic comeback means Musk went from being the world's biggest wealth loser for the year in April, to the fourth-greatest gainer with a $41 billion increase. Only Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, and Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison have grown their net worth more. Musk also remains easily the richest person on the planet with a $270 billion fortune — worth more than corporate titans like Salesforce ($262 billion), PepsiCo ($233 billion), or McDonald's ($216 billion). Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, worth $215 billion, and Zuckerberg, worth $202 billion, still trail him by a distance. Yet it's worth noting that Musk has been much richer in the past. In November 2021, he was worth an astounding $340 billion. Tesla stock is down nearly 40% from there, leaving Musk about $70 billion poorer than at his peak. Musk's wealth rebound this year reflects renewed optimism about not just Tesla but the wider stock market and US economy. The Federal Reserve recently made its first cut to interest rates after hiking them from nearly zero to north of 5% in under 16 months, pushing stocks to record highs and easing inflation and recession fears. The Tesla chief warned last year that soaring prices, steeper rates, and a looming downturn were bad news for his company. Consumers had less disposable income to spend on a car, buying one had become more costly and difficult due to higher borrowing costs and stricter lending, and people may have been holding off buying a new car until the economy improved, he said. In April, Musk announced sweeping layoffs, Tesla published disappointing first-quarter delivery numbers, and investors fretted about price cuts squeezing profit margins and Chinese rivals like BYD taking market share from Tesla. Those myriad concerns tanked the stock, but signs of easing economic pressures have underpinned a recovery in recent weeks. It's worth noting that Musk's vast fortune also reflects his roughly 42% ownership of SpaceX, the rocket company valued at $210 billion in June, and his stakes in X, Neuralink, xAI, and The Boring Company.

Micron Technology's (MU) bullish outlook is driving its and chipmaking peers' shares higher in premarket trading; Costco Wholesale (COST) is expected to post both quarterly profit and sales gains after the bell; Meta Platforms (META) stock adds to record highs; OpenAI reportedly is planning to restructure to become a for-profit organization and give Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Sam Altman a massive stake; and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell makes his first remarks today after last week's supersized interest-rate cut. U.S. stock futures—especially the tech-dominated Nasdaq—are rising on Micron's rosy outlook after indexes closed mixed Wednesday. Here's what investors need to know today. Micron Technology (MU) shares are jumping 16% in premarket trading after the memory chipmaker's revenue and outlook blew past expectations. The Nvidia (NVDA) partner swung to a profit in its fiscal fourth quarter and almost doubled revenue, buoyed by "robust AI demand," according to CEO Sanjay Mehrotra. Micron's results lifted other chipmakers and semiconductor industry suppliers, with ASML Holding (ASML) jumping 4% and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), and Nvidia all up about 2%. Costco Wholesale (COST) will report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings after the closing bell Thursday, with analysts projecting year-over-year growth on the top and bottom lines. It will be the retailer's first results since it raised its membership fees for the first time in seven years. Analysts are projecting very little further appreciation for the shares, which are edging higher in premarket trading and have climbed nearly 40% this year. Meta Platforms (META) shares, which hit an all-time high Wednesday, are rising a further 2% in premarket trading after the company unveiled new products at its annual Connect conference. In his keynote address, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced a lower-cost Quest 3S headset, Orion augmented reality glasses, new features for its smart glasses made in partnership with Ray-Ban, and new AI features, among other things. OpenAI reportedly is planning to restructure to become a for-profit organization, as the Microsoft (MSFT)-backed company struggles with an ongoing exodus of key personnel. According to Reuters, which first reported the plan, OpenAI is in talks to give CEO Sam Altman equity worth up to $150 billion, while Bloomberg said the company is discussing giving him a 7% stake. Meanwhile, OpenAI's long-serving Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Mira Murati was among those to announce a departure Wednesday. It's a big day for Federal Reserve speakers, among them Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who will deliver pre-recorded opening remarks at the 2024 U.S. Treasury Market Conference. Powell's speech will be his first since announcing last week's jumbo-sized interest-rate cut. Investors will also be on the lookout for comments from New York Fed President John Williams and Fed Vice Chair Michael Barr on the health of the U.S. economy. Data due today include a revised estimate of second-quarter GDP.

Title: Nvidia Stock -- The Road To $200
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/09/26/nvidia-stockthe-road-to-200/
Time Published: 2024-09-26T10:00:51Z
Full Content:
Visitors check out Nvidia's AI technology at the 2024 Apsara Conference in Hangzhou, China, on ... [+] September 19, 2024. (Photo by Costfoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Could Nvidia stock reach $200 in the next two years? We think there is a possibility. How? Consider this, just about nine months ago, at the end of December 2023, Nvidia stock was trading at around $50 levels. This year the stock has grown over 2x since and trades at close to $116 presently. Looking at valuations, Nvidia stock trades at about 95x trailing earnings. Is this pricey? Not really. Especially if you consider the company’s steadily expanding earnings, the long-growth runway for the artificial intelligence market, and Nvidia’s formidable lead in the accelerated computing market. The Fed’s recent rate cut could also provide a boost as investors seek growth opportunities in a low-rate environment. In the scenario below, we use Nvidia’s revenues, profitability, and valuation multiples to demonstrate a potential path to a $200 stock price. Nvidia’s revenues grew by close to 3x over the last 12 months, while notching an average annual growth rate of about 55% over the last three years, and the momentum can hold up. If Nvidia grows its sales at an average annual rate of over 60% for the next two years, its revenues could move from around $61 billion in FY’24 to around $155 billion by fiscal year 2026 or over 2.5x. There are several trends that could drive continued growth. While the initial AI models deployed by the likes of OpenAI in 2022 were largely text-based, models are increasingly multimodal, working with speech, images, video, and 3-D calling for higher computing power and a larger number of GPU shipments. Moreover, unlike a decade or so ago when advancements in computing power, particularly with processors, outpaced the development software that could fully utilize these capabilities, in the AI era, the demand for computing power has skyrocketed due to the intense computational requirements of machine learning models. This trend could result in sustained strong demand for Nvidia. Moreover, last week’s monetary easing by the Federal Reserve could provide an additional boost to Nvidia. The Fed’s 0.5% rate cut last Wednesday marked the first interest rate cut in close to four years. Check out our analysis of other ways to profit from the Fed’s next move? With the benchmark federal funds rate standing at 4.75% to 5% post the cut, there remains room for the central bank to lower interest rates further. Lower rates are typically beneficial for growth sectors including technology, which have higher earning potential in outer years, as lower discount rates boost the present value of future earnings. The lower rates are particularly beneficial to Nvidia. Why? Lower interest rates would reduce financing costs for builders of large data centers, potentially driving up capital spending in the space, and helping players like Nvidia which sells GPUs for servers. Moreover, the economics of the AI revolution remain mixed, given the high costs of model training and inferencing. A drop in interest rates could improve the financial feasibility of these investments. Now the stock markets are often myopic and tend to extrapolate short-term trends for the long run. In Nvidia’s case, the assumption is that demand growth and pricing power will hold up and profits will remain sizable as the generative AI wave advances. However, there are multiple risks and there remains a real possibility that the stock could see a sizable correction. We detail this possibility in our analysis of Nvidia’s downside to $40. Indeed we believe this broad range of upside and downside potential represents a simple fact: Nvidia is a volatile stock. To put things in perspective, NVDA stock swelled over 800% from levels of $13 in early January 2021 to around $130 now, vs. an increase of about 50% for the S&P 500 over this roughly 4-year period. It was a bumpy ride, with returns for the stock being 125% in 2021, -50% in 2022, and 239% in 2023. The underperformance in NVDA’s stock vs. the S&P 500 in 2022 stands out in particular, as the benchmark index had returns of -19% that year. Notably, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Combine this solid revenue growth with the fact that Nvidia’s margins (net income, or profits after all expenses and taxes, calculated as a percent of revenues) are on an improving trajectory. They grew from levels of about 25% in FY 2019 to about 49% in FY 2024 as the company sees better economies of scale and a more favorable product mix skewed toward complex data center products. Software-related sales are also trending higher. We can assume that margins will remain flat at current levels as Nvidia’s launch of pricier higher-end products such as the Blackwell chips are offset by potential competitive pressures. Now, if earnings grow 2.5x, the PE multiple will shrink by 2.5x to levels of about 40x, assuming the stock price stays the same. But that’s exactly what Nvidia investors are betting won’t happen. If earnings expand 2.5x over the next few years, instead of the PE shrinking from a figure around 95x now to about 40x, a scenario where the PE metric stays at about 65x looks quite likely. This would make the growth of Nvidia’s stock about $200 within the next two years or so a real possibility. What about the time horizon for this high-return scenario? In practice, it won’t make much difference whether it takes 2 years or 3, as long as Nvidia is on this revenue expansion trajectory, with margins holding up, the stock price could respond similarly.

William R. Keating, the congress member representing Massachusetts's 9th congressional district, recently made several transactions from his Individual Retirement Account (IRA), as per the latest congressional trade report. Among the most notable transactions, Keating sold a portion of his holdings in Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), Inc. Common Stock (NYSE:CAT) and NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) N.V. - Common Stock (NASDAQ:NXPI). Both transactions were valued between $1,001 and $15,000. In addition to the above, Keating also partially sold his holdings in several corporate securities, including those from Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), Becton Dickinson (NYSE:BDX) & Co, Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Elevance Health Inc, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co, Lowe's Companies Inc (NYSE:LOW), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc, T-Mobile USA Inc, Union Pacific Corp (NYSE:UNP), and Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE:VZ). Each of these transactions was valued between $1,001 and $15,000. Interestingly, two transactions stood out with a higher value. Keating partially sold his holdings in a Comcast Corp note, valued between $15,001 and $50,000. Furthermore, he sold his United States Treasury Series C-2032 note, also valued between $15,001 and $50,000. All transactions were conducted on September 11, 2024, and were reported on September 23, 2024. These trades, as per the report, were made from Keating's IRA, an investment vehicle commonly used by individuals to earmark funds for retirement savings. As investors keep a keen eye on the financial activities of influential figures like congress members, these transactions by Keating provide useful insights. However, as always, it's essential for investors to conduct their own research and consider various factors before making investment decisions. As William R. Keating adjusts his investment portfolio, it's worth noting the recent performance and outlook of Caterpillar, Inc. (NYSE:CAT), one of the stocks he has sold. According to InvestingPro data, Caterpillar has a robust market capitalization of $183.7 billion and has been demonstrating financial resilience. The company's P/E ratio stands at 17.2, reflecting a valuation that is attractive relative to near-term earnings growth, an observation that aligns with an InvestingPro Tip highlighting the company's low P/E ratio in the context of its earnings growth. Investors tracking dividend reliability will find Caterpillar's dividend history compelling, as the company has not only maintained dividend payments for an impressive 54 consecutive years but has also raised its dividend for 10 consecutive years. This consistency in rewarding shareholders is a testament to the company's financial stability and commitment to returning value to its investors, a point that is underscored by two separate InvestingPro Tips. For those looking at stock performance, Caterpillar has delivered a strong return over the last three months, with a price total return of 16.0%. This robust short-term performance is part of a longer trend, as the company has also enjoyed a high return over the last decade. Caterpillar's operational strength is further reflected in its gross profit margin of 32.72% for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, indicating a healthy ability to manage costs and sustain profitability. For investors interested in a deeper dive into Caterpillar's financials and performance metrics, InvestingPro offers additional tips and insights.

On Thursday, JPMorgan maintained its Overweight rating and NT$1,200.00 price target on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (2330:TT) (NYSE:TSM), citing expectations for a robust third-quarter earnings report. The firm anticipates that TSMC's revenue will slightly exceed the upper end of the company's forecast, with projected revenues of US $23.3 billion against guidance of US$22.4-23.2 billion. Gross margins (GMs) are also expected to be at the high end of TSMC's forecast, with an estimate of 54.8% compared to the projected range of 53.5-55.5%. The positive outlook is partly attributed to the strong growth in the N3 technology node, which is used for the latest iPhone builds and new application processors from companies like Mediatek and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). Additionally, the N4 node, primarily utilized for AI accelerators, is expected to contribute to the company's revenue growth. JPMorgan forecasts a quarter-over-quarter revenue increase of approximately 10% for the fourth quarter of 2024 due to these factors. JPMorgan also anticipates that TSMC will continue to communicate strong demand trends for its N3 technology and a persistent supply-demand gap for advanced packaging solutions, particularly the Chip on Wafer on Substrate (CoWoS) technology. The firm's outlook is bolstered by the expectation that 2025 will be a strong year for TSMC. This optimism is based on the sustained demand for AI accelerators, the expansion of N3 engagements beyond Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and an anticipated uptick in gross margins due to improved yields and potential price increases for the N3E technology node. In other recent news, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (TSMC) has reported significant growth in its second quarter of 2024, with a sequential revenue increase of 13.6% in NT dollars and 10.3% in USD. The company's gross margin rose to 53.2%, and its operating margin reached 42.5%. TSMC's High-Performance Computing (HPC) segment accounted for more than half of the total revenue for the first time, standing at 52%. The company revised its full-year revenue guidance to a growth rate slightly above the mid-20s percent in USD terms. BofA Securities maintained a positive outlook on TSMC, reiterating a Buy rating. The firm highlighted the upcoming delivery of a high-numerical aperture extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography tool to TSMC from ASML (AS:ASML), which is expected to enhance the company's capabilities in developing advanced semiconductor processes. TSMC's August financial report showed a revenue of NT$251 billion, a 2% decrease month-over-month but a 33% increase year-over-year. Bernstein SocGen Group updated its outlook on TSMC, increasing the price target to $220 from the previous $200, and retaining an Outperform rating on the stock. The firm suggests TSMC is well-positioned to perform better than its peers should a recession occur, due to its advanced technologies and market share gains. Finally, TSMC's capital expenditure for 2024 is projected to be between USD 30 billion and USD 32 billion, primarily allocated to advanced process technologies. As Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) approaches its next earnings date on October 17, 2024, the company's financial health and market performance remain a focal point for investors. With a market capitalization of $803.45 billion and a P/E ratio of 27.72, TSMC stands as a significant player in the semiconductor industry. In the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, TSMC has reported a revenue growth of 9.44%, showcasing its ability to expand amidst a dynamic tech landscape. This is further evidenced by a substantial quarterly revenue growth of 40.07% in Q2 2024, highlighting the company's strong performance in the short term. InvestingPro Tips suggest that TSMC's robust gross profit margin of 53.36% aligns with JPMorgan's expectations of high-end gross margins for the company. Additionally, with a dividend growth of 42.6% in the same period, TSMC demonstrates its commitment to returning value to shareholders. It's worth noting that the InvestingPro product lists 15 additional tips that can provide deeper insights into TSM's financial health and investment potential. Investors may also find TSMC's price resilience of interest, with the stock trading at 94.25% of its 52-week high. This, combined with a year-to-date price total return of 76.84%, positions TSMC favorably in the eyes of growth-oriented investors. The company's fair value, as assessed by analysts, stands at $214, while InvestingPro's fair value estimation is at $161.5, offering a perspective on the stock's potential undervaluation or overvaluation.

Title: Watch These Meta Platforms Price Levels as Stock Sets Record High

Time Published: 2024-09-26T02:06:11Z

Meta Platforms (META) shares will likely remain in focus for the remainder of the week after the tech titan’s stock set a record high on Wednesday and the company kicked off its annual Connect conference. The company unveiled a lower-cost Quest 3S headset, Orion augmented reality glasses, new artificial intelligence (AI) features, and other tech gadgets at the highly anticipated event. The Facebook and Instagram parent has also turned to celebrities, announcing deals with actors Awkwafina, John Cena, and Judi Dench, among others, that will allow the company to use their voices in a new AI assistant. Since the start of the year, Meta’s stock has gained around 60% through Wednesday’s close as the social media company's latest quarterly results indicate that significant investments in AI infrastructure and product innovations have started to translate into higher advertising revenue and earnings. Meta shares gained 0.9% on Wednesday to finish at $568.31, after surging to an all-time high of $576.88 during the session. Below, we take a closer look at the technicals on Meta’s chart and identify important price levels to watch out for. Meta shares broke out from a five-month ascending triangle on above-average volume earlier this month, with the stock price continuing to track higher into its Connect 2024 conference. The stock’s breakout coincided with the relative strength index (RSI) moving into overbought territory to confirm bullish price momentum but also caution of short-term stretched conditions. To forecast potential price targets above the stock’s all-time high (ATH), investors can use the measuring principle and a more subjective bars pattern. Let’s look at each in further detail. To project a price target using the measuring principle, we calculate the distance of the ascending triangle near its widest point and add that amount to the pattern’s top trendline. For instance, we add $165 to $535, which forecasts an upside target in the stock at $700. Speculating an upside target using a bars pattern works by using a prior trending move to forecast a potential future move, assuming price action tends to rhyme. In this case, we extract the stock’s trend higher from December to March and reposition it from this month’s low, which projects a price target of around $790. We selected this prior move because it commenced from an earlier ascending triangle’s lower trendline on Meta’s chart, similar to the stock’s price action from the most recent ascending triangle. Given the RSI indicator points to overbought conditions in the stock, investors should also keep a close eye on the $535 level, an area on the chart where prior resistance could become future support near the ascending triangle's upper trendline. Market participants who prefer to trade pullbacks rather than chase breakouts could look for buying opportunities near this area.

September 25, 2024 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, Sept. 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Indivior PLC (NASDAQ: INDV), CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD), DXC Technology Company (NYSE:DXC), and Five Below, Inc. (NASDAQ: FIVE). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Indivior PLC (NASDAQ: INDV) Class Period: February 22, 2024 - July 8, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 1, 2024 The Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants (1) grossly overstated their ability to forecast the negative impact of certain legislation on the financial prospects of Indivior products, which forecasting ability was far less capable and effective than Defendants had led investors and analysts to believe; (2) overstated the financial prospects of SUBLOCADE, PERSERIS and OPVEE, and thus overstated the Company's anticipated revenue and other financial metrics; (3) knew or recklessly disregarded that because of the negative impact of certain legislation on the financial prospects of Indivior's products, Indivior was unlikely to meet its own previously issued and repeatedly reaffirmed FY 2024 net revenue guidance, including its FY 2024 net revenue guidance for SUBLOCADE, PERSERIS and OPVEE; (4) knew or recklessly disregarded that Indivior was at a significant risk of, and/or was likely to, cease all sales and marketing activities related to PERSERIS; and (5) knew or recklessly disregarded that, as a result of the foregoing, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. For more information on the Indivior class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/INDV CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD) Class Period: November 29, 2023 - July 29, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 30, 2024 CrowdStrike is a global cybersecurity company that provides software that helps prevent data breaches. According to the complaint, CrowdStrike’s main product is the Falcon software platform, which purportedly uses artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to detect, prevent, and respond to security breach threats. The CrowdStrike class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) CrowdStrike had instituted deficient controls in its procedure for updating Falcon and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (ii) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of CrowdStrike’s customers; and (iii) such outages could pose, and in fact ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to CrowdStrike. The CrowdStrike class action lawsuit further alleges that on July 19, 2024, news broke that a flawed Falcon content update caused major worldwide technology outages for millions of devices running Microsoft Windows. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell more than 11%, according to the complaint. Then, on July 22, 2024, the CrowdStrike class action lawsuit further alleges that Congress called on CrowdStrike CEO, defendant George Kurtz, to testify regarding the crisis and CrowdStrike’s stock rating was downgraded by analysts such as Guggenheim and BTIG. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell more than 13%, according to the complaint. Finally, on July 29, 2024, news outlets reported that Delta Air Lines had hired prominent attorney David Boies to seek damages from CrowdStrike following the software outage, according to the complaint. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell nearly 10%, according to the CrowdStrike class action lawsuit. For more information on the CrowdStrike class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/CRWD DXC Technology Company (NYSE:DXC) Class Period: May 26, 2021 - May 16, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 1, 2024 According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants misrepresented its ongoing “transformation journey” and the Company’s ability to integrate previously acquired companies and business systems. While touting its ongoing success in implementing that integration, DXC repeatedly stressed its commitment to reducing the Company’s restructuring and transaction, separation, and integration (“TSI”) costs in order to increase its free cashflow and “unleash [its] true earnings power.” In truth, Defendants knew or recklessly disregarded that the Company was only able to reduce its restructuring and TSI costs by limiting its integration efforts. The complaint alleges that on August 3, 2022, DXC reported disappointing first quarter results, despite having reiterated its guidance just six weeks prior. DXC blamed its poor performance on the fact that its “cost optimization efforts have moved at a slower pace than anticipated.” These disclosures caused the price of DXC common stock to decline by 17%, from $31.52 per share to $26.15 per share. Then, on May 16, 2024, DXC’s CEO admitted that “the previous restructurings did not set a real, clean, solid, fully integrated baseline for profitable growth” because the systems that were acquired over time were “never integrated, never deduped,” and admitted that the Company was “not [a] fully functional organization.” DXC also announced it would need to spend an additional $250 million to achieve the restructuring and integration process it falsely claimed to have been successfully implementing during the Class Period. These disclosures caused the price of DXC common stock to decline nearly 17%, from $19.88 per share to $16.52 per share. For more information on the DXC class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/DXC Five Below, Inc. (NASDAQ: FIVE) Class Period: December 1, 2022 - July 16, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 30, 2024 According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided investors with false and/or materially misleading information about Five Below’s financial strength and operations, including its outlook for the first quarter and full year 2024. This information included Five Below’s statement that net sales are expected to be in the range of $826 million to $846 million based on opening approximately 55 to 60 new stores in the first quarter. Further, Five Below claimed that net sales for the full year are expected to be in the range of $3.97 billion to $4.07 billion based on opening between 225 and 235 new stores. Investors discovered that these statements were false and/or materially misleading when, on June 5, 2024, Five Below announced disappointing first quarter 2024 sales result and cut its full year 2024 guidance stating, “Net sales are expected to be in the range of $3.79 billion to $3.87 billion based on opening approximately 230 new stores.” At the same time, Five Below claimed that for the second quarter, “Net sales are expected to be in the range of $830 million to $850 million based on opening approximately 60 new stores.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

Meta Platforms, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:META) Chief Product Officer, Christopher K. Cox, has recently sold a portion of his holdings in the company. The transaction, which took place on September 23, involved the sale of 10,000 shares of Class A common stock at a price of $569.93 per share, amounting to a total of over $5.6 million. This sale was conducted under a prearranged 10b5-1 trading plan, which allows company insiders to sell shares at a predetermined time to avoid accusations of trading on nonpublic information. The shares sold by Cox were held by the Christopher K. Cox Revocable Trust, for which he is the trustee. Following the sale, Cox's trust still retains a significant stake in the company, with 328,662 shares of Meta Platforms' Class A common stock remaining. Additionally, Cox is associated with the Cox-Vadakan Irrevocable Remainder Trust, which holds 55,046 shares. Investors often monitor insider sales as they may provide insights into executives' views on the company's current valuation and future prospects. However, it is important to note that such transactions do not necessarily indicate a lack of confidence in the company; they may be part of personal financial planning or diversification strategies. Meta Platforms, Inc., formerly known as Facebook Inc ., is a leader in the technology sector, specifically within the computer programming and data processing industry. The company has made significant strides in recent years to expand its offerings beyond social media, delving into areas such as virtual reality and augmented reality. The sale by Cox was officially filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 25, with Erin Guldiken signing as attorney-in-fact for Christopher K. Cox. As insiders' transactions are publicly disclosed, investors have the opportunity to stay informed about the financial moves of Meta Platforms' top executives. In other recent news, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META). has been actively showcasing its advancements in augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The company's annual Connect conference highlighted the development of its first AR glasses, and an update to its AI chatbot feature that now allows users to select a voice of their choice. Despite technical challenges, Meta continues to invest heavily in AI and AR technologies, with projected capital expenses for 2024 estimated to be between $37 billion to $40 billion. Simultaneously, Meta has decided to hold off on joining the European Union's AI Pact, focusing instead on complying with the upcoming EU's Artificial Intelligence Act. The Act, set to be implemented by August 2, 2026, will require companies to provide detailed accounts of the data used to train their AI models. In the financial realm, both Roth Capital and BofA Securities have provided positive outlooks on Meta's shares. Roth Capital highlighted a steady increase in the company's cost per thousand impressions, a key indicator of robust advertising demand. BofA Securities maintained its Buy rating for Meta, anticipating the launch of advanced AI chat options and new AI capabilities for WhatsApp and Messenger. In its push towards environmental responsibility, Meta has secured up to 3.9 million carbon offset credits in a deal with BTG Pactual’s forestry arm, marking the company's most significant carbon removal procurement from a single project to date. This is part of Meta's strategy to achieve net-zero emissions by 2030. Lastly, Meta along with other tech giants is engaged with the European Union regarding the upcoming enforcement of the AI Act. The companies are participating in the drafting of the codes of practice for the new legislation, expected to be finalized by late next year. These are the recent developments involving Meta Platforms Inc. Amidst the news of Meta Platforms, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:META) Chief Product Officer, Christopher K. Cox, selling a portion of his holdings, current and potential investors may find it beneficial to consider additional metrics and tips from InvestingPro.

InvestingPro Tips suggest that Meta Platforms holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, providing the company with financial flexibility and resilience. Moreover, the company's P/E ratio is 28.42, which, when adjusted for near-term earnings growth, becomes even more attractive at 26.66.

Micron Technology (MU) shares surged in extended trading Wednesday as the company's revenue and outlook blew past expectations. The memory chip maker and Nvidia (NVDA) partner swung to a profit of $887 million or 79 cents per share in the fiscal fourth quarter, from a loss of $1.43 billion or $1.31 per share a year ago. Revenue nearly doubled to $7.75 billion, topping analysts' estimates. Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said the revenue gains were driven by “robust AI demand," and that the company is moving into fiscal 2025 “with the best competitive positioning in Micron's history." Micron said it expects current-quarter revenue to reach a record high between $8.5 billion to $8.9 billion, with the low end of that range above the analyst consensus. The company's projection for diluted earnings per share (EPS) of between $1.46 and $1.62 also exceeded estimates. Shares of Micron jumped more than 13% to $108.34 in extended trading Wednesday following the release.

Shares of Texas-based power generator Vistra (VST) surged nearly 6% higher on Wednesday, the largest daily gain of any S&P 500 stock. Vistra is no stranger to market-leading upticks, having surpassed Nvidia (NVDA) as the top-performing stock in the benchmark index this year. Despite the run-up in Vistra's stock price in 2024, several investment firms suggested there could be more upside potential for shares of the utility company. In research notes published this week, Jefferies boosted its price target on Vistra shares to $137 from $99, while Morgan Stanley lifted its target on the stock to $132 from $110. Analysts described catalysts that could help Vistra stock extend its march higher. Jefferies pointed to the firm's acquisition last week of the remaining 15% noncontrolling interest in its Vistra Vision subsidiary, which includes nuclear generation facilities as well other renewable and energy-storage assets. Analysts equated the Vision deal to buying back shares at a discount. The report from Jefferies also focused on the recent announcement from fellow electricity generator Constellation Energy (CEG) that it will restart a shuttered nuclear plant to provide power to Microsoft (MSFT) data centers. The analyst team believes the deal "confirms and expands" their thesis that Vistra stands to benefit from data-center opportunities, while the terms of the 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA) between Constellation and the software giant set a precedent for lucrative agreements in the future. So far in 2024, Vistra shares have more than tripled in value.

Major U.S. equities indexes were mixed on Wednesday as the upbeat mood that followed last week's interest-rate cut showed signs of dissipating. The S&P 500 slipped 0.2% on the day, receding from the all-time closing high posted in the previous session. The Dow fell 0.7%, failing to extend its streak of four consecutive record closes. The Nasdaq eked out a minimal daily gain of less than 0.1%. Shares of the financial technology company Global Payments (GPN) plunged 6.5%, posting the widest loss of any stock in the S&P 500 for the second straight day. The payment solutions provider issued underwhelming profit guidance at an investor conference earlier this week, noting it expects a year of transition in fiscal 2025. Analysts at the financial firm BTIG downgraded Global Payment stock to neutral, citing a lack of visibility in the company's growth trajectory that they believe leaves the stock in "no man's land" over the coming quarters. Amgen (AMGN) shares lost 5.5% after the drugmaker released data from a Phase 3 clinical trial of an experimental eczema treatment. Although Amgen's drug met its primary endpoint in the study, analysts question whether the results were strong enough for the treatment to merit a strong share in a market already served by Dupixent, a medication jointly developed by Amgen rivals Sanofi (SNY) and Regeneron (REGN). Shares of major U.S. automakers moved lower following unfavorable comments from analysts at Morgan Stanley. The investment firm downgraded General Motors (GM) to "underweight" from "equal weight" and scaled back its view on Ford Motor (F) to "equal weight" from "overweight," citing increased competition in China and a challenging environment for U.S. consumers. GM shares were down 4.9% on Wednesday, while Ford shares slid 4.1%. Vistra (VST) shares soared 5.9%, securing the S&P 500's top daily performance after Jefferies and Morgan Stanley boosted their price target on the utility stock. Analysts reacted positively to Vistra's recent acquisition of the remaining stake in its Vistra Vision subsidiary. In addition, the analysts said they believe the recent deal by fellow electricity generator Constellation Energy (CEG) to power Microsoft (MSFT) data centers sets a positive precedent for other attractive agreements. Constellation Energy shares were up 3.7% on the day. Shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) jumped 5.1% as Barclays upgraded the stock to "overweight" and lifted its price target. Analysts pointed to signs of recovery in the enterprise hardware business and said they view HPE stock as one of the best ways to invest in this trend. Barclays also believes HPE can continue to increase sales of its artificial intelligence (AI) servers, make gains in the storage market, and benefit from its acquisition of Juniper Networks (JNPR) announced at the beginning of the year. Intel (INTC) shares added 3.2%, extending strong gains posted this week amid reports of a potential investment of up to $5 billion from asset management firm Apollo Global Management. Intel has also reportedly drawn interest from fellow chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM). In addition, Intel launched two new AI products on Tuesday that are central to its strategy of improving its position in the data center market.

Costco Wholesale (COST) will report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings after the closing bell Thursday, with analysts projecting growth on the top and bottom lines—but very little further appreciation for the shares. The membership-based bulk retailer has seen its stock climb about 40% this year. Of the 19 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha, 13 have a buy rating on Costco's stock. The consensus price target of $912.94 represents only a slim premium to Wednesday's close of $908.42. Costco is projected to report $2.27 billion in net income on just shy of $79.96 billion in revenue, up from $2.2 billion and $78.9 billion, respectively, a year earlier. Investors will be watching closely for the company’s first results since raising its membership price for the first time in seven years. Here’s what you need to know about Costco’s upcoming earnings report.

A sign announces the closing of the observation center for the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in ... [+] Pennsylvania, following an accident on March 28, 1979. A pump failed in the reactor cooling system, shutting down the plant and threatening a nuclear meltdown. (Photo by Owen Franken/Corbis via Getty Images) Nvidia stock has soared 156% in 2024. Meanwhile, shares of Constellation Energy — a provider of nuclear power services and owner of the Three Mile Island facility in Pennsylvania that suffered an accident in March 1979 — have risen 129%. Constellation — which recently signed a 10-year agreement for Microsoft to pay the nuclear energy leader about $16 billion, according to Seeking Alpha — could be a better investment than Nvidia. Here are three reasons: One downside to consider is that analysts’ price targets fully capture Constellation’s upside, according to TipRanks. The demand for energy to operate data centers is forecast to rise as Nvidia revenue growth slows. U.S. power demand has remained roughly unchanged between 2014 and 2024, noted TheStreet. However overall power demand in data centers is projected to surge “160% by 2030,” according to a May 2024 Goldman Sachs report. To be sure, demand for AI-related hardware and software is also forecast to grow rapidly. More specifically, Bain estimates the total addressable market will increase by 40% to 55% annually, ranging between $780 billion and $990 billion by 2027, according to Barron’s. While Nvidia expects to grow faster than the industry, the AI chip designer’s revenue growth is slowing down. Nvidia’s revenues grew in a range of 206% to 265%, between the second quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, according to Investor’s Business Daily. Nvidia is still growing rapidly — but at a lower rate. For instance, the AI chip designer’s revenue increased 122% in the second quarter of 2024 and the company forecasts 80% growth in the third quarter of 2024, I noted in a September post on Forbes. Constellation Energy operates the largest U.S. fleet of nuclear power plants, which is the preferred electricity-generating fuel for tech companies, according to Seeking Alpha. In February 2022, Constellation was spun off from utility company, Exelon. Constellation stock surged 22% on September 20 following the announcement of a 20-year deal with Microsoft to supply electricity from a $1.6 billion restart of the undamaged 835-megawatt nuclear Unit 1 of Three Mile Island — which “closed under economic pressure” in 2019, noted the Wall Street Journal. The facility’s Unit 2 was shut down in 1979 after a partial core meltdown. The resulting five days of panic “heightened awareness of nuclear plants’ potential safety problems and contributed to a loss of enthusiasm for the industry that lasted decades,” the Journal reported. The company’s latest financial report for the June 2024-ending quarter fell short of earnings and revenue expectations. However, Constellation Energy raised its earnings per share forecast for 2024. Specifically, the company’s EPS of $1.68 was four cents below the consensus estimate while the company’s $5.48 billion in revenue fell $70 million short of analysts’ consensus forecast, noted TheStreet. Constellation raised its adjusted EPS outlook for fiscal 2024 by 4.8% to $8 a share at the midpoint of the range — 19 cents more than the consensus, TheStreet reported. Might this boost in Constellation’s earnings growth target foreshadow expectations-beating revenue growth? Analysts lifted the company’s stock price target significantly in the wake of the company’s deal with Microsoft. Examples include: Other analysts were bullish on Constellation. While Guggenheim's Shahriar Pourreza added “the hyperscaler demand for clean megawatts is real,” Mizuho's Maheep Mandloi indicated the arrangement “points to the need for 24×7 clean energy to meet data center needs,” MarketWatch noted. To be sure, anti-nuclear sentiment — while negative at times — is arguably less pronounced than in the past. With state and federal governments urging utilities to use nuclear and renewables fuel to make electricity, Constellation has more support than before. Moreover, since it requires “neither expensive battery storage nor quick-on extra natural gas capacity equal to 110% of renewable capacity,” nuclear has advantages over renewables, reported TheStreet. It appears Wall Street still sees more upside to Nvidia stock. The 42 analysts covering the AI chip designer set an average price target of $152 — representing 24% upside, according to TipRanks, which notes Constellation’s average price target of $214 from 20 analysts makes the stock about 1% overvalued.

Title: Congress Slams CrowdStrike (CRWD) for July Failure - Hagens Berman

September 25, 2024 15:02 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike faced intense scrutiny on Capitol Hill on September 24 as lawmakers demanded answers for a catastrophic software update that crippled essential services across the nation. Hagens Berman urges CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD) investors who suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mark Green (R-Tenn.) castigated the company's CEO, George Kurtz, for evading direct testimony and dispatching a subordinate to address the crisis. “This was a systemic failure with far-reaching consequences,” Green declared, “and we cannot let it happen again.” Adam Meyers, CrowdStrike’s senior vice president, offered a mea culpa for the incident, attributing the widespread outage to a faulty configuration update that caused a "Blue Screen of Death" on millions of Windows devices. However, his apology fell short of assuaging lawmakers' concerns. Congress’ interrogation of CrowdStrike comes on the heels of a September 12 report by SEMAFOR, wherein former CrowdStrike employees painted a picture of a company culture that prioritized speed over quality. Multiple sources described a workplace where mistakes were commonplace, and workers were often undertrained. One former manager even recalled warnings about the potential for catastrophic failures if the company continued to release untested products Securities Class Action Against CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (CRWD): The outage has also sparked litigation against CrowdStrike, with plaintiffs alleging that the company misled investors about the reliability of its flagship Falcon Sensor product. The complaint accuses CrowdStrike of failing to disclose significant risks associated with its update process and of downplaying the potential consequences of a major outage. The truth began to emerge on July 19, 2024, when CrowdStrike issued an automatic update for its flagship Falcon Sensor security product which contained a bug and caused a massive overnight outage that affected 8.5 million Windows computers around the world, disrupting businesses, airports, train stations, banks, broadcasters, and the healthcare sector. Many affected machines were unable to restart, instead showing a blue error screen sometimes called “the blue screen of death.” Then, on July 29, 2024, news outlets reported that one of CrowdStrike’s customers (Delta Airlines) which suffered more than 6,000 flight cancellations hired a prominent attorney to seek damages caused by the faulty update. These events have driven the price of CrowdStrike shares down nearly 16% since the outage.

Mark Zuckerberg is trying once again to bring VR to the masses, this time through a new Quest 3S headset that arrives next month starting at $299. The device promises to offer the same high-quality VR experience found in last year’s pricier Quest 3, for $200 less. “We’ve been working on bringing the Quest 3 family to a lot more people,” Zuckerberg said at the Meta Connect conference on Wednesday. The resulting Quest 3S looks similar, but Meta is indicating it reduced the product’s cost by changing the lens inside the headset. The new headset uses a “fresnel lens” with a lower resolution of 1,832 by 1,920 or 773 pixels per inch. The Quest 3, on the other hand, features “pancake lenses,” which can offer a higher resolution at 2,064 by 2,208 or 1218ppi. In addition, the 3S has a lower field of view at 96 degrees versus 110 degrees, according to the company’s comparison page. The other noticeable change is the exterior cameras, which are positioned differently, although both VR headsets offer full color passthrough, enabling you to view your real-world surroundings while wearing the device. The passthrough is the key to both the Quest 3 and 3S offering a "mixed reality" experience, meaning you can overlay virtual icons and windows on real-world sights. This will eventually include running the Windows OS remotely though the headset, according to Zuckerberg. On the plus side, the 3S can run a little longer, at 2.5 hours per battery charge, despite having a slightly smaller battery. Both headsets also use the same Snapdragon XR2 Gen2 processor and contain 8GB of RAM, which is perhaps why Zuckerberg said the 3S offers the same “defining features” as the Quest 3, including hand-tracking. The company is marketing the Quest 3S for people new to mixed reality experiences, or “who might have been waiting for a low-cost upgrade.” Preorders for Quest 3S start today with the company charging $299 for the 128GB model and $399 for the 256GB model. The product is then slated to start shipping on Oct. 15. Stay tuned for our review. Meta is also cutting the price of the 512GB Quest 3 from $649.99 to $499.

September 25, 2024 14:22 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Sept. 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of Class A common stock of CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD) between November 29, 2023 and July 29, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important September 30, 2024 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased CrowdStrike Class A common stock during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the CrowdStrike class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=27534 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2024. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) CrowdStrike had instituted deficient controls in its procedures for updating its Falcon software platform, and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (2) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of the CrowdStrike’s customers; and (3) such outages could pose, and in fact ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to CrowdStrike. As a result of these materially false and misleading statements and omissions, CrowdStrike stock traded at artificially high prices during the Class Period. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the CrowdStrike class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=27534 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Meta just revealed the budget-friendly Quest 3S VR headset at its annual Connect keynote event, but it also made a sad announcement about some of its previous headsets. The company will stop selling both the Quest 2 and the Quest Pro by the end of the year. “With Quest 3S on the shelf, we’re officially winding down sales of Quest 2 and Pro. We’ll be selling our remaining headsets through the end of the year or until they’re gone, whichever comes first,” the company wrote in a blog post that also announced the pending launch of the Quest 3S. The company will be selling Quest 2 and Pro accessories for “a bit longer” after the stock of headsets runs out. This includes the carrying case, the Touch Pro controllers and bundles like the Quest 2 Active Pack. Meta recently lowered the price of the Quest 2 to $200, and it’s still a decent headset for beginners. The Quest 3S is better in every way, but it starts at $300, while the standard Quest 3 costs $500. It’s the end of an era for the Quest 2. This was a hugely successful headset, as it launched during the dog days of COVID-19. For many, it became a crucial item to survive endless isolation, along with stuff like Zoom and Animal Crossing: New Horizons. It’s the end of an error (see what I did there?) for the Quest Pro. This headset never caught on, likely because it was originally priced at $1,500 before being quickly lowered to $1,000. It still costs a grand from Meta, but can typically be found for around $900 via Amazon and other retailers. As they say, out with the old and in with the new. The Quest 3S is, essentially, the new Quest 2. It starts at $300, boasts the same CPU as the original Quest 3 and handles full-color passthrough.

GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links. The Meta Quest 3S is Meta's new budget-friendly standalone VR headset, and you can preorder now ahead of its October 15 release. By Steven Petite on September 26, 2024 at 3:57PM PDT Meta Quest 3S (128GB) + Batman: Arkham Shadow Bundle $300 Meta Quest 3S (256GB) + Batman: Arkham Shadow Bundle $400 Meta Quest 3 (512GB) + Batman: Arkham Shadow Bundle $500 The newly announced Meta Quest 3S has a pretty awesome launch bundle that makes the already budget-friendly headset more enticing. From now until April 30, 2025, while supplies last, the Quest 3S will come bundled with Batman: Arkham Shadow, a Quest 3-exclusive action game that pits the Caped Crusader against the Rat King. The Meta Quest 3S launch bundle is available in both storage configurations: 128GB for $300 and 256GB for $400. Preorders are live now at multiple major retailers, including Amazon and Walmart, ahead of the headset's October 15 release date. Announced during Meta Connect 2024, the Quest 3S has the same chipset as the standard Quest 3, the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2, and the same amount of RAM (8GB). Just like with the Quest 3, you'll get a pair of Touch Pro controllers that support gesture controls to navigate menus. Battery life, according to Meta, is slightly better with the Quest 3S, with an average playtime between charges of two-and-a-half hours instead of two hours with the regular Quest 3. Where it cuts costs is with the lenses. The Quest 3S is fitted with the 1832 x 1920 fresnel lenses found in the Meta Quest 2, whereas the pricier Meta Quest 3 has 2064 x 2208 pancake lenses for improved resolution and clarity. In addition to the lower-resolution lenses, the Quest 3S drops the depth sensor and has a narrower field of vision. Meta also significantly reduced the price of the regular 512GB Quest 3, which is eligible for the same bundle offer, and discontinued the 128GB Quest 3 (now on clearance for $430). Meta Quest 3 VR headset options: Check out the new Meta Quest 3S bundles below: The base model 128GB Meta Quest 3S costs $300, the same price as the now-discontinued Meta Quest 2. Not only are you getting a more advanced piece of tech for the same price, Meta is throwing in one of the most exciting upcoming Meta Quest 3 and 3S exclusives, Batman: Arkham Shadow. The new Batman game releases October 22, one week after the Quest 3S arrives. The limited-time Meta Quest 3S bundle also comes with three months of Meta Quest+, a subscription program that normally costs $8 per month. With Quest+, you get two free games each month (valued up to $50). Even if you cancel your subscription, you get to keep those freebies. If you're new to the Meta Quest ecosystem, you're essentially getting seven free games with the purchase of the Quest 3S. Since the Quest 3S launches in October, you'll get two free games each month through the end of the year. Amazon also has a bundle that includes the Elite Strap, one of the most popular first-party accessories for Meta Quest headsets. The Elite Strap replaces the default band and is designed to provide better weight distribution to minimize pressure on your face. The strap is fitted with a dial that allows you to make quick adjustments. You can preorder the Meta Quest 3S bundle with the Elite Strap for $365.73 at Amazon. If Amazon drops the price bundle prior to launch, you'll pay the lowest price offered when your preorder is shipped. If you're unsure about the Elite Strap, you can buy it separately later on. At the moment, buying the headset and Elite Strap separately costs the same price as the bundle at Amazon. The 256GB Meta Quest 3S is available to preorder for $400 at Amazon. Like the 128GB version, you'll get Batman: Arkham Shadow and three months of Meta+. Amazon has the Quest 3S 256GB bundle with the Elite Strap included for $465.73. If you want to play Batman: Arkham Shadow but would rather opt for the more powerful Meta Quest 3, the same bundle is available to purchase now at Amazon. The Meta Quest 3 Batman: Arkham Shadow bundle costs $500, which sounds like quite the deal considering the price of the 512GB Quest 3 up until now. Meta revealed the bundle alongside a price drop for the Quest 3. The 512GB model previously cost $650 and will now go for $500. The 128GB model is being discontinued, but remaining stock will be sold for $430 (was $500). As a result of its discontinuation, the 128GB Quest 3 will not be available in the new Batman bundle, but you can buy the headset now for $429 at Walmart.

Title: I tried out Meta's Orion computer glasses. I'd buy them in a heartbeat — if they were actually for sale.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/orion-meta-ar-smart-glasses-review-2024-9
Time Published: 2024-09-25T17:50:17Z
Full Content:
Peter Kafka, Chief Correspondent covering media and technology Here is what you need to know about Orion, the new computer-on-your-face nerd glasses Mark Zuckerberg showed off today: Each pair of glasses reportedly costs Meta $10,000 to make, and the company says it needs time to get them to a price that makes them plausible — think something in the $1,000-ish range, like a laptop or high-end phone. (That $10,000 number comes from The Verge's Alex Heath. Meta declined to comment on the number). If all goes well, it could take a few years for that to happen. 2. I've tried them, and they are very cool! They don't make you look cool — you look like someone wearing tech on your face — but the ideas and engineering behind them are really fascinating. If you're one of the people who complains that Silicon Valley hasn't made anything except soul-sucking social networks and monetization machines for years, here's a compelling counter. More important: Unlike other face-computing tech I've tried over the years — Google's Glass, Apple's Vision Pro, Meta's own line of Quest goggles — this is one I can actually imagine buying, and using, in real life. My brief experience with Orion comes with major caveats. The biggest is that it's not actually ready for mass production. But if this pans out, it will deliver what lots of people in tech, and outside tech, say they want: a wearable computer jammed into a pair of glasses. What would you do with a wearable computer? For starters, lots of things you can do with a phone: Take and make phone calls and video calls. Send and receive texts. Take photos and videos. Watch videos. Play time-wasting games. Play around with AI. And because Orion sits on your face like glasses — bulky glasses that use silicon carbide instead of glass — you can do all those things while looking at, and interacting with, everything and everyone around you. This is "augmented reality" — digital images laid over the real world. As opposed to "virtual reality" — where you are totally enveloped by a digital landscape. There are obvious downsides to this. If you think it's frustrating to talk to someone who keeps looking at their phone to check a text or a viral video, imagine what it will be like to hold a conversation with someone who's staring at you and staring at something else at the very same time.* But there are very intriguing upsides, too. Most obviously: Picture yourself with a task — like changing a tire, making marinara, or solving a math problem — and the ability to simultaneously look at the thing you want to do and instructions on how to do it. Orion uses eye tracking, which means you select digital items just by looking at them. And you manipulate them — turn an app on or off, respond to a text message, swipe through videos on Reels — by making subtle flicks and clicks with your fingers. Those gestures get registered by a snug-but-not-bulky wristband** that registers your muscles' movements using electromyography*** and transmits them wirelessly to your glasses. Orion also comes the closest I've seen to a face computer you could take for a stroll. Unlike other devices I've seen, it doesn't need to be plugged into a bulky power source or tethered to a phone. Instead, it connects wirelessly to a TV-remote-sized power/computing device you can slip into your pocket that connects to the internet via WiFi or cell signals. Meta says its battery will last for two to three hours of continual use. And here, I'm going to stop talking about Orion's specs. Because it seems pretty silly to get very deep into a thing that's still in development and may never actually materialize for mass production. It's also important to stress that my brief demo time was in a Meta building, surrounded by Meta employees who guided me through a Meta-scripted walk-through. I have no idea how, or if, this thing works in the real world. Neither do Meta executives, really. They say they're about to start "dogfooding" the device with lots of employees to get a better sense of how it performs while continuing to figure out how to make it lighter and cheaper. Which brings us to two questions about Zuckerberg's reveal this week. First: Why is Meta showing off something no one's going to be able to buy — at best — for years? This reminds me of pre-iPhone reveals, where it was common for tech companies to show you stuff they might make one day, but very often didn't. When I ask Meta executives that question, they murmur about wanting their fellow employees to see the work they're doing, and to be encouraged by the progress they're making. But surely there are other ways to pump up morale — like having a record-high stock price, which happens to have happened this week. My theory relates to that stock price: that Zuckerberg, who has gotten grief over the years for plowing billions into his metaverse dreams, wants to show the world — and specifically investors — that all those dollars weren't wasted. And that he's getting very close to a consumer device people might buy in very large numbers. Which brings us to my second question: Why does Meta, whose online ad business is one of the world's greatest money-printing machines, want to make hardware anyway? That one is easier to answer. Most practically: As great as that money-printing machine is, it can't work without phones made by Apple and Google — companies that force Meta to play by their rules and restrictions. If Orion, or any other device Meta makes, becomes the future of computing, then Zuckerberg can operate his business on his devices. But if you're into vibes-based answers: Orion's debut is part of the Mark Zuckerberg 3.0 era. One where he says he's done apologizing (even though he's still apologizing) and done with politics (even though politics is not done with him). One where he's trying new looks (including his own designs). So if he wants to take a victory lap with very cool new tech — even if the tech isn't quite ready for prime time? He's going to do that, too. *The entire time I played with Orion, I kept thinking about teenagers I see walking around with a single AirPod in their ear at all times. The idea, supposedly, is that they can keep listening to whatever they want while begrudgingly listening to you, too. I find that half-in, half-out way of interacting with the world incredibly frustrating. But I'm old. Your mileage may vary. **For whatever reason, some Meta people call this a "neural wristband," which makes it seem like it's somehow reading your brain. Thankfully, it is not. ***(I had never heard of this term before this week, either.) Jump to

Title: Meta Will Discontinue Quest 2 & Quest Pro By The End Of The Year

Time Published: 2024-09-25T17:25:28Z

Quest 2 and Quest Pro will no longer be available when stock runs out or at the end of the year, whichever comes first. Meta made the announcement today at Meta Connect 2024. It comes as the company officially revealed and opened preorders for Quest 3S, starting at $300, and announced that it's also discontinuing the 128GB Quest 3 after cutting the price of the 512GB Quest 3 model to $500. When Quest 2, Quest Pro, and the 128GB Quest 3 are gone, Meta's headset lineup will be simplified to: Quest 2 launched in 2020 with a remarkable proposition: a twice as powerful chipset and higher resolution than the original Oculus Quest at a $100 lower price. Sure it also lost the OLED and precise lens separation adjustment of its predecessor, but this didn't seem to matter much as the improved graphics and $300 price point propelled Quest 2 to a level of success no other VR headset has reached before or since. Quest 2 outsold all its predecessors combined within 6 months of being on sale. Meta has now shipped an estimated 20-30 million Quest 2 units through its four years on the market, similar to the number of Xbox Series X/S consoles sold so far. The first major standalone VR games to not support Quest 2 are launching soon, but many other VR apps will likely support Quest 2 for many years to come, and Quest 2's lenses and display will live on in Quest 3S. Building on the success of Quest 2, two years later Meta hoped it could introduce a high-end Quest to serve enthusiasts and businesses. Quest Pro launched in 2022 at $1500. It featured Meta's first pancake lenses, QD-LCD displays with Mini-LED local dimming, eye tracking, face tracking, a battery in the rear of the strap, and ringless self-tracking Touch Pro controllers. In many ways Quest Pro was a pioneering headset. But in others it was lacking. By the time Quest Pro launched, leaks of a Quest 3 arriving a year later with a twice as powerful chipset at half the price had already emerged, severely dampening the headset's value proposition. Further, Quest Pro's underwhelming resolution, grainy passthrough, lack of automatic room sensing for mixed reality, and Meta’s cartoonish avatars not being detailed enough to do the face tracking sensors justice led to mixed-at-best reviews. Just four months after Quest Pro launched Meta cut its price from $1500 to $1000. This kind of price cut so soon after launch was unprecedented, and strongly suggests the headset vastly missed its launch sales targets. By around a year after launch Meta was giving away Quest Pro headsets to Roblox creators, when giving them a Quest 2 would have been perfectly fine. And earlier this year Meta removed the whiteboard, which was designed around the pressure-sensitive stylus tips of Quest Pro's controllers, from Horizon Workrooms. Multiple developers have told UploadVR they see only a tiny fraction of their user base on Quest Pro. As such, almost no Quest game developers took the time to add support for its eye-tracked foveated rendering. When Quest Pro is off the market, Meta will no longer be selling any headsets with eye tracking or face tracking. It's possible one of its Horizon OS partners, such as ASUS or Lenovo, will release a headset with these features some time next year. Get a weekly summary of the most important VR and AR news.

Title: Meta Just Cut The 512GB Quest 3 To $500 And Will Discontinue The 128GB Model

The 128GB storage model of Quest 3 is being discontinued, and the 512GB model has been cut to its $500 price. Quest 3 launched a year ago with two models, 128GB storage for $500 or 512GB for $650. When stock of the 128GB model depletes, the 512GB option will be the sole Quest 3 model. Until that happens, the 128GB model is available at a discounted price of $430. This announcement comes as Meta just officially revealed and opened preorders for Quest 3S, a cheaper headset that has the same Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chipset and color passthrough mixed reality capabilities as Quest 3, but uses the old fresnel lenses and single panel from Quest 2. Meta also announced that it's discontinuing Quest 2 and Quest Pro by the end of the year or when stock runs out, whichever comes first. When Quest 2, Quest Pro, and the 128GB Quest 3 are gone, Meta's headset lineup will be simplified to: As well as simplifying Meta's lineup, this move could push many potential Quest 3S 256GB buyers up to Quest 3, since for $100 more they can get a slimmer headset with double the storage, pancake lenses, higher resolution, and precise IPD adjustment.

Title: Meta Quest 3S vs. Quest 3: More similar than you'd expect
URL: https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-vs-quest-3
Time Published: 2024-09-25T17:21:25Z

No offers found You'll be shocked how alike the Meta Quest 3S is to the costlier Quest 3, though some budget-friendly Quest 2 traits return. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Affordable upgrade Meta has made VR more accessible to consumers again by bringing next-gen gaming and mixed reality apps to the same price point that made the Quest 2 so popular. Its lenses and display are unchanged from the previous generation, but it's more powerful and versatile than ever. Full upgrade The Meta Quest 3 has the same game library and graphical power as the Quest 3S but makes those games more visually appealing with more pixels and a wider view. Plus you get all the storage space you could want. Whether that's enough to pay the extra $200 is up to you. The Meta Quest 3S is here as a low-priced alternative to the Quest 3. If you compare the Meta Quest 3S vs. Quest 3 closely, you'll note a ton of similarities. Although it looks like a Quest 2 with new cameras, it shares more in common with the newer headset, from performance to accessories. If you're a Quest 2 owner, you might have been put off by the Quest 3's higher price and held off on upgrading. Now, the Quest 3S has the same price and many of the same upgrades; however, Meta has also discounted the Quest 3 512GB from $649 to $499 — the original price for the 128GB Quest 3 — and now's a good time to choose the mainline headset, too. Based on our year testing out the Quest 3 and our Quest 3S hands-on demo at Connect, we'll break down every main similarity and difference between the Meta Quest 3S and Quest 3! The Meta Quest 3S is essentially a hybrid between the Quest 2 visuals and Quest 3 hardware. Before breaking down the specific downgrades, we'll explain every way that the Quest 3S will modernize things for Quest 2 users. New CPU & extra RAM: Both the Quest 3 and 3S share the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chip and 8GB of RAM. Meta says this combination delivers twice-as-fast GPU performance for faster loading times. Even though the Quest 2 and 3 share most of the same games, the Quest 3 version will often have an exclusive patch with graphical enhancements like higher refresh rates, reduced fog, better lighting and shadows, more enemies or environmental objects on screen at once, better colors, and improved textures. Quest 3 exclusives: Most developers try to target both the Quest 2 and Quest 3, but some upcoming AAA games will be Quest 3 exclusives because they're too graphically demanding for the Quest 2's headset. So far, we know of Batman: Arkham Shadow, Alien: Rogue Incursion, and the recently-released Hitman 3 VR: Reloaded. Aside from those, many other upcoming Quest games are Quest 3-exclusive because they need full-color passthrough with high mixed-reality resolution to work well. Full-color passthrough: Despite the different camera configuration, the Meta Quest 3S has the same 4MP RGB camera with 18 pixels per degree (PPD) passthrough resolution, letting you see your living room in full color, if not at quite the same resolution as full virtual reality. Mixed-reality games were gimmicky and unpolished when the Quest 3 first launched, but these games have improved significantly in 2024; on the hardware end, Meta fixed mixed-reality warping and made MR apps use 80% less GPU processing in software updates over the summer. With the Quest 3S, you're getting a better MR experience right from the start. Controllers: The Meta Quest 3S uses Touch Plus controllers, the same controller generation as the Quest 3. These controllers remove the bulky tracking ring, relying on LEDs around the controller body for inside-out tracking. They also add improved haptics. Weight: Even though the Meta Quest 3S is thicker than the Quest 3, it weighs 1g less (514 vs. 515g), making the fit experience pretty darn comparable. Accessories: We were surprised to learn that most of the best Quest 3 accessories should carry over to the Quest 3S. According to Meta, its first-party carrying case, Elite Strap, Elite Strap with Battery, Touch Plus Active Straps, Compact Charging Dock, and Link cable will work with the Quest 3S, too. We assume that our favorite third-party Elite Straps will work as well; we'll test this as soon as we have our Quest 3S review unit. The obvious aesthetic difference with the front cameras aside, both the Meta Quest 3S and Quest 3 look very similar to one another, with the white plastic frame, sensors along the edge, and Meta label in front. One small design difference is that Meta removed the Quest 3's 3.5mm headphone jack from the left arm and moved its right-side USB-C charging port to the left. That gives you fewer headphone options than before; your best bet is wireless earbuds with a USB-C dongle that allows for charging passthrough, so you can still use a battery pack. The Meta Quest 3 was the first to use pancake lenses, with a flattened, reflective design that takes up less horizontal space but also requires more brightness. Most other VR headsets use thicker Fresnel lenses that make them front-heavy and have a noticeable "sweet spot" at the center. Our Quest 3 reviewer specifically praised the pancake lenses for eliminating that sweet spot for better visual clarity. One of the Quest 3S' cost cutbacks is using a Fresnel lens. Meta managed to make the Quest 3S 19.3mm thinner than the Quest 2, but it's still 11.6mm thicker than the Quest 3, shifting the weight forward. Just as many people upgraded the Quest 2 with an Elite Strap for better support and security during fast-paced VR games, you'll probably want the same for the Quest 3S. Visually, the Quest 3 and Quest 3S both use LCDs, but the Quest 3 (2,064 x 2,208) gives you 30% higher resolution than the Quest 3S (1,832 x 1,920, or the same as the Quest 2 display). That, combined with the Fresnel sweet spot, will make the visual experience familiar to Quest 2 owners and detract a bit from the next-gen graphics. Also, the Meta Quest 3S shares the Quest 2's shorter and narrower field of view (FoV) compared to the Quest 3. Unfortunately, the Meta Quest 3S brought back the Quest 2's interpupillary distance (IPD) system to save money. You can slide the lenses to three preset distances — 58mm, 63mm, or 68mm — instead of the IPD wheel and 1mm gaps from 53mm to 75mm you get on the Quest 3. During our hands-on, we found you could slide the Quest 3S lenses in-between those three IPD presets (about 60mm or 65mm), in case your personal IPD doesn't match one of those three presets; it's just trickier and less exact than on the Quest 3. Because the Quest 3S made these lens and design changes, Quest 3 facial interfaces won't work with the Quest 3S; Meta will sell a unique "Quest 3S Breathable Facial Interface" if you want a comfort upgrade for VR workouts. Meta started out selling the Quest 3 in 128GB and 512GB versions, but it's phasing out the 128GB model and making 512GB the default. The Quest 3S will ship in 128GB and 256GB sizes, matching the Quest 2 before it went out of stock. Most casual VR gamers will happily make do with 128GB of space; your average VR game takes up 5GB or less, though some of the major titles are 10GB or more. Both headsets use camera sensors to track your controllers or hands and map your surroundings so you don't hurt yourself, as well as a 4MP RGB camera for full-color passthrough. The only camera difference is that Meta gave the Quest 3 a physical depth sensor to determine how close or far away things are, while the Quest 3S uses software to detect it (as the Quest 2 did). Both the Quest 3 and 3S burn through battery quickly because of the Snapdragon XR2 and 8GB of RAM. But even though the Quest 3S (4,324mAh capacity) has a smaller battery than the Quest 3 (5,060 mAh), Meta estimates that the Quest 3S lasts about 18 minutes longer per charge (2.5 hours versus 2.2 hours). We assume that the Quest 3's higher resolution and brighter pancake lenses require more power, making the Quest 3S more efficient. We've asked Meta for confirmation on this. If you own the Quest 2 and want a new VR headset, then you're probably already happy with the level of immersion the Quest 3S will offer with the same resolution and lens. The Quest 3 resolution and storage boost would certainly be nice to have, but maybe not nice enough to justify spending another $200. Because it has the same CPU and memory, the Quest 3S will handle all the same VR and MR games equally well, receive support for the same amount of time, and do slightly better for battery life. It may feel more front-heavy, but an Elite Strap will fix that; frankly, we think the Quest 3 needs an Elite Strap for long-term comfort too, so you'll have to spend the extra money either way. Even though we'll still rank the Meta Quest 3 as the best VR headset today, the Quest 3S will be good enough for everyone who skipped the pricier headset. Affordable upgrade Choose the Meta Quest 3S if you want the power, game library, and mixed-reality passthrough of the Quest 3 for a lower price. Don't choose it if you dislike the Quest 2's visual experience and want something truly next-gen. Full upgrade Choose the Meta Quest 3 for the most storage, a pixel-packed display, wider field of view, and better hand tracking via the depth sensor. Skip it if you're on a budget and can make do without every possible feature.

Title: Meta has officially discontinued three of its VR headsets, including my current favorite

Goodbye Quest 2, Quest Pro, and 128GB Quest 3 When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Meta has launched the Meta Quest 3S (you can check out our hands on Meta Quest 3S review for our thoughts on it) and introduced us to a new affordable member of the Quest family, and also killed off three others. It’s time to officially say goodbye to the Meta Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro, and the 128GB model of the Meta Quest 3. The Meta Quest 2 has been sold out everywhere since July, so this announcement isn’t a surprise – it already happened. It’s sad, but with the 3S here, there’s no reason to pick up a Quest 2, frankly. It was fantastic, and I loved it, but it’s time for the next generation of XR hardware. The Meta Quest Pro has been hanging on, but its demise shouldn’t be a shocker. It’s never a good sign when a product drops one-third of its price in just six months on sale, and since the Quest 3 launch – a way cheaper headset that even performs better in a few key areas – the Quest Pro has very much faded into the background. Meta says these devices will still be on sale until the end of the year or until its remaining stock runs dry – whichever comes first. So if you want one for your collection, act fast, but if I were you, I’d pay attention to a different Quest that’s being killed off. My favorite of the trio: the Meta Quest 3 128GB. As leakers reported the day before Meta Connect, the Quest 3 128GB model is also being discontinued. The 512GB Meta Quest 3 will remain on sale, however, at a reduced price of $499.99 / £469.99 / AU$1,049.99. From now until the stock runs out, the 128GB Meta Quest 3 will be on sale for $429.99 / £409.99 / AU$799.99, and it looks like this could be the best headset to buy right now as it has all the upgrades of the full-Quest 3 while still being fairly affordable. Plus, given that VR games and apps aren’t big files 128GB is more than enough – especially as it’s so easy to delete and later redownload titles if you run out of storage. The only downside of this deal is you’ll miss out on the Batman: Arkham Shadow purchase bonus included with the Meta Quest 3S models and 512GB Meta Quest 3. This is a slight incentive to opt for the 512GB model instead, but even if you buy it separately the Meta Quest 3 128GB model is still a solid deal. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Just make sure you make a decision quickly, as it’s not clear how quickly Meta and third-party retailers will run out of stock.

Title: Ozempic is bridging the political divide

The health benefits of blockbuster weight loss drugs are bridging the stark political divide in the United States. Progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont said on Tuesday, in a Senate committee hearing on high anti-obesity drug prices, that he agreed with Elon Musk, a supporter of Former President Donald Trump, when it comes to expanding access to GLP-1 weight loss drugs. These treatments, which mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar, have shown remarkable effectiveness in treating obesity and type 2 diabetes. The most popular GLP-1 drugs on the market are Ozempic (NVO) and Wegovy, both of which are produced by Danish pharma giant Novo Nordisk. “Solving obesity greatly reduces risk of other diseases, especially diabetes, and improves quality of life. We do need to find a way to make appetite inhibitors available to anyone who wants them,” Musk posted last week on X (TSLA), the social media platform he owns. The post was made in response to a post about Sen. Sanders claiming that generic drug companies have said they can sell cheaper versions of these medications for less than $100 a month. In the U.S., the list price — a drug’s price without health insurance — for Ozempic is $968.52 for a month’s supply. The list price of Wegovy in the U.S. is $1,349.02. The cost of these popular medications is already much cheaper in other countries. For example, Ozempic is just $59 in Germany and Wegovy is only $92 in the U.K. “I don’t agree with Bernie about many things, but I do on this,” Musk wrote. Sen. Sanders grilled Novo Nordisk CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen Tuesday morning during a hearing of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), regarding what the company charges for its blockbuster drugs in the U.S. Sen. Sanders said that Novo Nordisk has made $50 billion in sales from Ozempic and Wegovy since 2018 — with 72% of that revenue coming from U.S. sales, Sen. Sanders said at Tuesday’s hearing. “In other words, the United States is Novo Nordisk’s cash cow for Ozempic and Wegovy,” Sen. Sanders said. At one point, Sen. Sanders quoted Musk’s tweet and said that “Mr. Musk is right.” Later that day, Musk posted on X that he really is “with Bernie on this one.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: A weight loss drug maker is aiming for a big IPO

Time Published: 2024-09-25T15:27:36Z
Full Content:
BioAge Labs, a biopharmaceutical startup focused on obesity drugs, is looking to raise nearly $200 million in its recently expanded, planned initial public offering, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Richmond, California-based company said on Wednesday that it plans to offer 10.5 million shares between $17 and $19 each. BioAge previously planned to only offer 7.5 million shares at the same price range. The updated SEC filing comes amid a surge of investor interest in a new class of weight loss medications known as GLP-1s. These drugs, which mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar, have shown remarkable effectiveness in treating obesity and type 2 diabetes. Market leaders Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY), the pharmaceutical giants behind popular GLP-1 drugs Wegovy and Zepbound, have seen their stock prices soar as a result. Over the past 12 months, Novo Nordisk’s stock has climbed 39%, while Eli Lilly’s has surged 68%. These gains reflect investors’ bullish outlook on the future of the obesity drug market. Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts anticipate the global market for GLP-1 drugs will reach $105 billion by 2030. BioAge is now trying to get in on the action. In its filing, the company said it is targeting obesity and diabetes drugs due to their “high prevalence and resulting potential for impact on population health” and “outsized commercial opportunities.” BioAge’s leading drug candidate is azelaprag, a pill that mimics apelin, a peptide released during exercise that decreases with age. Early clinical trial results suggest that taking azelaprag along with an injectable weight loss drug results in increased weight loss and prevents muscle mass loss, a side-effect of current weight loss drugs. BioAge started a phase 2 clinical trial this year of azelaprag in combination with tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Eli Lilly’s Zepbound. The company plans to start a second phase 2 trial of the drug next year to see how it works with semaglutide, the drug behind Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy and Ozempic. BioAge’s upcoming IPO comes just months after it raised $170 million in financing this past February. BioAge isn’t the only company working to disrupt the weight loss drug duopoly dominated by Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly. Surging demand for weight loss medications has transformed the two pharmaceutical developers into some of the world’s most valuable companies — potentially paving the way for the first $1 trillion pharma firms. Now several drug makers are racing to develop their own weight loss competitors. Viking Therapeutics is developing both a weight loss injection and a pill while large pharma companies like Roche and Pfizer are also working on their own anti-obesity drugs.

Title: Why moves by Amazon and comments by Jamie Dimon don’t threaten an end to remote work benefits | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: If your employer lets you work remotely one or more days a week, and you highly value that kind of flexibility, you probably didn’t love hearing last week that Amazon will soon require its corporate employees to return to the office five days a week. Or that Dell in a memo asked its global sales team employees who are able to work from a company office to do so five days a week, up from three previously, and noting that “working remotely should be the exception rather than the routine.” Or when AT&T last year announced it was consolidating offices and requiring managers to work on site at least three days a week — which meant some managers who lived near an office that was closing had to relocate or quit. Or even when JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, most of whose employees are already working in the office five days, publicly expressed displeasure last week that more government employees weren’t working on site in federal buildings, which he described as “empty,” according to various news reports. Whenever big players publicly change direction and require employees to be in the office full time, the worry is that other employers will follow suit. But for two key reasons, these kinds of public proclamations don’t signal a broader demise of remote work benefits. In the case of Amazon, CEO Andy Jassy’s memo announcing his new RTO mandate said all the usual things about wanting to strengthen in-person collaboration and company culture. But, importantly, Jassy also highlighted his desire to reduce the glut of managers hired in recent years, which had created more “layers,” including “a longer line of managers feeling like they need to review a topic before it moves forward,” he said. To thin the managerial herd, Jassy called on senior leaders in the company “to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of Q1 2025.” Related article How can you prevent being laid off? You can’t. Here’s why Normally, that might involve manager layoffs. But Amazon said Wednesday that assertion is inaccurate. The effort to increase the ratio of individuals to managers is “not the same as eliminating roles and would not necessarily involve layoffs,” the company told CNN, noting that it has “no plans to reduce overall headcount as part of this decision.” But by imposing an unpopular mandate to be in the office five days a week, “middle managers who have been made wealthy enough will say ‘I’m leaving,’” said Chris Williams, a former vice president of human resources at Microsoft who is now a leadership consultant to C-suite executives. That saves a company the expense of having to provide severance packages, because people will leave voluntarily. Jassy’s risk is that too many managers could quit. “He will solve his near-term problem. But he will have a hard time convincing new hires to commute to downtown Seattle five days a week. So he may have a going-forward recruiting problem,” Williams said. If so, that may require Amazon to eventually — and quietly — back off enforcing the new five-days-a-week mandate to attract talent, he suggested. While an individual company may decide to backtrack on its remote work policies, the numbers suggest that’s not happening widely. Workplace consulting firm Gallup found in May that among full-time employees in remote-capable jobs, 53% work a hybrid schedule, 27% work exclusively remotely and 21% work on site. Those are roughly the same percentages reported in November 2022. As of August 31, job postings on Indeed.com that specify hybrid and remote work have dipped a half percentage point year over year. But that’s primarily because industries that typically have the most remote-capable jobs (e.g., software development) have been hiring less of late, according to Nick Bunker, Indeed’s North American economic research director. Related article Deciding what to do when your employer changes the rules on remote work A Conference Board survey of US workers, meanwhile, found that workplace flexibility is the most important element of total compensation beyond a competitive salary. It also found that HR leaders say hybrid work models help attract and retain talent. So it’s not surprising that Gallup also found that 64% of those working fully remote and 29% who work hybrid said they would be “extremely likely” to look for another job “if your employer decides not to offer opportunities for you to work remote some or all of the time long term.” Many CEOs seem to have gotten the memo. The Conference Board in January reported that just 4% of US CEOs said they planned to prioritize bringing people back to the office full time. Williams noted: “I have yet to talk to any enlightened CEO who honestly believes the only way to make a good [workplace] culture is face-to-face.” Reuters contributed reporting to this article.

September 25, 2024 10:15 ET | Source: FN Media Group LLC FN Media Group LLC PALM BEACH, Fla., Sept. 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FN Media Group News Commentary - Gold prices are forecast to climb to record highs in the coming year. The price of gold has soared to new heights this year and is positioned to climb into early 2025, rising to new record highs, according to Goldman Sachs Research. The precious metal has increased more than 20% this year, peaking at a record of more than $2,500 per troy ounce. Goldman Sachs Research forecasts the price will reach $2,700 by early next year, buoyed by interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and gold purchases by emerging market central banks. The metal could get an additional boost if the US imposes new financial sanctions or if concerns mount about the US debt burden. They see that Gold prices are forecast to climb to record high. Goldman Sachs says that: “Gold is our strategists’ preferred near-term long (the commodity they most expect to go up in the short term), and it’s also their preferred hedge against geopolitical and financial risks. In this softer cyclical environment, gold stands out as the commodity where we have the highest confidence in near-term upside,” Goldman Sachs Research strategists Samantha Dart and Lina Thomas write. Active Mining Companies in the markets today include Asia Broadband Inc. (OTCPK: AABB), Equinox Gold Corp. (NYSE American: EQX), Kinross Gold Corporation (NYSE: KGC), Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE: GOLD), IAMGOLD Corporation (NYSE: IAG). In an additional article, Goldman Sachs added: “The yellow metal typically only guards against very high inflation and large inflation surprises caused by losses in central bank credibility and geopolitical supply shocks. Gold usually didn’t perform well in response to positive demand shocks when the central bank responded swiftly by hiking rates. Gold emerged as the best commodity to serve as a potential hedge against inflation and geo-political risks. Goldman Sachs Research’s base case is that gold appreciates to $2,700/troy ounce by year-end, an increase of about 16%, on solid demand from central banks in emerging markets and from Asian households. Gold could help shield against potential stock market drops if a trade war erupts, and it has upside if concerns mount about the US debt load or if the Fed is subordinated by a new administration.” Asia Broadband Inc. (OTCPK: AABB) Gold Production Continues Upward Trend For Third Quarter, As Ore Stockpile Processing Plant Advances Towards Completion - Asia Broadband Inc. (“AABB” or the “Company) is pleased to announce that the Company’s operations for the 3rd quarter ending September 30, 2024, will be completed next week and production levels have already surpassed the second quarter. The Company has exceeded its production and gross profit levels achieved in both the 1st and 2nd consecutive record quarters this year. Gold production more than doubled in the 1st quarter of 2024, in comparison to the 4th quarter of 2023, due to higher grade selection, recovery efficiencies and increased daily throughput levels. Additionally, the economies of scale from higher productions levels reduced production costs and added to the bottom-line gross profit, which has continued in an upward trend over the last three quarters. The elevated operational strategies and efficiencies of the AABB mining team continued in the 3rd quarter and has firmly established the foundation for the high production levels to follow the completion of the Company’s processing plant. The new facility is currently under construction in Etzatlan, Mexico, and its capacity will be primarily dedicated to processing the estimated $1 billion dollar ore value of the Company’s exclusive rights surface stockpile. AABB continues to develop the processing plant and will release updates as progress milestones are reached. The Company will release a processing plant project update in October. “The elevation of our production processes by the mining operations team in all three quarters of this year will have a multiplier effect with increased production levels. We are eagerly awaiting to extend this expertise to our massive ore stockpile processing when the new plant is complete. This will take us to a much higher level than we have ever reached before,” expressed Chris Torres, the Company President and CEO. AABB continues to implement its mining property acquisition strategy to optimize development capital utilization by focusing operations in regions of Mexico where AABB has a comparative advantage of development resources and expertise readily available for rapid expansion and duplication of the Company’s previous gold production success.

Speaking at the Gold Forum Americas, Bristow said while Barrick was alert to potentially value-accretive opportunities generated by the consolidation of the industry, it had the rare luxury of doing so from an asset base that would support organic growth well into the future. “Five years ago, we set out to build a sustainably profitable gold and copper business focused on world-class assets. We did not have to buy them at a premium: they were embedded in the merged portfolio of Barrick and Randgold and we just had to unlock their value,” he said. Kinross Gold Corporation (NYSE: KGC) recently provided an update on the Great Bear project (the “Project”), located in Red Lake, Ontario, Canada. Kinross has completed a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) for the Great Bear project which supports the Company’s acquisition thesis of a top tier high-margin operation in a stable jurisdiction with strong infrastructure. Based on mineral resources drilled to date, the PEA outlines a high-grade combined open pit and underground mine with an initial planned mine life of approximately 12 years and production cost of sales of $594 per ounce. The Project is expected to produce over 500,000 ounces per year at an all-in sustaining cost (AISC) of approximately $800 per ounce during the first 8 years through a conventional, modest capital 10,000 tonne per day (tpd) mill. Kinross has also released an updated mineral resource estimate increasing the inferred resource estimate by 568koz. to 3.884 Moz. which is in addition to the existing M&I resource estimate of 2.738 Moz. The mineral resource estimate and PEA for the Great Bear project are available here. Equinox Gold Corp. (NYSE American: EQX) recently announced an updated Mineral Resource Estimate ("MRE") for its 100% owned, exploration-stage Hasaga Property ("Hasaga" or the "Property") in Red Lake, Ontario. "Hasaga is located in the Red Lake Gold District of northwestern Ontario, which is renowned for its high gold grades and prolific historical gold production. This updated Mineral Resource Estimate focuses on the high-grade nature of the gold mineralization and is a departure from the previous bulk-tonnage approach," stated Scott Heffernan, EVP Exploration of Equinox Gold. "As expected, the updated Mineral Resource Estimate contains fewer gold ounces but at significantly higher average gold grades. "Further, the main zones of gold mineralization included in the updated Mineral Resource Estimate remain open, with numerous historical gold intersections defining drill-ready targets highlighting the potential for resource growth and new discoveries." IAMGOLD Corporation (NYSE: IAG) recently announced that the Côté Gold Mine ("Côté Gold" or "Côté") has reached commercial production. Côté Gold is located in Ontario, Canada and is operated as a joint venture between IAMGOLD, as the operator, and Sumitomo Metal Mining Co., Ltd. ("Sumitomo"). Commercial production is defined as the achievement of reaching a minimum of 30 consecutive days of operations during which the mill operated at an average of 60% of nameplate throughput of 36,000 tpd. "I would like to commend our teams at Côté Gold who have come together to achieve another great milestone as we progress and ramp up what we believe will be one of Canada's largest gold mines and a model for modern mining in Canada," said Renaud Adams, President and Chief Executive Officer of IAMGOLD. "Since achieving the first pour of gold on March 31, 2024, our teams have spent the last four months methodically and iteratively testing and ramping up all facets of the mine. This process has required remarkable commitment, ingenuity and teamwork to bring all the systems online together to achieve this milestone."

Title: On human nanoscale synaptome: Morphology modeling and storage estimation
URL: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310156
Time Published: 2024-09-25T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
One of the key challenges in neuroscience is to generate the human nanoscale connectome which requires comprehensive knowledge of synaptome forming the neural microcircuits. The synaptic architecture determines limits of individual mental capacity and provides the framework for understanding neurologic disorders. Here, I address morphology modeling and storage estimation for the human synaptome at the nanoscale. A synapse is defined as a pair of pairs [(presynaptic_neuron),(presynaptic_axonal_terminal);(postsynaptic_neuron),(postsynaptic_dendritic_terminal)]. Center coordinates, radius, and identifier characterize a dendritic or axonal terminal. A synapse comprises topology with the paired neuron and terminal identifiers, location with terminal coordinates, and geometry with terminal radii. The storage required for the synaptome depends on the number of synapses and storage necessary for a single synapse determined by a synaptic model. I introduce three synaptic models: topologic with topology, point with topology and location, and geometric with topology, location, and geometry. To accommodate for a wide range of variations in the numbers of neurons and synapses reported in the literature, four cases of neurons (30;86;100;138 billion) and three cases of synapses per neuron (1,000;10,000;30,000) are considered with three full and simplified (to reduce storage) synaptic models resulting in total 72 cases of storage estimation. The full(simplified) synaptic model of the entire human brain requires from 0.21(0.14) petabytes (PB) to 28.98(18.63) PB for the topologic model, from 0.57(0.32) PB to 78.66(43.47) PB for the point model, and from 0.69(0.38) PB to 95.22(51.75) PB for the geometric model. The full(simplified) synaptic model of the cortex needs from 86.80(55.80) TB to 2.60(1.67) PB for the topologic model, from 235.60(130.02) TB to 7.07(3.91) PB for the point model, and from 285.20(155.00) TB to 8.56(4.65) PB for the geometric model. The topologic model is sufficient to compute the connectome’s topology, but it is still too big to be stored on today’s top supercomputers related to neuroscience. Frontier, the world’s most powerful supercomputer for 86 billion neurons can handle the nanoscale synaptome in the range of 1,000–10,000 synapses per neuron. To my best knowledge, this is the first big data work attempting to provide storage estimation for the human nanoscale synaptome.

Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. The human brain is an enormously complex, multi-scale, and multi-level structure operating in space and time as well as generating molecular, cellular, and neuronal phenomena [1]. Understanding its structure, function, and dysfunction is a huge scientific challenge, a critical social need, and a great market opportunity. While attempting to solve emerging problems, neuroscience progresses tremendously producing big data [2] whose processing requires high-performance computing [3]. The challenges emerge in the acquisition, processing, modeling, interpretation, storage, and use of neurodata; here we address modeling and storage. The knowledge of connectome is essential for understanding how neural microcircuits encode information and how the brain works in health and disease [4]. The full nanoscale connectomes have only been completed for nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C.elegans) [5], larva Ciona intestinalis [6], and Drosophila [7]. These animals have very small brains; namely, Ciona intestinalis 177 neurons and about 6,600 connections, C.elegans 302 neurons (a constant number) and about 7,000 connections, and Drosophila about 100–130 thousand neurons and millions of connections. The human connectome has been developed at the macroscale by providing anatomical and functional connectivity [8]. The full human nanoscale connectome, however, has not yet been created. The most critical obstacles in obtaining it are the prohibitively long overall time necessary to acquire data and the computing resources required for storing and processing these big data [2,3,9]. For instance, to image the whole human brain would require an estimated 17 million years [9] by applying the same brain imaging protocol as was employed for Drosophila [7]. In addition, it is assessed that the complete reconstruction of 1 mm3 of the cortex would require 10,000 man-years [10] and cost above $100 million [4]. Owing to the progress in imaging, the acquisition time constantly decreases. In particular, synchrotron X-ray tomography [11] is a promising imaging modality able to decrease the whole human brain acquisition time at the sub-cellular level to a few years [12] or even less. At present, for instance, by employing phase-contrast synchrotron tomography, whole brain imaging was performed in about 16 hours at a 25 μm spatial resolution with 16-bit voxels [13]. This level of spatial resolution enables imaging the neuronal cell bodies, however, it still is insufficient to reveal the complete neurons with their dendrites and axons as well as the synapses that functionally connect neurons. The creation of the nanoscale human connectome requires the segmentation of all neurons and the reconstruction of all neuronal microcircuits forming it, each microcircuit considered a sequence of synapses, so consequently comprehensive knowledge of synaptome, i.e., the complete set of all synapses in the brain. The synaptic architecture determines the limits of individual mental capacity and provides the framework for understanding neurologic disorders [14]. The goal of this work is to 1) formulate three (topology-, location-, and geometry-related) morphological models of the human synaptome at the nanoscale along with their simplified versions to reduce storage and 2) estimate storage requirements for these models. To accommodate for a wide range of variations in the numbers of neurons and synapses reported in the literature, four cases of the total number of neurons in the brain (30;86;100; and 138 billion) and three cases of the number of synapses per neuron (1,000;10,000; and 30,000) are considered with three full and the corresponding simplified synaptic models resulting in total 72 cases of storage estimation. To my best knowledge, this is the first big data work providing the storage requirement estimation for the human nanoscale synaptome. The storage required for the synaptome can be calculated as (1) The number of synapses can be approximated by half of the product of the average number of neurons by the average number of synapses per neuron (a pair of the connected neurons form a synapse by the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons, so to avoid duplication in synapse counting half of the product shall be taken) The average number of neurons in the human brain and the average number of synapses per neuron can be obtained from abundant literature studies whereas the storage required for a single synapse is determined from the synaptic morphology model considered below. The exact numbers of neurons and synapses in the human brain are challenging to precisely determine due to the brain’s complexity and variability and a brief, nearly 150-year, history of cell counting in human brains along with types of counting methods are presented by von Barthel [15]. Because of large biological variability among individual human brains and different brain regions as well as diverse cell counting methods employed, the number of neurons in the human brain and its parts reported in various studies highly ranges. For instance, in an average brain, a normal biological variation in the number of neocortical neurons occurs by a factor more than two [15]. Many textbooks, original articles, and reviews have affirmed that the total number of neurons in the human brain is one hundred billion [16–24]. This affirmation is also present in the textbook by Kandel et al. [18] which is a commonly used textbook in neuroscience (and even praised as the “bible of neuroscience” [15]) authored by a Nobel Prize laureate in physiology or medicine 2000. This textbook knowledge has been challenged by more robust methods for neuron number counting providing an estimate of 86.1 billion neurons [25]. In some other sources, the number of neurons in the entire human brain was estimated at 30 billion [26], 70–80 billion [27], 85 billion [28], 67–86 billion [29], and 75–125 billion [30]. The number of neurons in the cerebral cortex reported in various studies ranges from 2.6 billion [31] to 32 billion [32]. A majority of studies estimate this number between 10–20 billion neurons including 14 billion [33],10–19 billion [34], 18.8 billion [35], 12.4 billion [25], and 12.7 billion [29]. In the cerebellar cortex Haug estimated about 50 billion neurons [27] and Williams and Herrup 65–70 billion neurons [28], whereas Andersen et al. estimated 102 billion neurons in the human cerebellum (105 billion cells including 3 billion glial cells) [36]. Several studies imply that the range of 50–70 billion cerebellar neurons is the most credible, including 54 billion [29] and 69 billion [25]. The number of neurons together in the brainstem, striatum, and diencephalon is approximately 700 million [25]. The above studies are summarized in Table 1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310156.t001 Many studies revealed that synapses are complex and diverse [37]. Moreover, their number can vary between individuals and change in response to learning and experience. Therefore, any estimates of their number should also be taken as an approximation. The number of synapses per neuron is also highly variable. Kandel et al. estimate that there are around 1014 (100 trillion) synapses in the average adult human brain [18] (meaning 1,000 synapses per neuron). Ref. [38] reports that the total number of synapses in the human neocortex is approximately 0.15×1015 (0.15 quadrillion). According to a reference book [39], the average neuron has 1,000 synapses with other neurons. Ten thousand connections per neuron are reported in [23]. Some sources estimate that a single neuron can have between 1,000–15,000 synaptic connections [24,40]. Defelipe demonstrated that the number of synapses per neuron is also cortical layer-dependent and the study of the synaptic profiles within cubes of cortical tissue of 50 μm wide by 50 μm thick revealed that for 158 neurons and 4,483,400 synapses examined in 6 cortical layers, the average number of synapses per neuron was 29,642 (100,042 in layer I (for 5 neurons only), 17,046 in layer II, 37,066 in layer IIIa, 56,521 in layer IIIb, 15,989 in layer IV, 29,965 in layer V, and 28,224 in layer VI) [41]. Hence, for the storage estimation, we take 3 values, 1,000, 10,000, and 30,000 synapses per neuron. To describe neuronal morphology at the nanoscale a dedicated nano neuronal format nN has been introduced [42] and accommodated here to model the synaptome. Let us assume that the whole brain has been imaged and all its neurons are already processed, and their synaptic axonal and dendritic terminals (also termed elements or membranes) are extracted and located in some Cartesian coordinate system. Let the terminal morphology be characterized by the coordinates of its center, radius, and identifier. Hence, the morphology of a dendritic terminal is described as follows Dendritic terminal identifier (D) Dendritic terminal coordinates (x,y,z) Dendritic terminal radius (r) The morphology of an axonal terminal is described in the following way Axonal terminal identifier (A) Axonal terminal coordinates (x,y,z) Axonal terminal radius (r) Consider two neurons forming a synapse meaning the following pair of pairs [(presynaptic neuron),(presynaptic axonal terminal);(postsynaptic neuron),(postsynaptic dendritic terminal)]. Let i and j be a presynaptic neuron and the postsynaptic neuron with identifiers Ni and Nj, and m and n the axonal terminal Aim and the dendritic terminal Djn of neurons i and j, respectively. Then, the synapse between the neurons i and j is defined as a pair of quadruples [Ni,Aim,(xim,yim,zim),rim;Nj,Djn,(xjn,yjn,zjn),rjn]. A synapse has three components, topology (the neuron and terminal identifiers), location (the coordinates of the terminal centers), and geometry (the terminal radii by approximating the fundi of the terminals with the circular shape), Fig 1. The complete synaptome is defined as a set of all the synapses {[Ni,Aim,(xim,yim,zim),rim;Nj,Djn,(xjn,yjn,zjn),rjn]} for all the presynaptic and the corresponding postsynaptic neurons. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310156.g001 I consider three synaptic morphology models with diverse content and potential applications, namely, (1) the topologic model with topology, (2) the point model with topology and location, and (3) the geometric model with topology, location, and geometry. The topologic model encapsulates the topology of all presynaptic neurons along with the topology of the corresponding postsynaptic neurons, i.e., {(presynaptic topology);(postsynaptic topology)}. The point model characterizes the topology and location of all presynaptic neurons and the corresponding postsynaptic neurons, i.e., {(presynaptic topology and location);(postsynaptic topology and location)}. The geometric model describes the topology, location, and geometry of all presynaptic neurons and the corresponding postsynaptic neurons, i.e., {(presynaptic topology, location, and geometry);(postsynaptic topology, location, and geometry)}. For the four considered cases of the number of neurons i.e. 30, 86, 100, and 138 billion, we get {3 1010, 86 1010, 1011, 1.38 1011} = {234.80, 236.32, 236.54, 237.01}. Hence, to store the neuron’s unique identifier out of other 30, 86, 100, or 138 billion neurons, 5 bytes (B) are needed in any of these four cases. For the three considered cases of the number of synapses per neuron, i.e., 1,000, 10,000, 30,000, we get {103, 104, 3 104} = {29.97, 213.29, 214.87}. Hence, for a given neuron to store its terminal’s unique identifier out of other 1,000, 10,000, or 30,000 terminals, 2 B are required in any of these three cases. The terminal coordinates are voxel resolution and synapse type dependent. There are two types of synapses, chemical with the synaptic gap (cleft) of 20-30/20-40 nm [43,44] and electrical with the 2–4 nm gap [43]. To distinguish the synapses, the acquisition data shall be sampled sufficiently dense and according to the Nyquist sampling theorem, the spatial sampling resolution shall be no lower than 10 nm to handle chemical synapses and 1 nm for the electrical synapses. To distinguish values at the levels of 10 nm and 1 nm spatial resolutions, the required ranges of values shall be 108 (226.6) for the 10 nm resolution and 109 (229.9) for the 1 nm resolution. Hence, 4 B are needed to store a terminal single coordinate value for each of the 10 nm and 1 nm voxel resolutions. To store a terminal location with 3 coordinates,12 B of storage are required. To store a terminal radius, 1 number meaning 4 B are needed. Hence, a single synapse storage determined by the synaptic model as a pair of (neuron, terminal) pairs requires (3) These values, because of an enormous number of synapses, will result in huge storage requirements so three simplifications are proposed to the synaptic model. First, in the full synaptic model for a given presynaptic neuron with identifier Ni its all presynaptic terminals Tim (each including the identifier, coordinates, and radius) are represented as a sequence of {[Ni,Ti1] … [Ni,Tim] … [Ni,TiM]}, where iM is the number of presynaptic terminals in neuron Ni. Since the neuron identifier is the same for all its presynaptic terminals, this sequence can be expressed as (Ni,{Tim}), m = 1 … iM. The number of presynaptic terminals is estimated as follows. Every presynaptic terminal (the presynaptic neuron’s output) has its corresponding postsynaptic terminal (the postsynaptic neuron’s input) so, consequently, the number of all neuronal inputs equals the number of all neuronal outputs. Therefore, on average we can assume that in an average neuron, half of its terminals are presynaptic and the other half postsynaptic. As the storage required for the presynaptic neuron’s terminals is for the considered cases at least three orders higher than that for the presynaptic neuron’s identifier, so the latter can be neglected. Second, the two sets of coordinates for the corresponding presynaptic and postsynaptic terminals can be approximated by a single set of coordinates with their mean value. Similarly, the presynaptic and postsynaptic terminal radii can be approximated by their mean value. Hence, the single synapse storage requirements for the simplified synapse model are the following (4) To estimate the storage required for the human synaptome Eq 2 is employed, where the single synapse storage for the full version of the synaptic model is determined by relationship (3) and for the simplified version of the synaptic model by relationship (4), the numbers of neurons in the average adult human brain and its parts are given in Table 1, and the numbers of synapses per neuron are provided in Section 2.3. To accommodate for a wide range of variations in the numbers of neurons and synapses reported in numerous sources, four cases of neurons and three cases of synapses per neuron are considered. Additionally, taking into account three synaptic models with full and simplified versions, in total 72 cases providing the storage required for the synaptome are estimated. For 100 billion neurons each on average with 10 thousand synapses 0.5 x 14 x 1011 x 104 = 7 x 1015 = 7 petabyte (PB) storage is required for the full topologic model. The full point and geometric models need 19 PB and 23 PB, respectively. The simplified models require 4.5 PB, 10.5 PB, and 12.5 PB for the topologic, point, and geometric models, respectively. For 86 billion neurons each on average with 10 thousand synapses these storage requirements reduce to 6.02 (3.87) PB, 16.34 (9.03) PB, and 19.78 (10.75) PB for the full (simplified) topologic, point, and geometric models, respectively. For 86 billion neurons each on average with one thousand synapses the storage requirements are 0.6 (0.39) PB, 1.63 (0.9.) PB, and 1.98 (1.08) PB for the full (simplified) topologic, point, and geometric models, respectively. The storage requirements for all 72 cases are given in Table 2. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310156.t002 Similarly, by applying relationships (2)-(4) and Table 1, storage requirements for different parts of the brain can be estimated. Then, Table 3 provides the storage required for the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and brainstem/striatum/diencephalon for the case of 86 billion neurons in the entire brain (for consistency all the numbers are from the same source [25]) estimated for the full and simplified topologic, point, and geometric synaptic models. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310156.t003 The same approach can, in general, be employed to estimate the data required for small brains, however, Eqs (3)–(4) are not directly applicable because the size of the synapse identifier is neuron and synapse number dependent. Let us estimate storage requirements for C.elegans [5]. To distinguish 7 x 103 = 212.77 synapses, 2B are required for the synapse identifier (with no need to apply the neuron identifier). Then, the single synapse storage needs 4 (2x2) B for the topologic model, 28 (2x2 + 2x3x4) B for the point model, and 36 (2x2 + 2x3x4+ 2x4) B for the geometric model. Hence, the full synaptic model of C.elegans with about 7,000 synapses requires around 28 KB for the topologic model, 196 KB for the point model, and 252 KB for the geometric model. For the simplified synaptic model, the single synapse storage needs 2 (1x2) B for the topologic model, 14 (1x2 + 1x3x4) B for the point model, and 18 (1x2 + 1x3x4+ 1x4) B for the geometric model. Therefore, the simplified synaptic model requires about 14 KB for the topologic model, 98 KB for the point model, and 126 KB for the geometric model. Let us estimate storage requirements for Drosophila. Scheffer et al. report that Drosophila has about 100,000 neurons and that the central hemibrain consists of approximately 25,000 neurons and around 20 million chemical synapses [45]. To estimate the storage required for Drosophila I use the information about the data size of the FlyWire dataset which is an electron microscopy reconstruction of the complete brain of an adult female Drosophila with about 130 thousand neurons and 32 million synapses representing the complete Drosophila brain [46–49]. Therefore, to distinguish 32 x 106 = 224.93 synapses, 4B are required for the synapse identifier. Then, the single synapse storage needs 8 (2x4) B for the topologic model, 32 (2x4 + 2x3x4) B for the point model, and 40 (2x4 + 2x3x4+ 2x4) B for the geometric model. Hence, the full synaptic model of Drosophila with 32 million synapses requires 256 MB for the topologic model, 1,024 MB for the point model, and 1,280 MB for the geometric model. For the simplified synaptic model, the single synapse storage needs 4 (1x4) B for the topologic model, 16 (1x4 + 1x3x4) B for the point model, and 20 (1x4 + 1x3x4+ 1x4) B for the geometric model. Therefore, the simplified synaptic model requires 128 MB for the topologic model, 512 MB for the point model, and 640 MB for the geometric model. The comparison of storage required for C.elegans, Drosophila, and human (for the case of 86 billion neurons in the entire brain and 1,000 synapses per neuron) estimated for the full and simplified topologic, point, and geometric synaptic models is presented in Table 4. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310156.t004 To evaluate the proposed method, the first large, nanoscale human brain tissue sample of a 1 mm3 [50] is employed here since a volumetric image dataset of the entire human brain at the nanoscale has not yet been acquired. The sample was surgically acquired from the temporal lobe of the cerebral cortex, stained, embedded in resin, cut into ~30 nm thick sections, and scanned using electron microscopy. The resulting volume comprises 50,000 cells, hundreds of millions of neurites, and 150 million synapses. In [51] this volume was additionally annotated such that each neuron object had 19 attributes and each synapse object had seven attributes (synapse ID, synapse type, presynaptic site considered as an object, postsynaptic partner considered as an object, location, bounding box, and layer). To store the annotated properties of the synapses along with those of the neurons and layers, nearly 27 GB of storage was required. In our synaptic model, a synapse is characterized by identifier, location, and size whereas in [51] a synapse is annotated with seven attributes, so to enable a fairer comparison the geometric model is extended with 14 additional numbers, 12 for the four coordinates of a rectangular bounding box and one for each of synapse type and layer. Hence, the extended geometric model requires 46 + 14 x 4 = 102 B. This storage still may be underestimation, as here I consider the presynaptic and postsynaptic sites to be represented by indexes whereas in [51] they are represented as objects. The extended geometric model for 150 million synapses requires 102 x 150 x 106 = 15,300 x 106 = 15.3 GB. Taking into account that this extended geometric model is likely underestimation and that nearly 27 GB cited in [51] is needed not only for the synapses but also for the annotated cells and hundreds of millions of neurites, these two amounts of storage are roughly comparable. One of the fundamental challenges in neuroscience is to generate the human nanoscale connectome. The key groups of challenges are data acquisition and computing. The acquisition produces big data and requires an enormous amount of time as already mentioned in the introduction. For very small brains, such as for the Drosophila brain, the acquired dataset can cover the entire adult brain, while in mammals the largest datasets include only a tiny fraction of a brain. For instance, a complete adult Drosophila brain was imaged with electron microscopy resulting in 7,050 40 nm thin sections forming a dataset of about 106 TB [46]. Regarding mammals, a tissue sample of the mouse lateral geniculate body having 67 million cubic microns of 400 x 600 x 280 resolution with about 100 trillion voxels yielded a dataset of about 100 TB [52]. A sample of 1 mm3 of mouse neocortex with 26,500 electron microscopy ultrathin sections with 4 nm/pixel resolution yielded a dataset of more than 2 petabytes [53]. Hence, a sample of 500 mm3 would have required a 1 exabyte storage. This dataset was continuously imaged across five microscopes for almost 6 months, each producing a daily throughput of 3.6 TB [53]. Not only acquisition but also validation is time consuming. To validate a hemibrain center of Drosophila assuming a rate of 1000 connections annotated per trained person, per day, would have taken more than 230 working years [45]. The first large nanoscale human brain tissue sample with 5,292 slices of 33 nm average thickness and 4 x4 nm2 pixels yielded a volume of approximately 2.1 PB [50]. The key computational challenges to achieve this goal are big data [2] and high-performance computing [3]. Although suitable data enabling the computation of the entire human connectome at the nanoscale have not been acquired yet, some of the computational challenges have already been addressed earlier [42,54,55]. I have previously formulated a dedicated nano neuronal data file format to describe neuron morphology at the nanoscale [42], estimated storage requirements to keep the volumetric and four geometric neuronal models (straight wireframe, enhanced wireframe, straight polygonal, and enhanced polygonal) [54], estimated high performance computing requirements for morphology modeling of the entire human brain at the nanoscale [55], and designed a nanoscale human brain atlas enabling the exploration of the brain model at the nanoscale [42]. As the connectome can be computed from the synaptome, toward the synaptome calculation I here present three morphologic models of the human nanoscale synaptome and quantitatively estimate the data bigness for storing them. These synaptome models are topologic, point, and geometric. Having the synaptome determined, any neuronal microcircuit is formed as a sequence of synapses whereas all the microcircuits, in turn, constitute the connectome. Any synaptic model introduced here enables the calculation of the connectome. The numbers of neurons and synapses in the human brain and its parts are highly variable and widely range in numerous studies reported; therefore, here I consider four cases of the total number of neurons in the entire brain including the minimum and maximum, and three cases of synapses per neuron in addition to the full and simplified versions of three synaptic models, topologic, point and geometric resulting in overall 72 cases. The storage required for the entire brain is estimated in the range from 30 billion neurons and 1 thousand synapses per neuron to 138 billion neurons and 30 thousand synapses per neuron. Then the full synaptic model of the entire human brain requires from 0.21 PB to 28.98 PB for the topologic model, from 0.57 PB to 78.66 PB for the point model, and from 0.69 PB to 95.22 PB for the geometric model, Table 2. For the simplified synaptic model, the topologic model requires from 0.14 PB to 18.63 PB, the point model from 0.32 PB to 43.47 PB, and the geometric model from 0.38 PB to 51.75 PB, Table 2. The simplified model reduces the required storage to 64%, 55%, and 54% for the topologic, point, and geometric models, respectively. Note that in all these cases the maximum storage required is 138 times higher than the minimum storage. This results from the fact that the minimum and maximum numbers of neurons are likely to be outliers and a more credible number is 86 billion neurons [25]. Similarly, the approximate number of 30 thousand synapses per neuron reported by Defelipe [41] was measured for a very small tissue sample, so the range of 1–10 thousand synapses per neuron is likely to be more credible. Then, the storage required is from 0.60 (0.39) PB to 6.02 (3.87) PB, from 1.63 (0.90) PB to 16.34 (9.03) PB, and from 1.98 (1.08) PB to 19.78 (10.75) PB for the full (simplified) topologic, point, and geometric models, respectively. Note that then the difference between the minimum and maximum storage is 10 times only. The reported number of neurons in different parts of the brain also varies in the literature from 2.6 to 32 billion (12.31 times) for the cerebral cortex and from 50 to 102 billion for the cerebellum (2.04 times), Table 1. Taking the numbers of neurons from the same source [25], the cerebral cortex contains 14%, the cerebellum 80%, and the brainstem/striatum/diencephalon 0.8% of the total number of neurons in the entire human brain. Then, the full synaptic model of the cerebral cortex requires from 86.80 TB to 2.60 PB for the topologic model, from 235.60 TB to 7.07 PB for the point model, and from 285.20 TB to 8.56 PB for the geometric model, Table 3. For the simplified synaptic model of the cerebral cortex, the topologic model needs from 55.80 TB to 1.67 PB, the point model from 130.02 TB to 3.91 PB, and the geometric model from 155.00 TB to 4.65 PB, Table 3. The full synaptic model of the cerebellum requires from 0.48 PB to 14.49 PB for the topologic model, from 1.31 PB to 39.33 PB for the point model, and from 1.59 PB to 47.61 PB for the geometric model, Table 3. For the simplified synaptic model of the cerebellum, the topologic model needs from 0.31 PB to 9.32 PB, the point model from 0.72 PB to 21.74 PB, and the geometric model from 0.86 PB to 35.86 PB, Table 3. The full synaptic model of the brainstem/striatum/diencephalon requires from 4.90 TB to 147.00 TB for the topologic model, from 13.30 TB to 399.00 TB for the point model, and from 16.10 TB to 483.00 TB for the geometric model, Table 3. For the simplified synaptic model of the brainstem/striatum/diencephalon, the topologic model needs from 3.15 TB to 94.50 TB, the point model from 7.35 TB to 220.50 TB, and the geometric model from 8.75 TB to 262.50 TB, Table 3. Note that the above synaptome storage estimations are valid for both the chemical and electrical synaptomes, as the single synapse storage covers the data sampling spatial resolutions of 10 nm and 1 nm. A volumetric image dataset of the entire human brain at the nanoscale enabling the computation of the synaptome and connectome has not yet been acquired. Consequently, any validation of the considered synaptic model with the actual human data is not yet feasible. What is available today is the first large, nanoscale human surgical tissue sample of a 1 mm3 [50] which is employed here to assess the proposed method. Then, our geometric model extended to partly compensate for the seven synaptic annotation attributes in [51] requires 15.3 GB to store this sample whereas [51] reports nearly 27 GB to store the synapses together with the annotated cells and hundreds of millions of neurites. Therefore, these two amounts of storage can be considered roughly comparable. Note that the synaptic representation in [51] requires to store layers as acquired in electron microscopy, however, there is no need to store layers in synchrotron tomography data. Moreover, this is not so straightforward to compare our estimated synaptome data bigness with the actually acquired datasets. The actually acquired datasets can include the raw images, segmentation data, annotations, reconstructions, and various representations like skeletons and connectivity graphs. In addition, the size of data can vary depending on the image resolution, extent of the imaged brain, data format, data simplification, and applied data compression. Note that even for Drosophila, synaptome completeness is beyond the current reach resulting in providing synapse counts that are representatives [45]. On the other hand, our model and storage estimates assume the completeness of the human synaptome. Regarding small animal brains, the localization part of the synapse representation in Drosophila proposed by Scheffer et al. [45] corresponds to our synaptic point model. Namely, the synapses there are stored as point annotations meaning one point for a presynaptic T-bar (corresponding on electron microscopy images to an active zone of the presynaptic terminal), and one point for each of its postsynaptic densities in the postsynaptic terminal (note that some more complex synaptic structures found, e.g., in the cerebellum may exhibit multiple active zones and the corresponding multiple postsynaptic densities). However, the identifiers of the neurons containing their connecting synapses are determined from segmentation which assigns 64-bit neuron identifier to each voxel, meaning requiring 8 B for neuron and 6 B for voxel identifier to distinguish 26 teravoxels. Our point synaptic model scaled to the Drosophila size (see the Results section) requires only 4 B for the synapse identifier meaning it is 10 B smaller per synapse than the synaptic data representation employed by Scheffer et al. [45]. The same method applied here to estimate the storage required for the human synaptome can, in principle, also be used to estimate synaptomes of other animals after the compensation for the synapse identifier dependency on the numbers of neuron and synapses. Namely, the synaptoms of Drosophila and C.elegans are “merely” at the level of megabytes and kilobytes, respectively (Table 4) in comparison to the human synaptome which requires storage at the level of petabytes. Even though the synaptic topologic model for the entire brain is much smaller than each of the synaptic point and geometric models, it is still too big to be stored on today’s top supercomputers related to neuroscience such as Sequoia of 1.5 PB and K of 1.4 PB of memory [2]. For the number of neurons in the range of 86–100 billion, only the case of 1,000 synapses per neuron can fit to this storage (and up to about 2,000 synapses per neuron) whereas the case of 10,000 synapses per neuron does not fit. Note that the simplified point and geometric models for the 1,000 synapses per neuron also fit this amount of storage. For the cerebral cortex with 12.4 billion neurons (Table 1) and in the range of 1,000–10,000 synapses per neuron, the full topologic and simplified point models fit the amount of memory provided by Sequoia or K. Today’s most powerful and world’s first exascale supercomputer Frontier [56] with 9,408 computing nodes each with 4 TB of flash memory offers an overall 37 PB memory. Frontier, for the synaptic model of the entire brain with 86 billion neurons and the 1,000–10,000 range of the number of synapses per neuron, is able to handle the human nanoscale synaptome, and for 30,000 synapses per neuron only the simplified topologic, point, and geometric models. Another exascale supercomputer Aurora with the aggregate system memory of 10.9 PB [57] for 86 billion neurons is able to handle only the simplified synaptic models up to 10,000 synapses per neurons. The storage of the above supercomputers serves as a benchmark for our results. In general, the storage limits of the today’s supercomputers can be overcome either by a network of powerful supercomputers enabling to scale computing resources, such as BRAINS [58], or cloud storage offered by open-source services, such as the Brain Observatory Storage Service and Database which is a cloud-based solution for storing and accessing petascale image datasets [59]. The topologic model is sufficient and the most efficient to compute the connectome or rather its topology. The synaptic point model allows for the construction of the connectomic point model with the locations of the synapses. The synaptic geometric model enables the construction of the connectomic geometric model with the locations and sizes of the synapses. Note that these connectomic models do not allow to construct the exact full path between the consecutive synapses in a microcircuit as in the synaptic model the parameters of the soma, axon, and dendritic and axonal trees (as formulated in [42]) are not available (meaning can be discarded after the calculation of the synaptome). The introduced synaptic models are useful for morphometric and network-related analyses. The topologic model allows for the determination of the number of microcircuits, loops, and feedbacks. The point model enables the calculation of synaptic densities and patterns of interconnectivity such as distributions of microcircuits with respect to length, underlying structures and tracts, and local and global networks (subsystems). In particular, this includes the distribution of microcircuits among the cerebrum, cerebellum, brainstem, and subcortical structures as well as their distribution among the cerebral and cerebellar cortical layers. Other network-related features also can be calculated including clusters (hubs), worldness, betweenness centrality, and motifs. The geometric model additionally enables the calculation of the distribution of the terminal sizes (provided that they, especially the postsynaptic terminals, are feasible to be determined). Storage-wise this work is limited to the size of the already calculated synaptome. However, its calculation requires a much bigger storage to handle all the neurons along with their complete dendritic and axonal trees as estimated in [54]. In addition, synchrotron tomography requires also space for numerous projections from which the volumetric raw data are calculated. Depending on the spatial resolution, the volumetric raw data require from 2,800 exabytes (EB) for 10 nm resolution (to image chemical synapses) to 2,800,000 (EB) for 1 nm resolution (to image electrical synapses) [54]. By converting the volumetric raw data into a geometric model, the storage required, depending on the type of geometric model, ranges from 20.56 PB to 82.56 PB for 86 billion neurons and 10,000 synapses per neuron [54]. Model-wise this work is restricted to synaptome morphology although the synaptome size can be expected to be much higher at the molecular level. For instance, in [60] the mouse synaptome was considered at the molecular level by cataloging and mapping enormous synapse diversity. Namely, the postsynaptic proteome contains more than 1,000 proteins whereas as few as 10 proteins could produce 1,023 types and 1011 subtypes of excitatory synapses. Neurodegenerative processes cause death of neurons and synapse loss, degeneration of synapses, and the spread of pathology through the brain via synapses. Therefore, the study of synaptome is also vital from the standpoint of synaptopathy, meaning the disturbances in neuronal connectivity, which with the increasing awareness is one of the first pathological even in many neurologic disorders [40]. Studies of synapses in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [61–64], dementia with Lewy bodies [65], and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [66] demonstrated changes in synaptic density and morphology as well as molecular composition and the aggregation of disease-associated proteins in the synapse which may disrupt its structure and function. In AD, the loss of synapses also correlates with a cognitive decline [61,63]. Moreover, some evidence indicates that synaptopathy underlines a variety of psychiatric disorders [67]. The involvement of synaptic disturbances in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia was reviewed by Obi-Nagata et al. [24]. The schizophrenic patients were observed to have the reduced dendritic spine density [68–70]. Glanz et al. [68] reported that in schizophrenic subjects, spine density in the prefrontal cortex was decreased by 23% compared with normal control subjects. Garey et al. [69] demonstrated the 66% dendritic spine density decrease in frontal regions and 59% decrease in temporal regions in cortical layer III. Konopaske et al. [70] observed that the number of spines per dendrite was reduced by 21.6% for the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The decrease in spine number was only observed for smaller spines and not for larger spines [71] resulting in less plastic circuits (as large spines are generally highly stable and small spines are more plastic and related to learning and behavioral flexibility [72]). Therefore based on these studies, this is likely to expect the storage required for the synaptome of persons with neurologic disorders to be smaller than that needed for the normal subjects. It remains still unclear how generalizable are these findings across all cortical layers and the entire cerebral cortex. Nevertheless, assuming in average a 25% spine density decrease for the whole cerebral cortex and taking 86 billion neurons in the entire brain, the required storage for the diseased cerebral cortical synaptome would range from the minimum of 41.85 TB for the topologic simplified model with 1,000 synapses per neuron to the maximum of 6417 TB for the full geometric model with 30,000 synapses per neuron (compare with Table 3). Finally comparing the human genome and synaptome, the storage required for the human genome varies (depending on coverage) from 30 GB to 200 GB [73] and it seems today rather “small” in comparison to that required for the human nanoscale synaptome that is at the level of petabytes. However, to store hundreds of thousands of human genomes it is estimated that 2–40 EB of storage capacity will be needed by 2025 [73]. As a similar trend may be expected in neuroscience, this estimation gives some idea of how enormous storage will be required to store hundreds of thousands of human synaptomes and connectomes. A key challenge in neuroscience is to generate the human nanoscale connectome which requires knowledge of synaptome forming the neural microcircuits. The synaptic architecture determines the limits of individual mental capacity and provides the framework for understanding neurologic disorders. Toward this objective, I here address morphology modeling and storage estimation for the human synaptome at the nanoscale. The storage required for the human synaptome depends on the number of synapses and the storage necessary for a single synapse determined by a synaptic model. I here introduce three synaptic morphology models with diverse content and potential applications: topologic with topology, point with topology and location, and geometric with topology, location, and geometry. They are useful for morphometric and network-related analyses. The topologic model allows for the determination of the number of microcircuits, loops, and feedbacks. The point model enables the calculation of synaptic densities and patterns of interconnectivity. The geometric model additionally enables the calculation of the distribution of terminal sizes. The number of neurons in the human brain and its parts reported in various studies highly ranges because of large biological variability among individual brains and different cerebral regions as well as diverse cell counting methods employed. To accommodate for a wide range of variations in the number of neurons and synapses reported in numerous sources, four cases of the number of neurons in the brain (30; 86; 100; and 138 billion) and three cases of synapses per neuron (1,000; 10,000; and 30,000) are considered with three synaptic models with the full and simplified (to reduce storage) versions resulting in total 72 cases for which the storage required for the synaptome is estimated. The full(simplified) synaptic model of the entire human brain requires from 0.21(0.14) PB to 28.98(18.63) PB for the topologic model, from 0.57(0.32) PB to 78.66(43.47) PB for the point model, and from 0.69(0.38) PB to 95.22(51.75) PB for the geometric model. The full(simplified) synaptic model of the cerebral cortex needs from 86.80(55.80) TB to 2.60(1.67) PB for the topologic model, from 235.60(130.02) TB to 7.07(3.91) PB for the point model, and from 285.20(155.00) TB to 8.56(4.65) PB for the geometric model. The full synaptic model of the cerebellum requires from 0.48(0.31) PB to 14.49(9.32) PB for the topologic model, from 1.31(0.72) PB to 39.33(21.74) PB for the point model, and from 1.59(0.86) PB to 47.61(35.86) PB for the geometric model. The full (simplified) synaptic model of the brainstem/striatum/diencephalon requires from 4.90(3.15) TB to 147.00(94.50) TB for the topologic model, from 13.30(7.35) TB to 399.00(220.50) TB for the point model, and from 16.10(8.75) TB to 483.00(262.50) TB for the geometric model. The topologic model is sufficient and the most efficient to compute the connectome or rather its topology, however, even though it is much smaller than each of the synaptome point and geometric models, it is still too big to be stored on today’s top supercomputers related to neuroscience such as Sequoia of 1.5 PB and K of 1.4 PB of memory (and for the number of neurons in the range of 86–100 billion, only neurons with up to about 2,000 synapses can fit to this storage). The most powerful world’s supercomputer Frontier for the entire brain with 86 billion neurons and the 1,000–10,000 number of synapses per neuron is able to handle the human nanoscale synaptome, and for 30,000 synapses per neuron only the simplified topologic, point, and geometric models. The storage limits of today’s supercomputers can be overcome either by a network of powerful supercomputers enabling to scale computing resources or cloud storage offered by open-source services. The human synaptome requires storage at the level of petabytes whereas the synaptoms for Drosophila and C.elegans are “merely” at the level of megabytes and kilobytes, respectively. In the future, to store hundreds of thousands of human synaptomes and connectomes, storage at the level of exabytes or higher will be required. To my best knowledge, this is the first big data effort attempting to provide storage requirement estimation for the human nanoscale synaptome. This work has been inspired by the SYNAPSE (Synchrotron for Neuroscience–an Asia-Pacific Strategic Enterprise) efforts aiming to map the entire human brain at sub-cellular resolution demonstrating the neuronal network connections and my invited talk presented at the SYNAPSE 2022 general meeting. I would like to thank Prof. Ann-Shyn Chiang, the creator of the Drosophila connectome, for providing valuable insights regarding connectomic data size.

Good morning! I've been known to make a bet or two in my day, which is why I'm wondering the odds you could get betting you'd have four kids with the same birthday. In today's big story, the economy is heading in the right direction, but consumers aren't buying it. What's on deck: But first, the vibes are all off. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates, the stock market reached all-time highs, and the risk of a recession is gone. Things seem to be going really well for the economy, right? Wrong. Consumers aren't feeling bullish about the economy these days. In fact, they're quite pessimistic. US consumer confidence suffered its biggest drop in three years this month, according to data from the Conference Board. We've been here before. For much of 2022 and 2023, Americans were in a "vibecession" where their perception of the economy was much worse than the data indicated. Last time around, pesky inflation was keeping things like groceries and housing costs high, even as the rest of the economy showed improvement. This time, the labor market's the culprit, writes Business Insider's Juliana Kaplan. But it's not mass layoffs most people are worried about. Having a job isn't the issue — the unemployment rate is just 4.2% — as much as finding the next gig. It's no wonder that consumers aged 35 to 54 suffered the biggest drop in confidence, according to the Conference Board. This group, which is in its prime earning years, is facing a job market that's keeping them stuck in place. The labor market isn't a lost cause, though. The Fed has acknowledged its top priority is keeping an eye on job growth and unemployment. We'll get a sense of which direction things are headed on October 4 when we get September's payroll data. Morgan Stanley's chief US equity strategist, Mike Wilson, recently outlined the best- and worst-case scenarios for the numbers in regard to the stock market. If unemployment dips below 4.1% and non-farm payroll can surpass 150,000, consider it game on for a big fourth quarter for stocks. But if unemployment climbs to 4.3% and non-farm payroll drops below 100,000, buckle up for a bumpy ride. The stock market isn't representative of the entire economy, as we've already covered. But continued success there could give companies more confidence to start hiring again. The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

Title: Alphabet shares target cut, keeps outperform on investor concern

On Wednesday, Oppenheimer has revised its price target for Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares, the parent company of Google, reducing it to $185 from the previous $210. Despite the price target adjustment, the firm maintains an Outperform rating on the stock. The reduction in the price target comes amid investor concerns over Google's search engine being labeled a monopoly and the potential loss of its exclusivity with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) devices. Google is responsible for generating 31% of its gross search revenue, amounting to $61 billion, through Apple devices. It pays Apple 36% of that revenue to maintain exclusivity, which translates to 19% of Google's net ad exposure. Oppenheimer's assessment suggests that Google would only need to retain 65% of search activity from Apple users if no Traffic Acquisition Costs (TAC) are paid, or 75% if TAC drops to 15%. This comes in the context of a survey from April indicating that 75% of users would choose Google as their default search engine, and 78% would download Chrome if Google Search was not available in Safari. The firm also noted the separate Department of Justice case against Google's Adtech business, estimating it to represent less than 2% of Alphabet's equity value. The new stock price target of $185 is based on a 20x multiple of the company's expected 2026 earnings, discounted at 8%, or a 21x multiple of the 2025 estimated earnings, compared to the NASDAQ's average P/E ratio of 25x. In other recent news, Alphabet Inc., Google's parent company, is facing a $9.3 billion antitrust lawsuit in the UK, which it has asked a tribunal to dismiss. The suit alleges Google has abused its dominance in the online search market. Simultaneously, Alphabet Inc. has successfully overturned a 1.49 billion euro ($1.66 billion) antitrust fine imposed by the EU, originally levied for practices that allegedly hindered rivals in the online search advertising market. In the realm of financial analysis, TD Cowen has maintained a Buy rating for Alphabet, suggesting that potential changes in Google's default search engine status on Apple's Safari browser may not significantly affect Google's 2026 U.S. Search revenue. Meanwhile, DA Davidson has initiated a neutral rating for Alphabet, outlining potential challenges and opportunities for the company, particularly in areas like artificial intelligence. In terms of regulatory actions, the EU is currently directing Google to cease anti-competitive actions within its advertising technology sector, with a breakup order not expected at this time. However, the European Commission may consider such a measure in the future if Google continues its anti-competitive behavior. These are the recent developments surrounding Alphabet Inc. and its subsidiary, Google. As investors digest Oppenheimer's revised price target for Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), it is valuable to consider some key financial metrics and expert analysis that could further inform their decisions. Alphabet's market capitalization stands robust at $2.02 trillion, reflecting its significant presence in the tech industry. Notably, Alphabet is trading at a P/E ratio of 23.1, which is attractive when paired with its near-term earnings growth prospects. This aligns with an InvestingPro Tip highlighting the company's low P/E ratio in relation to its expected earnings expansion. Another InvestingPro Tip worth mentioning is the company's strong financial position, as it holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, which could provide resilience against market volatility and strategic flexibility. Moreover, Alphabet's revenue growth over the last twelve months as of Q2 2024 stands at an impressive 13.38%, with a gross profit margin of 57.64%, indicating efficient operations and a strong market position. For investors seeking more comprehensive insights, InvestingPro offers additional tips, including Alphabet's status as a prominent player in the Interactive Media & Services industry and its ability to cover interest payments comfortably with its cash flows. In total, there are 10 more InvestingPro Tips available for Alphabet, which can be found at https://www.investing.com/pro/GOOG, providing a deeper dive into the company's financial health and market outlook.

Title: Gen Z are ‘conscious unbossing’—they’re avoiding stressful middle management roles

Tech giants have spent the last two years culling their middle managers. Amazon was the latest to send theirs to the chopping block just last week. Now, Gen Zers don’t even want to climb the greasy pole. In fact, 72% of the youngest generation of workers say they’d rather progress in an individual contributor role than become middle managers, according to the recruitment firm Robert Walters. Although just 16% of the 3,600 Gen Zers surveyed said that they will avoid middle management at all cost, it’s clear that the majority of young people today aren’t keen on the idea of managing others. Over half of Gen Zers expressed that they don’t want to be middle managers, as part of a trend that has been dubbed ‘conscious unbossing.’ Even the 36% of respondents who said they do anticipate stepping into a managerial position at some point in their careers, admitted they don’t actually want to. It’s not that Gen Z workers don’t want success—they’d just rather it didn’t come with the responsibility of managing others. Lucy Bisset, a director at Robert Walters, said that Gen Z prefers to bring their “whole self to projects and spend time cultivating their own brand and approach, rather than spending time managing others.” A clear example of this is the rise in young people ditching the corporate rat race to become their own boss—or an influencer. According to LinkedIn, the second fastest-growing job title among Gen Z grads right now is “founder.” Read more from Fortune –Sam Altman says it’s relentless and all-consuming to run OpenAI teams after shock CTO departure –YouTube’s MrBeast looks for ‘obsessed’ employees to help run his $700 million company, per leaked handbook –Here’s what actually makes employees happy and more likely to stay at their jobs –Laurene Powell Jobs is one of Kamala Harris’s biggest bankrollers—and closest friends –‘As painful as disruption is, it’s not negotiable’ says CarMax’s CEO Meanwhile, separate data shows that more than half of Gen Z say they would become full-time influencers if they had the opportunity, and the percentage has only gone up in surveys dating back to 2019. “My generation don’t want to go work a consulting or banking job. They don’t even want to be an astronaut anymore,” Steven Schwartz, the Gen Z founder and CEO of the multimillion-dollar marketplace Whop previously told Fortune. “They want to make content online, they want to find customers online… Being educated with more information about what people can do, why would they want to do something that isn’t the most elite experience and the most fun for them?” Really, it’s hard to know whether Gen Zers would actually turn down management roles. With the oldest of the generation turning 27 this year, many won’t have been offered the opportunity to step up yet—but it’s hardly surprising they’ve been put off. Having joined the world of work during tech company’s quest for “efficiency,” Gen Z has repeatedly been sent the message that middle managers are disposable. At Google, where 12,000 managers lost their jobs last year, workers have been told it will be harder to get promoted into management roles going forward. Meanwhile, Meta CEO Zuckerberg said that “flattening” its internal hierarchy was core to its restructure last year. He credited Elon Musk as the source of inspiration behind having “fewer layers of management.” In fact, middle-management positions accounted for almost one-third of layoffs in 2023, Bloomberg found, up from 20% in 2018—and the “great unbossing” trend hasn’t shown any signs of slowing down. Last week, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said he wants to “increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15%” (by cutting the number of managers at the tech giant). What’s more, even middle managers who haven’t been laid off are opting to walk out of the role. Earlier this year, a global study found that 75% of millennial managers feel overwhelmed, stressed, and burnt out. As a result, many are eyeing the exit and looking for non-management gigs. Is it any wonder that when Robert Waters asked young people why they’re turning their noses up at middle management jobs, nearly 70% responded: “Too high stress, low reward.” “Those new to middle management experience a steep step-up in workload, further expectations to be ‘always available’ to those they manage, as well continuing pressure to hit their own targets,” Bisset explained. “It’s clear how these roles can prove overwhelming and deter many from taking on the extra responsibility.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Investors have until October 7, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case.

The complaint alleges that during the relevant period, the company misrepresented its warranty reserves and that it had completed a sequence of organizational changes designed to ensure higher quality and lower costs. In truth, Ford was experiencing higher warranty costs, and the warranty reserves did not accurately reflect the quality issues in its vehicles. On July 24, 2024, after the market closed, Ford announced second quarter 2024 financial results (the “2Q24 Press Release”).

Title: What to do if you left it late to start investing

You partied in your 20s and 30s. Or you had kids early and there was no money leftover. Or perhaps you got divorced and your partner took the lot. Bottom line: you’re late to start investing. Are you doomed to eat cat food in your retirement? To be grinding out another shift in your 80s as the oldest barista on the block? Probably not – provided you to take sufficient action now to turn things around. You’ll need to be more focussed than a younger saver though, without their head start. And maybe you should do a few things differently. Imagine you’ve woken up penniless after 20 years in a coma – long of hair, but short of time. The good news? You avoided selfies, Brexit, Covid, social media, and the last series of Game Of Thrones. However you also missed out on two decades of compound interest effortlessly growing your wealth. It’s a financial morality tale is as old as time spreadsheets, handed down from bloggers to Twitter pundits to TikTok influencers. Person A and Person B both start work in their early 20s. They earn the same salary. Person A notices there are a lot of old people around and begins to save, before they too get old. Person B imagines they’ll wear crop tops forever, eats out or orders in every day, spends everything, saves nothing, and reaches their 40s with little to show for it except for a pretty Instagram account. Run the numbers and Person A may already be headed for a comfortable retirement in their early 60s. But person B will need to save much more – and/or for much longer – just to catch-up. We’ve marvelled at the mathematical wonder of compound interest on Monevator before: Consider two investors: Captain Sensible and Captain Blithe. From the age of 25, Captain Sensible invests £2,000 per year in an ISA for 10 years until he is 35. At 35 he stops and never puts another penny into his fund again. Captain Sensible then leaves his nest egg untouched to grow until he hits age 65. He earns an average annual return of 8% and when he looks at his account 30 years later, he has £314,870 to play with. Captain Blithe, meanwhile, spends the lot between the ages of 25 to 35. Only when he hits 35 does he sober up and start tucking away £2,000 per year in his ISA. He keeps this up for the next 30 years until he reaches 65. Captain Blithe earns an average annual return of 8%, too. He ends up with £244,691. To recap: – Captain Sensible has invested a total of £20,000. – Captain Blithe has invested a total of £60,000. Yet Captain Sensible’s pile is worth over 28% more than the late-starting Captain Blithe’s – even though Sensible only invested a third of the amount. Compound interest takes a while to get interesting. All things equal, the earlier you start, the bigger your pension snowball will be by the time you’re old enough to start worrying about it. Of course hearing “you should have started earlier” isn’t any more welcome in personal finance than when you’re facing last dibs at a swingers’ party. There’s not much you can do about that now. What matters is how to best proceed. The good news is that beginning in 2012 most people have been auto-enrolled into pensions at work. But if this came too late for you – or if you didn’t put enough away – then start addressing things today. To catch up with swots like me who were aggressively saving by age 23, you have two broad routes: Clearly you can also pick-and-mix from these options. But know that all of them – from making your own lunch to save an extra tenner to gambling your life savings on a start-up – come with potential risks, rewards, and the chance of outright failure. Risky bets like putting real money into the likes of Bitcoin might well speed up your gains. But very often taking bigger or less orthodox risks will see you do worse. People try to get rich quick because it promises a shortcut, not because of any stellar track record. So you must consider the options for yourself and chart your own course. Just for the record, we strongly advise against robbing a bank! We’ve looked at devising your investing plan before, and also how much you can eventually withdraw from a portfolio. But before you get to that good stuff, you need to understand how far behind you are – and what investing success would look like. When it comes to retirement, success mostly means meeting your annual spending requirements with a low risk of running out of money. So you’ll want know how much you’ll need – realistically – to spend in your retirement years. A good way to get a handle on this number is to track your current spending. Use that as a base to figure out your budget, adjusting as seems appropriate. For instance, fewer work suits in retirement, but more gardening magazines. For a quick start though, see estimates from the likes of the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association (PLSA) and Which magazine. Here are the latest annual retirement income figures from the PLSA: Source: PLSA All figures like this are controversial (read a relevant Monevator comment thread for a taste) because our expectations are all different. So it’s always best to work out your own figures if you can. But for the purposes of a late-starter getting – well – started, ballpark figures will help you to zero-in on the scale of the challenge. From there you can estimate the size of retirement pot you’ll need to generate your desired income – in conjunction with your State Pension – and so what shortfall you face, especially as a later starter. You can always further refine your numbers as you go. So you’re on the wrong side of those Sensible Sarah versus Spendy Samuel spreadsheets? Let’s look at your main evasive action options, with links to further reading. By far your best remedial action is to put much more of your salary into your retirement pot. Ideally in the most tax-advantaged way. Every penny you save rather than spend today is more income for your future self. Also, by getting used to a leaner household budget now, you may be happier making do with less when you do retire. Crucially, your savings rate is one lever that’s mostly under your control – unlike say investment returns or how many healthy working years you have left. Remember there are young FIRE-seekers who are targeting retirement in their 30s or early 40s by saving hard and investing. To some extent you can flip that script, copying their tactics to catch-up late. Another sure winner. Every year you stay in paid employment is (a) an extra year to put savings away, (b) another year for your pension pot to compound, and (c) one less year in retirement that your pension has to pay for. Working for longer is probably not the most appealing prospect, but maybe you can make lemonade out of lemons and enjoy a late bloom at work? Or pivot to a second career? Our final years in work are usually extra-valuable because earnings are higher at the end of our careers than at the start. (Though professional footballers and lap-dancers may need to pursue a different tack). Normally we think it’s a good idea to save into both an ISA and a pension, given they are both tax-efficient wrappers. That’s because money in an ISA is much more accessible – which can be a huge benefit if you need it. But saving into a pension usually has a numerical edge due to tax-bracket arbitrage, salary sacrifice, and the tax-free lump sum you can withdraw on retirement. As a late starter, ISA savings may be a luxury you can’t afford. Run the numbers to see if you’re better-off throwing everything you can into your pension in your precious remaining work years. Maximise your employer’s pension match Your employer is obligated to chip in 3% of your qualifying earnings into your pension under the workplace pension rules. You must contribute 5% of your earnings (though this will cost you less in take home pay terms, after tax relief) for a total minimum contribution of 8%. Some employers are more generous though, and will match further contributions you make up to some limit. This is effectively a hike to your salary, albeit a pay raise that you must put into your pension. Contribution matching is an unbeatably cost-effective way to turbo-charge your savings rate, so you should almost always try to maximise your employer’s contributions. (Ideally via salary sacrifice). Locking more money away for decades probably won’t come easy if you’ve been a spender all your life. At least as an oldie you’re closer to the age where you’re allowed to get your hands on the money again… I hear you: no shit Sherlock: “Earn more money so I can save more money. Why didn’t I think of that?” Understood. But it’s worth a second reminder that how much you can feed into the hopper of your retirement investing engine is what will largely determine what you can spend in retirement. Maybe you planned to coast as a team leader rather than pushing hard to become a department head? Or to stay in a steady public sector job, rather than following your former colleagues into the tougher but more lucrative private sector? Obviously I don’t know your work situation. The permutations are endless. My point is just that easing up and retiring early isn’t on the horizon for you. So maybe knuckle down and work harder instead? Think of it as the bill coming due for all that spending you did 20 years ago… Okay, we’re heading into more controversial territory. But if you can stomach the extra volatility, then it might be worth running your portfolio a little hotter in the hope of bigger gains. What would this look like? For a passive investor it means a larger allocation to equities – such as your global tracker fund – and holding less in defensive assets like bonds, cash, and gold. For example, instead of the industry standard 60/40 portfolio split between equities and bonds, perhaps you’d go 75/25 instead. In theory, you can expect (but not be certain) to earn higher returns over the long term with a higher allocation to equities. The price you’ll pay will be a bumpier ride – and the potential for unlikely but possible lower final returns. (Here’s how that could happen). Remember: the market doesn’t care about your pension predicament nor your hopes for higher returns. Markets will certainly crash from time to time – in the worst case right as you retire – so do keep the riskiness of your portfolio under review as you get older and your pot grows. This is even riskier again, and definitely not for everyone. But if you find yourself in your early 40s, say, with inadequate pension savings when your ‘What About My Retirement?’ lightbulb goes off, then gunning for expected equity returns of 6-10% (hopefully) and tax relief in a pension may make more sense than paying off mortgage debt costing you 5%, say. There’s a panoply of options here, from choosing not to make overpayments on a traditional mortgage to switching to an interest-only option, to remortgaging to extend your mortgage term. All these paths have downsides. Such risks are what ‘pays’ for the potential upside from getting more money growing in your pension for longer. I’ve written a lot about these pros and cons before. And like I did then, I’ll stress again that paying down a mortgage ASAP is also a fine strategy – even for late starters. You can always go on a massive savings push once you’ve cleared the mortgage. Even if it’s not the financially optimal path, clearing your debts may be more motivational for you. That matters! I’d certainly urge you to reject any other kind of debt when borrowing to invest. Mortgages are low cost, they buy you somewhere to live, and they’re not marked-to-market, so you won’t face a sudden cash call during a stock market rout. Other kinds of debt are much more expensive and/or risky. Is amping up the conventional approach not moving the dial for you? Have you left it so late – or are your ambitions are so big – that you need more money than 20 years of diligent plodding can possibly deliver? Let’s run through a few more disruptive alternatives. Maybe you can’t hack the rat race anymore in your late 60s, but you could live with doing a few more years of lower-stress work? So-called ‘BaristaFIRE’ involves earning a bit through the sweat of your brow or muscles to top-up the income from your retirement portfolio. Like this you can survive with a smaller retirement portfolio. It takes a six-figure capital sum to generate £3,000 to £6,000 a year in retirement (a wide band to reflect the vast range of starting points, end points, and all the rest). So earning say £10,000 a year from part-time work can make up for a lot of missing invested money. But I probably wouldn’t work at a coffee shop or similar, if I’d been a high-earner in my main career and money was my main BaristaFire motivation. Most Monevator readers should instead pursue part-time or consulting work in the same vein as their lifelong profession. Doing so will maximise the kerching!-to-effort ratio. I believe everyone has a passion, hobby, aptitude, spare bedroom, or the free time to make £5,000 to £20,000 a year to supplement their main income – without the risks of quitting work to start a business. You may disagree, which is fine but is also perhaps why you’re behind on your retirement savings… The truth is options abound and I can’t list them all here. Be creative, test and iterate, and back yourself. The better pushback is that for a high-earner, it’s not worth messing around with side hustles for £10,000 a year when they are earning £100,000+ in their day job. And I agree. Such people are probably better off getting promotions or doing more overtime. But for the average earner on £35,000, say, the extra cashflow of £5,000 from a side-project can go straight to the bottom line to massively boost your pension savings. Of course if you want to make really big bucks then starting a proper business is one of the best ways. Perhaps the only way for most for us. But that doesn’t mean it’s easy – or in fact less than unlikely or near-impossible. (Beware survivorship bias!) The risks vary. If you’re trying to create a start-up software business, say, or to launch a restaurant, then your chances of success are low. Data suggests 90% of startups fail. But if you’re an established architect wanting to set up your own practice doing what you already do and with an existing book of contacts, for example, then there’s surely less risk of outright failure. Either way, your workload goes through the roof when you run your own business. By all means be an entrepreneur if it’s your life goal. But I wouldn’t quit work to start a business to try to fix my pension pot. Some active investors do beat the market. A handful even over the long-term. Warren Buffett, I’m looking at you. You’re not Warren Buffett and you haven’t got much chance of finding the next Buffett, either. But if you can – or if you have edge yourself and so can pick your own stocks to beat the market – then by definition this will increase your long-term returns. Perhaps there’s a case for investing into a few previously proven but out-of-favour active funds that might recover over the long-term, if you really want to roll the dice. Say with 25% of an otherwise passive equity allocation. Examples as I write could be investment trusts like Scottish Mortgage, Finsbury Growth & Income, Pershing Square Holdings, and RIT Capital Partners. These funds have all compounded money very well over the long-term but are more or less in a funk right now. And they all sit on big discounts. To be clear though, there’s zero guarantee that these or any other active funds will beat the market again in the future. And needless to say you should not take my top-of-head list as any sort of investment advice. Do your own research! Remember: you’ll probably do worse if you invest actively. You’re unlikely to beat the market and you’ll pay more in fees for trying. But there’s always a chance… so onto the list it goes. Some ways of making money sit between investing and running a business. Moves like investing into a family or friend’s franchise business, running a multi-unit buy-to-let portfolio via a limited company, or reserving property off-plan in the hope of flipping it for a profit later. These are idiosyncratic investments where the outcome will be about your aptitude – and luck – rather than what the S&P 500 does. Again, possibilities abound. I’d suggest looking at areas close to your own professional expertise. You might have some kind of edge or insight there. For example, if you’re a dentist then perhaps you know there’s a need for a new multi-practice building in your local area? You could be part of a consortium that gets it built and occupied. That sort of thing. Good luck! There’s no end of other high risk, high reward ‘opportunities’ out there. And yes – I’m lifting my fingers off the keyboard to put ‘opportunities’ into air quotes because one person’s reasoned speculation is another person’s reckless gamble. If not a borderline scam. Into this bucket we might put everything from punting on cryptocurrencies to extreme concentration into just a few company stocks (putting it all into nVidia, say) to investing more than a small percentage of your net worth into a handful of private or crowdfunded start-ups. I would define this category as anything where if a hundred of us have a stab, 90 of us will lose some or all our money – or at the least lag the market in the case of listed shares – but 5-10% might see huge returns. So as the man once said: “Do you feel lucky, punk?” Personally, I would again at most ring-fence a portion of my assets for such antics. Maybe a maximum 10% allocation. That way if I did pick a winner it would meaningfully move the dial, but if – as is most likely – it goes tits up then I’m not too far further behind on my goals. If you say “No way, not touching this stuff with a bargepole” then I can only applaud your good sense. We all know other ways to get rich that aren’t written about on worthy websites like Monevator. And as an upstanding citizen I don’t recommend any of them. Besides the moral issues, do you really want to risk your reputation or your liberty for the sake of a slightly comfier retirement? Perhaps marrying rich is the exception. But I’m the wrong person to ask about marriage, as I see mostly risks… Maybe read some Jane Austen! For some of our regular readers, this post will have seemed like one long ‘obviously’. Such people began saving and investing when they were very young maybe, or they’re on the other side of work already and enjoying the fruits of their labours. Good for them! However I do regularly hear from people with proper jobs and responsibilities who’ve no idea where they stand or what to do about their pensions – and they’re sometimes only ten to 20 years from retirement. If that’s you, then don’t panic. Follow the links in this article, learn more, and begin to create your plan. For most non-investment crazed would-be retirees, I’d suggest stick mostly (or entirely) to the sober tactics, with maybe an added side hustle. Beyond that you could perhaps make a modest 5-10% allocation to a few out-of-favour trusts or to very carefully chosen long-shot bets in the hope – but not expectation – of faster gains. But you must figure out what works best for you. Who knows? You might even have fun doing so. I’m sure I’ve missed out a few possibilities above. Let me know in the comments below – and do tell us your story if you closed the gap in your retirement savings later in life yourself! Thanks for reading!

I imagine there are plenty of people who look no further than the headline salary when considering moves, rather than the wider benefits package. Certainly worth paying attention to in debates about public vs private sector. @tetromino — Good point, I should surface that explicitly. Will add a bit now before sending out the email. Thanks! For the love of God, if you must eat pet food in your dotage, go with dog food, not cat food. Have you seen what they put in cat food? > But person B will need to save much more – and/or for much longer – just to catch-up. More, yes. They will probably be earning rather more than their younger self. If they can reduce their outgoings there’s more tax they’ll be saving of what goes into the pension. Anyway, I’ll stand up as the poster child for the Johnny-come-lately non-recommended way. Barista-FIRE was what I was frightened of. It was a rough experience for three years, and I had good luck to be doing it after a market crash. And I survived/eventually thrived over a decade of active investing, though arguably tutored by Monevator in the early days. So under some circumstances you can get there from here. While I did manage to avoid debt (apart from mortgage) from my early twenties, it absolutely beats me how you get to save money when you’re young. Perhaps living in London through my twenties was my mistake, and perhaps living away from home was another – it was looked down on in the same way as Thatcher’s view on buses and how folk play the mating game under their parents’ roof puzzles me. The general point remains. Young people just don’t usually have much spare money – they’re earning less at the start of their careers and their outgoings are higher as they establish themselves. I didn’t start saving for a pension until I was 29 and I cleared the workforce in my early fifties, because I couldn’t stand what it had become. Re investing, think key point is just make a start. Initially it may seem pointless but get the saving going on an automatic basis and take any employer pension contribution you can. Biggest risk is divorce. Choose your partner carefully ( or just do without). My charm and good looks meant I swerved that one but boy have I seen some financial casualties. Some were emotionally upset too. However old age care fees are just an apocalyptic horseman…have an extra £300k for those. This is me at age 49. Was always conservative with money but on divorce found myself starting over. Its a mix of investing hard (over 30% of income) and running a 85/15 equities/bond portfolio using SIPP and ISA. The result is I’m back on track with 11 years to go (I have a serious illness so want to retire early). The risks of a poorly timed downturn are clear though – been doing a lot of research on sequence risks recently. It shows it is doable though, and have to say Monevator really helps. If you’ve left it ‘too late’ to invest then it’s never too late to turn that around. Do what you can. But if it’s still not enough, then how can you make what you do have go further? Easiest way is geo arbitrage. The UK is a high cost of living location. It’s a relatively rich (but IMO still deeply dysfunctional) nation with a lot of poor people and a few rich ones. And when GDP per capita is around £35,000 p.a. then nothing is cheap and everyone wants a piece of what’s yours. So why not just up sticks altogether and move to where your money will buy you 2 to 3 times as much? If you think that you can’t do that because of your relatives/ friends/ the language barrier, then of course you can. Do it for yourself and for the life you deserve, but have been afraid to reach for. Even in Europe, there are still Low Cost of Living locations where tax is minimal and where £100k will buy you a fine house and a little over £20k p.a. will give you a decent standard of living for a couple. Check out the example of Bosnia. Totally under the radar: https://youtu.be/vxVuFFAhHsQ?feature=shared And that channel/website has plenty of other ideas too: https://thewanderinginvestor.com/blog/ As does this one here: https://youtu.be/KXf38mC3puE?feature=shared And here: https://youtu.be/ebIzq3-rDSw?feature=shared The other thing you could do is accept you’ve messed it up, put £2880 in your new borns JSIPP and at least they won’t suffer the same fate? So who do we know who has happily relocated to Bosnia? I’m highly suspicious of the geo-arbitrage is easy brigade. Like the cost of living is the only variable in quality of life. Someone would actually have to have done it in order for me to take them seriously. But in that scenario, I would be all ears! @Rhino: what about the millions of Brits who retired to Spain and Portugal since the 1970s? No longer such LCOL destinations now, for sure, but just after the fall of Salazar’s successor and the death of Franco in 1974 and 1975 respectively they very definitely were. Do you really think we just happen to be born into the best overall retirement location we could have been born into? I doubt it. Re: Geo-arbitrage, let’s not forget the more modest option of doing it semi-local, as exemplified by one of our readers: https://monevator.com/fire-side-chat-domestic-geo-arbitrage-made-it-possible/ @Ermine — Thanks for chiming in, was hoping you would! You are indeed UK personal finance’s poster-man for starting late and getting out. 🙂 Absolutely, I’d talk to one of them to get the lowdown. Funnily enough my uncle is currently moored up in Portugal semi permanently. In a similar vein to my JSIPP comment I’m trying to talk my kids into marrying Norwegians. @Delta Hedge #6 Easiest way is geo arbitrage. The UK is a high cost of living location. It’s a relatively rich (but IMO still deeply dysfunctional) nation with a lot of poor people and a few rich ones. London is a HCOL location. Fixed that for you 😉 OK, fair enough, a few other UK cities, which tend to be peopled by highish paid young professionals, Oxbridge, Bristol. Those poor people ted to reduce the COL somewhat. Avoid the extremes, natch. I’m not knocking geo-arbitrage, but it should be said that it’s harder as you get older, and while barista-FIRE sucks ending up Billy-no-mates in an alien culture where you don’t really grasp the lingo probably sucks in a different way. It’s not just your personal finances where it’s harder to change things as you get older. I have been plugging away at Duolingo French for nearly a year, while there is some progress and I am probably ahead of my O level French progress is glacial. I can sort of follow the radio news, interviews with real people still sound like line noise to me. Sometimes you gotta do the best with what you have to hand, I agree, but life is about more than money, it is also about your setting. I’m sure Bosnia is charming, but geo-arbitrage works within the UK too – and particularly within the US. There’s some argument it’s worth moving after you retire, since proximity to high-paying work and/or good transport connections to it do raise the cost of living massively. Also high population densities and work opportunities are usually detrimental to natural beauty. I agree wholeheartedly with the theory of “Do you really think we just happen to be born into the best overall retirement location we could have been born into? I doubt it.” , it’s just that in practice you are also shaped across your lifetime by where you live. Arguably the best time to deploy geo-arbitrage is in your twenties when you have least baggage. Reminds me of the book, ‘the almost nearly perfect people’ by Michael Booth. Synopsis is that the scandi countries regularly top the bill in happiness surveys and quality of life etc. but this is from the perspective of the native population, with the ex-pat experience being somewhat different and not so rosy. It’s worth a read actually. FIRE blogs also peppered with failed emigration experiments – grass is generally greener type fallacies. I get the feeling successful geo arbitrage is quite a tough one to pull off in practice, especially, as ermine notes, for those of more advanced years. Would agree, domestic geo arbitrage a much simpler trick. @ermine – I suspect that Duolingo will turn out to be the Sinclair C5 to Tesla’s Model S. What the UK’s many language barrier challenged potential geo arbitrageurs are waiting for is a fusion of Google Translate with the successor to Google Glass and the Apple Vision Pro. Imagine a fully wearable and weatherproof rechargeable device which takes spoken words and written characters in any language and translates them immediately, seamlessly and automatically into any other. And it needs to retail for below £1,000. This is far more near term likely I think than Tesla’s level 5 FSD EV ‘robotaxi’, yet alone Musk’s mad Mars’ plans. The Babel Fish of Douglas Adams’ lore may be near to hand: https://youtu.be/iuumnjJWFO4?si=0TFOkETmWgqTfHSN @Delta Hedge Imagine a fully wearable and weatherproof rechargeable device which takes spoken words and written characters in any language and translates them immediately, seamlessly and automatically into any other. No thanks. I don’t routinely carry a mobile phone with me, never mind a full-body robo-suit. All Watched Over By machines Of Loving Grace. Curtis, not Brautigan > And it needs to retail for below £1,000 Yup. For that price it’ll whisper advertising sweet nothings to you all the time, I’m sure, wraparound Facebook. A metaverse, indeed. Each to their own. I am so old I remember what the term IRL means 😉 And I read Asimov’s The Feeling of Power in my teens. You are more than welcome to say OK Boomer but if that’s the price of entry I think it illustrates the problem of geo-arbitrage for those at the RE end of the journey. @ermine: ideally it’ll all fit neatly inside a jacket pocket and comprise a) wireless ear buds with microphones to take the foreign spoken words and play it to you in English, b) glasses with LED sized cameras embedded to OCR scan foreign written words and display the English translation on the inside of the lenses and c) your mobile phone which you’ll just speak into and its speaker will then translate into the foreign language, in your own voice should you chose. It might sound far fetched but the only piece of Star Trek tech which came to pass (only more so) was the Communicator, which became the mobile phone, and now the smart phone. And on the subject of wrap around Facebook, this from Investing.com only today: “Meta climbed Wednesday after debuting its first augmented reality glasses at its annual connect event”. The future is closer than you think. As Dylan said back in day, ‘the times they are a changin’. @DH (13) I wouldn’t be too quick to knock Duolingo. I have studied German slowly and painfully the old-fashioned way over the years. I am involved in a German conversation group and have been impressed on more than one occasion by the competence of newcomers who have only learned via Duolingo. @DavidV: These investors think Duolingo could be one of the best investments out there: https://open.substack.com/pub/atmosinvest/p/top-4-favorite-stocks-to-own-forever Then again, since subscribing to the free tier for a score of investment Substacks, I’m now daily bombarded with ‘the 25 best companies to hold forever’ type lists, which if I added them up probably more or less make up the investment universe and thereby inadvertently make the case for index tracking 😉 You need to frighten people into saving for their old age. Just ask them “Do you want to reach your sixties still dependent on other people paying for your clothes?” That should do the trick. On taking on more risk, leverage + active investing, this is double edged: – Using volatility and permanent loss of capital as metrics here, moving up the risk scale from index tracking equities to say single name stocks or sectors and regional bets usually doesn’t work or more pros would do it and more retail investors would lag less. – But Consumer Staples and Low Volatility stocks as groups do benefit it seems from more return per unit of risk, defying the efficient frontier. Historically Private Equity has outperformed on this measure but that seems not to be the case now. – Leveraging a low risk asset can deliver better risk to return than moving to invest in a higher risk asset. You really need cost of carry to be low to negative – i.e. the cost of finance is less than the net (post any tax payable) paid out yield on the assets brought. – Contrarianism tends to be a fail but sometimes it wins. But you have both to be right when others are wrong and in a way where you get an additional net return. This is harder than it sounds. For every successful contrarian you do hear about there are so many more who failed who you never hear from. – Then again there are always contrarian opportunities. From the Daily Telegraph’s money pages just this morning “Had you invested £100 in an index of emerging market shares in September 2009, you would have £121 today. The same amount focused on China itself would be worth just £95. Had you instead put your faith in a global stock market recovery over the next decade and a half you would have grown your £100 to £324. And if you had simply bet that America would bounce back to regain its economic leadership, your £100 investment would today be worth £539.” And, for balance here, our own @TI in the MV piece “A buying opportunity has emerged in Emerging Markets” said (back on 11 December 2013): “The S&P 500 has beaten the iShares emerging markets ETF by more than 30% in the year to-date.Will that stellar level of outperformance continue? Maybe. Will it be replayed every year for the rest of the decade? I’ll go out on a limb and say: Not on your nelly”. Back then 11 years ago I nodded to myself in agreement with that as how could the US just keep outperforming year after year after year? But it did. In and around 2012 there were actually a couple of pieces out there saying that US tech was quite cheap compared to then recent (1995-2000 and 2004-7) historical valuations and its growth prospects. If you’d gone with that sentiment; then, from 30th December 2011 through to 3rd January 2022 (buying the NASDAQ index on the last trading day of the earlier year, and selling on the first trading day of the latter), you would have made 19.79% annually in dollar terms, and more still in sterling. So, being a contrarian (in that example case, a tech uber bull) can pay off, it’s just statistically that it tends not to at the aggregate level. @ermine (#3) “For the love of God, if you must eat pet food in your dotage, go with dog food, not cat food. Have you seen what they put in cat food?” Why pet food at all? Even buying in bulk, the dog food we get (just to be completely clear – for our dog) is just over a £1 a tin, whereas Aldi baked beans are 41p, tinned soups 61p, and a jacket potato 24p. OK, Aldi’s dog food is a bit cheaper than what we buy (~50p in multipacks), but our dog’s innards have become a bit fussy as he has aged. Not wanting to take away from your point about jumping ship to a better paid job, but I’m not convinced that the poor public sector, prosperous private sector schtick is still true. Thanks to outsourcing the line between the two has become very murky. The people delivering services are often agency staff while the office staff are permies on gold plated DB pensions. To boost your pension it might make more sense to move from private to public. RE: Emerging markets versus the US, oof, yes, but I’d take that side again. Especially as I didn’t forecast the US market wouldn’t beat EM, I just didn’t think it’d continue to thrash it. Which was wrong, but rational — then and now I’d argue. I’ve mentioned before that I published elsewhere on the Internet in 2011 or 2012 a two-part series on why investors shouldn’t write-off the US stock market, especially tech shares. It is a massive ongoing gripe for me that these articles (along with most others on that site) are no longer available. Not just for bragging rights (though there is that) but because I’d love to link to it to show that — hard as it is to believe theser days — there was a time when the mighty US market was out of fashion, and it wasn’t even that long ago! I look at markets today and I too struggle to see the tech-lite Rest of World keeping up with US exceptionalism. But then I struggle even more to imagine another near-15 year winning streak for the US. Doesn’t mean it couldn’t happen of course — there are underlying reasons why the US has done so well, especially in tech — but as we’ve discussed before there’s usually a medium-term Ying and Yang to US versus the rest of the world’s equities (albeit with the US outpacing the field long-term). Re: DuoLingo, another shareholder here! I have a small position that’s better than doubled and every week I chant the name ‘Bessembinder ‘ three times and will myself to hold onto it. 😉 Nice new interview with the CEO here: https://sherwood.news/business/duolingo-ceo-luis-von-ahn-q-and-a/ @Azamino – You could well be right — as I alluded to in the article I can hardly get into even broad brush discussions for earning potential in different industry sectors, let along people’s specific careers. I think your helpful comment reinforces that people looking to catch-up need to take a holistic view of what they’re trying to achieve with their pension, and what the best opportunities are for *them* specifically. 🙂 @TI “…I published elsewhere on the Internet in 2011 or 2012 a two-part series on why investors shouldn’t write-off the US stock market, especially tech shares. It is a massive ongoing gripe for me that these articles (along with most others on that site) are no longer available.” Have you tried the Wayback Machine (https://web.archive.org/)? I find that site extremely useful for finding deleted material (or deleted domains). @DH accepting that one shouldn’t always infer the general from the particular, I am disturbed both by the capacity for AI to bullshit on all cylinders along with the tendency for AI fans to believe in its ability to transform the world. I have an installation of BirdnetPi in my back garden. It’s quite successfuly identified that there are birds in the garden, it has achieved 100% fail, confidently (> 80%) IDing this exotic crew, I’d have twitchers on the lawn by now 😉 I have put the real IDs in brackets, formed from listening to the recordings AI used to identify: Northern Slaty-Antshrike (robin alarm) Lark-like Bunting (robin alarm) Common Poorwill (some finch followed by magpie) Lark-like Bunting (robin song) Indian Roller (jackdaw) Two things are wrong here. One is these are acceptably clear recordings, some finch is my lack of detailed knowledge but the others are certs. This damn thing knows the lat/lon of where it lives, if I went to a pub with a bunch of people who had the slightest knowledge I’d be laughed out the door claiming the original list. I haven’t got the faintest idea of what Tensorflow Lite is which seems to be the AI guts of this, but the breathtaking confidence in total error is quite impressive, particularly given prior knowledge. I will piddle with this to see if it can be sharpened up, but the fundamental Dunning-Kruger problem is one I’ve seen in a lot of AI. It’s there in the AI ‘assistance’ Wordpress offers, which can totally change the meaning of a sentence with blithe assurance this is better. I used perplexity to try and see if two electric blanket controllers were equivalent. It hemmed and hawed, I read a page of random waffle and was none the wiser; its greatest service was locating a picture of the connectors from which I inferred it was worth a go, and it worked. So apart from the Isaac Asimov angle, I’ll stick with Duolingo, because from these experiences I infer using an AI babelfish is probably a great way to hurl vile abuse at random strangers in foreign countries, which you won’t realise until you get your face rearranged or a pantechnicon arrived with three tons of rice pudding when you thought you ordered a couple of bags of sugar. There’s a fundamental problem with whizzy tools in the hands of noobs. If you have at least some idea of what the result should look like, you have some change of switching it off if it’s chuntering out gibberish. I’m sure people will fix some of this in time, but in the meantime, emigrants/expats/whatever, learn the lingo to at least a serviceable degree. Similarly for the culture- if you are going to some Arab countries then cover up and lay off the hooch, in Thailand don’t insult the king etc etc. @Curlew — Yes, curiously the whole URL hasn’t been archived, which is odd because it wasn’t a small website. I wonder if the site’s owner somehow barred their site from being archived legally or via robots.txt or something. We’d also have the issue of my ‘coming out’ (which if it ever happens will be the biggest anti-climax since the Segway, but which I’d rather do deliberately versus a random link). Moot anyway as the link’s not there. :-\ @ermine: buggy AI is going to be a much bigger issue to begin with than the “Open the pod bay doors HAL” scenario and, even if and when that scenario arrives, it’s then bad human actors misusing AI that’ll be the bigger risk, and not the creation of a SkyNet. At the moment both chat bots and LLM assisted search are pretty crappy tbh. OTOH, there’s some impressive stuff going on with protein folding and with combining neural nets and LLMs. Google Deep Mind was able to crack International Maths Olympiad problems for example and win silver. Already some firms are firing human coders for machine written software. However, it’s not where things are now, but where they will be, that really matters. It’s overhyped now for sure, but writing off machine learning today would be like saying that the internet was going nowhere commercially in 1994. I suspect that there’s a big market for usable, portable, real time translate. It just has to integrate seamlessly with existing (mobile phone) and future (Meta / Apple / Google glasses and ear buds) consumer tech. @TI: I’ve got a feeling now that yours may be the articles which I was referring to above (“around 2012 there were actually a couple of pieces out there saying that US tech was quite cheap”)! Cheap growth beats cheap value and even cheap quality IMO. So you were prescient. EM and European underperformance is rather perplexing. EMs got bid up in the run up to 2008, but they had already taken a massive pummeling by 2013. Likewise, Europe was in the doldrums from the Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain (the ‘PIGS’) debt crisis, and Cyprus was in the frame. Those markets didn’t exactly look overvalued back then, and they really should have put in a much better performance from 2014 to date. It’s not just relative underperformance to the US generally and American Mega Cap Tech particularly, but a rather poor absolute level of return, especially from China. Small caps and small value has also underperformed by a historically unusual margin, and over an exceptionally long time frame. I don’t give financial advice. If (and thank God I’m not in this position) I were to be a late starter to investment then, for me, I guess that I’d be thinking then about taking more concentration risk and a contrarian active bet on mean reversion. That strategy could, of course, easily blow up. But if, counterfactually, I was to find myself that far behind and with so little time left until I expected to retired, then I suspect that I’d then feel compelled to try something radical. That’s not the best way to invest as fear and desperation cloud judgment as much as greed and hubris. @Alan S #20 I wasn’t advocating eating pet food – there was a novel Monevator once recommended that had ‘the dog food years’. It’s more TA we need to worry about, he used to favour dog food in times of fiscal distress but I fear he has a darker view of the financial future since he has cited eating cat food as the marker of epic fail in a portfolio 😉 @DeltaHedge #26 But if, counterfactually, I was to find myself that far behind and with so little time left until I expected to retired, then I suspect that I’d then feel compelled to try something radical. That’s not the best way to invest as fear and desperation cloud judgment as much as greed and hubris. Worked for me 😉 I read this dark transmission on here and at the end of that month had a meeting with a line manager and saw the writing on the wall. I was not the Right Stuff and was wasn’t prepared to do what was necessary to become it. Had I know that line manager was desperate because he had a new baby with his new second wife I would have used that against him, it explained the intensity of the discussion since he needed bodies. Later line managers were puzzled as to exactly why I inferred a one-way ticket. But once you emotionally decide the only way out is to pull the big red ejector handle, you can’t stop the hand reaching for that sucker. I exited the middle class and lived on almost minimum wage for three years, a damn sight eaiser if you own your house with a vestigial mortgage. The difference not spent attracted 40%/32% tax win which is more than that percentage on the amount foregone. It’s not the greatest amount of fun I’ve ever had. But as we observed in a Skype call with some ex-Imperial guys, the privilege of owning your own time and deciding what you will do with this day never gets old, even after a decade. Never underestimate the financial firepower of a desperate old git in the endgame at the peak of his earning power. I have been cynical about the value of compound interest, yes, I’ve seen it but only a decade after retiring. CI plus passive investment expected returns is ion drive, not Saturn V. I did have luck on my side inasmuch as the reason my job went bad was partly because the markets had been shot up in the global financial crisis. That is a terribly good time to start investing, market timing with knobs on. You didn’t have to get much right then, but you did need to start, and I did. I didn’t really expect it to work, but I could recognise a chance worth taking Your FIRE journey was an inspiration to us all @ermine 🙂 Ion drives beat chemical rockets every time. Investing Saturn V’s can blow up on the launch pad like Putin’s recent failed Sarmat ICBM test. Late to the game invesors who are looking to try and play catch up before their retirement beckons should first check out the outcome of the 1969-70 Australian mining bubble or the fate of once all conquering, and much pumped and dumped, alt-coins like Verge/XVG, whose rollercoaster ride Coindesk summaries thus: “On Dec. 23, 2017, the coin hit highs of 30 cents, a staggering 1,384,300% increase from its all-time low…on Feb. 5, 2015. In the wake of the crypto winter of 2018 and 2019, the coin fell to as low as just under 1 cent in March 2020. It wasn’t until 2021, when Bitcoin skyrocketed again, that XVG reached 6 cents in May. The crypto market crashed shortly after… The coin never fully recovered, and by June 2022 had fallen to $0.004. Yet, even that low price marks a staggering 188,149% increase from XVG’s all-time low of $0.000002 on Feb. 5, 2015.” It’s still at $0.004 today, now nearly 7 years on from, and 98.7% down from, its 2017 peak. And in the crypto winter of 2018-19 it was actually at one point down 99.4% from the All Time Highs. It was at that peak that it first attracted attention and then drew in the newbies, as if attracted to a naked flame. The results thereafter were all too predictable, and indeed predicted at the time. I visited a beet sugar refinery once and discovered a fact that took my interest. What do you think they do with the protein from the beets? Goldfish food! Bugger cat or dog food, eat vegan goldfish food. [Correction: Spotted that Coindesk have messed up their maths. The lowest (2015) XVG price was actually $0.00002167 (so they’ve erroneously added an extra 0), which in turn means that the 188,149% figure should be 18,814.9%. The cycle low is $0.001427, which is more than 99.4% off the ATH, which elsewhere is more accurately given as $0.29725. The point remains, crypto is nuts, and alt-coins are a no touch for most (/sensible) investors]. Great article as always 🙂 I started actively investing when I was around 45, after taking a closer look at my work pension and then wondering what I was going to when I retire and it looked scary to me. I started with increasing my pension contributions and sorted out my monthly budget, which then started me looking at ISAs & passive investing with the help of this great blog and a more active portfolio using Investment Trusts. I’m 51 now with no debt other than what’s left of my Mortgage, I can at least see a path now and feel a lot more confident in taking a little more risk I still think I’ll be working when I’m 63 ish I think with a view to working part time. Hopefully by then I’ll have paid off the house When I see examples like the Captain Sensible one I kick myself for having missed out. Then I remember that I did do some moderately stashing of things away around about 29-30 but the problem was gains were eaten up by crap adviser charges (I think you had to go with a broker to buy a S&S PEP at the time) and mediocre funds so got nothing like the 8% example. Plus life was happening so I didn’t do it consistently and did the usual getting spooked by poor sequence of returns when it came to putting more in. The folly of yoof and all that. Only in my more reccent & more focused years been able to access almost nil cost platforms and the real low OCF funds/ETFs to plump up returns and really get past the worry aspect. Only started seriously investing late in day, unfortunately, a few years ago due to getting fingers burnt some 30 -40 years ago so consequently put me off Long story but medical conditions forced me to finish work early around 50 – had started in my earlier 40’s I think many people over estimate what they’ll need, how well they are likely to be – regardless of any healthy lifestyle and how long they’ve got left – which is likely better than not enough but puts you under major stress at times, many think they’ll be running around at 90 or 100 when actually not that many are – and if still alive certainly not spending much (unless paying for your care home costs) or getting out much. Holidays/cars likely a distant memory – that’s if you still have a memory at all I know they are investing focussed but many finance blogs I have read on this subject make light of, and seem to suggest, an early death is quite the advantage in that the portfolio won’t run out (regardless of withdrawal rate) Once you are faced with that prospect I can assure you that your pot isn’t your main concern and you would much rather live longer with not so much rather than vice versa As some others said I don’t find geo arbitrage (or in plain english “moving to somewhere cheaper to live”) always much of a good option either for most -tends to be those in later life or at least middle aged that would consider it and more often those looking to do an “escape to the country” type thing as generally by then had enough of cities and prefer a quieter existence But this is also when medical conditions tend to crop up, as mine and many others I know did – then you need to have medical facilities/main hospitals with A&E at hand Not always a period of your life when you want to be uprooting to miles away – which can often be the case if you require a large decrease in property costs – and having to start again, maybe no family around Also you can only achieve a large saving on property cost if you are already living in a fairly highly priced area but if you live in north then good luck with making much from that (unless you are also downsizing by a lot) I’ve known many come back as well after moving to Aus/NZ/other parts of UK – as the grass is not always greener as they believed it was – especially if you don’t really know anybody there Also when older you tend to delight in moving house with all it’s hassle and ramifications about as much as going to Glastonbury every year I agree with others divorce is a big risk and sometimes don’t even have to be married – the number of people suggesting to invest monies in partner’s ISA/pension if used all your allowances to save tax seems quite ludicrous to me, no matter how safe you think your relationship is – people can change markedly over time and even the safest can and do go sour. Also what about if they die first and not married and maybe no will – that would go to their family – not to you but some do it – presumably think it won’t happen to them – is that the “not me gov” bias? ^ @dearieme 30 Was it Wissington Sugar Factory? Great article. One piece of advice is focus on where you are investing as much as how much do you put into a pension. Too many workplace pensions have a ‘default’ allocation which typically are not the best for performance. Invest passively, diversity your portfolio, keep charges low and that should put you in good stead. Don’t try to chase todays winners (which are tomorrows losers). To get rich quick you do it slowly…. I retired at 60 with way more money than I needed but still enjoyed part time consulting for the first five years of retirement. I was able to earn six figures working only about 8 hours a week. But I also watched other engineers fail at consulting and it was easy to see why. Many engineers move into our management functions later in their careers. And their technical skills atrophy or become outdated. Even though I ran a billion dollar corporation I still kept a couple of tech responsibilities that kept my engineering skills sharp and current. If you plan on consulting after retirement that is a must. I was certainly late to investing, not starting until after I’d retired. This was an easy option as I’d joined the Civil Service as a graduate, partly because of the job for life, plus the “non-contributory” pension then advertised. As a middle manager I was lucky to spend most of my career doing roles I was competent at and interested in and looked forward to that decent pension without worrying about retirement. Rather than invest, we just bought properties we could do up in turn, concentrate on getting our garden just as we wanted it, before moving onto the next one for a yet larger garden. However, the anticipated pension prospects shrunk as the post financial crash curbs on public sector pay persisted. Then the coalition government decided we should pay more for our “non-contributory” pension, up to 8% of salary, an amount that simply swelled Treasury coffers as there’s no actual fund for such money. Taking into account the annual season ticket, I found my net pay after that going down. Even now, the published gross salary for my former grade isn’t much above where I finished up. Luckily for me, the coalition government was looking ditch many of my grade and I took the plunge in 2012. The mortgage remaining was quite sizeable but we’d already decided to sell up and shift to southern Scotland, less downsizing, more “down-financing”. Same size property, but half size garden. Domestic geo arbitrage in action. Initially I ignored investing as my one previous toe in the water was a small PEP invested in Euro stocks in 1999, which just went sideways for years. Only later, once interest rates started to go right down and peer-to-peer start to look riskier did I consider the stock market, inching in via Fundsmith and Vanguard VUSA in 2018. Just before COVID I discovered Monevator and received the “Don’t f***ing sell” message just before my early gains disappeared. But I hung on in there. Since then, with the help of TI and TA, I’ve diligently continued to accumulate my growing snowball, with my partner’s very successful passive portfolio and my much more interesting but perhaps less lucrative mainly active portfolio. I’m grateful not to be someone who relies on the success of their investing, but can instead develop it as a hobby to pay for improving our latest abode, develop our latest garden and cover our holidays. I’ve made my share of mistakes and learned an awful lot in six years, but hopefully there’s no prospect of being reduced to cat food (or indeed cats) while the UK manages to avoid true economic disaster. Thanks then to Monevator. While I may not merit Mogul status, you certainly well deserve my Mogul sub. @lenahan35. A definite maybe: it was in East Anglia but I’m not sure it was that one. It could have been Bury St Edmunds but that’s a maybe too. It was decades ago and my memory is unclear but I do remember putting my hand into a bin of product, sniffing it, and being instantly transported back to boyhood. (Like wot that French cove wrote about searching for his lost cat. If you’ll forgive a boyish joke.) As an exercise in squeezing value out of almost every stream of material in the plant the whole thing was mighty impressive. @No Longer Civil — Thanks for sharing your experiences and even more so for taking out a Moguls subscription. Hope you enjoy many happy years of tending to your garden and your portfolio! 🙂 @Jon and others — Just a quick thanks to everyone who shared their experiences of starting late with investing (and please do add yours if you’ve not already). Some Monevator pages are still widely-read years after publication. And hopefully these comments will provide some inspiration to anyone desperately Googling for a way to turn things around in the afternoon of their careers! I was interested to see the several comments about divorce. Back in my older and bolshier days I drafted a post about why you should not get married, but like a similar one on the real cost of having kids I shelved it. Perhaps I should see if it might be salvaged… 😉 Also, lots of interesting detail there in your comment in particular @Jon. Could I interest you in doing a FIRE-side chat interview? @Investor I think the cost of having kids is grossly overstated, maybe more so than cost of care fees. Circle of life – bring up children, nurture them, the roles will reverse (suspect daughters would be better, but sons aren’t a total loss…) Interesting to see how the tone of ‘Millenial Revolution’ has changed since the writers have had a child.

Title: Could The Newly Launched Bitcoin ETF Options Propel BTC Price To The Moon? Bitwise’s Exec Thinks So
URL: https://zycrypto.com/could-the-newly-launched-bitcoin-etf-options-propel-btc-price-to-the-moon-bitwises-exec-thinks-so/

One of the exciting developments from last Friday was the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) greenlight for listing and trading of physically settled options tied to BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). Bitwise’s head of alpha strategies has suggested that these products could set the stage for enormous upside volatility in the BTC price. On Sept. 20, the Securities and Exchange Commission gave its regulatory blessing to the Nasdaq exchange to list options on BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) — marking the first time the top Wall Street financial cop has greenlighted options tied to spot Bitcoin funds for U.S. customers. Listing spot BTC options on regulated US exchanges, where the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) protects traders against counterparty risk, represents “the most monumental advancement possible” for cryptocurrency markets, Jeff Park, Bitwise Asset Management’s head of alpha strategies, observed in a Friday tweet. “For the first time, Bitcoin will have a regulated market where the OCC protects clearing members from counterparty risks,” Park explained. “This means Bitcoin’s synthetic notional exposure can grow exponentially without the [default] risks that have kept investors at bay.” Notably, Park argued that Bitcoin’s unique attributes combined with options could deliver massive potential for upside volatility. The first is Bitcoin’s “volatility smile,” depicting the willingness of derivatives traders to pay high premiums for both exposure to and protection from heavy upside or downside price volatility. This gives Bitcoin options “negative Vanna,” meaning the asset’s volatility soars alongside its spot price, making Bitcoin’s upside “explosively recursive.” “A negative Vanna gamma squeeze acts like a refueling rocket,” the expert added. The other Bitcoin characteristic is its capped supply. As fresh leverage flows into the market, new coins cannot be printed to accommodate it — an anomaly that has typically limited the peak of explosive meme stocks such as Gamestop (GME). While there are markets for other commodities like oil and natural gas, the Bitwise executive said they trade more closely with the futures market because they have expiration dates. They’re also vulnerable to supply manipulation by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other bodies.“Bitcoin ETF options are the first time the financial world will see regulated leverage on a perpetual commodity that is truly supply constrained,” he summarized. “Things will likely get wild. In such scenarios, regulated markets may shut down.” Remarkably, Bitcoin is completely decentralized and can’t be shut down, which he believes “will add even more fuel to the fire.” “It’s going to be unbelievably fantastic.” Meanwhile, other top analysts expect the SEC to approve options trading on other spot Bitcoin ETFs “in short order.”

By: Temidayo Omoniyi | Updated: 2024-09-25 | Comments | Related: > Cloud Strategy With the ever-growing demand for data to power Large Language models (LLM), the need for streaming data is on the rise. The influx of data coming in real-time needs to be stored and made useful for prediction or descriptive use cases. Microsoft Azure has tools to achieve this use case with its many resources for data professionals. We can achieve predictive and descriptive models by introducing resources like Azure Stream Analytics, Azure Machine Learning, and Power BI services. To better understand this article, it is advised to read the previous article titled "Data Streaming Micro-Service Architecture with Azure Technology". This article is a continuation, with a few resources being provisioned. Project Architecture Microsoft Azure Stream Analytics is a cloud-based service designed to process and analyze large volumes of data from a variety of sources, including applications, social media feeds, and sensors, in real-time. The following steps should be taken to provide an Azures Stream Analytics job. Step 1: Basic Settings. In your Azure portal, fill in the following information, as seen in the image below. Step 2: Storage Account (Optional). This is optional. You can add a storage account to Azure Stream Analytics by setting up your container in Azure Data Lake. This is also used to sort the ingested data in real-time in the Azure storage account. Leave all other settings at default and click Review + create to provision the Azure Stream Analytics Job. Now that we have successfully provisioned the Azure Stream Analytics Job, we need to read and analyze the data. Set Input. This refers to the source at which the data will be ingested in Azure Stream Analytics. This is obtained from Azure Event Hub. From Azure Stream Analytics, expand Job topology, then select Inputs. This should open a new window, where you click Add input and select Event Hub. In the new window, fill in the following from the image below and click Save. Note: Leave the rest at default. Test Input Connection. After successfully creating the Azure Event Hub input, test the connection by clicking the test connection icon (not shown). If all is done appropriately, you should receive a Successful connection test message. Set Output. From the Project Architecture, we plan to move aggregated data from Azure Stream Analytics to the Power BI Streaming Dataset. The next steps should be followed to achieve the output dataset: Step 1: Create Power BI Workspace. A workspace is a collaborative area containing datasets (semantic models), reports, dashboards, etc., where colleagues develop and share business intelligence reports. You can learn more about the Power BI Service workspace by reading one of our previous articles. In your Power BI Service, click on Workspaces and select New | Workspace. This should open a new window where you need to fill in the following information and click Apply. Step 2: Assign Stream Analytic Output to Power BI Workspace. Now that you have created the Power BI workspace, head back to your Azure Stream Analytics in your Stream Analytics. In your Stream Analytics, select Outputs, Add Output, and choose Power BI. In the new window, fill in the following information from the image below. Click Save. Step 3: Query Stream Data. In your Stream Analytics, click on Query. This will open a new window where you are expected to fill in the following. From the query below, you will notice the data is being read from Stream Analytics and pushed into the Power BI workspace streamyahoofinance we created earlier. If you are satisfied with the query, start the Stream Analytics job by clicking the Start job button. This automatically starts Steam Analytics and pushes the data to the Power BI Service dataset. Now that your Stream Analytics job is running, head to the Power BI Service workspace created to confirm the dataset. If you notice the dataset is not appearing, try refreshing the web browser and run again. In your Semantic model, click the 3 dots and select Create report. This will open Power BI Design Canvas. In Power BI Report Canvas, you can create simple reports of your choice. The report below might have a limited amount of insight because it was done on a weekend when most stock markets are closed for the week. Azure Machine Learning Studio is a web-based development environment for data professionals for building, testing, and deploying machine learning models on the Microsoft Azure Platform. The following steps should be taken to create Azure Machine Learning. Step 1: Basic Configuration. In your Azure Portal, search for Azure ML Studio and fill in the necessary settings. Click Review + create. Step 2: Launch Studio. After successfully provisioning Azure ML Studio, click Launch studio to start building your models. Step 3: Create Compute. Azure ML Compute refers to the computing resources you use to run your machine learning projects in Azure Machine Learning. These resources provide the processing power and memory needed to train your models, analyze data, and deploy them into production. There are different types of computing available in Azure Machine Learning. For this article, we will focus on the Compute Instance and Compute Cluster, their differences, and when best to use them. Create the Compute Instance: You can manually stop the cluster if you are not using it or set it to off after a certain inactive period. During real-world scenarios, it is best to develop your model in a test environment and then import it to Azure Machine Learning. This is for cost-saving purposes and other use cases. We will use the Jupyter Notebook to test and deploy the base to Azure ML for production use cases. The following steps will help to create a forecast model from Yahoo Finance: Step 1: Install All Necessary Libraries. Before starting the process, we need to install all necessary libraries for this project. Open your Windows terminal and paste the script below to install all the required Python Wheels. Step 2: Import All Needed Libraries. Here is a list of imported libraries needed for this project. Step 3: Get Historical Data. Note:Since we want to create a forecast model, we need historical data to train the model for prediction purposes. Data ingested from Yahoo Finance API with the Azure Function Timer trigger are in real-time; this means we don't have enough historical data to create a predictive model. Create a function that will help get the Nvidia stock data from the start date of 2010-01-01 till current date. This date range would provide enough historical data to train the model. Step 4: Visualization. Using the matplotlib library, we will create a line chart to provide a trend to understand the closing price of NVDA stock over the past couple of years. Step 5: Filter Closing Price Column. We need to create a new DataFrame with only the Close column. We plan to create a forecast model based on the Closing price column. Step 6: Standardize the Data. Scaling the data using the MinMaxScaler function is a method to slice the data to fit within a specific range, typically between 0 and 1. The MinMaxScaler is part of the sklearn.preprocessing module. Step 7: Split Data to Train. Splitting the data will help prepare the training data for the machine learning model, specifically for our case, which is a time series prediction. Step 8: Convert x_train and y_train to Numpy Array. We need to convert the training data list into a numpy array and reshape the input data into the needed format for the forecast machine learning model, which is the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. Step 9: Create Model. Using the LSTM model for time prediction, the following lines of code are used in creating the needed model: The following specifies the number of times the model will iterate over the entire training dataset using the epoch number. Step 10: Split Data to Test. The code snippet below is used to split the data into both the x_test and y_test needed for the forecast model. Step 11: Create a Forecast Chart. With all the necessary information, we can create a forecast chart using the historical data. Looking at the image below, you will notice that the Predicted Trend and Validation trend are close to the train forecast. We can further improve the model's accuracy by performing hyper-parameter and model tuning. Now that we are satisfied with the model, we can import it to Azure Machine Learning. In your Azure Machine Learning Notebook tab, click the 3 dots (not shown), and then select Upload files. This will open another window. In the new window, click the + icon to upload the .ipynb file from your local machine, check all the boxes, and click Upload. With the file successfully uploaded, we can save the notebook, install all necessary libraries, and run the model. In this article, we have covered both descriptive and predictive models based on streaming data. We created a Power BI service workspace to ingest financial data from Yahoo Finance into the Power BI Stream Dataset Semantic model. The same process was repeated for the predictive model, where we created a model to forecast price prediction based on historical data. For the Forecast model, we could not use it in real-time as we needed historical data to first train the model before creating predictions. Subsequent articles on this project will be released to make further improvements to the predictive model.

Title: Future of TV Briefing: How publishers are turning podcasts into video talk shows

Last chance: Secure your pass for the Digiday Media Buying Summit | Oct. 15-17 Last chance: Secure your pass for the Digiday Media Buying Summit | Oct. 15-17 This Future of TV Briefing covers the latest in streaming and TV for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Wednesday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → This week’s Future of TV Briefing looks at how Overtime and Vox Media are adapting their podcasts into long-form videos. Honestly, I thought video podcasts were just a fad. And obviously, I was wrong. Way wrong. More than 170 million people have watched a video podcast on Spotify, per the company, and YouTube has become the “most used” platform for consuming podcasts, according to a study by Cumulus Media and Signal Hill Insights. All of which is to say: Podcasts are becoming largely video productions. As a result, podcast publishers are having to sort out how to adapt podcasts into videos. Sure, they can just hook up a show’s RSS feed to YouTube and have the audio play over a static image of the podcast’s thumbnail image. But then that’s not really a video podcast. “There is a version of a video show that you could do, say, on YouTube that is a static image and just a long-form audio bed underneath it. That doesn’t feel as native to the platform, even though people do consume that way. And so as we think about podcasts as like a modern talk show – our chat podcasts at least – we are thinking about what’s native to the different platforms where they appear,” said Nishat Kurwa, svp and executive producer for podcasts at Vox Media, which has been producing video podcasts since The Verge’s Vergecast debuted in November 2011. Making video podcasts native to platforms like YouTube means making sure a video podcast is as much a video as a podcast. There are some basic elements, like filming the hosts and guests. But simply recording a Zoom session or setting up a single camera in a podcast studio doesn’t necessarily suffice. “It’s important for us to be cutting and changing the layout of the screen, just to keep the user engaged. That’s one thing that you never need to think about for audio, vs. on video, it’s like, ‘How is there some type of change every once in a while so that people are not just looking at the same type of image for too long?’” said Sam Gordon, editor-in-chief of Overtime, which started producing long-form video podcasts roughly six months ago and has accumulated 55 million views on YouTube for those podcasts in the past two months. Much of the answer to that question depends on how the podcast is recorded. If done entirely in person, then a best practice is to set up three cameras on set: one focused on the host, one focused on the guest(s) or cohost and one set at a wide angle to show all parties. “That way we always have two angles that we can pull from for any given person,” said Gordon. In-person recordings also open up production design opportunities to create visual interest on the set. For example, Sue Bird’s and Megan Rapinoe’s podcast with Vox Media, “A Touch More,” originated as an Instagram Live series recorded at home. So the video podcast is filmed in one of Vox Media’s studios on a set “that looks like a cozy room,” said Kurwa. If recorded remotely via Zoom or another video conferencing platform, creating visual interest can be trickier. Webcam-quality clips are often of lower resolution than what people are accustomed to watching on YouTube, especially as more of YouTube’s watch time takes place on TV screens. This is where graphics become the unsung workhorse of the video podcast. “You can add a lot of personality with graphics,” said Kurwa. Overtime, for example, has graphics packages for each of its shows recorded via Zoom. These graphics enable the Zoom recordings to be inset as opposed to scaled up to cover the entire screen and enlarge the lower image quality. Additionally, Overtime sometimes adds motion to the graphics that add depth and life to the shot. “We also have graphics where we can show multiple camera angles at once. If you go full screen, and it’s half one [clip] and half the other, it’s not visually engaging,” Gordon said. Vox Media similarly enlists its design team to create custom visuals and motion graphics for its video podcasts. “We map out what the segments are going to be in the show. We talk to the design team about some recurring templates that we think we’re going to use, whether that’s the segment title cards or recurring motion graphics that we think will be useful to have over time,” Kurwa said. Minding the visual as well as aural quality of podcasts is also reshaping the skillsets of those working on podcasts. Case in point: Production assistants on the Vox Media Podcast Network’s production team have historically been responsible for pulling archival audio clips and now are being asked to also pull b-roll video clips. “We are seeing the future of podcasts as multi-platform shows. I think that is a skillset that’s really beneficial for podcast producers to have, so that they can be more versatile in the jobs of now, the jobs of the future, and be more of an asset to more kinds of productions,” Kurwa said. “It’s: Speak out, but don’t speak out if you want to pay your rent, but speak out if you want to be a morally accepted creator, but don’t speak out if you want to be able to pay your bills.” Thanks to the Summer Olympics airing across traditional TV and streaming, people spent more time watching NBCUniversal properties on their TV screens in August than any other media company’s, according to Nielsen’s latest Media Distributor Gauge viewership report. NBCUniversal’s upswing didn’t necessarily come at a cost to all other companies’ watch time shares. YouTube and Roku’s The Roku Channel gained share in the month. 90%: Percentage share of Paramount Global’s planned layoffs that the company expects to have been completed after Tuesday. $100: Price of Roku’s new Ultra connected TV device.

YouTube’s latest brand safety snafu: Ads for brands including Adobe and Mazda as well as Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign appeared on YouTube videos spreading misinformation about Haitian migrants, according to The New York Times. Lionsgate’s AI deal: The movie and TV studio has signed a deal with generative AI company Runway that gives the latter access to its content library and the former access to an AI model trained on that content, seemingly without any money changing hands between the two, according to The Wall Street Journal. YouTube’s AI tools: A year after unveiling generative AI tools for creators, YouTube is adding to its lineup by formally rolling out products to let creators have generative AI come up with video concepts and even create actual videos (albeit only up to 6-second-long clips), according to The Verge. Amazon’s AI ads: Like Google and Meta before it, Amazon has created a tool for advertisers to have AI create their video ads by converting static images into video, according to TechCrunch.

Title: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSM)’s Geopolitical Risks Could Weigh on Shares

We recently published a list of 10 Best Foreign Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) stands against the other best foreign stocks to buy now. The close of 2024 is resulting in a much needed paradigm shift for US and global equities. Ever since the coronavirus pandemic disrupted our way of living in 2020, investors have had to deal with one setback or another. While the immediate effect of the pandemic equities saw technology stocks soar, other sectors, such as energy and travel didn’t. Then, inflation rose in 2022 forcing central banks worldwide to rapidly hike interest rates, which naturally made equities much less attractive than before. Since then, rates have been high in Europe and the US as well as in the developing world. However, with the European Central Bank’s (ECB) and Bank of England’s (BOE) latest rate cut decision, things appear to be changing. The ECB got the ball rolling in June after it cut interest rates by 25 basis points and then followed up with another 25 point cut in September. These decisions have been influenced to some extent by economic growth concerns. During the press conference after she announced the rate cuts, ECB President Christine Lagarde commented that while her organization had initially expected European economic growth to pick up, this hadn’t been the case. As per Lagarde, “We have revised downwards the outlook for growth, because the consumption that we had anticipated for now, essentially, because net income has begun to increase, inflation has gone down significantly and we were expecting consumption to pick up, has not picked up. And I think that we will be looking at that carefully when we produce our next growth and GDP numbers.” During Q2 2024, the EU and broader Euro area’s GDP grew sequentially by 0.3%, which was similar to the Q1 figures. On an annual basis, the EU’s GDP marked a 0.8% growth while the Euro area’s growth was 0.6%. Lagarde’s comments were accompanied by the ECB’s updated growth estimates for 2024, 2025, and 2026. While it had expected these to sit at 0.9%, 1.4%, and 1.6%, respectively, the updated estimates reduced all of these by 0.1 percentage point. With the EU’s economic performance, one country’s under performance is relevant for the broader area as well as an analysis of foreign or exUSA economies. This country is Europe’s largest economy, Germany. The German economy was 2023’s worst performer among major economies as it contracted by 0.3%. In Q2, the GDP contracted by 0.1% sequentially and missed analyst estimates of 0.1%. This slowdown came at a time when inflation jumped by 2.6% in July and accelerated by 0.1 percentage point over June. The economic uncertainty has also affected German investors, as data from the ZEW economic research institute’s economic sentiment index shows that the index fell to a whopping 3.6 points from an earlier 19.2 points. Analysts had expected it to sit at 17 points. Additionally, investor perceptions of the economy fell to levels last seen just as the coronavirus had started to wreak havoc in May 2020 and sat at -84.5. Germany is struggling because the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine has cut its supply of cheap Russian gas. While this has increased costs, on the demand side, Germany is suffering from a weak Chinese economy. Data from the Federal Statistical Office shows that Germany’s exports to China in May sat at €7.5 billion for a 14% annual drop. Between January to May, the exports were €40.3 billion, for a 10%+ drop over 2022. With German firms such as LVMH experiencing a 14% Chinese sales drop in Q2 and Swatch witnessing a 30% drop in H1, it’s clear that Chinese consumers are in no mood for discretionary spending. This has also led to Goldman recommending that investors sell European stocks with Chinese exposure as it is worried about its basket of European stocks. As per the bank, while “a great deal of earnings downgrades have already occurred year-to-date for our luxury basket, we worry that more could take place.” It adds that “Also, the valuation premium of the basket has deflated, but remains on the high side of its history.” Pessimism about China is evident in the data as well. During Q2, the economy grew by 4.7%, with retail sales whimpering through a 2% growth rate. This was the slowest since December 2022, when the Zero COVID lock downs were still making their impact across the country. In the aftermath of the disappointing data from the world’s second largest economy, Goldman and Citi, which had earlier expected the Chinese economy to grow by 4.9% and 4.8%, slashed their estimates to 4.7%. Goldman commented “We believe the risk that China will miss the ‘around 5%’ full-year GDP growth target is on the rise, and thus the urgency for more demand-side easing measures is also increasing,” while Citi stated, “We believe fiscal policy needs to step up to so as to break the austerity trap and timely deploy growth support.” Yet, while Germany and China have struggled, the world’s largest economy America has thrived. US GDP grew by 3.1% annually in Q2, lending credence to the argument of American exceptionalism. On a quarterly basis, it was up by 0.7%, despite the fact that interest rates remain at a 24 year high. This growth has created ample room for the Federal Reserve to keep rates high, and now, most expect that an interest rate cut is incoming. Due to America’s dominant role in global economic affairs, the Fed’s decisions have a global impact. For European stocks, it meant that the day before the rate cut decision, the index tracking Europe’s top 600 stocks gained 0.5% while the British stock market jumped by 0.7%.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 156 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is the world’s largest contract chip manufacturer which provides it with a wide moat in the industry. Some of its biggest and most lucrative customers include tech companies like Apple, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, and AMD. Since chip designing is a complex process that takes years of development, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) benefits from long term customer partnerships. It also leads its primary rival Samsung when it comes to product quality which ensures that all of the world’s biggest companies continue to rely on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) to manufacture their chips. The firm is also currently competing with beleaguered US chip giant Intel, which plans to produce its 18A process in 2025. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) might see competition from Intel some years down the road if the latter can ramp up its products, and the only worries surrounding the firm is its operations base in Taiwan which is vulnerable to conflict with China. ClearBridge Investments mentioned Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said: “However, we added to our semiconductor positioning during the quarter with the purchase of Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). TSM, an out-of-benchmark name, is the world’s fabrication production provider of choice. The criticality and sophistication of the company’s manufacturing footprint powers all of the leading edge fabless global semiconductor companies, including Apple, Nvidia, Qualcomm, AMD and Broadcom. While AI has driven upside in data centers, PCs and handsets are at cycle lows, positioning half of the company’s business for a recovery.” Overall TSM ranks 1st on our list of best foreign stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of TSM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.
