Title: CVS Health to lay off nearly 3,000 workers in cost-cutting drive

The latest breaking updates, delivered straight to your email inbox. CVS Health is planning to cut about 2,900 jobs in an effort to slash costs, the U.S. health care company said Tuesday. “We’ve embarked on a multi-year initiative to deliver $2 billion in cost savings by reducing expenses and investing in technologies to enhance how we work,” a spokesperson said in a statement. The layoffs represent less than 1% of CVS Health’s workforce. “Impacted positions are primarily corporate roles. The reductions will not impact front-line jobs in our stores, pharmacies and distribution centers,” the spokesperson added. The job cuts at the company, which runs a network of pharmacies across the United States among other businesses, add to the 5,000 or so layoffs disclosed last year. In 2021, CVS Health announced that it would close around 900 stores between 2022 and 2024. “Our industry faces continued disruption, regulatory pressures and evolving consumer needs and expectations,” the spokesperson said Tuesday. U.S. drug store chains are struggling because of falling reimbursement rates for prescription drugs, according to analysts who cover the industry. At the same time, the front end of drug stores, where snacks and household staples are sold, has become less profitable as shoppers buy more of these items online from Amazon and at big-box chains such as Walmart, Target and Costco. Dollar General’s growth has also hurt drug store chains in rural areas. CVS Health, which already uses artificial intelligence in some of its businesses, is making additional investments in the increasingly popular technology, as well as in robotics, “to further automate, reduce cost and improve the experience for all of its constituents,” according to its latest annual report.

Title: Smite Developer Hi-Rez Lays Off Employees, Focusing on Smite 2
URL: https://wccftech.com/smite-developer-hi-rez-lays-off-employees-focusing-on-smite-2/
Time Published: 2024-10-01T16:16:23Z
Full Content:
Hi-Rez has announced that they have made layoffs within the company as part of an "internal reorganization and prioritization." Smite 2 is already in Early Access but requires those who are interested in playing it to purchase the Founder's Pack first before the game goes free-to-play after the first year. Studio Head Steward Chisam made a lengthy post on X, saying that the changes that Hi-Rez have made are "difficult but necessary" to be able to ensure that Smite 2 has a "long and sustainable future." Smite was first released in 2014, using Unreal Engine 3. The game has been ported to PC, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and even Amazon Luna. The only place players can't play the game is on mobile. Smite has been a hugely successful game in the MOBA genre, with there being many characters to choose from and a big esports scene with multiple tournaments, which also includes the annual million-dollar Smite World Championship. Chisam hasn't disclosed how many were laid off in the restructuring and said that "this will disproportionately impact those in marketing and publishing roles, as well as some from our Evil Mojo, G&A, and Titan Forge divisions." It's said that there will still be some developers working in small teams on Paladins and Smite to provide light updates to the games, but most of the studio is now shifting its focus entirely over to Smite 2. In the post, it's said that the team is now pivoting their focus on "gameplay development in the near term," which will include new modes, Gods, and quality-of-life improvements for the title rather than focusing on cosmetic and monetization features, which was originally the game plan for the Smite 2 team. Chisam has said that this has "a real human impact at a tough time," but also states that Smite 2's development team overall is larger than Smite's "throughout most of its life cycle. The team working on Gods and gameplay features (versus skins and monetization/progression/system features) is larger than the Smite 1 team ever was for such features. In this lengthy statement, it's also mentioned that they want to make Smite 2 the best possible game experience that can sustain itself "long into the 2030s." As the game is still in the Alpha stage, it's said that they have learned a lot about the process of "migrating gods from Smite 1 to Smite 2. We're doubling down on ensuring this transition meets players expectations and moves faster." Whether the amount of layoffs will be disclosed in the future is uncertain, and replies to the post have been turned off.

Title: Here’s The Actual Reason Why The World’s Second-Largest Asset Manager Vanguard Snubbed Bitcoin ETFs
URL: https://zycrypto.com/heres-the-actual-reason-why-the-worlds-second-largest-asset-manager-vanguard-snubbed-bitcoin-etfs/
Time Published: 2024-10-01T16:02:04Z
Full Content:
Back in 2017, legendary investor Jack Bogle infamously cautioned investors to “avoid Bitcoin like the plague”. Roughly seven years later, Vanguard has still ignited the ire of crypto enthusiasts by sticking to the conservative investment principles of its late founder. Despite the euphoria unleashed by chief rival BlackRock being among the issuers of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on American stock exchanges, Vanguard still won’t touch the new BTC products with a ten-foot pole. Bloomberg’s top ETF analyst Eric Balchunas has revealed why Vanguard, which currently holds approximately $7.2 trillion in assets under management, continues to shun Bitcoin spot investment vehicles, unlike its peers. According to Balchunas, the Pennsylvania-based company has traditionally steered clear of commodities, which Bogle dismissed as “total speculation” since they are “only worth what someone else will pay you.” Bogle favored assets with intrinsic cash flow over mere commodities like Bitcoin. Even as billions flowed into the newly-launched spot Bitcoin ETFs, Vanguard has maintained that it has no plans to offer its clients any crypto-related products. The Bloomberg ETF pundit described Vanguard’s paternalistic decision to block Bitcoin ETFs on its enormous trading platform as “a bit nanny state-ish.” He contends that their “highly intelligent” investors should be able to decide for themselves whether or not they want to gain direct exposure to the burgeoning crypto. Vanguard’s rejection of Bitcoin and crypto in general stands in contrast to its industry peers. BlackRock, Fidelity Investments, and Invesco have all debuted spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs this year, while major US banks like JPMorgan are serving as authorized participants for the products. Meanwhile, earlier this year, Vanguard named Salim Ramji, a former BlackRock executive who oversaw the company’s launch of its Bitcoin ETF (iShares Bitcoin Trust), as its new CEO. This move triggered chatter on social media that the asset manager might change its stance. However, despite his BTC-friendliness at BlackRock, Ramji quickly poured water on the idea that he has intentions for Vanguard to offer its clientele trading access to any of the multiple spot Bitcoin products on the market. That being said, despite the asset management behemoth eschewing Bitcoin ETFs, it still has indirect exposure in the dominant cryptocurrency by market cap as it is presently the second-biggest institutional holder of MicroStrategy — the world’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin.

The latest breaking updates, delivered straight to your email inbox. CVS Health is planning to cut about 2,900 jobs in an effort to slash costs, the U.S. health care company said Tuesday. “We’ve embarked on a multi-year initiative to deliver $2 billion in cost savings by reducing expenses and investing in technologies to enhance how we work,” a spokesperson said in a statement. The layoffs represent less than 1% of CVS Health’s workforce. “Impacted positions are primarily corporate roles. The reductions will not impact front-line jobs in our stores, pharmacies and distribution centers,” the spokesperson added. The job cuts at the company, which runs a network of pharmacies across the United States among other businesses, add to the 5,000 or so layoffs disclosed last year. In 2021, CVS Health announced that it would close around 900 stores between 2022 and 2024. “Our industry faces continued disruption, regulatory pressures and evolving consumer needs and expectations,” the spokesperson said Tuesday. U.S. drug store chains are struggling because of falling reimbursement rates for prescription drugs, according to analysts who cover the industry. At the same time, the front end of drug stores, where snacks and household staples are sold, has become less profitable as shoppers buy more of these items online from Amazon and at big-box chains such as Walmart, Target and Costco. Dollar General’s growth has also hurt drug store chains in rural areas. CVS Health, which already uses artificial intelligence in some of its businesses, is making additional investments in the increasingly popular technology, as well as in robotics, “to further automate, reduce cost and improve the experience for all of its constituents,” according to its latest annual report.

Title: Major Bitcoin Miner CEO Reveals Unveils His Plan For AI
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/10/01/major-bitcoin-miner-ceo-reveals-unveils-his-plan-for-ai/

MARA CEO Fred Thiel thinks that retail investors are giving small competitors too much credit for artificial intelligence plays that will not pay off for years. He has a vision for his company that plays to its core strengths. Marathon CEO Fred Thiel is making a play for the AI market on his terms Fred Thiel is the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of MARA, bringing over 35 years of extensive experience in the technology sector. In this discussion we cover a wide range of issues including how Marathon is adapting to the wave of smaller miners gravitating towards artificial intelligence, what separates his firm from some of the other pure-play miners, and how U.S. politics and the upcoming presidential election will affect the outlook for the mining industry. Forbes: Can you give an overview of how you've tried to position Marathon Digital Holdings within the world of bitcoin mining? Fred Thiel: We look at ourselves as sitting at the point of convergence between energy transformation and digital infrastructure. From a bitcoin mining perspective, we're the largest of the publicly traded miners today, operating 13 sites across four continents. We use a variety of different technologies and we're the only one of the large bitcoin miners that has a fully vertically integrated tech stack. What that means is we operate our own mining pool, which is what orchestrates all our miners around the world and is the interface to the Bitcoin blockchain. All the other miners use third-party pools that are either Foundry, for example, or Chinese pools. We also operate our own firmware, which runs in miners and then we have developed and designed our own cooling infrastructure. We have single-phase and dual-phase liquid cooling, both of which don't use water, so that is totally water-free, and this is a really exciting area as we move into providing digital infrastructure to the AI industry because it's the exact same infrastructure that's used by both industries. The other thing that is unique is we cofounded a company called Auradine, which is the only U.S. bitcoin mining ASIC manufacturer. Their miners can support multiple chip failures and still run so they can operate in wider temperature ranges. So what does that all add up to? To me, it means as a miner we have access to technologies that not necessarily other miners do and we continue to press the envelope on deploying that technology. Our data center in Abu Dhabi, which is all liquid immersion cooling, is a preeminent site. There are two data centers, a total of 250 megawatts, that have 99.8% uptime running in a very harsh environment, which is obviously the Middle East desert next to a body of water. It's very humid so liquid cooling is the only way to go. Our strategy initially was one of being asset light. We focused on just growing rapidly by hosting with third parties. Then earlier this year we shifted to vertically integrating and we acquired 54% of our capacity’s infrastructure, and as we continue to grow in coming years that number will get closer and closer to 100%. We tripled our capacity in 2023, we'll double it again this year and we'll continue to grow at a pretty great rate. Lastly, we're the second largest holder of bitcoin of publicly traded companies in the U.S. and our strategic focus really is to amass as much bitcoin as we can. That's our core treasury asset and we do that through mining and also going into the markets and buying opportunistically when it makes sense. Forbes: What metrics do you pay the most attention to and how does the development and investment you detailed help give you a leg up on the pure bitcoin miners? Thiel: A couple of things. I talked about how we operate 13 sites on four continents. We don't have a concentration in a particular region or state. Riot Platforms is 100% concentrated in Texas today. They're trying to solve that by acquiring Bitfarms and then they've acquired another small site, I think in Kentucky. CleanSpark was heavily focused on Georgia. Now they're focusing on Kentucky as well. The challenge with being focused on just one area is you're very susceptible to your energy utility and energy market pricing in that region. In the case of Riot, they have the double whammy of two big sites in Texas and you have curtailment issues, weather issues and community issues, which in Texas are not small things. In the case of CleanSpark, they operate lots of very small sites. Operationally that is a very different issue because now you have to have people spread all over managing these disparate small sites and it may mean you don't have the opportunity to really aggregate the scale and get the benefits of scale in the same way. But Marathon is operating on different continents, so we also have the ability to avoid the risk of regulatory regime issues in the U.S. For example, in the Biden budget, there were attacks specifically on energy used by bitcoin mining. The Harris administration seems like they are befriending AI, but they are still going to be antagonistic to bitcoin mining. By the way, you can't give AI energy at one price and not give bitcoin mining energy at the same price. Not only would the industry attack that issue, but it's a type of commercial discrimination, which could be viewed as illegal. But more importantly, there is a huge symbiosis between AI and bitcoin mining because AI workloads vary just like demand on the grid varies and bitcoin miners have a unique ability to synchronize their load to AI miners loads such that you don't get this huge variance of demand on the grid. So when you marry bitcoin miners and AI operators together, you get a much better grid profile. You have the ability to stabilize the load, and you have an ability to use more of the intermittent energy—solar, wind—than AI can use. If you look at our technology piece, operating our own pool, it's very transparent to our investors; they can see every block that we win. By operating your own pool, you do a couple of things. One is you pay a pool operator a percentage of your winnings for them to operate the pool. It's 1% or 2% depending on the size of the miner; we don't have to do that. Then we have systems like Slipstream, a non-standard block submittal service that people in the Ordinals world really love. It allows us to get higher fees for submitting blocks to the network than the normal mempool would pay, so that gives us additional revenues on top of the traditional transaction fees that we get. We also have a Layer 2 called Anduro, which people are now starting to develop applications on. Forbes: Can you speak a little more about how Anduro is constructed? Thiel: It's a Bitcoin L2 that is essentially a clone of the Bitcoin network. It can process transactions much faster. It can do things that you can't really do as easily on the L1 of Bitcoin, but it anchors all its security, and it's pegged to the L1. You can, for example, do transactions in a much easier way than you can with lightning. Lightning requires you to open channels and close channels. This is a true sidechain, so you could build a digital identity network on it. You could build a MLS for real estate on it. You could build a transaction processing system for credit card remittances, whatever you may want to have. One of the applications that’s been built on it, which will be released soon, is called Alys, and Alys is a full EMV system from the Ethereum world that lets you take an application built for Ethereum and port it directly to Bitcoin. And then going back to our liquid cooling technology and the ASIC technology, we have technology advantages in that we can build miners specific to the use case. So in Finland for example, we have a small data center that heats 11,000 homes. How are we doing that? We're doing it through district heating by capturing heat from the miners. We have the ability to build custom miners for use cases. We recently made an investment in a company in San Diego, and what they do is they go in and they over-dimension solar systems for homes with solar panels and batteries and they use the excess capacity to mine bitcoin. Realize that solar energy has zero marginal cost, and so if you put 10 kilowatts of panels on a house versus six kilowatts of panels, the only difference in cost is the capital expenditure for the panels. Then all that extra energy can be used for bitcoin mining. More importantly, you can also heat water with the heat from the bitcoin miners. And what they do is they provision this and then they sell electricity to the consumer at 25% below market price. That fits into this model of the long tail of bitcoin mining, which is highly decentralized bitcoin mining, putting it out at the edge and leveraging zero-cost energy. So what you'll see from us over the next couple of years is a move towards the cost to mine being covered by services we're providing to the parties with which we’re partnered. That’s an obtuse way of saying we believe–and we're in the process of signing agreements with large partners–that people will pay us for the benefits of marrying bitcoin mining to different applications. And in doing so, our cost of energy will go towards zero. Forbes: Hash price continues to go down, and your stock price, along with other pure-play miners, has trailed that of Bitcoin and some of the other smaller miners that have made more direct overtures towards AI. What do you think of those things? Thiel: A couple of things. At the beginning of this year you started to see the shift from bitcoin miners to kind of MicroStrategy and the ETFs because of the coming halving. Any miner was suddenly going to produce half as much bitcoin, and so their costs were going to go up. Essentially, they'd be less profitable, so it's only logical to think that their market cap would be impacted. At the same time, MicroStrategy was out there buying $2 billion worth of bitcoin, and that became very attractive for people to do. The investment community–I'll go away from the retail side for a minute–the hedge funds, the volatility investors, love bitcoin mining because you get a lot more alpha than you did just by investing in bitcoin. It's the same reason Warren Buffett invested in gold miners versus gold because he likes the fact that when gold price runs up, gold miners’ cost to extract doesn't necessarily go up. The same generally holds with bitcoin miners. There's a six to nine-month lag as bitcoin price runs up before the cost to mine really starts jumping because the cost of mine is driven by either energy costs or global hash rate and the difficulty rate going up. And so if you have to go buy new capacity, buy new miners and deploy them, there's a six to nine month lag in that process. So you have this period of high profit when bitcoin price moves quickly. When bitcoin price does not move quickly, it moves sideways, buying spot bitcoin is much smarter and that also gives you an insight into our HODL strategy and why we go and buy bitcoin in the market sometimes. But MicroStrategy and Marathon and the other big miners have options that there's an options market. And so the ball players love it. They can do all sorts of very creative stuff and if you look at the stock prices, they tend to move pretty much in a pattern where they move up at the beginning of the week and down at the back half of the week. And that all has to do with selling calls and then buying back the calls after you short the stock. You can see very specific trading patterns for all the companies. The smaller guys were generally ignored previously, and now people have said the big guys are well-valued, and the smaller guys should be valued similarly on a per exhash basis. I think they're giving the small guys too much credit. Look at Cipher, they've signed up 350 megawatts of new stuff, but it's not going to come online for 12 to 18 months, yet the stock price goes up. So that's retail chasing that. Our investor makeup interestingly has changed this year in that in the first quarter we had about 39% institutional and now we're up closer to 60%. The institutional investors are seeing the value in our story because of how we position the transition to AI. I do not think that a miner like TerraWulf or Hut8 can go and build and operate a hosting center for AI very effectively. It is not the same thing as running a bitcoin mining site. Forbes: What is the investor makeup? Are these buy and hold investors? Thiel: Our single biggest shareholder today is BlackRock. They hold 13% to 14% of our shares, in both their managed and unmanaged funds. Same thing with Fidelity. You have basically BlackRock, Fidelity, Vanguard, and then some long list of others after that. But I think what we're certainly seeing when we're out talking to investors is the people who are starting to talk to us with interest are the ones who are looking at what we're doing around AI infrastructure and how that opportunity is very different from traditional bitcoin mining. Traditional bitcoin mining is a zero-sum game, and every four years, you get slapped in the face with a price increase effectively. As you start looking at digital infrastructure in the AI space, you now have the benefit of providing technology or services to these hyperscalers. The area we believe is most interesting is AI at the edge, which is all about inference. The inference marketplace is still two to three years from growing a lot because people are still busy building these LLMs [large language models]. If you read Sam Altman's white paper that he published recently, basically, his argument is you have to invest heavily in LLMs so that you have essentially something for inference to query. The way I put it is LLMs are the brain and inference is how you make money off of AI. Inference is the digital twin that is sitting in a factory, running a factory, and leveraging a model that sits up in the cloud, and the model is updated daily, sent back down to the edge, and it operates at the edge. There will be tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of these modular data centers that do inference at the edges spread all over the place. Forbes: Let’s talk more about the HODL strategy. You've hinted at some very strategic decisions that affect how you leverage your balance sheet when updating equipment and making investments versus procuring bitcoin on the spot market. Can you break that down a little more? Thiel: When you are investing in bitcoin mining, you are betting on the fact that you will be able to produce bitcoin at a lower cost than you could acquire it in the open marketplace. So if I'm going to spend $100 million dollars and buy bitcoin, I get that bitcoin tomorrow, and then I get the benefit of its price appreciation over the hold period, and let's just say I'm going to hold it for 36 months. If you assume it will go up 20%-plus a year, you have that price appreciation in the bitcoin, and your basis is today's price. If you are going to go into the mining business, your bet is I'm going to invest $100 million dollars in infrastructure that will likely go live in about 12 months on average. It could be shorter if you're buying an existing site that's running and you're just going to replace the miners. And so you need to over the following 24 months, mine not just as much bitcoin as you acquired where you bought the bitcoin today, but enough bitcoin so you're also covering your cost of power, etc., such that at the end of the period of time you end up with more dollar value of bitcoin than you did just by buying it today. What that requires is a belief in what the price of bitcoin is going to do in the long term. And so when we have access to capital, there are times when we will choose to go into the market and buy bitcoin versus invest it in adding more mining capacity because sometimes there's a lag in how long it takes for us to deploy the capital when we're adding mining capacity. Forbes: You recently met with Donald Trump. Can you share your experiences or takeaways from that round table? Thiel: Former President Trump has been very well briefed and understands the value proposition that bitcoin provides to the U.S. as a country and the opportunity that bitcoin mining provides for the U.S. to be the dominant player in processing bitcoin transactions and securing the bitcoin blockchain. It's a little bit like the gold reserves the U.S. holds. The U.S. holds 40% of the gold reserves of the world because in the event there was ever an attack on the U.S. dollar, you have the gold reserves that you can use. The U.S. also happens to have custody of the majority of other countries’ gold. As you know, Russia got on the wrong side of that with the sanctions program. Many nations have figured out that with the weaponization of the dollar, they need to be able to hold assets in something other than the dollar. So they're now evaluating holding things in amongst other things, bitcoin as well as gold and other assets. And not that they will hold all their reserves in bitcoin, but they may decide to hold somewhere between 1% to 10%, depending on the country and their risk profile. I don't think the Saudis, if you were to talk to them, would say that they consider the rupee, the ruble or some of these other currencies as good reserve assets, and so they're still going to put their faith in the dollar. But they want to have a hedge, and they want to have something that provides a risk-adjusted return potentially better than just placing their money in dollar assets because a lot of the countries today outside of the U.S. are being very cautious about their buying of Treasury bills, for example. The sixth largest buyer of Treasury bills today is Tether [according to Investopedia]. It's not a country. It's a stablecoin. So what you're starting to see is people who want to have dollar-denominated stablecoins end up being the biggest holders of Treasury bills. Then you have to look at bonds and who wants to hold those? The Chinese certainly aren't buying them anymore nor are a lot of other countries. So if a sovereign is going to hold bitcoin, then the sovereign has to be guaranteed that they can transact it. Because if all bitcoin mining happens in the U.S. or the U.S. has a significant amount of bitcoin mining going on, then the U.S., in theory, could sanction a country by forcing U.S. bitcoin miners through legal regulation to not mine certain transactions because they're on OFAC sanction lists, for example. That could restrict somebody from transacting where, let's just say you had 60% of mining in the U.S., well, six out of 10 blocks, meaning somebody would only be able to transact in four out of any 10 blocks. That happens, and if you've got enough countries in the world to go against one country, you could potentially almost block them out. So sovereigns who are going to hold bitcoin have a need to have mining in their country. Bhutan is a great example. Bhutan holds $1 billion of bitcoin. They also have a lot of mining in their country. El Salvador now has stated that they no longer need third-party debt because they mine and hold bitcoin. So the U.S. should hold bitcoin just like they hold gold, and the U.S. should ensure that a certain percentage of the global hashrate comes from the U.S. so that all the bitcoin held in the U.S. by ETFs and these other funds can be transacted if need be. Forbes: Trump has said that he would like to see all remaining bitcoin mined in the U.S. That might be just politicking more than a serious policy statement, but I'm interested in your thoughts, given what you just mentioned. Thiel: I'm not going to put words in his mouth, but I think he views it as strategic importance for the U.S. to be a dominant player in bitcoin mining. And I think sometimes when he says dominant, he'll say, we have to be the end all. He wants that in the way of bitcoin mining and in the U.S. holding bitcoin reserves just like the gold aspect. You've seen him recently talk about if the U.S. were to hold a lot of bitcoin it could potentially appreciate to a point that it could pay for part of the debt or even all the debt. Representative Paulina Luna, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and others are all believers in these programs. We think it's certainly a very wise choice because there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin. So it's just a question of who will own them over what period of time. Being shareholders in and having cofounded the only U.S. ASIC manufacturer for bitcoin mining, we’re certainly big believers in bitcoin miners made in the USA. You could argue that Chinese companies make 75% of the bitcoin miners made in the world today. I'm not saying that they're trying to do anything bad, but it does provide them an ability to essentially somewhat control the supply and the pricing of bitcoin miners. Forbes: That concentration can be dangerous in anything. Thiel: Exactly. So that's why we're big advocates. Regardless of who wins the presidential election, there may be opportunities to do something about that from a tariff perspective. Forbes: Have you had any interactions with the Harris campaign? Thiel: We have talked with the head of the DNC. We have talked with all sorts of senators and the Harris team does not want to engage with us. They have engaged with the AI industry. My belief is that, unfortunately, Senator Warren and her anti-crypto army have a fairly strong lock on some of the policy decisions that the Harris team is evaluating. Certainly, President Biden wanted to apply a tax to bitcoin mining as part of his budget. Part of this is they just don't understand the environmental benefit that bitcoin mining brings and the fact that it does not add additional fossil fuel requirements, it actually helps subsidize the renewable energy side of the world. And if they understood that, I think they would be willing to listen. But there are many forces rallied against us for political reasons on that side of the aisle that I wish didn't exist. Forbes: When did you start imprinting “made in the USA” in the blocks that you mine and why did you do that? Thiel: It was around the 4th of July [actual date was July 31]. It's a way for people to know if that block is mined in the U.S. or if it was mined offshore. Offshore entities control the majority of bitcoin pools. We're one of the few bitcoin pools that is not. We believe some people prefer transacting and putting their transactions into blocks that are mined in the U.S. Forbes: Are you ever worried that there could be a certain premium on bitcoins mined in the U.S. versus those elsewhere? Could that potentially impact the fungibility of any of these assets? Thiel: If you filter on OFAC, that doesn't impact the fungibility because you're not filtering bitcoins; you’re filtering wallets. How to look at it is somebody's bank account is on an OFAC list. The dollars in the bank account are on the list. It's the account, so the account can't transact. It's not that the bitcoin it holds is tainted. You may remember back in 2021, when we launched our pool, it originally had OFAC filtering turned on. Forbes: You’ve mentioned in the past that mining of Kaspa is a way to diversify. How much Kaspa do you have and are you continuing to mine it? Thiel: We continue to mine kaspa. We've grown our capacity a handful of times since we first announced that we were doing it. It's dissimilar from bitcoin in that it's a much smaller market cap and pool of liquidity. And so you can't just add exahashes and grow. You have to be very careful because there isn't a lot of liquidity compared to bitcoin. We mine enough so that we are not an overwhelming amount of the hashrate on the Kaspa network, but it is more profitable to mine than bitcoin on a per kilowatt hour basis. So if I invest a kilowatt of energy towards bitcoin, my profit using S21s could be anywhere from 5 to 8 cents depending on my cost of energy per kilowatt hour. In the case of kaspa, it's anywhere from 35 cents to a dollar. I can take kaspa, I can sell it and I can buy bitcoin or hold it. Kaspa has had some very strong price appreciation lately. So we've had a HODL strategy around some of the kaspa. Forbes: I published a list of what we called crypto billion dollar zombies in the magazine in March. Kaspa was mentioned as one of them. We saw the mining and we know it's similar to bitcoin, but it's hard to ascertain real discernible use for it beyond just people mining it and then sending it back and forth. Any more thoughts about Kaspa you'd like to share? Thiel: Kaspa as a technology is very interesting. It is a webchain versus a blockchain. It's web of blocks versus a linear line of blocks, and Kaspa has a very fast transaction speed. It also has a very high emissions decline. So it goes from emitting a lot of kaspa at the front end and then that subsidy drops very rapidly down. And so kaspa mining will likely not be a long-term business, but as long as we can mine it profitably and there's a good liquid market for it, then we just view it as a great source of revenues. Forbes: Is there anything I didn't ask you that’s at the top of your mind you'd like to share? Thiel: One thing that could be of interest to readers is that one of the primary drivers for the hashrate growth has been the upgrade cycle. If you take 30 watt per terrahash machines and replace them with 15 watt per terrahash machines, you just double your hashrate. Now that the upgrade cycle is finished, we’re entering a phase where people have to add actual capacity. I think you're still going to see global hashrate inching up, but you won't see the step function change that you saw. In 2023 hashrate doubled, then we had a halving in early 2024, and then you had all this hashrate come online [later]. We‘re pushing 700 exahash today. I think if anything, what you're going to see is bitcoin is going to continue to push sideways. We're seeing an institutionalization of bitcoin–ETFs have come on board; you now can do options on ETFs; you now have Morgan Stanley's 15,000 wealth advisors soliciting for bitcoin. We're still in the early days of this and you're now going to have hopefully the repeal or the reversal or the number of exemptions to SAB121, and you're going to see banks being able to custody bitcoin in addition to BNY Mellon, which means you can then start doing leverage, etc. You're going to build a lot of liquidity. With all those, what should be demand drivers? You still see institutional buyers sniping to buy bitcoin. They're sitting on the sidelines. They wait for a dip and they buy a dip. They are not in the market hurrying up, forcing the price up. So until there is a catalyst that drives the price of bitcoin up and maybe the election is the catalyst, I don't think we're going to see bitcoin price move up dramatically. Forbes: Thank you.

Background of international currency notes. Closed-end funds (CEFs), with an average yield of around 8%, are terrific for just about any investor—especially those looking to their portfolios to help pay the bills. Heck, even if you’re not leaning on your CEFs for income, those big payouts are gold—you just reinvest them to boost your portfolio’s value and book an even bigger income stream going forward. But of course, not all CEFs are great investments, with some best avoided unless they trade at big discounts to net asset value, or NAV, the key indicator of value for these funds. And sometimes even a great fund isn’t the best one to buy, despite a big yield and an impressive record. That’s the situation with two CEFs that many income investors love: the Eaton Vance Tax-Advantaged Global Dividend Income Fund (ETG) and Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK). Both have their merits, starting with their payouts: ETG yields 8.1% and STK pays a solid 5.6% as I write this.

Eaton Vance Tax-Advantaged Global Dividend Income Fund 2Q2024 fact sheet This level of diversification gives ETG an edge because it spreads risk across the global economy, insulating the fund from the volatility of any single sector or from another big turn in the US stock market. And the roughly 12% of the portfolio in fixed-income investments (mainly investment-grade bonds) adds even more ballast. It helps support that big dividend, too. Now let’s switch over to STK, whose portfolio is in many ways the opposite: Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund June 30, 2024, fact sheet You can clearly see that almost all of the categories in the table above are tech-related. The fund’s top holdings read like a who’s who of the tech elite and include Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO) and Lam Research Corp. (LRCX). These are all great companies, but when tech hits a rough patch, STK feels the brunt of it. NVIDIA’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is now over 70, highlights the risk here, reflecting how pricey some of these stocks are. When tech goes up, STK soars—but when tech stumbles, like it has recently, STK’s performance suffers. Then there’s the volatility. Don’t get me wrong. STK has performed strongly over the long term, with a five-year annualized return of 17.6%. But the flipside is clear: This is a high-risk, high-reward play. That’s not ideal for income-focused investors looking for steady, reliable payouts—especially when we look at the price you’ll pay for STK now. As I write this, ETG trades at a 10.4% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio), so you can buy its portfolio for quite a bit less than it’s worth. This kind of deal is what we love to see in CEFs—it sets you up for upside and provides a margin of safety in case the market wobbles (since the fund is already cheap, it’s harder for it to get a lot cheaper). In contrast, STK trades at a slight premium to NAV. In other words, you’re paying more for a portfolio of tech stocks that’s already trading at higher prices. With the tech sector well-known for its volatility, paying a premium doesn’t make sense, especially when we can get ETG at a discount and lock in a higher yield at the same time. Over the past decade, ETG has proven itself as a steady performer, delivering a 9.1% annualized return. That’s impressive, especially for a diversified income fund that’s built to withstand the market’s ups and downs. ETG’s ability to provide consistent returns across various sectors gives it an edge when the market gets choppy. And choppiness is very much on the table after 2024’s outsized stock-market gains, especially in the tech sector. This also means STK is like a rollercoaster just at the top of a peak. Sure, its annualized return of 17.6% over the last five years looks fantastic on paper, but that’s largely because it’s been riding the wave of tech’s explosive growth. While STK has a portfolio perfect for those willing to ride the tech waves, ETG is simply the better buy for income investors now. Its 8.1% yield, combined with a double-digit discount to NAV and a diversified portfolio, make it a safer, more consistent play for those of us who prefer to sleep soundly at night while collecting reliable dividends.

Title: Vaginal Tritrichomonas foetus infection in mice as an in vivo model for drug development against Trichomonas vaginalis

Full Content:
Trichomonas vaginalis is the causative agent of the common sexually transmitted disease, trichomoniasis, which affects more than a hundred million people worldwide. Metronidazole and tinidazole, agents belonging to the 5-nitroheterocyclic class of antimicrobials, are most often used to treat infection, but increased resistance has been reported and adverse effects of these drugs can be significant. Consequently, an urgent need exists for the development of novel drug entities against trichomoniasis. Critical for antimicrobial drug development is the demonstration of in vivo efficacy. Murine models of vaginal T. vaginalis infection are unreliable for unknown reasons. Meanwhile, murine infections with the related bovine pathogen, Tritrichomonas foetus, tend to be more robust, although susceptibility to different antimicrobials might differ from T. vaginalis. Here, we explored the utility of T. foetus infection as a surrogate model for drug development against T. vaginalis. Four different T. foetus strains caused robust vaginal infection in young mice, while none of four diverse T. vaginalis strains did. Comparison of drug susceptibility profiles revealed that T. foetus and T. vaginalis were similarly susceptible to a range of 5-nitroheterocyclic and gold(I) compounds. By comparison, proteasome inhibitors were 10- to 15-fold less active against T. foetus than T. vaginalis, although one of the proteasome inhibitors, bortezomib, had low micromolar activity or better against multiple strains of both trichomonads. Different strains of T. foetus were used to demonstrate the utility of the murine vaginal infection models for in vivo efficacy testing, including for bortezomib and a gold(I) compound. The differences in susceptibility to proteasome inhibitors may be partially explained by differences in the proteasome subunit sequences between the two trichomonads, although the functional relevance of the proteasome was similar in both organisms. These findings indicate that T. foetus can serve as a reliable surrogate model for T. vaginalis in vitro and in murine infections in vivo, but caution must be exercised for specific drug classes with targets, such as the proteasome, that may display genetic divergence between the trichomonads.

Trichomoniasis, caused by infection with the protozoan parasite Trichomonas vaginalis, is the most common, non-viral sexually transmitted disease in the world with a global incidence of ~156 million, and a global prevalence of 5.4% [1]. The parasite can infect different genitourinary tissues, including the urethra, vagina, and cervix of women, and the prostate and urethra of men [2]. Infected women can experience a broad range of symptoms, including abnormal vaginal discharge, odor, and itching, vulvar or vaginal erythema, and colpitis macularis (“strawberry cervix”) [3]. Many women remain infected for extended periods [3]. Infection in men can lead to mild to moderate urethral discharge and urethral inflammation, but symptoms tend to be less severe than in women [1, 4]. The global prevalence of T. vaginalis infection is almost 10 times lower in men compared to women [1], which may reflect a lack of testing due to milder infection symptoms or could be related to an abbreviated course of infection. Nonetheless, lack of symptoms does not protect an individual from the complications associated with infection. For example, T. vaginalis infection can increase susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection by 50% [5]. Furthermore, a positive correlation between HIV infection and trichomoniasis symptom severity was found in men [6]. In women, infection has also been linked to an increased risk of cervical cancer, low infant birth weight, preterm birth, and stillbirths [7, 8]. In men, a decrease in sperm viability and motility has been observed with the risk to decrease fertility [9]. To avoid potential complications, it is important to treat infection upon diagnosis, particularly since infection can last for months to years [10]. Metronidazole and tinidazole are two antimicrobials currently FDA-approved for the treatment of trichomoniasis [11]. They belong to the class of 5-nitroheterocyclic drugs. Metronidazole, first developed in 1959, is the primary drug for trichomoniasis treatment worldwide [12]. Tinidazole, a structural derivative of metronidazole, was FDA-approved for trichomoniasis treatment in 2004 [11]. Both are prodrugs that must be reduced to a free radical inside microbial cells before they can covalently bind to multiple protein and nucleic acid targets. Adduct formation leads to inhibition of DNA synthesis and many vital protein functions, eventually killing the organism. Both drugs primarily target anaerobic microorganisms, including T. vaginalis, as these organisms possess enzymatic pathways with low enough redox potential to donate electrons to the drug molecules [12]. For metronidazole, cure rates range from 86–97% [13–15]. Despite its general effectiveness, an estimated 2–10% of all clinical trichomoniasis cases are caused by strains that display resistance to metronidazole and other 5-nitroheterocyclic drugs [16–18]. Beyond loss of efficacy due to resistance, metronidazole can have significant adverse effects that compromise its use and effectiveness. Thus, a large percentage of women treated with the drug have reported nausea, vomiting, unpleasant taste, diarrhea, headache, vaginal irritation, and yeast infections [19, 20]. Currently no other drug classes are FDA-approved to treat trichomoniasis. With the threat of growing resistance, and significant adverse effects, development of alternative antimicrobials in other drug classes remains urgent for treatment of trichomoniasis. Library screens of approved FDA drugs and drug candidates have been done to identify new activities against T. vaginalis but have not resulted in promising candidates [21]. De novo drug design against unexploited targets is currently the most realistic strategy for development of new antitrichomonal agents. One such strategy is exemplified by proteasome inhibitors [22]. The proteasome is an enzymatic complex present in all eukaryotic and some prokaryotic cells, whose function is to degrade and recycle proteins that are misfolded or not needed [23]. The enzyme complex consists of a barrel-like structure, consisting of two pairs of rings with seven α-subunits and seven β-subunits. Peptide substrates are fed through the center of the barrel where they are cleaved into smaller fragments. Three of the 14 proteasome subunits are catalytically active: β1 (caspase-like), β2 (trypsin-like), and β5 (chymotrypsin-like). Each cleaves the substrate at its preferred site via hydrolysis [24]. Proteasome inhibitors were first developed as anti-inflammatory agents and as novel agents for cancer treatment [25]. For example, the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, was FDA-approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. More recently, proteasome inhibitors have also been found to be effective against Plasmodium falciparum, the protozoan responsible for malaria [26]. Importantly, several new proteasome inhibitors were shown to be highly selective for the parasite over human cells [27]. T. vaginalis also possess a proteasome that can be targeted for the development of new agents against the parasite, since several proteasome inhibitors were active against the parasite in vitro and have selectivity over human cells [22]. Critical for antimicrobial drug development is the demonstration of in vivo efficacy. Ideally, animal models of infection can be used that employ the very same pathogens that infect humans. In the case of trichomoniasis, several reports have shown that mice can be infected vaginally with T. vaginalis [28–30], but infections tend to be tenuous and unreliable for poorly understood reasons. As an alternative, mouse infection models with surrogate trichomonad pathogens can be used if it can be shown that those infections are robust, and the pathogens respond to antimicrobial candidates in similar ways to the human target pathogen. For example, vaginal infection of mice with the bovine pathogen, Tritrichomonas foetus, have been shown to cause sustained infection [28]. T. foetus is a protozoan parasite that causes tritrichomoniasis in cattle, a similar disease to human trichomoniasis. The parasite is closely related to T. vaginalis, being in the same phylum [31]. Despite its promise, the broader utility of this model for drug development against T. vaginalis remains to be established. Therefore, the aims of this study were to establish infectious characteristics in mice, similarities in in vitro drug responses, structural target similarities of a set of T. foetus strains in relation to T. vaginalis and establish the overall utility and limits of the murine T. foetus model as a basis for current and future drug development against T. vaginalis. T. foetus strains 003 (ATCC 30003), 166 (ATCC 30166), 232 (ATCC 30232), 924 (ATCC 30924), and T. vaginalis strain G3 (ATCC PRA-98) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). T. vaginalis strains R88, MSA1172, S520 and S1489 were kindly provided by Dr. William Secor (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, GA). T. foetus strain D1 and T. vaginalis strain F1623 were described in prior studies [32, 33]. Trichomonads were grown in trypticase-yeast extract-maltose (TYM) medium, supplemented with 10% horse serum (Omega), 0.74% ammonium iron (II) sulfate hexahydrate (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich), and adjusted to pH 6.2. Cultures were grown axenically at 37°C under anaerobic conditions. The following 5-nitro heterocyclic were purchased commercially (molecular masses in parentheses): Metronidazole (171 Da; Sigma-Aldrich), ronidazole (200 Da; APExBIO), tinidazole (247 Da; TCI America), nitazoxanide (307 Da; AdipoGen), and nithiamide (187 Da; MedChemExpress). The following gold(I) compounds (CPD), whose naming follows our prior usage [34], were also purchased: Auranofin (679 Da; Enzo Life Sciences), (Tri-n-ethylphosphine)gold(I) chloride (351 Da, CPD4; Sigma-Aldrich), (Tri-n-methylphosphine)gold(I) chloride (309 Da, CPD10; Sigma-Aldrich) and myochrysine (390 Da; Sigma-Aldrich). The following gold(I) compounds were synthesized and characterized as described previously [34]: (Tri-n-propylphosphine)gold(I) chloride (357 Da, CPD11), (Triisopropylphosphine)gold(I) chloride (357 Da, CPD12), Bis(triethylphosphine)gold(I) chloride (433 Da, CPD14), and Bis(tri-n-propylphosphine)gold (I) chloride (517 Da, CPD15). The proteasome inhibitors bortezomib (384 Da), ixazomib (361 Da) and carfilzomib (720 Da) were obtained from MedChemExpress. The benzimidazole compounds lansoprazole (369 Da), omeprazole (345 Da), albendazole (281 Da) and fenbendazole (299 Da) were also obtained from MedChemExpress. Pantoprazole (383 Da) was purchased from APExBIO and disulfiram (297 Da) from TCI America. BALB/cJ mice (obtained from The Jackson Laboratory) were bred in-house. Female mice were used within one week of weaning at 3–6 weeks of age. Groups of mice were housed in single plastic cages with free access to feed and water. The study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was approved by the University of California San Diego Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol Number: S00205). Mice were handled with care, only by research staff fully trained in animal handling, at all times to minimize distress. Mouse health was monitored daily, as well as each time a sample was taken. Vaginal trichomonad infections in mice cause no pain, distress, or suffering, obviating any need for humane endpoints. Experimental endpoints were based solely on the infectious dynamics relative to the study objectives of assessing drug effects on infectious load. All animals were euthanized on the last day of sample collection by controlled CO2 inhalation, followed by cervical dislocation. Infections were performed with different strains of either T. vaginalis or T. foetus as indicated under the specific experiments in the figures. Trichomonads were cultured overnight, centrifuged, and resuspended at a density of 2 x 108 trophozoites/mL. For all in vitro and in vivo experiments, numbers of viable trophozoites were determined under a phase-contrast microscope. Viability was >95% as assessed by observation of the characteristic parasite motility. Five μL of the parasite suspension (containing 106 trophozoites) were slowly administered intravaginally to mice with a 20 μL micropipette. Mice were held briefly upside-down after agent administration to minimize leakage. In select experiments (as indicated in the figure legends), mice were pretreated one day before infection with one of following pretreatment regimens: a) 5 μL intravaginal administration of 10 mg/mL ammonium iron (III) citrate (Sigma-Aldrich); b) 100 μL intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 10 mg/mL ammonium iron (III) citrate; c) 100 μL i.p. injection of 4 mg/mL 17β-estradiol (Sigma-Aldrich); or d) 100 μL i.p. injection of 4 mg/mL 17β-estradiol (Sigma-Aldrich) and 100 μL i.p. injection of 1 mg/ml dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich). The ammonium iron (III) citrate solution for intravaginal administration was made in PBS containing 1% hypromellose, while all formulation for i.p. injections were prepared in PBS. Control mice received no pretreatment. For drug efficacy tests in vivo, suspensions of bortezomib or gold (I) CPD4 were prepared at 10 mg/mL (= 1% w/v) in 0.2% hypromellose in PBS. Hypromellose solution without drugs was used as a control. Five μL of the drug suspensions (containing 0.05 mg of drug) were administered intravaginally as outlined above for the parasite inoculations. A total of five doses were administered: One dose on day 1 after infection, two doses each on days 2 and 3 after infection with 6–8 h between treatments on those days. Infectious load was determined 3–4 days after infection for all experiments except for a time course study with T. foetus strain 232, where mice were sampled on days 1, 3, 6, and 9. For assessment of infection, mice were lavaged intravaginally by slowly dispensing 30 μL of TYM medium into the vagina, taking it up again, and repeating the process two more times. The washes were diluted to 120 μL in TYM medium, and 10 μL of the diluted washes were placed into a hemocytometer for counting of motile trophozoites under a phase-contrast microscope. Infectious load is expressed as total number of trophozoites per mouse. For washes without countable trophozoites, the remaining volume was cultured in 2 mL of TYM medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin for five days at 37°C, and regularly monitored for cell growth. Drug stocks were prepared as 10 mM solutions in DMSO. A 75 μM working stock was prepared in PBS and 1:3 serial dilutions were made in TYM medium in 96-well plates (post-dilution volume 40 μL/well). Parasite cultures were grown overnight in a 15 mL tube, centrifuged and resuspended to a density of 7 x 105–2 x 106 trophozoites/mL. Ten μL of this suspension were added into each well (final culture volume 50 μL/well), resulting in a final number of 7,000–20,000 trophozoites per well and final drug concentrations from 20 μM to 1 nM. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours under anaerobic conditions (AnaeroPack; Mitsubishi Gas Chemical). Viable cell numbers were determined with a luciferase-based ATP assay (Promega) [35]. Luminescence was measured with the SpectraMax M2e plate reader, using the SoftMax Pro program (version 7.0.3). To assay the minimum lethal concentration (MLC), drugs were added to 96-well plates, and serially 2-fold diluted in TYM medium. Parasites were added to each well at a density of 7 x 105/mL (T. foetus D1) or 106 trophozoites/mL (T. vaginalis R88), resulting in a final number of 28,000 or 40,000 trophozoites per well, respectively. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours under anaerobic conditions. Cultures (200 μL) were then transferred to medium-filled 15 mL tubes (representing a 1:75 dilution of the overnight culture to ensure adequate dilution of the drugs in those cultures) and kept at 37°C for a maximum of five days for observation of any cell growth indicative of survivors of the initial drug exposure. For sequence analysis of proteasome subunits, the genome and proteome sequences of the following parasite strains were used: T. foetus CC09-1 (GenBank AIF54491–504), T. vaginalis G3 (BioProject PRJNA938429, PRJNA16084) and P. falciparum NF54 (BioProject PRJNA422809), along with that of humans (BioProject PRJNA807723) and mice (BioProject PRJNA169). A phylogenetic tree was generated using MEGA software (version 11.0.13). Support values were calculated by bootstrapping with 100 replications. Protein sequences were aligned with the MUSCLE algorithm and an unrooted tree was constructed using the Le Gascuel model, with gamma distribution and invariant sites. Gaps were partially deleted, so that sites with missing data were only removed when necessary. Proteasome subunit designation followed the findings in [36]. For immunoblotting, T. foetus D1 and T. vaginalis F1623 cultures were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour with 0.3 μM or 3 μM of bortezomib, or with DMSO as a control. Lysates were made with radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) buffer (Cell Signaling Technology), supplemented with Halt protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific). Proteins were separated on a 4–20% SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad), transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore) and blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk. The membrane was incubated with a primary rabbit anti-ubiquitin polyclonal antibody (Proteintech, Cat No. 10201-2-AP) at a 1:10,000 dilution overnight and a secondary horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Cat No. 7074S) at a 1:20,000 dilution for 30 minutes. Proteins were detected with a chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Millipore). For labeling of catalytically active proteasome subunits with an activity-based probe, total cell lysates of T. foetus D1 or T. vaginalis F1623 were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour with 0.1–10 μM of bortezomib, or with DMSO as a control. Afterwards, 2 μM of the fluorescent proteasome probe, MV151 (R&D Systems, Cat No. I-190) [37] was added and lysates were further incubated at 37°C for 2 hours. Proteins were separated on a 4–20% SDS-PAGE gel, and bands were visualized by fluorescent imaging with excitation at 470 nm and emission at 530 nm. All statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism (version 10.0.0). For compound activity screening, luminescence values were normalized against drug-free controls and plotted against the log drug concentration in each well to create a concentration-response curve for each drug. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50), or concentration of drug needed to inhibit trophozoite growth and viability by 50%, and negative log10 of the IC50 (pIC50) were calculated. The assay sensitivity for pIC50 was set at 4.7, equivalent to the highest drug concentration tested in the assays. Each experiment was independently repeated three times per compound and per trichomonad strain. For in vitro data comparisons, parametric tests (ANOVA, t-tests) were used. For comparison of multiple groups, a one-way ANOVA was performed, and if a significant difference was found, Tukey’s multiple comparisons test was applied to specific pairs. For in vivo data comparisons, a non-parametric Mann-Whitney test was used. Previous studies had suggested that murine vaginal infections with T. vaginalis are characterized by low infectivity and/or short-lived infections, even with various manipulations of the host designed to increase susceptibility [28]. It is possible that marginal infectivity is related to the particular strains of T. vaginalis used for the infections, so we tested a range of four diverse strains of T. vaginalis for their ability to cause vaginal infection in young female mice. Three to four days after intravaginal inoculation, vaginal washes showed no detectable trophozoite counts for any of the tested strains (Fig 1A). Cultures of the washes for up to 5 days were uniformly negative, underlining that none of the T. vaginalis strains led to even low-level infection (Fig 1A). Furthermore, systemic (i.p.) or topical (vaginal) administration of iron, which improves T. vaginalis growth in culture [38], or systemic administration of estrogen alone or estrogen plus dexamethasone, which have been suggested to improve susceptibility of mice to T. vaginalis infection [28, 39], did not promote infectivity (Fig 1B). These experiments suggest that T. vaginalis could not infect mice under any of our current conditions, regardless of particular strains or conditioning regimens. Young (3–4 weeks) female BALB/cJ mice were intravaginally inoculated with the indicated strains of T. vaginalis (A, B) or T. foetus (C, D). In the experiments in panel B, mice were pretreated by vaginal instillation (topical) of iron or intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of iron, estrogen, or estrogen and dexamethasone (dex) before infection, at dosages detailed in the Methods. Vaginal lavages were taken on day 3 or 4 of infection (A-C) or on the indicated days (D), and motile trophozoites were counted in a hemocytometer. Data points represent counts from individual mice, dashed lines indicate the detection threshold of the assays, and red diamonds show geometric means. For select samples without countable trophozoites, lavages were cultured in trichomonad growth medium with antibiotics (blue symbols). Positive cultures are indicated by solid blue dots, while negative cultures (no growth) are depicted by open blue dots.

Four different T. foetus strains were obtained and tested for their vaginal infectivity in young female mice. All four strains were able to cause infection without any pre-treatment with infectivity close to 100% (i.e., the percentage of mice with trophozoites detectable by direct counting or culture over total number of inoculated mice) (Fig 1C). To examine the time course of infection, we selected the T. foetus strain 232, which had the highest infectivity and/or highest trophozoite loads, and sampled mice every 2–3 days. All mice remained infected throughout the 9 days of the experiment, indicating a lack of spontaneous clearance during that period (Fig 1D). These findings demonstrate that T. foetus constitutes a more reliable murine model of vaginal trichomonad infection than T. vaginalis. To explore potential reasons for the differential murine vaginal infectivity of T. vaginalis and T. foetus, we examined two parasite characteristics that may plausibly be involved: maximal growth rate and tolerance to different pH environments. The T. vaginalis strains had significantly slower growth rates in culture with longer doubling times compared to the T. foetus strains despite optimal growth conditions and media (Fig 2A). Furthermore, T. vaginalis growth was inhibited by even modestly alkaline pH in vitro, while T. foetus was able to grow mostly unhindered under these conditions (Fig 2B). These data indicate that the intrinsic properties of the two trichomonad species exhibit significant differences in regard to growth and pH tolerance. Trophozoites of the indicated strains were cultured in vitro in trypticase-yeast extract-maltose (TYM) medium. (A) Cell numbers were counted before and after a 24-hour time incubation period and doubling times were calculated. Data are mean ± SE; *p<0.05 (unpaired t-test for all T. vaginalis strains vs. all T. foetus strains). (B) Media were adjusted to the indicated pH and trophozoites were grown in each medium for 24 hours and counted. Data are mean ± SE.

Data are mean ± SE. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.g002 To test whether the differential pH sensitivity of the trichomonad strains might be responsible for their differential infectivity in vivo, we measured the vaginal pH in 3–6 week old mice before and after treatment with estrogen alone or with estrogen and dexamethasone [28]. Mean vaginal pH was 6.21 ± 0.04 in the untreated group (mean ± SE, n = 7 mice), 6.49 ± 0.09 for the estrogen-treated group (n = 7), and 6.71 ± 0.05 for the mice treated with estrogen and dexamethasone (n = 9). A Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn’s multiple comparisons test showed significance between the estrogen and dexamethasone versus the no treatment group. However, these data show that the vaginal pH was below 7.0 in all groups, thereby excluding differential pH tolerance as a possible explanation for the differential murine vaginal infectivity of T. vaginalis vs T. foetus. To compare susceptibility to antimicrobial drugs between the two trichomonad species, we screened different strains against four major drug classes that are clinically used in trichomoniasis or have been shown to have significant in vitro activity against T. vaginalis: 5-nitroheterocyclic drugs [41], gold(I) compounds [34], proteasome inhibitors [22], and benzimidazoles [21]. The most consistently active compounds were 5-nitroheterocyclic compounds and gold(I) compounds (S1 Table). By comparison, the tested proteasome inhibitors had excellent activity against the T. vaginalis strains but were significantly less potent against the T. foetus strains (S1 Table). The benzimidazoles and another compound with reported in vitro activity against T. vaginalis, disulfiram [21], had only minimal or no activity against either T. foetus or T. vaginalis (S1 Table). Comparison of specific drugs within the three major drug classes with the greatest potencies revealed that all tested drugs were less active in T. foetus, although differences were observed between the drug classes (Fig 3). 5-Nitroheterocyclic drugs and gold(I) drugs displayed, on average, a ~3-fold lower activity (mean ΔpIC50 = 0.47–0.48) in the T. foetus strains compared to the T. vaginalis strains, but this difference did not reach statistical significance (Fig 3). By comparison, the tested proteasome inhibitors were ~14-fold less active (mean ΔpIC50 = 1.15) against T. foetus relative to T. vaginalis, which was statistically significant (Fig 3). Activity (pIC50) of the indicated compounds from each of the indicated three drug classes against multiple strains of T. foetus and T. vaginalis was determined by 24 h growth and survival assay (the detailed data are provided in S1 Table). Each point represents the mean pIC50 of four (T. foetus) or three (T. vaginalis) different strains for the drugs listed below each graph. ΔpIC50 was calculated for each drug class by subtracting the mean T. foetus pIC50s from the mean T. vaginalis pIC50s. Red lines represent geometric means. Significance was calculated with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (*p <0.01).

Significance was calculated with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (*p <0.01). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.g003 Pairwise comparisons of strains were conducted to discover whether any individual T. foetus strain had similar drug susceptibility profiles to any of the T. vaginalis strains. Strong positive correlations were seen among the different T. foetus strains for all three major drug classes (Fig 4A, Table 1). In contrast, only modest average correlations were observed between strains of T. foetus vs. T. vaginalis (Table 1), which particularly affected the proteasome inhibitors and gold(I) compounds (Fig 4B). This might be partially explained by the only modest average correlations of drug susceptibilities among the different T. vaginalis strains (Table 1). In particular, the T. vaginalis strain S1489 displayed a very different drug susceptibility profile than the other T. vaginalis strains (Fig 4C, Table 1), thereby markedly skewing the correlation data for both T. vaginalis and T. foetus (Table 1). The graphs show correlations of the pIC50 values for individual drugs between the indicated pairs of trichomonad strains (the detailed data on drug activities used for these analyses are provided in S1 Table). Each point represents one drug and is color-coded by drug class. Plots are shown with a linear regression line (black) and line of identity (dotted red).

To further characterize antimicrobial drug activity in the two trichomonad species, we determined MLCs by culturing cells for 24 hours in the presence of titrated drug concentrations, diluting the cultures 75-fold (to minimize the impact of residual drugs), and testing for survivors by outgrowth over the ensuing 5 days. The MLCs for metronidazole as a representative 5-nitroheterocyclic compound, and auranofin as a representative gold(I) compound, were very similar for T. foetus or T. vaginalis, reflecting the trends of the respective IC50 findings (Table 2). MLCs were generally 3- to 10-fold higher than IC50, consistent with the notion that complete parasite killing requires higher drug concentrations than growth inhibition by 50%. In contrast, MLC values could not be determined for the two tested proteasome inhibitors, even when tests were done with >100-fold higher drug concentrations than IC50 (Table 2). Even higher drug concentrations could not be tested in the MLC assays due to toxicity of the solvent DMSO. These results confirm that the antimicrobial activities of 5-nitroheterocyclic and gold(I) compounds are not significantly different between the two trichomonad species. The data also show that the tested proteasome inhibitors are unlikely to be trichomonacidal for either T. foetus or T. vaginalis. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.t002 To determine the utility of the new T. foetus vaginal infection models for drug efficacy testing, and to evaluate whether selected drugs are efficacious in vivo, we tested two representative compounds with excellent in vitro activity, the gold(I) compound, CPD4, and the proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, using two different T. foetus strains. Mice infected with T. foetus 232 were topically treated five times over three days with CPD4 and the infectious load was determined on day 4 (Fig 5A). None of the CPD4-treated mice had countable trophozoites, while ~70% of control mice were infected with an average of ~103 trophozoites per mouse (Fig 5B). Similarly, mice infected with the T. foetus strain D1 and treated with bortezomib showed no countable trophozoites, while all of the control mice had detectable infection (Fig 5C). These results demonstrate that the murine vaginal infection models are not only effective with different T. foetus strains, but are suitable for efficacy testing of new drug candidates against trichomonads. The results also reinforce the fact that CPD4 and bortezomib can clear T. foetus infection in an in vivo model. (A) Timeline of infection and treatment. Mice were treated five times over the course of 2.5 days, starting pno day after infection. (B/C) Mice were infected with the indicated T. foetus strains and treated intravaginally with 0.05 mg/dose (5 μL of a 10 mg/mL suspension) of either the gold(I) compound CPD4 (B) or bortezomib (C), or were left untreated as controls. After 4 days, trophozoite numbers were determined. Each point represents an individual mouse. Dashed black lines represent the detection threshold. Red lines represent geometric means. Significance was calculated by Mann-Whitney test (*p <0.01). (A) Timeline of infection and treatment. Mice were treated five times over the course of 2.5 days, starting pno day after infection.

This discrepancy raised the question whether the T. foetus proteasome is substantially different from that of T. vaginalis. Analysis of the T. foetus genome identified all 14 proteasome subunits, seven α subunits (α1–7) and seven β subunits (β1–7), as expected for all eukaryotes (Fig 6). Sequence comparison of the subunits showed good homology (50–87% amino acid identity) with T. vaginalis, but much less homology (31–57%) with the human and murine counterparts, or even the protozoan parasite P. falciparum (Fig 6). By comparison, the human and murine proteasome subunits are more closely related to each other than the T. foetus subunits are to T. vaginalis. These findings indicate that structural differences exist between the T. foetus and T. vaginalis proteasome subunits, potentially offering an explanation for the differential activity of the tested proteasome inhibitors against the two trichomonad species.

For both trichomonads, bortezomib caused concentration-dependent increases in the abundance of ubiquitin-labeled proteins (Fig 7A). Furthermore, we used an activity-based probe, MV151 [37] for labeling of the catalytic proteasome subunits of the parasites. For T. foetus, labeling of β1 and β5 was strongly inhibited by bortezomib, while β2 labeling was only minimally affected at the highest concentrations (Fig 7B). By comparison, for T. vaginalis, inhibition was most prominent for the β1 subunit followed by β5 and, to a lesser degree, β2 (Fig 7B). Together, these findings show that bortezomib inhibits the proteasome in both T. foetus and T. vaginalis, most likely by targeting the same catalytic subunits. (A) The depicted trichomonad strains were incubated for 1 hour with the indicated final concentrations of bortezomib or left without inhibitor (0 μM). Total cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by western blotting with an anti-ubiquitin antibody (left panels). As expected, multiple proteins of different sizes are labeled with ubiquitin, leading to the apparent “smear” on the blots. Total protein was visualized by Coomassie Blue staining (right panels). (B) Total cell lysates of T. foetus and T. vaginalis were incubated for 1 hour with the indicated concentrations of bortezomib and subsequently labeled for 2 hour with the fluorescent activity-based proteasome probe, MV151. Lysates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and labeled proteins were visualized by fluorescent imaging. The band labeled with an asterisk corresponds to a non-specific target of MV151 that could not be competed for with any available proteasome inhibitor and is thus unlikely to be a proteasome subunit. Raw images of the blots and gels are shown in S1 Raw images.

Robust infections with the relevant pathogens for a sufficiently long duration are key features of a good model. For trichomoniasis, infection of amenable animals, particularly rodents such as mice, with the causative pathogen, T. vaginalis, would be desirable, but we found here that murine vaginal infections with any of four T. vaginalis strains did not lead to detectable infection. In contrast, different strains of another trichomonad, T. foetus, were found to reliably infect mice for at least one week. These findings indicate that vaginal T. foetus infections provide a robust murine model suitable for in vivo drug testing. The striking difference in infectivity between T. vaginalis and T. foetus is unlikely to be related to particular strains of the respective pathogen, since the findings were consistent for four diverse strains of each species. General characteristics of the two trichomonad species are probably more important. For example, we found a difference in doubling time and pH tolerance between the two trichomonad species. Faster growth rates of T. foetus might promote infectivity by counteracting inevitable vaginal losses, while the slower growth of T. vaginalis may not be sufficient to make up for such losses. Consistent with this notion, highly infectious organisms tend to have faster doubling times due to optimization of codon usage bias and increased copies of rRNA and tRNA [42]. Another potential explanation for differential infectivity could be differences in pH tolerance. The murine vagina, unlike the normally acidic environment of the human vagina, has a pH close to neutral or even slightly alkaline [43]. The ability of T. foetus to grow under alkaline pH conditions may promote vaginal infection, while in vitro growth of T. vaginalis was strongly inhibited by alkaline pH and may thus also be compromised in vivo in mice, although our measurements that the murine vaginal pH ranged from 6.5–7 would not suggest that differential pH tolerance can explain differential murine vaginal infectivity of T. foetus vs T. vaginalis. Other possible explanations are conceivable for differential infectivity. For example, the estrus cycle of mice is characterized by periodic influx of leukocytes [44]. T. foetus may be more resistant to killing by polymorphonuclear leukocytes compared to T. vaginalis [28]. While the presence of vaginal leukocytes has no apparent impact on infectivity for T. foetus, it has been shown to have a negative impact on T. vaginalis infection [28]. Furthermore, the vaginal microbiota may be differentially affected by trichomonad infection and may impact the interactions of different trichomonads with the host. For example, T. vaginalis infection reduces vaginal epithelia-associated Lactobacillus species in humans [45]. In cats, T. foetus infection significantly impacts the abundance of a variety of different phyla present in the fecal microbiota [46]. Perhaps the extent and manner of microbial changes and their impact on host susceptibility to infection in mice may be more conducive to vaginal T. foetus infection. Other studies had some success with vaginal infection of mice with T. vaginalis, although rates of infection were generally low and variable [28–30]. Beyond specific mechanistic explanations for this variable infectivity, it is conceivable that differential infectivity may be related to the host ranges of the two trichomonads. T. vaginalis is strictly a human parasite [47], while T. foetus can infect cows, cats, and pigs [48]. The apparently narrow host range of T. vaginalis may indicate a requirement for particular host features that are not present in other species, while the broader host range of T. foetus may indicate that infection depends less on particular host characteristics. It is also important to note that none of the prior work, contrary to our present study, had assessed infection by direct trichomonad counts but relied on cultures of vaginal washes. It is possible that cell numbers were too low for counting but sufficient for obtaining positive cultures, which are likely to be one or two logs more sensitive than counts. It is also possible that different conditioning or pretreatment protocols, such as multiple subcutaneous estradiol injections, or co-infection with lactobacilli could have sensitized mice to vaginal T. vaginalis infection beyond what we employed in the current work [28–30]. Finally, although we tested four different stains, differences in T. vaginalis strains could still matter for murine infectivity, so it remains possible that a heretofore untested strain can, in fact, infect mice robustly. For a microorganism to be a useful surrogate model for drug development against a related but different infectious agent, both must have similar responses to the drugs of interest. We observed such congruency in the drug susceptibility of T. foetus and T. vaginalis to 5-nitroheterocyclic drugs and gold(I) compounds. Both drug classes are thought to act on a broad range of targets [49, 50]. In the case of 5-nitroheterocyclic drugs, the prodrug forms are first reductively activated, then form covalent adducts on multiple target molecules, including different proteins as well as nucleic acids [51]. The molecular targets responsible for cytocidal activity of 5-nitroheterocyclic drugs have not been defined, but it is likely that inactivation of multiple targets has synergistic effects that irreversibly damage the target cells [49]. The mechanism of action of gold(I) compounds is not well understood but also involve adduct formation and likely inactivation of multiple targets [50]. The multiplicity of cellular targets for both drug classes can provide an explanation for their similar activities against T. foetus and T. vaginalis, since even differences in the sequence or structure of any particular target are unlikely to interfere with the overall effectiveness of these drugs. It must be noted, however, that while not statistically significant, T. foetus had generally lower pIC50s for each compound of the two drug classes in the in vitro screening assays, which was also observed in prior studies with fewer compounds [22, 40]. Another explanation for differential drug susceptibility could be differential membrane permeability between the two parasites [52], which may allow for increased passive diffusion of small molecules, including potentially the tested antimicrobial drugs whose molecular masses are <800 Da, and thus greater susceptibility of T. vaginalis. Notably, we found little or no activity differences in the MLC assays, perhaps suggesting that the IC50 growth assays and MLC survival assays test slightly different drug properties or are differentially impacted by parasite characteristics not directly related to the drug action. For example, the IC50 assays could be affected by the faster growth rate of T. foetus over T. vaginalis. Drugs such as 5-nitroheterocyclic compounds that form covalent adducts may be consumed during the culture period, so a faster growing organism may deplete drugs more rapidly, thereby requiring apparently higher IC50 values to achieve 50% maximal growth inhibition. By comparison, MLC assays measure the ability of a drug to kill all target organisms, which typically requires higher drug levels, so the impact of drug consumption would be less apparent. Nonetheless, both IC50 and MLC provide valuable information for comparative assessment of the drug impact of T. foetus and T. vaginalis, and clearly show that the drug susceptibility of T. foetus closely resembles T. vaginalis in regard to 5-nitroheterocyclic and gold(I) compounds. Consequently, our demonstration of in vivo efficacy for one of the gold(I) compounds is promising for its ultimate in vivo efficacy against T. vaginalis. Contrary to the 5-nitroheterocyclic and gold(I) compounds, we observed marked differences in the activity of proteasome inhibitors against T. foetus and T. vaginalis. Thus, T. foetus had significantly lower pIC50s for all tested drugs in this class compared to T. vaginalis. The target of these compounds is well defined and involves one or several of the three catalytic subunits of the proteasome [53, 54]. Differences in the sequence or fine structure of the relevant proteasome subunits between the two trichomonad species, which clearly exist based on our phylogenetic analysis, can probably impact the binding of specific inhibitors. In this context, it is important to note that the tested inhibitors were originally developed against the human proteasome [55] but not specifically selected for activity against either T. vaginalis or T. foetus. Screening of large proteasome inhibitor libraries may well identify compounds that are equally active against both trichomonads. It is therefore possible, that inhibitors could be found that are more active against T. foetus than T. vaginalis and even human cells, which could represent a promising starting point for new veterinary drugs against bovine tritrichomoniasis [56]. Nevertheless, based on the phylogenetic and functional analyses, we were able to conclude that no fundamental differences exist in the 20S proteasomes of T. foetus and T. vaginalis. We could also demonstrate that one proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, has low micromolar or better activity against both T. foetus and T. vaginalis and can eliminate T. foetus infection in vivo, underlining that drug candidates with adequate activity against T. foetus can be active in vivo even if their relative potency in T. foetus does not closely mimic the findings in T. vaginalis. While this study focused on female mice, it is also important to acknowledge that males are carriers of T. vaginalis and at times may suffer symptoms. Male animal models of T. vaginalis infection via urethral injection and anesthesia have been established in mice [47] and rats [57]. In future studies, it would be of interest to evaluate drug efficacy in these models for potential treatment of male trichomoniasis. In summary, the T. foetus murine infection models described here have excellent utility as surrogate in vivo models for drug development campaigns for new drugs against T. vaginalis, particularly if multiple molecular drug targets are predicted. Caution should be exercised, however, for compounds with singular targets if those targets differ significantly between the two trichomonad species. In such situations, it would be advisable to conduct careful in vitro compound testing beforehand to confirm that drug activity is not significantly different between the two organisms or at last remains sufficiently high in T. foetus that in vivo efficacy testing is not likely to yield false negative results. T. foetus and T. vaginalis cultures were incubated for 24 hours with a range of drug concentrations, ATP content was assayed as a measure of cell growth and viability, and pIC50 values were calculated from the resulting concentration-response curves. Data are shown as mean ± SE of three or more independent experiments. IC50 values were derived from the mean pIC50. The highest tested drug concentration was 20 μM, so lack of growth inhibition at that concentration is listed as IC50 >20 μM. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.s001 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.s002 (PDF) BMH was supported in part by the UCSD Graduate Training Program in Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology.

Full Content:
Trichomonas vaginalis is the causative agent of the common sexually transmitted disease, trichomoniasis, which affects more than a hundred million people worldwide. Metronidazole and tinidazole, agents belonging to the 5-nitroheterocyclic class of antimicrobials, are most often used to treat infection, but increased resistance has been reported and adverse effects of these drugs can be significant. Consequently, an urgent need exists for the development of novel drug entities against trichomoniasis. Critical for antimicrobial drug development is the demonstration of in vivo efficacy. Murine models of vaginal T. vaginalis infection are unreliable for unknown reasons. Meanwhile, murine infections with the related bovine pathogen, Tritrichomonas foetus, tend to be more robust, although susceptibility to different antimicrobials might differ from T. vaginalis. Here, we explored the utility of T. foetus infection as a surrogate model for drug development against T. vaginalis. Four different T. foetus strains caused robust vaginal infection in young mice, while none of four diverse T. vaginalis strains did. Comparison of drug susceptibility profiles revealed that T. foetus and T. vaginalis were similarly susceptible to a range of 5-nitroheterocyclic and gold(I) compounds. By comparison, proteasome inhibitors were 10- to 15-fold less active against T. foetus than T. vaginalis, although one of the proteasome inhibitors, bortezomib, had low micromolar activity or better against multiple strains of both trichomonads. Different strains of T. foetus were used to demonstrate the utility of the murine vaginal infection models for in vivo efficacy testing, including for bortezomib and a gold(I) compound. The differences in susceptibility to proteasome inhibitors may be partially explained by differences in the proteasome subunit sequences between the two trichomonads, although the functional relevance of the proteasome was similar in both organisms. These findings indicate that T. foetus can serve as a reliable surrogate model for T. vaginalis in vitro and in murine infections in vivo, but caution must be exercised for specific drug classes with targets, such as the proteasome, that may display genetic divergence between the trichomonads.

Trichomoniasis, caused by infection with the protozoan parasite Trichomonas vaginalis, is the most common, non-viral sexually transmitted disease in the world with a global incidence of ~156 million, and a global prevalence of 5.4% [1]. The parasite can infect different genitourinary tissues, including the urethra, vagina, and cervix of women, and the prostate and urethra of men [2]. Infected women can experience a broad range of symptoms, including abnormal vaginal discharge, odor, and itching, vulvar or vaginal erythema, and colpitis macularis (“strawberry cervix”) [3]. Many women remain infected for extended periods [3]. Infection in men can lead to mild to moderate urethral discharge and urethral inflammation, but symptoms tend to be less severe than in women [1, 4]. The global prevalence of T. vaginalis infection is almost 10 times lower in men compared to women [1], which may reflect a lack of testing due to milder infection symptoms or could be related to an abbreviated course of infection. Nonetheless, lack of symptoms does not protect an individual from the complications associated with infection. For example, T. vaginalis infection can increase susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection by 50% [5]. Furthermore, a positive correlation between HIV infection and trichomoniasis symptom severity was found in men [6]. In women, infection has also been linked to an increased risk of cervical cancer, low infant birth weight, preterm birth, and stillbirths [7, 8]. In men, a decrease in sperm viability and motility has been observed with the risk to decrease fertility [9]. To avoid potential complications, it is important to treat infection upon diagnosis, particularly since infection can last for months to years [10]. Metronidazole and tinidazole are two antimicrobials currently FDA-approved for the treatment of trichomoniasis [11]. They belong to the class of 5-nitroheterocyclic drugs. Metronidazole, first developed in 1959, is the primary drug for trichomoniasis treatment worldwide [12]. Tinidazole, a structural derivative of metronidazole, was FDA-approved for trichomoniasis treatment in 2004 [11]. Both are prodrugs that must be reduced to a free radical inside microbial cells before they can covalently bind to multiple protein and nucleic acid targets. Adduct formation leads to inhibition of DNA synthesis and many vital protein functions, eventually killing the organism. Both drugs primarily target anaerobic microorganisms, including T. vaginalis, as these organisms possess enzymatic pathways with low enough redox potential to donate electrons to the drug molecules [12]. For metronidazole, cure rates range from 86–97% [13–15]. Despite its general effectiveness, an estimated 2–10% of all clinical trichomoniasis cases are caused by strains that display resistance to metronidazole and other 5-nitroheterocyclic drugs [16–18]. Beyond loss of efficacy due to resistance, metronidazole can have significant adverse effects that compromise its use and effectiveness. Thus, a large percentage of women treated with the drug have reported nausea, vomiting, unpleasant taste, diarrhea, headache, vaginal irritation, and yeast infections [19, 20]. Currently no other drug classes are FDA-approved to treat trichomoniasis. With the threat of growing resistance, and significant adverse effects, development of alternative antimicrobials in other drug classes remains urgent for treatment of trichomoniasis. Library screens of approved FDA drugs and drug candidates have been done to identify new activities against T. vaginalis but have not resulted in promising candidates [21]. De novo drug design against unexploited targets is currently the most realistic strategy for development of new antitrichomonal agents. One such strategy is exemplified by proteasome inhibitors [22]. The proteasome is an enzymatic complex present in all eukaryotic and some prokaryotic cells, whose function is to degrade and recycle proteins that are misfolded or not needed [23]. The enzyme complex consists of a barrel-like structure, consisting of two pairs of rings with seven α-subunits and seven β-subunits. Peptide substrates are fed through the center of the barrel where they are cleaved into smaller fragments. Three of the 14 proteasome subunits are catalytically active: β1 (caspase-like), β2 (trypsin-like), and β5 (chymotrypsin-like). Each cleaves the substrate at its preferred site via hydrolysis [24]. Proteasome inhibitors were first developed as anti-inflammatory agents and as novel agents for cancer treatment [25]. For example, the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, was FDA-approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. More recently, proteasome inhibitors have also been found to be effective against Plasmodium falciparum, the protozoan responsible for malaria [26]. Importantly, several new proteasome inhibitors were shown to be highly selective for the parasite over human cells [27]. T. vaginalis also possess a proteasome that can be targeted for the development of new agents against the parasite, since several proteasome inhibitors were active against the parasite in vitro and have selectivity over human cells [22]. Critical for antimicrobial drug development is the demonstration of in vivo efficacy. Ideally, animal models of infection can be used that employ the very same pathogens that infect humans. In the case of trichomoniasis, several reports have shown that mice can be infected vaginally with T. vaginalis [28–30], but infections tend to be tenuous and unreliable for poorly understood reasons. As an alternative, mouse infection models with surrogate trichomonad pathogens can be used if it can be shown that those infections are robust, and the pathogens respond to antimicrobial candidates in similar ways to the human target pathogen. For example, vaginal infection of mice with the bovine pathogen, Tritrichomonas foetus, have been shown to cause sustained infection [28]. T. foetus is a protozoan parasite that causes tritrichomoniasis in cattle, a similar disease to human trichomoniasis. The parasite is closely related to T. vaginalis, being in the same phylum [31]. Despite its promise, the broader utility of this model for drug development against T. vaginalis remains to be established. Therefore, the aims of this study were to establish infectious characteristics in mice, similarities in in vitro drug responses, structural target similarities of a set of T. foetus strains in relation to T. vaginalis and establish the overall utility and limits of the murine T. foetus model as a basis for current and future drug development against T. vaginalis. T. foetus strains 003 (ATCC 30003), 166 (ATCC 30166), 232 (ATCC 30232), 924 (ATCC 30924), and T. vaginalis strain G3 (ATCC PRA-98) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). T. vaginalis strains R88, MSA1172, S520 and S1489 were kindly provided by Dr. William Secor (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, GA). T. foetus strain D1 and T. vaginalis strain F1623 were described in prior studies [32, 33]. Trichomonads were grown in trypticase-yeast extract-maltose (TYM) medium, supplemented with 10% horse serum (Omega), 0.74% ammonium iron (II) sulfate hexahydrate (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich), and adjusted to pH 6.2. Cultures were grown axenically at 37°C under anaerobic conditions. The following 5-nitro heterocyclic were purchased commercially (molecular masses in parentheses): Metronidazole (171 Da; Sigma-Aldrich), ronidazole (200 Da; APExBIO), tinidazole (247 Da; TCI America), nitazoxanide (307 Da; AdipoGen), and nithiamide (187 Da; MedChemExpress). The following gold(I) compounds (CPD), whose naming follows our prior usage [34], were also purchased: Auranofin (679 Da; Enzo Life Sciences), (Tri-n-ethylphosphine)gold(I) chloride (351 Da, CPD4; Sigma-Aldrich), (Tri-n-methylphosphine)gold(I) chloride (309 Da, CPD10; Sigma-Aldrich) and myochrysine (390 Da; Sigma-Aldrich). The following gold(I) compounds were synthesized and characterized as described previously [34]: (Tri-n-propylphosphine)gold(I) chloride (357 Da, CPD11), (Triisopropylphosphine)gold(I) chloride (357 Da, CPD12), Bis(triethylphosphine)gold(I) chloride (433 Da, CPD14), and Bis(tri-n-propylphosphine)gold (I) chloride (517 Da, CPD15). The proteasome inhibitors bortezomib (384 Da), ixazomib (361 Da) and carfilzomib (720 Da) were obtained from MedChemExpress. The benzimidazole compounds lansoprazole (369 Da), omeprazole (345 Da), albendazole (281 Da) and fenbendazole (299 Da) were also obtained from MedChemExpress. Pantoprazole (383 Da) was purchased from APExBIO and disulfiram (297 Da) from TCI America. BALB/cJ mice (obtained from The Jackson Laboratory) were bred in-house. Female mice were used within one week of weaning at 3–6 weeks of age. Groups of mice were housed in single plastic cages with free access to feed and water. The study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was approved by the University of California San Diego Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol Number: S00205). Mice were handled with care, only by research staff fully trained in animal handling, at all times to minimize distress. Mouse health was monitored daily, as well as each time a sample was taken. Vaginal trichomonad infections in mice cause no pain, distress, or suffering, obviating any need for humane endpoints. Experimental endpoints were based solely on the infectious dynamics relative to the study objectives of assessing drug effects on infectious load. All animals were euthanized on the last day of sample collection by controlled CO2 inhalation, followed by cervical dislocation. Infections were performed with different strains of either T. vaginalis or T. foetus as indicated under the specific experiments in the figures. Trichomonads were cultured overnight, centrifuged, and resuspended at a density of 2 x 108 trophozoites/mL. For all in vitro and in vivo experiments, numbers of viable trophozoites were determined under a phase-contrast microscope. Viability was >95% as assessed by observation of the characteristic parasite motility. Five μL of the parasite suspension (containing 106 trophozoites) were slowly administered intravaginally to mice with a 20 μL micropipette. Mice were held briefly upside-down after agent administration to minimize leakage. In select experiments (as indicated in the figure legends), mice were pretreated one day before infection with one of following pretreatment regimens: a) 5 μL intravaginal administration of 10 mg/mL ammonium iron (III) citrate (Sigma-Aldrich); b) 100 μL intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 10 mg/mL ammonium iron (III) citrate; c) 100 μL i.p. injection of 4 mg/mL 17β-estradiol (Sigma-Aldrich); or d) 100 μL i.p. injection of 4 mg/mL 17β-estradiol (Sigma-Aldrich) and 100 μL i.p. injection of 1 mg/ml dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich). The ammonium iron (III) citrate solution for intravaginal administration was made in PBS containing 1% hypromellose, while all formulation for i.p. injections were prepared in PBS. Control mice received no pretreatment. For drug efficacy tests in vivo, suspensions of bortezomib or gold (I) CPD4 were prepared at 10 mg/mL (= 1% w/v) in 0.2% hypromellose in PBS. Hypromellose solution without drugs was used as a control. Five μL of the drug suspensions (containing 0.05 mg of drug) were administered intravaginally as outlined above for the parasite inoculations. A total of five doses were administered: One dose on day 1 after infection, two doses each on days 2 and 3 after infection with 6–8 h between treatments on those days. Infectious load was determined 3–4 days after infection for all experiments except for a time course study with T. foetus strain 232, where mice were sampled on days 1, 3, 6, and 9. For assessment of infection, mice were lavaged intravaginally by slowly dispensing 30 μL of TYM medium into the vagina, taking it up again, and repeating the process two more times. The washes were diluted to 120 μL in TYM medium, and 10 μL of the diluted washes were placed into a hemocytometer for counting of motile trophozoites under a phase-contrast microscope. Infectious load is expressed as total number of trophozoites per mouse. For washes without countable trophozoites, the remaining volume was cultured in 2 mL of TYM medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin for five days at 37°C, and regularly monitored for cell growth. Drug stocks were prepared as 10 mM solutions in DMSO. A 75 μM working stock was prepared in PBS and 1:3 serial dilutions were made in TYM medium in 96-well plates (post-dilution volume 40 μL/well). Parasite cultures were grown overnight in a 15 mL tube, centrifuged and resuspended to a density of 7 x 105–2 x 106 trophozoites/mL. Ten μL of this suspension were added into each well (final culture volume 50 μL/well), resulting in a final number of 7,000–20,000 trophozoites per well and final drug concentrations from 20 μM to 1 nM. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours under anaerobic conditions (AnaeroPack; Mitsubishi Gas Chemical). Viable cell numbers were determined with a luciferase-based ATP assay (Promega) [35]. Luminescence was measured with the SpectraMax M2e plate reader, using the SoftMax Pro program (version 7.0.3). To assay the minimum lethal concentration (MLC), drugs were added to 96-well plates, and serially 2-fold diluted in TYM medium. Parasites were added to each well at a density of 7 x 105/mL (T. foetus D1) or 106 trophozoites/mL (T. vaginalis R88), resulting in a final number of 28,000 or 40,000 trophozoites per well, respectively. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours under anaerobic conditions. Cultures (200 μL) were then transferred to medium-filled 15 mL tubes (representing a 1:75 dilution of the overnight culture to ensure adequate dilution of the drugs in those cultures) and kept at 37°C for a maximum of five days for observation of any cell growth indicative of survivors of the initial drug exposure. For sequence analysis of proteasome subunits, the genome and proteome sequences of the following parasite strains were used: T. foetus CC09-1 (GenBank AIF54491–504), T. vaginalis G3 (BioProject PRJNA938429, PRJNA16084) and P. falciparum NF54 (BioProject PRJNA422809), along with that of humans (BioProject PRJNA807723) and mice (BioProject PRJNA169). A phylogenetic tree was generated using MEGA software (version 11.0.13). Support values were calculated by bootstrapping with 100 replications. Protein sequences were aligned with the MUSCLE algorithm and an unrooted tree was constructed using the Le Gascuel model, with gamma distribution and invariant sites. Gaps were partially deleted, so that sites with missing data were only removed when necessary. Proteasome subunit designation followed the findings in [36]. For immunoblotting, T. foetus D1 and T. vaginalis F1623 cultures were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour with 0.3 μM or 3 μM of bortezomib, or with DMSO as a control. Lysates were made with radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) buffer (Cell Signaling Technology), supplemented with Halt protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific). Proteins were separated on a 4–20% SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad), transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore) and blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk. The membrane was incubated with a primary rabbit anti-ubiquitin polyclonal antibody (Proteintech, Cat No. 10201-2-AP) at a 1:10,000 dilution overnight and a secondary horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Cat No. 7074S) at a 1:20,000 dilution for 30 minutes. Proteins were detected with a chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Millipore). For labeling of catalytically active proteasome subunits with an activity-based probe, total cell lysates of T. foetus D1 or T. vaginalis F1623 were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour with 0.1–10 μM of bortezomib, or with DMSO as a control. Afterwards, 2 μM of the fluorescent proteasome probe, MV151 (R&D Systems, Cat No. I-190) [37] was added and lysates were further incubated at 37°C for 2 hours. Proteins were separated on a 4–20% SDS-PAGE gel, and bands were visualized by fluorescent imaging with excitation at 470 nm and emission at 530 nm. All statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism (version 10.0.0). For compound activity screening, luminescence values were normalized against drug-free controls and plotted against the log drug concentration in each well to create a concentration-response curve for each drug. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50), or concentration of drug needed to inhibit trophozoite growth and viability by 50%, and negative log10 of the IC50 (pIC50) were calculated. The assay sensitivity for pIC50 was set at 4.7, equivalent to the highest drug concentration tested in the assays. Each experiment was independently repeated three times per compound and per trichomonad strain. For in vitro data comparisons, parametric tests (ANOVA, t-tests) were used. For comparison of multiple groups, a one-way ANOVA was performed, and if a significant difference was found, Tukey’s multiple comparisons test was applied to specific pairs. For in vivo data comparisons, a non-parametric Mann-Whitney test was used. Previous studies had suggested that murine vaginal infections with T. vaginalis are characterized by low infectivity and/or short-lived infections, even with various manipulations of the host designed to increase susceptibility [28]. It is possible that marginal infectivity is related to the particular strains of T. vaginalis used for the infections, so we tested a range of four diverse strains of T. vaginalis for their ability to cause vaginal infection in young female mice. Three to four days after intravaginal inoculation, vaginal washes showed no detectable trophozoite counts for any of the tested strains (Fig 1A). Cultures of the washes for up to 5 days were uniformly negative, underlining that none of the T. vaginalis strains led to even low-level infection (Fig 1A). Furthermore, systemic (i.p.) or topical (vaginal) administration of iron, which improves T. vaginalis growth in culture [38], or systemic administration of estrogen alone or estrogen plus dexamethasone, which have been suggested to improve susceptibility of mice to T. vaginalis infection [28, 39], did not promote infectivity (Fig 1B). These experiments suggest that T. vaginalis could not infect mice under any of our current conditions, regardless of particular strains or conditioning regimens. Young (3–4 weeks) female BALB/cJ mice were intravaginally inoculated with the indicated strains of T. vaginalis (A, B) or T. foetus (C, D). In the experiments in panel B, mice were pretreated by vaginal instillation (topical) of iron or intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of iron, estrogen, or estrogen and dexamethasone (dex) before infection, at dosages detailed in the Methods. Vaginal lavages were taken on day 3 or 4 of infection (A-C) or on the indicated days (D), and motile trophozoites were counted in a hemocytometer. Data points represent counts from individual mice, dashed lines indicate the detection threshold of the assays, and red diamonds show geometric means. For select samples without countable trophozoites, lavages were cultured in trichomonad growth medium with antibiotics (blue symbols). Positive cultures are indicated by solid blue dots, while negative cultures (no growth) are depicted by open blue dots. Young (3–4 weeks) female BALB/cJ mice were intravaginally inoculated with the indicated strains of T. vaginalis (A, B) or T. foetus (C, D).

Four different T. foetus strains were obtained and tested for their vaginal infectivity in young female mice. All four strains were able to cause infection without any pre-treatment with infectivity close to 100% (i.e., the percentage of mice with trophozoites detectable by direct counting or culture over total number of inoculated mice) (Fig 1C). To examine the time course of infection, we selected the T. foetus strain 232, which had the highest infectivity and/or highest trophozoite loads, and sampled mice every 2–3 days. All mice remained infected throughout the 9 days of the experiment, indicating a lack of spontaneous clearance during that period (Fig 1D). These findings demonstrate that T. foetus constitutes a more reliable murine model of vaginal trichomonad infection than T. vaginalis. To explore potential reasons for the differential murine vaginal infectivity of T. vaginalis and T. foetus, we examined two parasite characteristics that may plausibly be involved: maximal growth rate and tolerance to different pH environments. The T. vaginalis strains had significantly slower growth rates in culture with longer doubling times compared to the T. foetus strains despite optimal growth conditions and media (Fig 2A). Furthermore, T. vaginalis growth was inhibited by even modestly alkaline pH in vitro, while T. foetus was able to grow mostly unhindered under these conditions (Fig 2B). These data indicate that the intrinsic properties of the two trichomonad species exhibit significant differences in regard to growth and pH tolerance. Trophozoites of the indicated strains were cultured in vitro in trypticase-yeast extract-maltose (TYM) medium. (A) Cell numbers were counted before and after a 24-hour time incubation period and doubling times were calculated. Data are mean ± SE; *p<0.05 (unpaired t-test for all T. vaginalis strains vs. all T. foetus strains). (B) Media were adjusted to the indicated pH and trophozoites were grown in each medium for 24 hours and counted. Data are mean ± SE.

Data are mean ± SE. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.g002 To test whether the differential pH sensitivity of the trichomonad strains might be responsible for their differential infectivity in vivo, we measured the vaginal pH in 3–6 week old mice before and after treatment with estrogen alone or with estrogen and dexamethasone [28]. Mean vaginal pH was 6.21 ± 0.04 in the untreated group (mean ± SE, n = 7 mice), 6.49 ± 0.09 for the estrogen-treated group (n = 7), and 6.71 ± 0.05 for the mice treated with estrogen and dexamethasone (n = 9). A Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn’s multiple comparisons test showed significance between the estrogen and dexamethasone versus the no treatment group. However, these data show that the vaginal pH was below 7.0 in all groups, thereby excluding differential pH tolerance as a possible explanation for the differential murine vaginal infectivity of T. vaginalis vs T. foetus. To compare susceptibility to antimicrobial drugs between the two trichomonad species, we screened different strains against four major drug classes that are clinically used in trichomoniasis or have been shown to have significant in vitro activity against T. vaginalis: 5-nitroheterocyclic drugs [41], gold(I) compounds [34], proteasome inhibitors [22], and benzimidazoles [21]. The most consistently active compounds were 5-nitroheterocyclic compounds and gold(I) compounds (S1 Table). By comparison, the tested proteasome inhibitors had excellent activity against the T. vaginalis strains but were significantly less potent against the T. foetus strains (S1 Table). The benzimidazoles and another compound with reported in vitro activity against T. vaginalis, disulfiram [21], had only minimal or no activity against either T. foetus or T. vaginalis (S1 Table). Comparison of specific drugs within the three major drug classes with the greatest potencies revealed that all tested drugs were less active in T. foetus, although differences were observed between the drug classes (Fig 3). 5-Nitroheterocyclic drugs and gold(I) drugs displayed, on average, a ~3-fold lower activity (mean ΔpIC50 = 0.47–0.48) in the T. foetus strains compared to the T. vaginalis strains, but this difference did not reach statistical significance (Fig 3). By comparison, the tested proteasome inhibitors were ~14-fold less active (mean ΔpIC50 = 1.15) against T. foetus relative to T. vaginalis, which was statistically significant (Fig 3). Activity (pIC50) of the indicated compounds from each of the indicated three drug classes against multiple strains of T. foetus and T. vaginalis was determined by 24 h growth and survival assay (the detailed data are provided in S1 Table). Each point represents the mean pIC50 of four (T. foetus) or three (T. vaginalis) different strains for the drugs listed below each graph. ΔpIC50 was calculated for each drug class by subtracting the mean T. foetus pIC50s from the mean T. vaginalis pIC50s. Red lines represent geometric means. Significance was calculated with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (*p <0.01).

Significance was calculated with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (*p <0.01). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.g003 Pairwise comparisons of strains were conducted to discover whether any individual T. foetus strain had similar drug susceptibility profiles to any of the T. vaginalis strains. Strong positive correlations were seen among the different T. foetus strains for all three major drug classes (Fig 4A, Table 1). In contrast, only modest average correlations were observed between strains of T. foetus vs. T. vaginalis (Table 1), which particularly affected the proteasome inhibitors and gold(I) compounds (Fig 4B). This might be partially explained by the only modest average correlations of drug susceptibilities among the different T. vaginalis strains (Table 1). In particular, the T. vaginalis strain S1489 displayed a very different drug susceptibility profile than the other T. vaginalis strains (Fig 4C, Table 1), thereby markedly skewing the correlation data for both T. vaginalis and T. foetus (Table 1). The graphs show correlations of the pIC50 values for individual drugs between the indicated pairs of trichomonad strains (the detailed data on drug activities used for these analyses are provided in S1 Table). Each point represents one drug and is color-coded by drug class. Plots are shown with a linear regression line (black) and line of identity (dotted red).

To further characterize antimicrobial drug activity in the two trichomonad species, we determined MLCs by culturing cells for 24 hours in the presence of titrated drug concentrations, diluting the cultures 75-fold (to minimize the impact of residual drugs), and testing for survivors by outgrowth over the ensuing 5 days. The MLCs for metronidazole as a representative 5-nitroheterocyclic compound, and auranofin as a representative gold(I) compound, were very similar for T. foetus or T. vaginalis, reflecting the trends of the respective IC50 findings (Table 2). MLCs were generally 3- to 10-fold higher than IC50, consistent with the notion that complete parasite killing requires higher drug concentrations than growth inhibition by 50%. In contrast, MLC values could not be determined for the two tested proteasome inhibitors, even when tests were done with >100-fold higher drug concentrations than IC50 (Table 2). Even higher drug concentrations could not be tested in the MLC assays due to toxicity of the solvent DMSO. These results confirm that the antimicrobial activities of 5-nitroheterocyclic and gold(I) compounds are not significantly different between the two trichomonad species. The data also show that the tested proteasome inhibitors are unlikely to be trichomonacidal for either T. foetus or T. vaginalis. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.t002 To determine the utility of the new T. foetus vaginal infection models for drug efficacy testing, and to evaluate whether selected drugs are efficacious in vivo, we tested two representative compounds with excellent in vitro activity, the gold(I) compound, CPD4, and the proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, using two different T. foetus strains. Mice infected with T. foetus 232 were topically treated five times over three days with CPD4 and the infectious load was determined on day 4 (Fig 5A). None of the CPD4-treated mice had countable trophozoites, while ~70% of control mice were infected with an average of ~103 trophozoites per mouse (Fig 5B). Similarly, mice infected with the T. foetus strain D1 and treated with bortezomib showed no countable trophozoites, while all of the control mice had detectable infection (Fig 5C). These results demonstrate that the murine vaginal infection models are not only effective with different T. foetus strains, but are suitable for efficacy testing of new drug candidates against trichomonads. The results also reinforce the fact that CPD4 and bortezomib can clear T. foetus infection in an in vivo model. (A) Timeline of infection and treatment. Mice were treated five times over the course of 2.5 days, starting pno day after infection. (B/C) Mice were infected with the indicated T. foetus strains and treated intravaginally with 0.05 mg/dose (5 μL of a 10 mg/mL suspension) of either the gold(I) compound CPD4 (B) or bortezomib (C), or were left untreated as controls. After 4 days, trophozoite numbers were determined. Each point represents an individual mouse. Dashed black lines represent the detection threshold. Red lines represent geometric means. Significance was calculated by Mann-Whitney test (*p <0.01). (A) Timeline of infection and treatment. Mice were treated five times over the course of 2.5 days, starting pno day after infection.

Significance was calculated by Mann-Whitney test (*p <0.01). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.g005 Bortezomib showed good in vitro and in vivo activity against T. foetus, yet it and the other proteasome inhibitors were markedly less potent against the different T. foetus strains than T. vaginalis (S1 Table). This discrepancy raised the question whether the T. foetus proteasome is substantially different from that of T. vaginalis. Analysis of the T. foetus genome identified all 14 proteasome subunits, seven α subunits (α1–7) and seven β subunits (β1–7), as expected for all eukaryotes (Fig 6). Sequence comparison of the subunits showed good homology (50–87% amino acid identity) with T. vaginalis, but much less homology (31–57%) with the human and murine counterparts, or even the protozoan parasite P. falciparum (Fig 6). By comparison, the human and murine proteasome subunits are more closely related to each other than the T. foetus subunits are to T. vaginalis. These findings indicate that structural differences exist between the T. foetus and T. vaginalis proteasome subunits, potentially offering an explanation for the differential activity of the tested proteasome inhibitors against the two trichomonad species.

Distance scale is shown on the bottom left. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.g006 To confirm that the T. foetus proteasome is functionally similar to T. vaginalis, we analyzed the accumulation of ubiquitin-labeled proteins after proteasome inhibition by western blotting. For both trichomonads, bortezomib caused concentration-dependent increases in the abundance of ubiquitin-labeled proteins (Fig 7A). Furthermore, we used an activity-based probe, MV151 [37] for labeling of the catalytic proteasome subunits of the parasites. For T. foetus, labeling of β1 and β5 was strongly inhibited by bortezomib, while β2 labeling was only minimally affected at the highest concentrations (Fig 7B). By comparison, for T. vaginalis, inhibition was most prominent for the β1 subunit followed by β5 and, to a lesser degree, β2 (Fig 7B). Together, these findings show that bortezomib inhibits the proteasome in both T. foetus and T. vaginalis, most likely by targeting the same catalytic subunits. (A) The depicted trichomonad strains were incubated for 1 hour with the indicated final concentrations of bortezomib or left without inhibitor (0 μM). Total cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by western blotting with an anti-ubiquitin antibody (left panels). As expected, multiple proteins of different sizes are labeled with ubiquitin, leading to the apparent “smear” on the blots. Total protein was visualized by Coomassie Blue staining (right panels). (B) Total cell lysates of T. foetus and T. vaginalis were incubated for 1 hour with the indicated concentrations of bortezomib and subsequently labeled for 2 hour with the fluorescent activity-based proteasome probe, MV151. Lysates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and labeled proteins were visualized by fluorescent imaging. The band labeled with an asterisk corresponds to a non-specific target of MV151 that could not be competed for with any available proteasome inhibitor and is thus unlikely to be a proteasome subunit. Raw images of the blots and gels are shown in S1 Raw images.

Robust infections with the relevant pathogens for a sufficiently long duration are key features of a good model. For trichomoniasis, infection of amenable animals, particularly rodents such as mice, with the causative pathogen, T. vaginalis, would be desirable, but we found here that murine vaginal infections with any of four T. vaginalis strains did not lead to detectable infection. In contrast, different strains of another trichomonad, T. foetus, were found to reliably infect mice for at least one week. These findings indicate that vaginal T. foetus infections provide a robust murine model suitable for in vivo drug testing. The striking difference in infectivity between T. vaginalis and T. foetus is unlikely to be related to particular strains of the respective pathogen, since the findings were consistent for four diverse strains of each species. General characteristics of the two trichomonad species are probably more important. For example, we found a difference in doubling time and pH tolerance between the two trichomonad species. Faster growth rates of T. foetus might promote infectivity by counteracting inevitable vaginal losses, while the slower growth of T. vaginalis may not be sufficient to make up for such losses. Consistent with this notion, highly infectious organisms tend to have faster doubling times due to optimization of codon usage bias and increased copies of rRNA and tRNA [42]. Another potential explanation for differential infectivity could be differences in pH tolerance. The murine vagina, unlike the normally acidic environment of the human vagina, has a pH close to neutral or even slightly alkaline [43]. The ability of T. foetus to grow under alkaline pH conditions may promote vaginal infection, while in vitro growth of T. vaginalis was strongly inhibited by alkaline pH and may thus also be compromised in vivo in mice, although our measurements that the murine vaginal pH ranged from 6.5–7 would not suggest that differential pH tolerance can explain differential murine vaginal infectivity of T. foetus vs T. vaginalis. Other possible explanations are conceivable for differential infectivity. For example, the estrus cycle of mice is characterized by periodic influx of leukocytes [44]. T. foetus may be more resistant to killing by polymorphonuclear leukocytes compared to T. vaginalis [28]. While the presence of vaginal leukocytes has no apparent impact on infectivity for T. foetus, it has been shown to have a negative impact on T. vaginalis infection [28]. Furthermore, the vaginal microbiota may be differentially affected by trichomonad infection and may impact the interactions of different trichomonads with the host. For example, T. vaginalis infection reduces vaginal epithelia-associated Lactobacillus species in humans [45]. In cats, T. foetus infection significantly impacts the abundance of a variety of different phyla present in the fecal microbiota [46]. Perhaps the extent and manner of microbial changes and their impact on host susceptibility to infection in mice may be more conducive to vaginal T. foetus infection. Other studies had some success with vaginal infection of mice with T. vaginalis, although rates of infection were generally low and variable [28–30]. Beyond specific mechanistic explanations for this variable infectivity, it is conceivable that differential infectivity may be related to the host ranges of the two trichomonads. T. vaginalis is strictly a human parasite [47], while T. foetus can infect cows, cats, and pigs [48]. The apparently narrow host range of T. vaginalis may indicate a requirement for particular host features that are not present in other species, while the broader host range of T. foetus may indicate that infection depends less on particular host characteristics. It is also important to note that none of the prior work, contrary to our present study, had assessed infection by direct trichomonad counts but relied on cultures of vaginal washes. It is possible that cell numbers were too low for counting but sufficient for obtaining positive cultures, which are likely to be one or two logs more sensitive than counts. It is also possible that different conditioning or pretreatment protocols, such as multiple subcutaneous estradiol injections, or co-infection with lactobacilli could have sensitized mice to vaginal T. vaginalis infection beyond what we employed in the current work [28–30]. Finally, although we tested four different stains, differences in T. vaginalis strains could still matter for murine infectivity, so it remains possible that a heretofore untested strain can, in fact, infect mice robustly. For a microorganism to be a useful surrogate model for drug development against a related but different infectious agent, both must have similar responses to the drugs of interest. We observed such congruency in the drug susceptibility of T. foetus and T. vaginalis to 5-nitroheterocyclic drugs and gold(I) compounds. Both drug classes are thought to act on a broad range of targets [49, 50]. In the case of 5-nitroheterocyclic drugs, the prodrug forms are first reductively activated, then form covalent adducts on multiple target molecules, including different proteins as well as nucleic acids [51]. The molecular targets responsible for cytocidal activity of 5-nitroheterocyclic drugs have not been defined, but it is likely that inactivation of multiple targets has synergistic effects that irreversibly damage the target cells [49]. The mechanism of action of gold(I) compounds is not well understood but also involve adduct formation and likely inactivation of multiple targets [50]. The multiplicity of cellular targets for both drug classes can provide an explanation for their similar activities against T. foetus and T. vaginalis, since even differences in the sequence or structure of any particular target are unlikely to interfere with the overall effectiveness of these drugs. It must be noted, however, that while not statistically significant, T. foetus had generally lower pIC50s for each compound of the two drug classes in the in vitro screening assays, which was also observed in prior studies with fewer compounds [22, 40]. Another explanation for differential drug susceptibility could be differential membrane permeability between the two parasites [52], which may allow for increased passive diffusion of small molecules, including potentially the tested antimicrobial drugs whose molecular masses are <800 Da, and thus greater susceptibility of T. vaginalis. Notably, we found little or no activity differences in the MLC assays, perhaps suggesting that the IC50 growth assays and MLC survival assays test slightly different drug properties or are differentially impacted by parasite characteristics not directly related to the drug action. For example, the IC50 assays could be affected by the faster growth rate of T. foetus over T. vaginalis. Drugs such as 5-nitroheterocyclic compounds that form covalent adducts may be consumed during the culture period, so a faster growing organism may deplete drugs more rapidly, thereby requiring apparently higher IC50 values to achieve 50% maximal growth inhibition. By comparison, MLC assays measure the ability of a drug to kill all target organisms, which typically requires higher drug levels, so the impact of drug consumption would be less apparent. Nonetheless, both IC50 and MLC provide valuable information for comparative assessment of the drug impact of T. foetus and T. vaginalis, and clearly show that the drug susceptibility of T. foetus closely resembles T. vaginalis in regard to 5-nitroheterocyclic and gold(I) compounds. Consequently, our demonstration of in vivo efficacy for one of the gold(I) compounds is promising for its ultimate in vivo efficacy against T. vaginalis. Contrary to the 5-nitroheterocyclic and gold(I) compounds, we observed marked differences in the activity of proteasome inhibitors against T. foetus and T. vaginalis. Thus, T. foetus had significantly lower pIC50s for all tested drugs in this class compared to T. vaginalis. The target of these compounds is well defined and involves one or several of the three catalytic subunits of the proteasome [53, 54]. Differences in the sequence or fine structure of the relevant proteasome subunits between the two trichomonad species, which clearly exist based on our phylogenetic analysis, can probably impact the binding of specific inhibitors. In this context, it is important to note that the tested inhibitors were originally developed against the human proteasome [55] but not specifically selected for activity against either T. vaginalis or T. foetus. Screening of large proteasome inhibitor libraries may well identify compounds that are equally active against both trichomonads. It is therefore possible, that inhibitors could be found that are more active against T. foetus than T. vaginalis and even human cells, which could represent a promising starting point for new veterinary drugs against bovine tritrichomoniasis [56]. Nevertheless, based on the phylogenetic and functional analyses, we were able to conclude that no fundamental differences exist in the 20S proteasomes of T. foetus and T. vaginalis. We could also demonstrate that one proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, has low micromolar or better activity against both T. foetus and T. vaginalis and can eliminate T. foetus infection in vivo, underlining that drug candidates with adequate activity against T. foetus can be active in vivo even if their relative potency in T. foetus does not closely mimic the findings in T. vaginalis. While this study focused on female mice, it is also important to acknowledge that males are carriers of T. vaginalis and at times may suffer symptoms. Male animal models of T. vaginalis infection via urethral injection and anesthesia have been established in mice [47] and rats [57]. In future studies, it would be of interest to evaluate drug efficacy in these models for potential treatment of male trichomoniasis. In summary, the T. foetus murine infection models described here have excellent utility as surrogate in vivo models for drug development campaigns for new drugs against T. vaginalis, particularly if multiple molecular drug targets are predicted. Caution should be exercised, however, for compounds with singular targets if those targets differ significantly between the two trichomonad species. In such situations, it would be advisable to conduct careful in vitro compound testing beforehand to confirm that drug activity is not significantly different between the two organisms or at last remains sufficiently high in T. foetus that in vivo efficacy testing is not likely to yield false negative results. T. foetus and T. vaginalis cultures were incubated for 24 hours with a range of drug concentrations, ATP content was assayed as a measure of cell growth and viability, and pIC50 values were calculated from the resulting concentration-response curves. Data are shown as mean ± SE of three or more independent experiments. IC50 values were derived from the mean pIC50. The highest tested drug concentration was 20 μM, so lack of growth inhibition at that concentration is listed as IC50 >20 μM. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.s001 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.s002 (PDF) BMH was supported in part by the UCSD Graduate Training Program in Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology.

India's push into semiconductors comes as more U.S. chipmakers set their sights on India. Nvidia, AMD, Micron are among the U.S. companies that have pledged to expand in the country. "I'm in touch with the Micron CEO regularly, and they are making good progress," Goyal said. Goyal added that Indian behemoth Tata and other domestic companies are working to make India's semiconductor dream a reality. It's unlikely India will manufacture the most cutting-edge chips without the expertise of companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Samsung which build some of the world's most advanced chips. "It is a tough job, but we have the talent, we have the skills," said Goyal. The minister referenced a recent trip to Silicon Valley where he visited several U.S. semiconductor companies and "saw tons of Indians working on the shop floor [and] on management teams," recounts Goyal. The minister, spearheading U.S. corporation expansion efforts under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is confident India will be able to deliver the first chip by 2026-2027. Apple has already found success in India as it has looked to diversify its supply chain away from China. Goyal says 14% of the world's iPhones are manufactured in India, with that number "expected to grow." Apple increased assembly in the country in the last two years while boosting its retail presence to attract new iPhone buyers. And according to Goyal, Indian customers are increasingly opting for the more expensive iPhones. Apple has also begun manufacturing other products, including iPads, AirPods and Apple Watches in the country. "They're increasing production," Goyal added. Apple's expansion efforts in India have brought 150,000 jobs across manufacturing facilities in India, making it the biggest employer in the country's electronics industry, according to India's Commerce department. An Apple spokesperson was not immediately available to comment. Apple's foray into India comes amid ongoing growth challenges in China. On the recent bout of optimism around China's economic story and the latest stimulus measures, Goyal suggested that India's success is not predicated on China's troubles. "India… is not dependent on China. We stand on our own competencies, on our capabilities, and we believe we an offering that is far superior to China," said Goyal. Goyal met with a few Wall Street investors on Monday including executives from BlackRock, Warburg Pincus and KKR. Goyal said almost all the U.S. private equity players are looking to build and develop data centers across the country. Google, Microsoft and Nvidia are among the tech companies that are bringing artificial intelligence expertise to India, which Modi's government has been receptive to. But analysts warn that India must continue tackling larger issues including poor infrastructure, bureaucracy and red tape that have slowed down corporate expansion plans. Got a confidential news tip?

The Corporate Europe Observatory (CEO) has rendered a great public service by very recently publishing a report titled ‘Bayer’s Toxic Trails’ which reveals how the German agrochemical giant Bayer has been lobbying hard to promote glyphosate and GMOs, or trying to “capture public policy to pursue its private interests.” This report, written by Joao Camargo and Hans Van Scharen, follows Bayer’s toxic trail as “it maintains monopolistic control of the seed and pesticides markets, fights off regulatory challenges to its toxic products, tries to limit legal liability, and exercises political influence.” This CEO report tells us that German multinational Bayer is one of the biggest pharmaceutical and agricultural companies in the world, employing over 100,000 people globally. Despite facing very extensive legal actions relating to very serious health problems caused by its high hazard products, it has plans “to stay afloat in a volatile future – from pushing glyphosate and new GMOs, to claiming its agricultural model is climate smart.” . Screenshot from CEO . The CEO report says on the basis of its extensive study that “the company’s general modus operandi is to cosy up to different political regimes or carefully generate political pressure to push through its products and its monopoly model, using market power, size, financial assets and lobbying as key tools.” As the CEO report tells us, Bayer has been in the headlines again recently because of the EU’s re-approval of the controversial herbicide glyphosate for another 10 years. This has happened despite the fact that “Glyphosate has come under heavy scrutiny over the past decade, since the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC, a World Health Organization agency) classified the company’s bestselling pesticide as “probably carcinogenic to humans”. In the US Bayer has recently been ordered to pay US$2.25 billion in compensation to a single plaintiff due to cancer linked to use of the pesticide (later cut to US$400 million by a judge).” “In total, so far, Bayer has faced over 170,000 lawsuits associated with its pesticide Roundup, which glyphosate is a main ingredient of. As of 2024 the company also estimates that there are still over 60,000 pending Roundup lawsuits. According to US law firm Wisner Baum, roughly 60 per cent of lawsuits have been resolved through verdicts in individual cases worth billions, or via a collective Roundup settlement agreement worth approximately US$11 billion. As a result the company’s stock continues to fall: it has dropped 70 percent since the summer of 2018, when it acquired the giant agrochemical glyphosate producer Monsanto for €63 billion.” However, the report says, “Bayer is pursuing a business model of increasing monopoly control over chemicals and seeds. After the Bayer-Monsanto and other mergers, just four companies ended up controlling 60 percent of the world seed market. Analysis shows that Bayer is the leading company in the global seed market, with a 17 percent share. It is also a dominant player in the chemical crop protection market. As a result, it appears determined to undermine key aspects of the EU’s beleaguered Green Deal. And even where it finds obstacles, for example when its products are deemed too toxic to sell for use in Europe, it will still produce them here and instead export the banned substances to other countries around the world, including across the global south. The company has a long history of promoting a global agricultural model that creates and perpetuates addiction to its ever more expensive products.” Further the CEO report says, “Recent examples show the capability of the agrochemical giant to challenge or change policies and even laws in countries like Thailand, Mexico, and the US… Bayer’s plans promise a disturbing future for food, farmers, and communities – a future that undermines sustainable agriculture and real climate solutions in order to secure future corporate profits, whatever the environmental and health consequences.” Regarding powerful lobbying efforts , this report tells us, “Major actors in the agrochemical sector, aka ‘Big Toxics’, are currently among the biggest lobby spenders by sector at EU level, jostling for the top place with Big Tech and Big Energy. According to the EU lobby register, Bayer AG spent up between 7 to €8 million in 2023 on EU lobbying, the biggest sum declared by any individual chemical company and the highest amount ever spent by Bayer on EU lobbying. To this we should add an important caveat: these are self-declared figures in a de facto voluntary register. In the past, Monsanto hired lobby firm Fleishman-Hillard to work on its lobby campaign to secure the re-authorisation of glyphosate but did not declare the €14.5 million contract in the register. “It was in the context of this glyphosate lobby campaign that Monsanto-Bayer was exposed by the publication of the Monsanto Papers. In May 2019 Bayer acknowledged that its Monsanto unit was being investigated by French prosecutors for compiling files on journalists, politicians and other influential persons in several European countries. The inquiry was opened after a complaint was filed by newspaper Le Monde, which alleged that Monsanto had developed and maintained a file on 200 European names, including journalists and lawmakers, in hopes of influencing their position on pesticides.” . Source . US investigative journalist Carey Gillam (who has published two books on glyphosate and Monsanto) published an overview of how the company has very actively manipulated the debate on glyphosate. According to Gillam they have done this not only by “ghostwriting scientific papers and suppressing science that conflicts with corporate assertions of Roundup’s safety”, but also via cosy relationships with regulators and lawmakers, and through strategic manipulation and intimidation of the media. The CEO Report states further that in 2022 the US-based investigative group US Right to Know (USRTK) reported that the very active ‘Genetic Literacy Project’ “is an influential front group that partners with Bayer and other chemical companies to promote GMO foods and pesticides and argue for deregulation. Bayer paid the Genetic Literacy Project US$100,000 from July 2020 to June 2021 for its work “to prevent legislative overreach in genetic engineering”, according to the group’s declaration in the US regarding its lobbying there. In its first ‘Political Advocacy Transparency Report’, published in December 2023, Bayer declared spending of €49 million worldwide on lobbying (including the pharmaceutical side of its operations), as well as an extra €26 million on trade association fees. The report indicates that Bayer spent a staggering €75 million on lobbying worldwide in 2022, (of which at least €13.5 million was spent in Europe). Regarding new GMOs, in 2021 Bayer proposed “a new regulation (separate from GMOs) assessing whether the changes in the DNA of the new plant are similar to the ones that could have been obtained through conventional breeding methods or spontaneous mutation.” This would class new GMOs as essentially the same as non-GM. Bayer’s lobbying also ignores the conclusion of scientific researchers in 2022 that we have already exceeded the safe planetary boundaries of chemicals in the environment. Target Seven of the 15th Conference of Parties on the UN Convention for Biodiversity clearly outlines the imperative of “reducing the risks of pesticide use to protect a further decline of biodiversity.” Results of powerful lobbying by Bayer and others in Europe can be seen- the European Commission has proposed to deregulate new GMOs, and has re-authorised the use of the “probably carcinogenic” glyphosate for another decade, despite not having achieved the agreement of a qualified majority of member states. In the USA, “because of the avalanche of litigation unfolding as a result of the toxic nature of glyphosate and the fact that the labels of products that contain glyphosate have not warned users of its potential dangers, Bayer wants to change US law. Bayer has also been lobbying lawmakers in three US states to pass legislation which would provide legal protection for the company from future lawsuits.” As AP reported “nearly identical bills introduced in Iowa, Missouri and Idaho this year – with wording supplied by Bayer – would protect pesticide companies from claims they failed to warn that their product causes cancer.” Experts warn that this could have huge consequences – extending to US product liability laws and providing corporate immunity for lawsuits. The CEO report says, “Despite the adverse health and scientific findings, Bayer isn’t giving up one inch on maintaining its glyphosate production and market. It is simply an extremely profitable chemical, with annual market revenue of US$10 billion in 2023.” This means “ignoring and dismissing the wealth of scientific evidence and the work of the IARC on glyphosate, which has despite enormous pressure not changed its scientific findings.” This is being resisted. In September 2023, 185 US environmental organisations sent letters to the House and Senate, urging both chambers to reject these legislative proposals whose aim is to pre-empt existing state and local laws and ordinances which are in place to safeguard communities from the harmful impacts of toxic agricultural pesticides.The dubious track record of the EPA on glyphosate and other substances has already been widely documented and exposed by the publication of the Monsanto Papers. The CEO report says, “Ever since taking on Monsanto and adding glyphosate-based RoundUp to its list of troublesome products, it has taken many hits. Sales have continued to decline in its crop science and pharma segments, and a further slash in its 2023 revenue directly connected to a drop in glyphosate demand is creating pressure for change.” Bayer had announced that it would take glyphosate for residential use out of the US market in 2023, although its massive agricultural use will be retained. A class action against Bayer was opened by non-Hodgkin Lymphoma patients in Australia – over 800 people allege their cancer was caused by glyphosate and Roundup in particular, spelling more trouble on the horizon. In Missouri, the company was condemned to pay US$1.56 billion for more cancer cases connected to Roundup. The CEO report tells us further that Bayer has been looking into alternatives to glyphosate for some time. “In March 2024 the company announced that such a product would be publicly available in 2028. At the beginning of this year, in Brazil, Bayer presented two new herbicides in this vein: Icafolin and Convintro. The Convintro herbicide contains PFAS diflufenican and endocrine-disrupting metribuzim, two substances which are bound to raise serious environmental and health issues.” The CEO report adds, “An even more business-friendly and Bayer-friendly German government in 2025, such as one led by the former director of BlackRock Germany (one of Bayer’s biggest shareholders) – and current CDU leader in the Bundestag – Friedrich Merz, might improve Bayer’s prospects. With a rise in conservative and far-right elected representatives in the EU, Bayer and its toxic lobby will likely realign for new political scenarios.” Expressing shock the CEO report says, “It is astonishing to see how far Monsanto’s (subsequently Bayer’s) lobbying has sunk its teeth into public decision-making across the world. Bayer’s lobby tactics continue to capture public policy-making, and in doing so hollow out democracy. A perverse symbiosis between corporate lobby groups and decision-makers has been actively created through its economic weight and large investments in many corners of the world, and this consistently leads to crucial decisions being made in favor of industry profits, rather than public interest.” Further, this report adds, “companies like Monsanto/Bayer have for many years managed to influence, design and change national policies on the use of pesticides and biotechnology in food production, leading to significant and long-lasting environmental and health harm. But if Bayer were to now succeed in changing US law on labelling, and thus to de facto achieve immunity from further litigation related to its toxic products, that would still be a new low for democracy and for policies to improve public health and preserve biodiversity.” According to the CEO report, “Some things are really hard to change. As with the three other ‘horsemen of the agrochemical apocalypse’ – Syngenta, Corteva, and BASF – the dire climate situation of food chokepoints internationally offers the opportunity for corporations like Bayer to hold more power over governments and farmers who are subject to significant socio-economic pressures, deploying patented products, crops, and technologies controlled almost exclusively by them. These companies are privatising life and food itself, with patented seeds and the coupled use of pesticides, to maintain and further lock in an agro-industrial model that produces mainly commodities.” This report strongly asserts, “Companies such as Bayer have left a toxic trail all around the world and all through their long history. Bayer’s model of production, and many of its products, have been a past, present, and future threat to people and planet,– Bayer’s modus operandi is not to work in the public interest, but rather to capture public policy to serve its private interests and dividends of its shareholders, all while ignoring the public health and environmental impact of its activities. “In the short term, we need a firewall between decision-makers on the one side, and Bayer and its lobby representatives on the other. Much as we need toxic-free food and a toxic-free environment, we desperately also need toxic-free politics…We need to urgently kick big toxic polluters out of the places where they exercise their poisonous political influence.” * Click the share button below to email/forward this article to your friends and colleagues.

By Ej Dickson A few years ago, I was talking to the host of a popular Disney-theme-park podcast when the conversation invariably led to where it always does between two Disney adults: Why do we love Disney so much, when everything it does seems tailor-made to piss us off? This was in 2022, in the midst of a particularly brutal public-relations war sparked by the so-called Don’t Say Gay bill, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ legislation prohibiting public schools from including materials about LGBTQ+ identities in their curricula. Many Disney employees were outraged by the bill, and because the company’s largest theme park is based in the state, there was massive internal pressure on then-CEO Bob Chapek to speak out against it. But Chapek did the opposite, explaining in a memo that publicly decrying Don’t Say Gay would “do very little to change outcomes or minds” and would only serve to “further divide and inflame.” Eventually, following days of bad press, Chapek issued a memo apologizing for not publicly opposing the bill. But the damage had already been done: Both progressives and conservatives were outraged, and amid the bad press, Disney refused to extend Chapek’s contract, leading to his ouster a few months later. According to reporting from The New York Times, Chapek would later tell people that he felt unfairly targeted, since his handling of the bill (or more accurately, its lack thereof) had been supported by the board as he went. Disney’s approach struck many, including myself, as the apogee of corporate bungling. It felt like the company was sending a clear message that although it would be happy to accept money from members of the LGBTQ+ community, that wasn’t tantamount to acknowledging its right to exist. And as a queer Disney fan myself, that message didn’t sit well with me. So I asked this podcast host: How did he square his own principles with loving Disney? Did he feel bad about it? He didn’t have to think twice about his answer. Editor’s picks The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 250 Greatest Guitarists of All Time The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time 25 Most Influential Creators of 2024 “Not really,” he said. “They keep putting out stuff I like. Yes, it’s a big, soulless corporation. And, yes, I still love it. Because they make things that move me.” At the time, I thought this was kind of bullshit. There are a lot of brands that make things that move people. I, for one, am moved by fried-chicken sandwiches and carbonated water and $10 canvas sneakers. Yet I avoid buying Chick-fil-A or a SodaStream or Shein clothes, because there are aspects of their business practices that do not move me, that I, in fact, find repugnant. And while it may be momentarily satisfying to write a scathing Twitter thread calling out colonialist violence or evangelical Christian homophobia, voting with my wallet is by far my most effective form of protest. So why not do that, even if it means I can’t stream The Simpsons on Disney+, or purchase the new Pizza Planet-truck-inspired popcorn bucket? Is that really such a difficult tradeoff in order to affect some concrete, if marginal, change in the world? As it turns out, for me at least, the answer is yes. Because a few weeks — not even a few months — after the Don’t Say Gay debacle, I booked a trip to Disney World. I’ve gone on at least two more since then; in fact, I just came back from another one two weeks ago. I haven’t stopped buying my kids Disney-branded clothes and toys. I haven’t even canceled Disney+. The simple explanation for why I do this is because I am a hypocrite who is devoid of integrity. But I fear the actual explanation is far more complicated. I am one of a cadre of people who self-identify as Disney adults. While it would be easy to define this group as “adult Disney fans,” it’s a little bit like saying Beauty and the Beast is a movie about a hot girl who reads a lot and then develops Stockholm syndrome; it’s technically true, but it also kind of misses the point. Unlike Swifties or Trekkies or Philadelphia sports fans, Disney adults can’t really be defined by one or more demographic traits; you can’t say they skew white and female or middle-aged and nerdy or inebriated and prone to battery-throwing, because they are any and all of the above. They are united by only one factor: an unflagging belief that everything Disney puts out, from its streaming shows to its theme-park attractions to its cruises to its animated films, is superior to that of its competitors, in that it is infused with a specific ethos that can only be summarized as “Disney magic.” Disney magic is a term that’s even more difficult to define than Disney adult. On a customer-service level, it refers to the small touches that make a park guest’s stay more memorable: a free dessert here, an extra 30 seconds interacting with Chip and Dale there. It’s the type of attention to detail that is supposed to make you forget you’re spending thousands of dollars on a vacation, because Disney is not supposed to feel like a vacation at all. It’s supposed to feel like an enhanced version of reality, where the people are nicer, the streets are cleaner, and the food tastes (marginally) better. But there’s another aspect of Disney “magic” that’s more ineffable. It’s the way a full-grown adult man kind of has to catch his breath when he sees an actor playing Cinderella in full regalia. It’s the distinctly floral chlorine scent that wafts from the waters of Pirates of the Caribbean (so beloved that there are candles sold on Etsy inspired by the odor), or the way you automatically hear a clip-clop of hooves when “76 Trombones” pipes through the sound system of Main Street USA. It’s a feeling that marketing experts would likely chalk up to decades upon decades of a multinational conglomerate building brand allegiance across generations, but that a less cynical person would attribute to the apotheosis of the ideology popularized by Walt Disney himself, the idea that Disney will exist “as long as there is imagination left in the world.” Disney magic can be best summarized as a testament to the boundless human capacity for imagining, whether that applies to a child gazing up at Sleeping Beauty’s castle or an executive trying to figure out how to maximize quarterly Frozen-merch earnings. As a kid, I went to the Disney parks with my family probably every other year, because they were the one place where our conversations didn’t end in shouting and tears. I used to spend hours writing in my journal about vacations we took months ago, documenting every little detail like where we went to eat or about other families we’d met at the hotel. I would read and reread these entries, because they served as a reminder for me that there was a place where I could be happier than I was at home or at school, where all the kids thought I was a snaggle-toothed weirdo who read the dictionary for fun. (They were right, but that’s not germane.) So for me, Disney magic was the ability to envision a world where people were nicer than we were to one another, or than my family was to ourselves. Disney is, of course, not just its parks: It is an entire brand universe, comprising consumer products, publishing, media networks (ESPN, ABC, FX), studios (Pixar, LucasFilm, Marvel, 20th Century Studios), and international operations. It has such a stranglehold on the culture at large that according to one survey, Mickey Mouse has a higher level of name recognition than Santa Claus. Entire generations have grown up on a steady diet of Disney-owned properties, a list that has only expanded since the acquisitions of Marvel, LucasFilm, Pixar, and 20th Century Fox over the past two decades. One could theoretically spend an entire human life cycle exclusively consuming Disney products, from being swaddled in a Mickey-branded Huggies diaper to exchanging wedding vows in front of Sleeping Beauty Castle. And while there’s no such thing as a Disney-branded birth or funeral, I would bet my 401(k) that the idea has been floated in boardrooms. For the past few years, however, there has been a distinct sense that Disney has been slipping in its ability to consistently provide consumers its trademark magic. Though 2023, the company’s centennial, was projected to be a banner year, its last animated feature, Wish, was a box-office flop, as was Pixar’s Elemental; its Marvel entries, The Marvels and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, fared little better. In May 2024, CEO Bob Iger revealed at an investor conference that Disney+, the company’s streaming service that launched in 2019, was operating at a $4 billion loss, largely due to what he deemed an emphasis on “volume and not quality,” according to The Hollywood Reporter. Even the parks division, typically the most profitable of Disney’s verticals, is flailing, with operating profit declining three percent last quarter due to what CFO Hugh F. Johnston referred to as “moderation of consumer demand.” Share prices have plummeted. Over the past few months, I have spoken to various figures within Disney’s extensive orbit. Depending on who you speak to, the loss of Disney magic can be attributed to a wide range of factors: Many point to Bob Chapek, the parks head turned CEO who, by the end of his brief tenure, was so widely reviled that he was literally booed off the stage at the D23 fan expo. According to a September New York Times investigation, Chapek had essentially been pushed out by his predecessor Iger, who served as CEO for 16 years before retiring in 2021. A beloved figure within the company for years, Iger had become frustrated with Chapek’s poor management of Disney creatives, according to the Times piece, orchestrating his ouster even after he had personally hand-picked him as his successor. Others pointed to various external factors, such as the devastating impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, which led to the parks being temporarily shuttered, tens of thousands of employees being laid off, and a $4.7 billion loss in the third quarter of 2020. The economic instability brought about by the pandemic “was bad for every company, but especially Disney, because they count so much on the parks” for revenue, says Scott Gustin, a reporter who covers theme parks. “And I don’t think things have been steady [at the company] since.” Overall, however, there is a distinct sense among almost everyone I spoke with that over the course of the past few decades, via a series of decisions motivated by an amalgam of greed and complacency, Disney is in serious danger of losing its position as a cultural juggernaut. “Disney’s never hidden the fact they’re all about your money,” one former midlevel corporate employee told me. “But they’ve also provided high-value entertainment, high-value experiences. Now, I would say the company has pivoted to nickel-and-diming. And they are not providing high-quality entertainment and experiences in the same way.” (Disney did not respond to requests for interview or comment.) These conversations painted a portrait of a corporation on autopilot and operating under the assumption that it is simply too big to fail. These sources contend that while this may have been true for Disney at one point, the company has squandered enough goodwill among its consumers that it no longer is. “There is a sense that if the company is not careful and they don’t adjust their course, that there is a point where people won’t see them as the leader anymore,” says one former employee. They also were reflective of a company that is dismissive toward, if not outright contemptuous of, its most loyal fans. According to two former corporate employees, the company eschews hiring what one referred to as “superfans,” viewing a love for the brand as “a huge turnoff.” “To me, it feels counterintuitive, because I feel like you’d want to hire the people who know the brand best, so they can protect it,” the person said. “Some of your biggest advocates are going to be these people.” Fans of the parks in particular have expressed mounting frustration with rising ticket prices, the elimination of various amenities, and the perceived decrease in quality of the overall experience. Many of the sources I spoke to for this piece told me that in recent years, staffing had been an issue at the parks, leading to attractions being shut down, and overwhelmed employees providing poor customer service. Some issued complaints directly to the company, only for such feedback to fall on deaf ears. “They tolerate fans,” the former corporate employee told me. “They take their money. But I feel like the fans and the bloggers and the influencers kind of annoy them, too. From my perspective, they don’t market toward the people who are their biggest moneymakers.” In true Disney-adult form, many sources I spoke with skewed toward personifying these failures, viewing them as reflective not of a multibillion-dollar corporation subject to shifting markets and trends, but of an individual whose actions cause personal disappointment. One source I spoke with likened the company to a toxic ex-boyfriend who you always come back to against your better judgment; another person, to a high school mean girl. Now, they say, the brand is facing the consequences. “People are revolting against Disney,” one former executive said. “They are sick of the bully in the room.” TO BE FAIR, DISNEY HAS BEEN in similarly dire straits before. In the early 1980s, the company had lost its primacy in the film and animation markets, churning out forgettable features like The Fox and the Hound and Pete’s Dragon. Between 1982 and 1984, its net income fell by 25 percent, making itself vulnerable to takeover attempts by corporate raiders. With the appointment of Michael Eisner as CEO in 1984, Disney’s fortunes shifted, ushering in the so-called Golden Age of Disney animation with features like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin; drastically expanding the parks, including Walt Disney World’s Animal Kingdom and Hollywood Studios and Disneyland Paris; and acquiring ABC in 1995, including ESPN. Eisner also introduced the particularly brilliant marketing strategy of capitalizing on its existing intellectual property (IP) by selling limited-edition VHS tapes of classic Disney films, releasing them only for short periods of time. This strategy allowed millions of Gen X-ers and millennials to inject the iconography of Disneyana — the princesses, the castles, the songs, and, of course, the non-fucking mice — directly into their veins. In 2005, after a series of high-profile box-office flops and public feuds with former Disney animation exec Jeffrey Katzenberg, the board pressured Eisner to step down as CEO, leading him to hand the reins to then-President Bob Iger. As he documents in his book, The Ride of a Lifetime, Iger had inherited a company that was flailing as it had in 1984: The post-9/11 economic recession had sent Disney’s stock price tumbling, the animation department was adrift, and the advent of internet piracy had taken a bite of the company’s profits. “Almost every traditional media company, while trying to figure out its place in this changing world, was operating out of fear rather than courage,” Iger wrote, “stubbornly trying to build a bulwark to protect old models that couldn’t possibly survive the sea change underway.” In short, it was a climate very similar to that of our current media landscape, and Iger was able to clearly visualize a path forward for Disney that did not rely on traditional media frameworks. Foreseeing the impending demise of cable television, he became an early advocate for digital-first mobile-streaming content; he also led the acquisition of Pixar, which was by far outpacing Disney in terms of its creativity and ingenuity, thus successfully reinvigorating the animation team. Both of these decisions were widely derided and extremely expensive: “In essence,” Iger wrote of the launch of Disney+, the company’s streaming subscription service, “we were hastening the disruption of our own business, and the short-term losses were going to be significant.” But Iger was keenly aware of the fact that such short-term losses were essential to preserving the integrity of the brand and the quality of the product. “You have to look past whatever the commercial losses are and be guided, again, by the simple rule that there’s nothing more important than the quality and integrity of your people and your product,” he wrote. Under Iger’s leadership, Disney became a mega-conglomerate with massive global reach, with the company opening parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong and building its extensive library of IP with the acquisition of Marvel, LucasFilm, and 20th Century Fox. And while this rapid growth has gone a long way in establishing the company’s dominance in the global market, it has also come with accompanying growing pains, particularly following the 20th Century Fox merger in 2019, according to a number of former corporate employees I spoke with. Once a legendary Golden Age film studio that produced such classic films as The Sound of Music, Star Wars, and Titanic, Disney’s acquisition essentially “swallowed up” the company and “spit out what it didn’t want,” according to one source. “That was a very dark point,” says the source. “It was ugly. It was ruthless.” The deal was accompanied by multiple rounds of layoffs, as well as a growing sense of complacency that made many employees’ lives difficult. One former employee sums up the attitude as follows: “You’re so lucky to work here, because you get to work on the best content, the best movies, the best shows in the world. If you are unhappy, we don’t need you.” To a degree, that attitude has always existed within the Disney brand. Yet those I spoke with said it was more justifiable prior to the merger, as well as the launch of Disney+ in 2019. That year, the company hit a high-water mark both creatively and commercially: Thanks to the release of box-office smashes like Frozen II, Toy Story 4, Avengers Endgame, and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, the company grossed a record $13 billion globally, accounting for nearly 40 percent of the worldwide box office. Something shifted, however. Multiple sources tell me that employees felt they were under so much pressure to ramp up output for the platform, and to establish it as a viable competitor to Netflix and Amazon, that it became impossible to keep up. “There’s a pretty obvious decline in quality starting from 2019,” one former corporate executive tells me. “[2019’s] The Mandalorian is the only thing on Disney+ that was treated with the same care as they had treated [previous releases]. The pressure was just so intense to put out as much content as possible.” The end result has been a string of anemic superhero franchise entries (The Marvels), overhyped streaming series (the just-canceled The Acolyte), bloated franchise reboots (Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny), underperforming live-action remakes (Mulan, Pinocchio), and uninspired animated features, previously the bulwark of the Disney entertainment division (Onward, Strange World, Elemental). Though there have been a few hits over the past few years — 2021’s WandaVision was critically acclaimed, while Disney Animation Studios’ Encanto got a huge boost from its soundtrack going viral on social media — much of its output has been disappointing. And while some of these failures could be explained by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, with people failing to return to theaters in pre-2020 numbers, that explanation only goes so far. One source I spoke with speculated that the pandemic only served to highlight how little care Disney was giving to the quality of its entertainment offerings, operating on the assumption that people were bored at home and would watch anything put out under the Disney brand — an assumption that was proven wrong with the failure of what they viewed as subpar films like Soul and Luca. “Covid brought Disney to its knees,” one person told me. “And the problem is, Disney didn’t think it could be brought to its knees. So now it has to reckon with that.” On the parks side, previously Disney’s biggest revenue driver, the company has especially struggled. “There’s a lot of discourse around Disney’s rapid growth, and with that a lot of discourse about its perceived greed and the deep decline and quality of their movies and their parks,” says Jenny Nicholson, a YouTuber and former Disney cast member. In the spring of 2024, Nicholson posted a scathing four-hour video essay chronicling the downfall of one of the parks’ most notorious failures, Walt Disney World’s immersive Galactic Starcruiser hotel, which cost thousands of dollars a night and was open for barely 14 months before it shut down. Nicholson’s video essay condemning the project as an ill-conceived cash grab amassed more than 10 million views, seemingly due to its ability to tap into the mounting “frustrations” fans have with the parks, she says. These frustrations can be best summarized as the distinct feeling that guests are being cheated. Since the parks temporarily shut down in 2020, the company has slowly eliminated beloved amenities such as early park hours for resort guests, or free transportation from the airport to Disney hotels, or ways for fans to skip lines for free, all while steadily boosting ticket prices. “There seems to be a lot more push toward short-term profits as opposed to the overall longevity and reputation of the company,” says Nicholson. As a result of the skyrocketing prices, guests are increasingly shying away from the parks. On an August 2024 earnings call, CFO Hugh Johnston indicated that there had been a three percent decrease, or “a bit of a slowdown,” in operating income at the domestic parks during the third quarter. He added that the company anticipated a similar decline in earnings in future quarters, downplaying it as “a slight moderation in demand.” Such an admission must be particularly galling for the company in light of its arch rival, Universal Studios, building a massive theme park expansion called Epic Universe just a few miles away from Kissimmee, Florida, where Walt Disney World parks and resorts are located. One theme park journalist told me that over the past decade, Disney’s Imagineering division — the department focused on creating new theme-park rides and attractions — has focused too much on capitalizing on lucrative IP, such as the Star Wars and Marvel franchises, and less on creativity. “Where [consumers] sit, in 2024, we’re just after who’s innovating and who’s giving us thrills and spending money,” the journalist said. “And that’s Universal by far.” Disney’s overreliance on existing IP has been a source of frustration for fans for close to a decade — and if you look at the company’s slate of upcoming releases, it does not seem that they plan to pivot anytime soon. During the August 2024 call, Johnston noted that the downward trends in parks would likely be offset by the entertainment division, including the upcoming releases of highly anticipated films like the CGI-animated Lion King prequel Mufasa, and Moana 2. Citing those two examples is telling: Both are based on existing Disney IP, only emphasizing that the company has become overly reliant on adapting preexisting material, rather than generating new and fresh ideas. “Disney only has a few rabbits in their sleeve when it comes to bringing people to the movies,” one former employee told me. “There’s only so many animated films they can turn [into] live action. There’s only so many rides they can turn into films.” The quality, the former employee said, “is just not there anymore.” Ultimately, however, in speaking to various fans and insiders of all stripes, Disney’s decline can be boiled down to one crucial factor: arrogance. Having achieved market primacy for so long, and having garnered such a rabidly devoted and demographically wide-ranging fan base, there is an overwhelming sense that there is nothing Disney can possibly do to lose its hold over the public imagination. To adapt a famous 2016 election-era Trump boast, if Bob Iger stood in the middle of Main Street and shot Goofy in broad daylight, the company would probably lose some fans — but certainly not all. Its guiding ethos appears to be bolstered by the sense that it is simply too big to fail in any meaningful way. But if its recent string of failures are any indication, for one of the few times in the company’s history, it may not be right. ONCE, WHEN I WAS IN MY very early twenties, I was on a vacation with my family and we got into a fight. I can’t remember what it was about, but I was distraught enough that I needed to not be with them at the time. So I stalked off into the distance, sniffling and shaking and ignoring my phone calls, in search of someplace where I had always felt safe. And I ended up on the It’s a Small World ride. As my Friendship Boat gently rocked through the water, the intoxicating chlorine fragrance intermingling with that of the microwaved pizza from Pinocchio’s Village Haus next door, and animatronic kiwis and flying fish and can-can girls winking at me from the plasticine shores, it suddenly occurred to me how insane this all was. In a moment of emotional turmoil, I had not retreated into meditation or drugs or alcohol or cognitive behavioral therapy or any of the other tactics at my disposal. Instead, I’d beelined, as if by mammalian instinct, like a dying elephant making its way across the savannah, to a 1965 World’s Fair exhibition sponsored by Pepsi. Why had I done this? What was this going to offer me? How was this going to make me feel better? This wasn’t even an E-ticket attraction. There are about a million reasons I can think of to point out why It’s a Small World should not be emotionally effective. It’s long. It’s boring. It is built around a conception of global unity that does not celebrate cultural and political differences but completely eradicates them, as represented in the ride’s final tableau showing all the children of the world clad in the same generic white outfits, singing and holding hands, looking like a Benetton ad as conceived by the Hare Krishnas. Its primary designer, Mary Blair, was a genius whose artistic gifts were sublimated by the misogyny of the Disney company, resulting in a life of thwarted ambition that led to her early death from alcoholism-related dementia. And of course, there’s the song, two relentlessly peppy melodies played over the same set of chords, written by the songwriting duo the Sherman Brothers, who also wrote the music for The Parent Trap, Mary Poppins, and The Jungle Book. It’s frequently voted among the most annoying in history, even though it’s probably less so than Walt’s original proposal for the ride, which was to have all the children of the world sing the national anthem in their native tongues simultaneously. But no matter how many reasons I can come up with for why It’s a Small World should not move me, no matter how much I cringe when I think about sobbing on a boat ride surrounded by animatronic children, one fact remains: I am still moved. The idea that a group of disparate people from various backgrounds — a brilliant yet frustrated alcoholic, Russian Jewish immigrant brothers, a raging anti-communist and probable antisemite — could come together and present such a simple and united vision of children as a force for peace, is deeply moving to me. The idea that Walt Disney — a man who sold a vision of optimism and progressivism, yet was so contemptuous of his employees’ right to unionize that he voluntarily testified against them in the 1947 HUAC hearings, even firing the animator who created Goofy; the man who is perhaps most responsible for contempt for the little guy being integrated into Disney’s DNA — could set aside his own noxious politics to help present a vision of a better world for children is deeply moving to me. The reminder that we were all children once, that we all started out believing in a better world, undergirds so much of Disney’s best work. I’m thinking of the final scene in Mary Poppins, when the wealth-and-status-obsessed banker father finally presents his children with the kite they’d been begging him to mend; or the moment in Snow White and the Seven Dwarves when the orphan Snow White has narrowly escaped a violent death, and she’s scared and alone in the forest until she meets a bunch of woodland creatures and vows to stay resolute, the chirpy orchestral chorus for “With a Smile and a Song.” “There’s no use in grumbling when raindrops come tumbling/Remember you’re the one who can fill the world with sunshine,” she sings, as the bunnies wag their tails and the chipmunks scrunch their noses and the birds marvel at the beauty and the robustness of the human spirit. Every time I sing those words to my own kids — and I mean every time — I can’t help but tear up a little bit. Because it’s not a message of blind optimism or shiny, happy ignorance in the face of despair or anything else people like to accuse the Disney corporation of promoting — or which it has arguably promoted in its approach to things like the Don’t Say Gay legislation. It’s a message of power. You are the one who can fill the world with sunshine. You are the one who can use your own imagination to remake the world however you see fit. It’s a message I wish I had taken more to heart when I was an anxious, sad, scared little kid; I wish I had believed that I could have built my own magic. Frankly, had I done so, it probably would have saved my parents a lot of money. Over and over and over again, I continue to give Disney money, because Disney continues to make things that move me. I believe in Disney magic. I believe in the power of smart, creative people coming together to tell good stories in new and interesting ways, to teach us who we are and who we were and who we would like to be; and in the capacity to reinvent the world as long as there is imagination left in it.

Wall Street is heading for a lower open on the first day of October. The S&P 500 had a positive September for the first time in five years. September is historically the worst month of the year. With a 5.5% gain in the third quarter, the S&P 500 enters the seasonally bullish period into year-end up nearly 21% in 2024. 2. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Monday the central bank is not on a preset easing course, signaling smaller rate moves going forward after September's 50-basis-point cut. The next big event that could influence the Fed and the stock market comes Friday when the government releases its September employment report. 3. Pivotal Research initiated Club stocks Meta Platforms and Alphabet with buy ratings and respective price targets of $780 per share (35% upside to Monday's close) and $215 (28% upside). The analysts see strong revenue growth ahead for Meta and a "deep moat" competitively at Alphabet. 4. Citi raised its Medtronic price target to $92 per share from $85, though analysts remained cautious. The best medtech alternative is Club name GE Healthcare, which has a newly FDA approved diagnostic agent and a tailwind from Fed rate cuts going for it. GEHC shares have been a top performer in our portfolio lately. 5. Stephens started Club name Danaher with an overweight buy rating and a $315-per-share price target, implying roughly 13% upside. The analysts see a pickup in biotech funding and Chinese economic stimulus as positives, putting the life sciences giant in a better position next year. 6. Barclays said Apple is seeing weak demand for its new AI-ready iPhone 16. Club members know that I am always skeptical of these so-called channel checks. I have said it over and over again, the expected robust upgrade does not have to happen all at once. 7. Citi upgraded Anheuser-Busch Inbev to buy from neutral. Is a large buyback coming? In beer, we own Modelo and Corona brewer Constellation Brands, which reports earnings before Thursday's opening bell. Constellation reset expectations last month and the market took it in stride. We want to see what's next. 8. KeyBanc raised its Netflix price target to $760 per share from $735. Who would have thought that of the FANG and "Magnificent Seven" stocks the video streaming giant would be the best? Meanwhile, Raymond James downgraded Club name Disney to a market perform hold rating. The analysts are concerned about the moderating parks business. 9. East Coast and Gulf Coast union port workers went on strike after a midnight labor contract deadline came and went. It was the first walkout by the International Longshoremen's Association since 1977. Costco and Home Depot were among the Club names that were preparing for the work stoppage. 10. Wells Fargo cut its Boeing price target to $110 per share from $119 and kept its sell-equivalent rating on the aircraft maker. Boeing factory workers have been striking for nearly three weeks. Bloomberg reported that Boeing is thinking about a $10 billion equity raise.

Title: CVS Health to lay off nearly 3,000 workers in cost-cutting drive | CNN Business

Time Published: 2024-10-01T12:42:52Z

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: CVS Health is planning to cut about 2,900 jobs in an effort to slash costs, the US health care company said Tuesday. “We’ve embarked on a multi-year initiative to deliver $2 billion in cost savings by reducing expenses and investing in technologies to enhance how we work,” a spokesperson said in a statement. The layoffs represent less than 1% of CVS Health’s (CVS) workforce. “Impacted positions are primarily corporate roles. The reductions will not impact front-line jobs in our stores, pharmacies and distribution centers,” the spokesperson added. The job cuts at the company, which runs a network of pharmacies across the United States among other businesses, add to the 5,000 or so layoffs disclosed last year. In 2021, CVS Health announced that it would close around 900 stores between 2022 and 2024. “Our industry faces continued disruption, regulatory pressures and evolving consumer needs and expectations,” the spokesperson said Tuesday. Related article Why Walgreens, CVS and Rite Aid are closing thousands of drug stores across America US drug store chains are struggling because of falling reimbursement rates for prescription drugs, according to analysts who cover the industry. At the same time, the front end of drug stores, where snacks and household staples are sold, has become less profitable as shoppers buy more of these items online from Amazon and at big-box chains such as Walmart, Target and Costco. Dollar General’s growth has also hurt drug store chains in rural areas. CVS Health, which already uses artificial intelligence in some of its businesses, is making additional investments in the increasingly popular technology, as well as in robotics, “to further automate, reduce cost and improve the experience for all of its constituents,” according to its latest annual report.

Title: Allurion reports average 12.5% weight loss in latest study
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/allurion-reports-average-125-weight-loss-in-latest-study-93CH-3642683
Time Published: 2024-10-01T12:12:49Z
Full Content:
NATICK, Mass. - Allurion Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: ALUR), a medical technology company focused on obesity treatment, has published a systematic review and meta-analysis that demonstrates the effectiveness and safety of their Allurion Program. The analysis, which synthesized data from 11 observational studies involving 2,107 patients between 2016 and 2024, revealed an average weight reduction of 12.5% and a significant decrease in body mass index (BMI) of 4.75 kg/m2 after four months of using the Allurion Balloon. Dr. Ram Chuttani, Chief Medical Officer and Founding Partner of Allurion, emphasized the importance of the findings, stating that the meta-analysis not only confirms the weight loss and BMI reduction outcomes but also highlights the metabolic health benefits associated with the program. These benefits include improvements in HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and glycemia levels. The Allurion Balloon, a key component of the Allurion Program, is a swallowable and procedure-less intragastric balloon designed to aid weight loss. It is complemented by the Allurion Virtual Care Suite, which includes a mobile app for consumers, insights for healthcare providers, and a connected scale. The program has been documented in 26 peer-reviewed journal articles and has been used by over 150,000 patients globally. While the Allurion Gastric Balloon is still considered an investigational device in the United States, the company reports a low rate of serious adverse events at just 0.90%. This data is based on the press release statement by Allurion Technologies and is intended to inform about the recent findings related to the Allurion Program. The full study can be accessed through a published article in a peer-reviewed journal. Investors and those following the medical technology sector may note that Allurion's approach to weight loss is part of a broader trend in the industry towards non-surgical and digitally supported therapies. However, as with all medical treatments, outcomes can vary, and regulatory approvals play a significant role in the availability and adoption of new technologies. In other recent news, Allurion Technologies reported a 25% increase in its second-quarter revenue to $11.8 million. Despite this, the company revised its full-year 2024 revenue guidance downward to $40 to $45 million due to regulatory and macroeconomic challenges. Roth/MKM recently initiated coverage on Allurion with a Buy rating, highlighting the potential U.S. approval of the company's weight-loss balloon. Chardan Capital Markets also maintained a Buy rating on Allurion's stock but reduced the price target to $2.50. Allurion has appointed Keith Johns to its Board of Directors, who brings extensive experience from the metabolic drug industry. The company reported safe and sustained weight loss in adolescents and patients using its Allurion Program, according to recent studies. However, Allurion faces a potential delisting from the New York Stock Exchange due to non-compliance with the exchange's minimum share price requirement, but plans to address this issue within the allotted six-month cure period. These are some of the recent developments for Allurion Technologies. While Allurion Technologies' meta-analysis demonstrates promising results for its weight loss program, the company's financial health presents a more complex picture. According to InvestingPro data, Allurion's market capitalization stands at $39.45 million, reflecting its position as a smaller player in the medical technology sector. Despite the company's impressive gross profit margin of 76.19% for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, which aligns with the high-value nature of its innovative weight loss solutions, Allurion faces significant challenges. An InvestingPro Tip indicates that the company is "quickly burning through cash," which could be a concern for investors considering the capital-intensive nature of medical technology development and commercialization. Another InvestingPro Tip reveals that analysts anticipate a sales decline in the current year, with revenue growth showing a negative 23.59% in the last twelve months. This projection contrasts with the positive clinical outcomes reported in the meta-analysis, suggesting a potential gap between clinical success and market penetration. It's worth noting that InvestingPro offers 14 additional tips for Allurion Technologies, providing a more comprehensive view of the company's financial situation and market position. These insights could be particularly valuable for investors looking to understand the full picture beyond clinical data. This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links. Sony has revealed that it already used machine learning in developing the 2023 game. By Hayley Williams on October 1, 2024 at 5:07AM PDT Sony's plans to augment its game-development process with AI and machine learning is already underway, the company revealed in its 2024 Company Report. In one example cited in the report, Sony used machine learning to augment the subtitling process for certain languages in Marvel's Spider-Man 2. Sony has revealed it used voice-recognition software to automatically synchronize subtitles with their corresponding voice lines in certain languages, dramatically reducing the speed of the subtitling process. Spider-Man 2 launched with text support for 27 languages, with 12 of those also available in fully dubbed audio. The company said that this use of machine learning, a subset of AI computing, was part of a broader plan to "[deliver] our IP rapidly and at low cost to a broader range of fans." The segment of the report focuses on technologies that have the potential to improve efficiency in development processes, including AI and machine learning as well as real-time 3D processing, and sensing and capturing technology. Sony isn't the first to include AI in its development workflow, and it definitely won't be the last. EA has spoken on using AI in the development of this year's College Football 25 to automatically create models for the thousands of players who were included in the game. Microsoft is also all-in on AI, as is Amazon Games. Nintendo is one of the few major players in the industry to speak out against the use of AI in game development at this point. While so many companies are excited about the potential for AI in game development, few have touched on the potential impact it may have on the industry's human workforce, even as sweeping layoffs continue to impact developers and support staff across the industry. Video-game voice actors and mo-cap performers are currently on strike, with the use of AI a key concern for union SAG-AFTRA. Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

A Closer Look at the Spread of Algorithmic Management Systems—Which Contributed to $8 Billion in Turnover Costs and a 45% Injury Rate at Amazon—Across Corporate America Man lying on the floor. Accident in warehouse With the help of digital technology, machines can perform complex managerial tasks, like supervising employees and assessing job candidates. It is no wonder that 57% of workers expect AI to change the way they do their current job, and 36% expect it to go as far as replacing their current job. With employees often described as a business’s most important assets and human capital a key factor in economic competitiveness, investors and policymakers alike must understand and manage the risks to businesses and workers stemming from the deployment of digital technologies. And because JUST Capital research shows that 51% of workers at Russell 1000 companies, who make up 15% of the employed population in the US in 2021, are not earning a living wage, defined as sufficient to afford a decent standard of living for the worker and his or her family in a particular place, long-term investors must also understand and mitigate the harms that AI can cause to low-wage workers. While there has been a recent surge of interest in and funding for AI safety or mitigating catastrophic societal-scale threats of uncontrolled AI systems, ex/ante founder and managing partner Zoe Weinberg explains that more proximate harms—like discrimination, bias, and fairness—are taking back seat. The time has come for long-term investors to take the drivers’ seat to first understand and address these harms. The ways in which AI can impact job quality are manifold. This article—the first in a series on AI and the workplace—focuses on algorithmic management, the delegation of managerial functions to algorithms in an organization, which is becoming an important part of AI-driven digital transformation of companies. This article closely examines the impact of algorithmic management on Amazon to illustrate why algorithmic management systems should matter across portfolios to all investors. The Promise of Algorithmic Management Systems Organizations increasingly rely on algorithmic-based HR decision-making to monitor employees, driven in part by the technology industry’s claims that its decision-making tools are efficient and objective. Algorithmic management systems can increase the scale of management operations: matching Uber’s 149 million riders with its over 7 million drivers in 10,000 cities across 70 countries through algorithms is indeed unprecedented. Companies also harness algorithms to increase efficiency: UPS trucks have long been equipped with computers that give drivers advice and filled with sensors that record when drivers open doors, buckle their seat belts, and back up their trucks. In addition, algorithmic management systems can make employees more effective: MetLife call center workers receive real-time feedback from AI on whether they are not empathetic enough, sound tired, or speak too quickly. A Slippery Slope A slippery slope of mud and melting snow. Photo Tim Clayton (Photo by Tim Clayton/Corbis via Getty ... [+] Images) However, researchers from MIT find that focusing solely on efficiency can lower employee satisfaction, wellbeing, and performance in the long-run by treating workers like “cogs in a machine” or triggering employees to continue working to the point of exhaustion. As Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR), a coalition of faith-based and values-based investors, and OpenMIC, a nonprofit focused on responsible use of digital technologies, explain in their new report, Dehumanization, Discrimination and Deskilling: The Impact of Digital Tech on Low-Wage Workers, a critical element of algorithmic management systems is the monitoring and surveillance of workers in violation of their human rights. More specifically, the report outlines a number of human rights impacted by digital technologies, including right to privacy (Article 12 in the 1948 Universal Declaration on Human Rights) and occupational safety and health (ILO Convention 155 in 1981 and 187 in 2006). Why This Should Matter to Investors Worker well-being, satisfaction, and human rights should matter to all investors. When algorithmic management systems detract from them, the resulting higher worker turnover, higher injury rates, increasing regulatory fines and sanctions, and increasing regulation can materially dampen long-term value creation. Tying Worker Satisfaction and Safety to the Financial Statements at Amazon Skillful worker attending brief meeting in the factory . Industrial people and manufacturing labor ... [+] concept . Amazon—the second largest private employer in the US and the fourth largest US company by market capitalization—is worth closely examining because of the scale of the impact of algorithmic management on labor wellbeing and shareholder value. The lessons learned from this close examination are relevant to other companies that also use algorithmic management. Over the past couple of years, researchers, investigators, lawmakers, and workers have been reinforcing each other’s claims that Amazon’s high injury rates are linked to the company’s workplace productivity quotas and surveillance practices. For example, Amazon warehouse worker Daniel Olayiwola, who became the first warehouse worker in corporate history to present his own resolution at Amazon’s annual shareholder meeting in 2022, highlighted the dangers of Amazon’s “Time Off Task” (TOT) policy, which tracks the amount of time per day to the minute that workers do not scan products (including during bathroom breaks), its rate system, the number of products that employees scan per hour, and algorithmic firing based on TOT and rates. During the pandemic, the New York Times reported 3% turnover a week or 150% turnover a year, which means that on average Amazon had to replace its entire workforce every eight months. According to leaked internal documents marked “Amazon Confidential” that tech news website Engadget reviewed and reported on, the cost of attrition was an estimated $8 billion annually for Amazon in 2021—nearly 25% of Amazon’s 2021 net profit of $33 billion. Engadget further reported that regretted attrition, or workers choosing to leave the company, occurred twice as often as unregretted attrition, or layoffs and firings, and that only one out of three new hires in 2021 stayed with the company for 90 or more days. Amazon’s announcement last week to increase the average total compensation package for fulfillment and transportation employees in the US to over $29 per hour—Amazon’s largest ever investment of over $2.2 billion in pay and benefits—may be a cost-effective way to reduce the $8 billion cost of employee turnover or said differently, it may be hazard pay. Because it’s challenging to update information gleaned from leaked confidential documents, and we must try to understand worker satisfaction and algorithmic monitoring following the pandemic, let’s also discuss the interim report released by the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, which was investigating workplace safety. According to the report, during Prime Day week in 2019, Amazon’s rate of recordable injuries—the injuries that Amazon is required to disclose to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)—was over 10 injuries per 100 workers. In addition, the report explains that Amazon’s total injury rate, which includes injuries that the company is not required to disclose to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), was nearly 45 injuries per 100 workers during the week of Prime Day in 2019. That is almost half of the company’s warehouse workers! The report highlighted that although Amazon’s total injury rate includes minor injuries, such as bruises and superficial cuts, it also includes serious injuries, such as torn rotator cuffs and concussions, which the company should have treated as recordable injuries. Amazon examined the issue closely in a memo titled “2021 Prime Day Lessons Learned,” which analyzes staffing performance for the period leading up to Prime Day in 2021. As context, Amazon had 117,300 employees in 2013, growing steadily to the peak of 1.6 million in 2021 before declining in 2022 and 2023 to 1.5 million. The document states that Amazon had only a 54.7% success rate meeting its hiring target from the end of March through the beginning of May in 2021. That means Amazon filled barely more than half of the positions it needed to fill to have fully staffed warehouses during that period. From the beginning of May through the end of June—ending the week of Prime Day—the company met only 71.2%. Indeed, worker satisfaction and worker safety are deeply intertwined. Tying Worker Satisfaction and Safety to Regulatory Risk at Amazon Organization and transportation in the warehouse Several states, including New York and California, passed bills that require companies to disclose production quotas to warehouse workers and prevent companies from retaliating against employees for failing to meet undocumented quotas. US Senator Edward Markey (D-Mass) earlier this month introduced the Warehouse Worker Protection Act at a federal level, which if passed would require companies to provide written notice to workers of quotas and prohibits dangerous quotas, including those that rely on constant surveillance. In addition, the Stop Spying Bosses Act, introduced by US Senators Bob Casey (D-PA), Cory Booker (D-NJ), and Brian Schatz (D-HI), would require any employer collecting data on employees or applicants to disclose such information in a timely and public manner, prohibit employers from collecting sensitive data on individuals (i.e., off-duty data collection, data collection that interferes with organizing, etc.), create rules around the usage of automated decision systems to empower workers in employment decisions, and establish the Privacy and Technology Division at the Department of Labor to enforce and regulate workplace surveillance as novel technologies evolve and grow. As a case in point, two warehouses violating California’s Warehouse Quotas law cost Amazon $5.9 million in June 2024 alone. If passed, the federal bills would expand the scope of costly fines. The biggest threat to Amazon is likely to be action by government regulatory bodies. Amazon’s largest regulatory fine was EUR 746 million (US$887 million) in 2021 for violating the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a European privacy law. More recently, in January 2024, French regulator CNIL fined Amazon France Logistique EUR 32 million (US$35 million) for an “excessively intrusive” surveillance system: CNIL said that tracking the inactivity of employees’ scanners was illegal and that the system set up to measure the speed at which items were scanned as “excessive.” As US regulation catches up to EU regulation on AI and privacy, regulatory risk could weigh down Amazon stock price, which at $187.99 per share nears all-time highs. Spreading Like a Virus Coronavirus Covid-19 Amazon is not alone. Algorithmic management systems are pervasive. According to researchers at the UC Berkeley Labor Center, across the country, employers are increasingly using data and algorithms in ways that stand to have profound consequences for wages, working conditions, and equity. Countless workplace surveillance systems collect data about worker activities through a wide variety of means, including handheld devices, point-of-sale systems, mobile phones, fingerprint scanners, fitness apps, wellness apps, smart cameras, microphones, and body sensors, according to Aiha Nguyen, who explores the future of labor for Data & Society, a nonprofit research organization. Nguyen says algorithmic management systems enable “work speedups, employment insecurity and instability, a shift of risks of and costs from employers to workers,” among other issues. The AI-driven digital transformation of companies is only beginning, and it would behoove long-term investors to understand and shape it. This series of articles—which will also cover exploitation of data workers, the gig economy, and automated hiring tools—aims to do just that. Investors that can proactively identify and reduce exposure to these harms in their portfolios should be better able to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns and immunize their portfolios from regulatory risk.

We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Stocks to Buy for Long Term. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other stocks. On September 23, Chris Watling, Longview Economics founder, CEO, and chief market strategist, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the rate easing path and the impact it may have on the market. According to Walting, the market is deeply divided on not two but three different sides. While some analysts and investors foresee a recession, others believe the economy is going towards a soft landing, and of those a small minority believe that the economy may accelerate at a rapid pace. Walting also added that while predicting the appropriate terminal rate is interesting, there is a lot more going on with the economy. Comparing economic conditions to the 2008 recession, households and corporations are in much better shape, hinting that a recession may not be the most likely outcome. He believes that the economy may be slowing right now but it may experience faster reacceleration than before without the need for further falls. His advice to investors is to judge the economy based on multiple data points. As for the appropriate portfolio, Walting suggests that bonds are overcooked and gold must be given a pause. At the moment, the market is rotating away from tech into defensive sectors, and in the future, it may rotate more towards cyclical stocks. As the S&P 500 recorded an upside following the Fed's easing cycle, investors and analysts alike eye a soft landing for the economy. On September 26, Liz Miller, Summit Place Financial Advisors founder and president, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the future of markets. Miller states that the pivot has been great for the financial markets and now that the Fed is thinking about growth, investors are hopeful of a soft landing. She suggests that stocks in sectors such as housing, rental, finance, and consumer goods may benefit immensely from the easing interest rate cycle. Miller suggests that the S&P 500 is not the best way to measure the performance of financial markets, given that it is skewed to the mega-cap tech stocks. Looking at other indices, other sectors have not made highs since December 2021. She believes the market may be flat but there is huge potential for upsides. Miller shares concerns over the Chinese economy and how it influences the global outlook. She suggests that for the global economy to balance, companies must work to regain consumer confidence in China. Now that we have studied the appropriate portfolio mix for investors following the Fed's decision, let's take a look at the 7 best stocks to buy for the long term. Our Methodology To come up with the 7 best stocks to buy for the long term we examined promising stocks hedge funds are piling into. These are blue chip stocks with wide moats and have long track records of driving shareholder returns. We have ranked the stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 308 Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a technology company that specializes in e-commerce, online retail, streaming, and data cloud services. Its e-commerce platform is functional in 20 countries and ships to over 100 countries. Its proprietary cloud service, Amazon Web Services, on the other hand, is used by millions of active customers and has over 130,000 AWS partners across 200 countries. The company is on track to capture over 40% of the e-commerce market in the United States. As for its cloud segment, AWS has logged 30% plus operating margins consistently for the past five quarters, making it a star performer. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also making strides on the AI front. Over the past few months, the company has partnered with AI startups like Anthropic and signed deals with the US government to test new AI models. As for AI hardware, the company has produced several AI chips to reduce its dependence on other companies. Speaking of AI, AWS is now housing the next generation of Llama models from Meta, giving customers more choices to build, deploy, and scale generative AI applications. The new models are capable of visual reasoning, document processing, and multilingual translation. Amazon’s growth is undeniable which explains its position on our list. Analysts are bullish on AMZN and their 12-month median price target of $220 points to a 17% upside from current levels. Overall, AMZN was held by 308 hedge funds and Fisher Asset Management was the largest shareholder, according to the Insider Monkey database. Meridian Hedged Equity Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: "Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a global technology company that operates e-commerce, cloud computing, digital advertising, and other businesses. We own Amazon because we believe it is well-positioned to benefit from several strong secular trends, including the shift to online shopping, the growth of cloud computing, and the increasing importance of digital advertising. The company exceeded expectations in the first quarter, with cloud-computing revenue growth accelerating, driven by easing cost optimization pressures and the ramp of generative AI workloads. The North American retail segment drove record operating margins, highlighting the success of Amazon’s efforts to improve efficiency and lower its cost to serve. International retail also showed promise, as emerging markets steadily progressed towards profitability. Given the strength across these key segments, we continue to hold the position in the company." Overall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the best stocks to buy for long term. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Culture Wars And Unconstitutional Laws: The Threat To America's Future
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffraikes/2024/10/01/culture-wars-and-unconstitutional-laws-the-threat-to-americas-future/
Time Published: 2024-10-01T10:00:40Z
Full Content:
Ill-advised and unconstitutional ideological crusades by conservative state legislators are infringing on the rights of American businesses and endangering America's future. Climate change, conceptual illustration. The Climate Crisis is Here… It's no secret that the accelerating impacts of climate change are being felt worldwide. 2024 is likely to be the warmest year in recorded history, and nine of the hottest years on record have all been in the last decade. To take just one example, residents of Phoenix, Arizona experienced 113 days in a row this summer with over 100-degree temperatures. With hotter days come more extreme weather events. In what was billed as a once-in-a-1000-year event, Sarasota, Florida and its environs experienced as much as ten inches of rain in just 24 hours this past June. (This followed once-in-a-millennium rainstorms in St. Louis, Kentucky, Death Valley in 2022, and Fort Lauderdale in 2023.) July saw Hurricane Beryl become the earliest-ever Category 5 hurricane to develop in the Atlantic. Last week, after another once–in–a–thousand–year rainstorm in Western NC, Hurricane Helene devastated the Southeast, bringing catastrophic flooding to Appalachian cities. As climate impacts become increasingly extreme, we are collectively racing against time to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions before we reach 1.5 degrees of warming. The good news is the global renewable energy boom is here. With costs coming down and technology improving, the world will install an estimated 593 gigawatts of solar capacity this year, nearly 30% more than in 2023 and six times more than in 2019. Here in the U.S., led by California and Texas, we now have eight times more solar power and twice as much wind power as a decade ago. Battery storage capacity is also expected to nearly double this year, meaning more renewable energy can be saved and used whenever needed. …But Texas Legislators Would Halt Our Progress Since its oil boom days, Texas has always been an energy leader, and these days are no exception – Texas now leads the country in wind power and is second only to California in solar. The clean energy transition is crucial for the Lone Star state since Texas is especially threatened by warming temperatures and hurricanes. Its statewide energy grid is also increasingly overwhelmed: Texas suffered 210 power outages between 2020 and 2023, more than any other state. So, given the urgent necessity of decarbonizing our energy grid and Texas's role as a renewable energy leader, why have its lawmakers been trying to sabotage progress against climate change? In 2021, Texas conservatives passed S.B. 13, a misguided and arguably unconstitutional law requiring all state entities, like pension funds and the K-12 education endowment, to divest any business that has moved away from supporting fossil fuels. Meant as an ideological attack against the growing move towards Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investing, S.B. 13, according to a study by the Texas Association of Business, cost Texas nearly $700 million in lost economic activity, $181 million in annual earnings, more than 3000 full-time jobs, and more than $37 million in tax revenues in F.Y. 2022-2023. S.B. 13's ideological crusade also prompted five of the largest underwriters for municipal bonds in Texas – JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Bank of America, and Fidelity – to exit the Texas market, meaning much higher borrowing costs for Texas cities. These five banks "used to underwrite about 35% of the debt in the market," notes Wharton Business professor Daniel Garrett, "so they've left a really big gap." The Texas public school fund also pulled $8.5 billion from Blackrock to comply with the law. Last month, supported by Democracy Forward, the American Sustainable Business Council (ASBC) filed a lawsuit against S.B. 13 and a similar law, S.B. 19, which forces state funds to divest from companies that restrict business with gunmakers. "SB-13 is not just a misguided policy," says David Levine, president and co-founder of ASBC. "It is an unconstitutional attack that stifles free speech and punishes businesses for prioritizing responsible investments." In fact, an Oklahoma District Court Judge has already struck down Oklahoma's anti-ESG law for similar reasons. As Chris Tomlinson wrote in the Houston Chronicle of this "unconstitutional, authoritarian power grab that hurts all Texans," "whether you worry about climate change or not, the real issue is whether the government should dictate any company's investment strategy. True conservatives believe elected officials should stay out of private sector decisions." It's Not Just Texas. Unfortunately, Texas lawmakers are not alone in these attempts to hamstring American businesses. Per Reuters, 2022 saw at least 44 new bills or laws in 17 red states that attempted to penalize companies for investment strategies or behaviors they deemed too progressive, up from a dozen in 2021. Among these was Florida Governor Ron DeSantis's infamous "Stop WOKE Act," which attempted to ban workplace trainings on improving race relations and which a federal judge permanently blocked in July. Similarly, the Republican-controlled House in Georgia passed a bill cutting tax breaks for Delta Airlines, the state's largest private employer, after its CEO lambasted new voting restrictions there. (The bill failed to pass the Senate.) Even more frightening, the anti-ESG push has now been taken up by the authors of Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation blueprint to supercharge a second Trump presidency. In their report, they call for Trump's Department of Labor to "remove ESG considerations from ERISA," the law setting minimum standards for pension and health plans. After deriding ESG for taking into account woke causes like "reducing greenhouse gas emissions," the Project 2025 report decrees that "DOL should prohibit investing in ERISA plans on the basis of any factors that are unrelated to investor risks and returns." However, considering the impacts of climate change is precisely the type of long-term risk that businesses and investors should be evaluating to protect their returns and financial health. Of course, the government plays an indispensable role in regulating companies, so they follow the law, do right by their workers and communities, and don't conduct business with America's enemies. But trying to force U.S. companies, by law, to uphold far-right conservative ideology is simply a bridge too far. It is, in a word, unconstitutional. And amidst a global climate crisis that threatens all Americans, especially those most vulnerable in our society, these misguided ideological crusades don't just jeopardize our future prosperity and global competitiveness—they endanger our communities, economy, and planet.

Title: The 2024 Forbes 400: The 25 Wealthiest People In America

Itwas another great year to be rich, especially for the select few at the very top. With markets roaring, nearly all of the 25 wealthiest people in America got wealthier over the past 12 months—some by billions, or even tens of billions, of dollars. In all, the top 25 billionaires on The Forbes 400 list are worth a collective $2.5 trillion. They hold nearly half of the $5.4 trillion in total wealth of the entire 400. This elite group is $471 billion richer than in 2023, with each of the top 25 up 31% on average, outpacing the 18% jump in wealth across list members overall and the S&P 500’s 27% return. Much of the gains come from two people: Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, who added $75 billion to his net worth thanks to rebounding Meta stock, and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, who has ridden the AI wave to $63.3 billion in additional wealth since the 2023 ranking. They’re two of a record 12 members of The Forbes 400 who are also in the $100 Billion Club, the lucky group of tycoons whose fortunes stretch a dozen digits. Most of these 25 were among the top 25 last year, too. But there are three fresh faces: traders Jeff Yass (who ranked No. 28 in 2023) and Thomas Peterffy (who was No. 27), plus Walmart heir Lukas Walton, who jumped from No. 31 last year to No. 25 in 2024 on the back of the retailer’s rising stock. They replace MacKenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Jeff Bezos, who continues to give away her fortune; Miriam Adelson, whose shares of casino operator Las Vegas Sands have hit a cold streak; and investor Len Blavatnik, whose stock in Warner Music Group is worth less than a year ago. Zuckerberg jumped five spots, to No. 3; Huang jumped six, to No. 11. Only three members of the top 25 got poorer over the past year: Elon Musk, whose fortune dropped by $7 billion but who remains the richest person in America; Bill Gates, after we increased our estimate of his 2021 divorce settlement with Melinda French Gates; and Phil Knight, following a rough run for Nike stock since last year. Here are the top 25 members of the 2024 Forbes 400 list: One of Sam Walton’s eight grandchildren, he inherited an estimated 4% stake in Walmart from his father, John Walton, who died in a 2005 plane crash. Lukas, who survived childhood cancer, founded and runs Builders Vision, a sustainability-focused philanthropic and impact-investing platform that has doled out more than $3 billion since launching in 2021. He is one of just two Forbes 400 members under age 40 (the other: VC investor Josh Kushner, No. 347, who is 39). His mother, Christy Walton (No. 48), cosigned a letter urging President Biden to withdraw from the 2024 election in July and has been fundraising for Kamala Harris. Two members of the family’s third generation still sit on Walmart’s board: Jim’s son Steuart Walton (Lukas’ first cousin) and Rob’s son-in-law Greg Penner, who is chairman. “On the doorsteps of the Olympic Games,” Knight wrote this summer in a letter to U.S. athletes, whose jerseys Nike designed, “we need to reignite the passion, desire and the want to win.” His sportswear giant could use a pep talk, too. Nike stock is down 15% since last year, making Knight, who created the company with his University of Oregon track coach in 1964, one of just three in the Top 25 to be poorer than in 2023. Peterffy is more than $10 billion richer than last year as shares of Interactive Brokers Group, the electronic trading firm he founded in 1993, rose 30%. The company booked $4.3 billion in revenue last year, a 42% year-over-year increase. Since he failed to persuade Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin to enter the Republican presidential primary race, Peterffy, a longtime supporter of free-market policies, has kept quiet on Trump’s reelection bid. Griffin’s hedge fund, Citadel, the most profitable of all time, raked in $8.1 billion in trading profits last year. Since then, Griffin, never one to leave money idle, has donated $50 million to the University of Miami, dropped $45 million on a Stegosaurus skeleton (a record price in the dinosaur auction business) and shelled out more than $90 million for an estate in Saint-Tropez, France. In August, Schwarzman and his wife announced plans to open their Miramar estate in Newport, Rhode Island, to the public as a museum upon their deaths. They spent $27 million on the Gilded Age mansion in 2021 and have been restoring it ever since. In May, Schwarzman, the cofounder and CEO of $1 trillion (assets) investment firm Blackstone, announced he’s backing Trump for president, two years after vowing to support someone else in 2024. In August, their Mars Inc. announced it’s gobbling up snack and cereal maker Kellanova (formerly Kellogg’s) for $35.9 billion. The deal will put brands like Pringles, Pop-Tarts and Froot Loops under the Mars umbrella alongside Snickers, M&M’s and Kind bars. It’s the company’s biggest acquisition since it bought Wrigley in 2008 for $23 billion. The Mars siblings own an estimated two-thirds of the $50 billion (2023 revenue) business but have no role in daily operations. Yass’ fortune nearly doubled after Forbes revalued his trading firm, Susquehanna International Group—and Yass’ share of profits—based on tax returns leaked to ProPublica. With a potential TikTok ban threatening Susquehanna’s estimated 15% stake in the social media app, Yass has made nearly $70 million of federal political contributions during the 2024 election cycle, including $20.5 million to the Club for Growth Action, a conservative super PAC that has publicly opposed the TikTok ban (but denies having been influenced by Yass). In August, Koch Industries became Koch, Inc., as Charles rebranded the increasingly tech-focused $125 billion (revenue) conglomerate for the first time since taking over the family firm after his father’s 1967 death. Julia Koch, the widow of his brother David (d. 2019), and her three children paid nearly $700 million that same month for 15% of BSE Global, which owns the NBA’s Brooklyn Nets and the WNBA’s New York Liberty and operates the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. Rob Walton retired from Walmart’s board in June after more than four decades as a director of the firm his father Sam Walton (d. 1992) cofounded in 1962. He and his siblings’ estimated 35% stake in the retail giant is worth more than ever as shoppers flock to Walmart’s “Every Day Low Price” strategy to escape high inflation, driving both its revenue and shares to all-time highs. Jim still chairs the family’s $26 billion (assets) Arvest Bank Group. Alice, the richest woman in America for the ninth time in 10 years, reclaimed the title of the world’s wealthiest woman in early September from L’Oréal heiress Françoise Bettencourt Meyers of France for the first time since May 2022. Dell scored his biggest payday ever in November, when semiconductor giant Broadcom acquired his cloud computing spinoff VMware; Dell swapped his 39% stake for an estimated $33 billion in cash and Broadcom shares. Around that time, he put $3.6 billion in cash and stock into his family’s charitable foundation and pumped at least $500 million into a donor-advised fund. Dell’s net worth is up 40% this year, thanks to 90% and 64% jumps in Broadcom and Dell Technologies share prices, respectively. Huang keeps climbing into rarer air: He has added $63.3 billion to his fortune, pushing him up six more notches on The Forbes 400 (he jumped 31 spots last year), on the back of a 162% rise in Nvidia shares. As his wealth grows, so does his celebrity: Paparazzi followed his every move on a trip to his native Taiwan this summer—a phenomenon termed “Jensanity.” Huang cofounded Nvidia, which designs and sells more chips used for artificial intelligence systems than any other company, in 1993 and has served as CEO and president since. The former mayor of New York City and cofounder of financial-data and media firm Bloomberg LP was awarded the nation’s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, by President Biden in May. Over the next three months, Bloomberg announced $1.6 billion of gifts to the medical schools of his alma mater, Johns Hopkins, and four historically Black colleges. The Microsoft cofounder’s rank is lower than it has been in 34 years, due mostly to a new Forbes estimate of his 2021 divorce settlement. In September, Netflix released a five-episode series called What’s Next? The Future with Bill Gates, which tackles topics including AI and income inequality. In February 2025, he’s set to publish a memoir, Source Code. TerraPower, the next-generation nuclear power company he cofounded in 2008, broke ground on a demonstration plant in Wyoming in June. That same month, his ex-wife, Melinda, resigned as co-chair of the couple’s Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and walked away with $12.5 billion for her own philanthropy. “Damn, I’m fired up!” exclaimed Ballmer in August at the grand opening of his Los Angeles Clippers’ new 18,000-seat Intuit Dome stadium, which boasts a 38,000-square-foot circular scoreboard. He bought the Clippers a decade ago for a then-record $2 billion after running Microsoft as CEO for 14 years, and spent $2 billion of his own money on the new stadium; Forbes now values the team at more than $4.6 billion. Net worth: $136 billion | Source of wealth: Google | Age: 51 A federal judge ruled in August that Page and Brin’s Google acted illegally to maintain a monopoly in online search, which is responsible for 57% of parent company Alphabet’s sales. (The tech giant reportedly plans to appeal.) Shares hit an all-time high in July thanks to Google’s continued push into generative AI and cloud services, including a partnership with Oracle, before slipping in recent months. More than seven decades in, the investing legend is staying plenty busy. In August, Berkshire Hathaway became America’s first non-tech company to hit $1 trillion in market capitalization. In June, Buffett—the nation’s greatest philanthropist, with some $60 billion in lifetime giving—donated $5.3 billion of Berkshire stock, with a twist: He clarified that the vast majority of his remaining fortune will go to a charitable trust run by his three children, instead of the Gates Foundation, as was previously assumed. It was another banner year for the Oracle cofounder, chief technology officer and more than 40% shareholder, with the software firm’s shares up 12% to record highs. He’s spending accordingly: Ellison splashed out nearly $300 million on a Florida resort in August, adding to his $2 billion–plus real estate portfolio. He also plans to invest a reported $6 billion into the on-again-off-again merger between Paramount Global and Skydance, his son David’s media production company. No one got richer over the past year, in sheer dollar terms, than Zuck. He’s $75 billion wealthier, and ranks five spots higher, following a 75% runup in Meta Platforms stock. Revenue has been growing more than 20% per quarter, and the social media giant repurchased $31 billion of its shares over the past year. Zuckerberg, who turned 40 in May, has taken on a new look, sporting a gold chain, letting his wavy hair grow out and ditching his uniform hoodie for a shearling jacket. He also surprised his wife, Priscilla, with a seven-foot-tall statue in her likeness. Since last summer, Bezos has snapped up three homes on Miami’s “billionaire bunker” island for $234 million. He has the cash: Since moving to tax-friendly Florida last November, the Amazon founder has offloaded more than $8 billion (pretax) of his shares; he still owns 9% of the e-commerce Leviathan, whose stock is up 29%. The Bezos Earth Fund, through which he has given $2 billion of a $10 billion pledge, will hand out up to $100 million to winners of an AI for Climate and Nature challenge beginning later this year. Tesla’s self-proclaimed “technoking” tops The Forbes 400 for the third straight year, despite losing $7 billion as shares of his electric vehicle maker fell 14% and a Delaware judge voided $56 billion of his stock options in January. In May, Musk’s new AI startup, xAI, raised $6 billion at a $24 billion valuation. A month later, his rocket maker, SpaceX, launched a tender offer valuing the company at around $210 billion, up from nearly $180 billion. In an X post seen by 220 million, Musk endorsed Donald Trump within an hour of the assassination attempt on the former president. Trump now vows to name Musk to a new government efficiency commission if elected.

Title: The 2024 Forbes 400 List Of Wealthiest Americans: Facts And Figures

Forbes calculated fortunes using stock prices from September 1, 2024. It’s a record-smashing year for America’s 400 richest people. After adding nearly $1 trillion to their fortunes over the past 12 months, The Forbes 400 are worth a collective $5.4 trillion, by far the most ever. It now takes a record $3.3 billion to make the list, up from $2.9 billion in 2023. In general, the richer you were, the richer you got. Just 25 people—a dozen of them worth $100 billion or more—are responsible for $500 billion of the gains. These top 25 now holds more than $2.5 trillion in wealth, nearly half the list’s total net worth. The richest person in America, for the third straight year, is Elon Musk, who is worth an estimated $244 billion. Despite dropping $7 billion in wealth over the past year amid sputtering Tesla stock and an ongoing battle over his $56 billion stock options package, Musk remains some $47 billion ahead of No. 2 Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder, who is worth an estimated $197 billion. Mark Zuckerberg (estimated net worth: $181 billion) climbed from No. 8 last year to No. 3 in 2024 thanks to the huge rebound in shares of Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. Alice Walton continues her reign as the richest woman in the U.S., her ninth time in a decade. With shares of Walmart, which her father Sam Walton (d. 1992) cofounded in 1962, up by 41% in the past year, she’s worth an estimated $89.2 billion, good for No. 15 overall. Walton is one of just 67 women on The Forbes 400, up from 60 last year. As a group, the list’s women are worth a combined $839 billion, compared to $621 billion in 2023. Diane Hendricks ($21.9 billion) remains the wealthiest self-made woman in America, one of a record 13 women on the list who built—rather than inherited—their fortune. Overall, 67% of The Forbes 400 is self-made, meaning they founded their own company or helped build one, though some traveled much longer and tougher paths to great wealth than others. Forbes once again assigned everyone on the list a self-made score, from 1 to 10, with 10 being the true rags-to-riches stories. Those remain rare—just 25 out of the 400. Despite it requiring more money than ever to make the list, 23 billionaires were able to elbow their way into the ranks this year. These newcomers include Todd Graves ($9.5 billion), who created the Raising Cane’s fast food chain; Peter Cancro ($5.6 billion), who built and runs Jersey Mike’s Subs; Jayshree Ullal ($4.4 billion), the CEO of cloud networking firm Arista Networks; Leonid Radvinsky ($3.8 billion), the owner of OnlyFans; and Alex Karp ($3.6 billion), the cofounder and CEO of data mining company Palantir. Another 11 people who fell off a previous Forbes 400 list returned to the ranks this year. The most notable: Donald Trump ($4.3 billion), who has ridden the volatile stock price of Truth Social parent-company Trump Media & Technology Group back onto the list, part of a broader ploy to wring billions in wealth out of his political career. These newcomers and returnees displaced several less-fortunate billionaires who lost their spot among the nation’s richest people. Among this year’s 30 drop-offs: Vince McMahon ($2.5 billion), who stepped down as executive chairman of WWE-parent company TKO Holdings in January amid sexual assault allegations, which he has denied. Aneel Bhusri ($3.2 billion) of software firm Workday, meanwhile, is one of ten 2023 400 members who got richer over the past year but were displaced by better-performing billionaires. They join a growing list of American billionaires who are simply too poor to make the cut. For the first time ever, there are more American billionaires not on The Forbes 400 than there are on it: 415 and counting. That includes plenty of famous faces. Arnold Schwarzenegger ($1 billion) is not rich enough for this list. Neither are Jerry Seinfeld ($1.1 billion), Bruce Springsteen ($1.1 billion), Taylor Swift ($1.3 billion) or Oprah Winfrey ($3 billion). The youngest member of the ranks is Walmart heir Lukas Walton, who is 38 years old and worth an estimated $33.9 billion. Venture capitalist and real estate mogul Josh Kushner ($3.8 billion), 39, is the only other listee under the age of 40. On average, the members of the 2024 Forbes 400 are 70 years old. The eldest is Dole Food Company’s David Murdock ($3.7 billion), who is 101. The richest Americans’ net worths have skyrocketed, but their generosity has not. Forbes once again investigated the lifetime charitable giving of every member of the list. A third have donated less than 1% of their fortunes so far, earning a lowly 1 on the Forbes philanthropy score; only ten people—2.5% of the list—have given away 20% of their riches or more, earning the highest mark, a 5.

Title: Taylor Swift, Magic Johnson, Sam Altman: The American Billionaires Too Poor To Make The 2024 Forbes 400 List

There aren’t many things $1 billion won’t get you, but a spot on The Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans is one of them. Not even $3 billion will do it. This year, the 400 wealthiest people in the U.S. are all worth at least $3.3 billion—a new record, and $400 million more than last year. That high bar means scores of America’s most prominent billionaires are simply not rich enough to make the cut. In fact, for the first time ever, there are more U.S. billionaires not on the list—415 and counting—than on it. These too-poor billionaires include celebrity moguls like Oprah Winfrey (estimated net worth: $3 billion), Kim Kardashian ($1.7 billion), Taylor Swift ($1.3 billion), Magic Johnson ($1.2 billion) and Arnold Schwarzenegger ($1 billion). Dozens of prominent tech and finance leaders don’t have enough scratch either, including virtual reality scion Palmer Luckey ($2.4 billion), Scale AI cofounder Alexandr Wang ($2 billion), Bilt Rewards founder Ankur Jain ($1.2 billion) and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman ($1 billion). Of course, there’s always next year. Just ask Jayshree Ullal, the president and CEO of Arista Networks, who was $100 million too poor in 2023 but, over the past 12 months, has ridden Arista’s skyrocketing stock price onto The Forbes 400 for the first time, with an estimated $4.4 billion net worth. And Altman may rank among the richest 400 Americans soon enough, too: According to multiple reports, OpenAI is currently discussing a restructuring that would change it from a non-profit into a for-profit corporation, and give Altman equity in the company for the first time. Bloomberg reported he may get a 7% stake in the newly restructured firm; Altman denied this to OpenAI staff last week, saying there are no plans for him to get a “giant equity stake” in the company. Though it may change soon, the CEO of OpenAI currently has no equity in the artificial intelligence giant he runs. Instead, he’s made a fortune through smart venture investments, including stakes in Stripe, Reddit and Helion, a research company looking to build the world’s first fusion power plant. OpenAI told investors that it’s expecting to soon close on a new funding round, which according to reports could value the firm at as much as $150 billion. The action star joined Forbes’ billionaires list earlier this year after our reporting revealed how he parlayed $500 million in Hollywood earnings into a diverse investment empire. His most valuable asset: a minority stake in one of the world’s biggest investment funds, Dimensional Fund Advisors. Seinfeld is the richest comedian in America thanks to lucrative syndication profits from his namesake TV show, including a five-year, $500 million deal with Netflix. Forbes named “The Boss” the latest entertainer to become a billionaire in July. His fortune comes from a lifetime of touring and selling records, as well as a $500 million deal to sell his music catalog in 2021. Jain is the founder and CEO of Bilt Rewards, a New York City-based credit card issuer that allows users to gain rewards – including airline and hotel points – off their rent payments. The company raised $200 million from private investors at a $3.1 billion valuation in January. The NBA superstar built his fortune off the court, including buying stakes in the Washington Commanders NFL team and Los Angeles Dodgers MLB team. His biggest asset, however, is a 60% stake in the $27 billion (assets under management) life insurance company Equitrust. A former door-to-door fax machine salesperson, Blakely made her fortune founding the shapewear brand Spanx. In August, she unveiled her latest invention: a stiletto-heeled sneeker called “Sneex.” The founder of online fashion retailer Fashion Nova – known for its social media and celebrity marketing – has spent $300 million over the past four years buying up Los Angeles real estate. In August, he paid $118 million for a new 175,000-square-foot headquarters for his fashion business. Swift’s record-breaking Eras tour and massively valuable music catalog propelled her into the three-comma club last October. Since then she’s released her 11th studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, and continued her blockbuster Eras Tour. Kim K might be famous for being famous, but she is a billionaire from Skims, her shapewear brand that raised $270 million at a $4 billion valuation in 2023. She also has a skincare line, SKKN BY KIM, and a private equity firm, SKKY Partners. Crowned the world’s youngest self-made billionaire in 2022 before falling from the ranks amid market turmoil, Wang regained the title in May after announcing that his artificial intelligence unicorn Scale AI had raised $1 billion at a $13.8 billion valuation. Wang owns an estimated 15% of the San Francisco-based firm. Ford sold his stake in his eponymous fashion brand to Estee Lauder in 2022 in a $2.8 billion deal. Since then, he’s put a big chunk of that fortune into an impressive real estate portfolio worth an estimated $200 million. The wunderkind sold his virtual reality company, Oculus VR, to Meta for $2 billion in cash and stock in 2014, at age 21. His latest venture: Anduril Industries, a defense firm that was valued by private investors at $8.5 billion in 2022. Though best known for his music, Shawn Carter made much of his fortune in alcohol. He sold a 50% stake in his champagne empire Armand de Brignac to LVMH in 2021, then sold the majority of his cognac brand D’Usse to Barcardi in 2023. Winfrey dropped off The Forbes 400 in 2021 and hasn’t made it back, though she’s still one of America’s richest self-made women, thanks to the reinvested profits from her show and films.

Title: Harris’s economic plan helps, but doesn’t get to the root of middle-class discontent

Hans Taparia is a clinical professor at New York University Stern School of Business. Bruce Buchanan is the C.W. Nichols Professor of Business Ethics and professor of marketing at New York University Stern School of Business. Like any candidate seeking reelection, President Joe Biden ran on his economic record: millions of new jobs created, steady GDP growth, inflation tamed, and new legislation allocating trillions of dollars for climate technology, semiconductors, and infrastructure. Kamala Harris aims to build on this record with child tax credits, down payment assistance for first-time home buyers, tax breaks for small businesses, modest tax increases for the wealthy, and a federal ban on price gouging for groceries. Her plan certainly helps—but none of these policy proposals address the root cause of discontent among the middle class: Wealth creation in America today defies gravity and always flows to the top. Despite recent economic indicators, the quality of life for much of America has been diminishing for decades. Since 1970, the share of income held by the middle class has dropped by a third while the share of income held by the wealthy has nearly doubled. Over the same span, the minimum wage, unchanged since 2007, has lost roughly half its purchasing power. Over 39 million workers, or 23% of the working population, make less than $17 per hour. Over 50% of American households earn less than $75,000, which, based on one study, is what the average family of three in the U.S. needs to earn to cover the costs of its basic needs. Simply put, America is hurting. At the core of the problem is that over the past half-century, American society has been reorganized, both legally and culturally, to put the interests of investors above all others—a state of affairs we call “the investor monoculture.” Today, about 80% of public company stock is owned by institutional investors—the likes of Berkshire Hathaway, BlackRock, State Street, Fidelity, JPMorgan Chase, KKR, and Blackstone. In 1980, this number was just 29%. Such investors tend to operate with one objective: to seek maximum profits, regardless of the harm it may cause society. Such harm usually comes at the expense of workers, customers, and communities—and explains much of the malaise and inchoate rage that plagues America. Today’s extreme profits are being generated in two ways. The first is through cost cutting, which usually means eliminating workers, outsourcing jobs, and lowering wages. Going forward, technological advancement and the artificial intelligence revolution promise to make this worse. The second is a relentless drive for revenue growth, regardless of its effects on society or the planet. For instance, food companies have been supersizing and ultra-processing their products for decades, making a poor diet the leading cause of mortality. Suicide rates for young people are up more than 60% since 2007, but investor pressure pushes technology companies to keep users hooked to their screens for as long as possible. But none of this is the investor’s concern. The investor monoculture serves the richest 10% of households, who hold over 90% of corporate stock, and whose incomes exceed $250,000. It has been the dominant political influence in the legislative and executive branches of the U.S. government since the Reagan administration—lowering taxes on corporations and the wealthy, diminishing the social safety net, frustrating the efforts of organized labor, and pushing back on market regulation. And in recent years, it has put hundreds of pro-investor judges on the federal bench, and a supermajority of six conservative justices on the Supreme Court. The Biden-Harris administration’s attempts to correct this situation have been sincere, but don’t get to the root of the problem. The Biden CHIPS and Science Act provides tens of billions in funding and incentives for American semiconductor manufacturers. But chip manufacturers aren’t large employers, and the biggest beneficiary of these funds will be, yes, the investors in those corporations. Harris just announced a plan for $100 billion in tax credits for companies in strategic industries such as biotechnology, aerospace, blockchain, and artificial intelligence. Once again, it will be the venture capitalists and other large investors in these companies who reap most of the benefits. To materially change our country’s trajectory, a new paradigm is required. Corporations must be redesigned such that everyday people (the bottom 90%) have a more equitable stake and say in corporations. In other words, we need to shift the ownership and governance of corporations away from current investors and toward stakeholders such as employees, customers, suppliers, communities, and the planet. Here’s a set of ideas that can be implemented without any new legislation or funding. This year, the U.S. government will spend $6.5 trillion, or 23% of GDP. Much of this is transfer payments, but trillions of dollars are general expenditures. This represents formidable spending power that can be leveraged to compel corporations to share government-generated wealth more fairly with communities and stakeholders. What if the corporations receiving government funds through the CHIPS and Science Act were required to share ownership rights or profits with the communities in which they build factories? What if the government gave preference to employee-owned businesses, or stipulated profit sharing with stakeholders, for its purchases of goods and services? What if it mandated that, instead of being owned by private equity players looking to return multiples on their investments, all hospice services receiving Medicare funds be substantively owned by nonprofits or the people providing the hospice care? What would that do for the caregivers? What would it do for the care? Or imagine the pride and dedication of construction workers who share in the ownership and profits of firms building government projects. Each year, the U.S. government lends hundreds of billions of dollars to corporations through agencies such as the Small Business Administration, the USDA, and the Department of Energy. Under the Inflation Reduction Act, the Department of Energy alone will lend over $400 billion to climate technology companies. The biggest gains from these loans will go to just a few investors. The U.S. government should stipulate higher levels of ownership, profit sharing, voting, and board rights for workers, communities, or other stakeholders in companies that participate in these programs. Such requirements would spread the benefits of these loans more broadly and give stakeholders a greater sense of economic agency and civic participation. Similarly, when state-funded universities or the National Institutes of Health license new drug discoveries or technology to corporations, they should require profit distribution that flows not just to investors but also to other stakeholders such as patients and caregivers. Imagine if patients shared in the profits from sky-high drug prices. Redesigning corporations to benefit stakeholders and communities using existing market-based approaches presents endless possibilities. The force of government spending and investment applied in this way would foster hope among the 90% who are marginalized by the investor monoculture and begin a process of political healing. America is hurting. Democrats must acknowledge and address this pain. The investor monoculture is at the root of the problem—and government-encouraged corporate redesign is one viable path to recovery. We already have the tools to do this. The question is whether we have the political will.

Title: Circle partners with Mark Carnegie to bring USDC to Australia

Share this article Circle has announced plans to bring its USDC stablecoin to Australia through a partnership with venture capitalist Mark Carnegie’s MHC Digital Group, signaling an expansion into the Asia Pacific region. The collaboration aims to increase USDC distribution and explore institutional use cases in Australia and beyond. MHC Digital Group, with offices in Australia and Singapore, will provide USDC access to wholesale clients across Australia. Circle’s Chief Business Officer Kash Razzaghi highlighted the region’s potential, noting its young, mobile-first population and digital wallet readiness. The partnership could help Australian superannuation funds avoid bank fees and may lead to the creation of an Australian dollar stablecoin in the future. This expansion follows Circle’s recent moves, including relocating its headquarters to New York City’s One World Trade Center ahead of a planned IPO valued at around $5 billion. The company has also made USDC available to investors in Mexico and Brazil through the banking system and became the first global stablecoin issuer licensed to offer dollar- and euro-pegged tokens in the European Union. USDC, the second-largest stablecoin behind Tether’s USDT, currently has a market cap of $35 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $7.87 billion. The partnership with MHC Digital Group represents another step in Circle’s global expansion strategy, potentially bringing stablecoin technology to a broader audience in the Asia Pacific region. In September, Circle partnered with Sony Block Solutions Labs to integrate USDC on Sony’s Ethereum layer-2 blockchain, Soneium, aiming to transform digital finance and entertainment transactions. Earlier this year, Circle implemented smart contract support for BlackRock BUIDL holders, enabling them to transfer shares for USDC, streamlining blockchain transactions and reducing costs. Beyond native L2s, Circle has also expanded its Web3 services to the Solana blockchain, enhancing USDC accessibility for developers and enterprises with improved on-chain transaction management and secure wallet integration.

Title: Five Stocks to Watch in October—and What to Watch For

The major indexes are trading near record highs after the Fed's rate cut fueled a rebound from a shaky start to September. Looking ahead at specific companies, October brings a major product launch from one of the Magnificent Seven and earnings reports from key companies in the tech, banking, and apparel industries. Below, we look at five stocks that could lead market trends—and see big price movements—in October. Tesla (TSLA) will kick off October with third-quarter delivery data early in the month. But investors may watch another event even more closely: a robotaxi launch scheduled for Oct. 10. The event, which CEO Elon Musk has said will be the most important moment for Tesla since it unveiled the Model 3 in 2016, will likely feature a prototype of the robotaxi model, dubbed “Cybercab.” It will also be an opportunity for the automaker to showcase its investments in artificial intelligence and its progress on full self-driving (FSD) software. Analysts have speculated that Tesla stock could get a lift if the company offers aggressive estimates of how quickly it can roll out robotaxis, the size of the market, or its timeline for achieving unsupervised FSD. Tesla stock has risen about 5% so far this year. Microsoft (MSFT) could set the tone for big tech earnings this quarter when it reports mid-month. While the company announced a date just yet, some market watchers expect that its earnings will drop after the bell on Oct. 22, the same day Google-parent Alphabet (GOOG; GOOGL) is expected to report. Microsoft is one of four trillion-dollar tech companies—including Alphabet, Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META)—engaged in an expensive artificial intelligence arms race. Microsoft spent nearly $14 billion on property and equipment in the quarter ended June 30, a 55% increase from the same year-ago period. Much of that spending was on the chips, servers, and other equipment needed to run the company’s AI-powering data centers. Big Tech's spending spooked some corners of Wall Street, which fueled a string of dramatic tech sell-offs in July. Chatter about AI spending has since abated, but Microsoft and its big tech peers have, unlike the broader market, yet to fully rebound from their summer slump. (Still, Microsoft shares are up 14% this year.) Microsoft’s upcoming report has the potential to recast the spotlight on big tech’s spending or give Wall Street a taste of the payoff the company has assured them is coming. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), the world's largest non-state-owned bank, could give investors a glimpse of what Fed rate cuts mean for American banks when it reports third-quarter earnings on Oct. 11. JPMorgan shares tanked in early September after one executive warned that net interest income (NII), the difference between what the bank earns on loans and what it pays on deposits, was likely to be lower in 2025 than previously forecast. That warning came just days before the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 50 basis points, which it is expected to follow up with a string of cuts stretching into next year. Lower interest rates will weigh on JPMorgan’s NII, but they will also take some of the pressure off borrowers who otherwise might have defaulted on loans. Bank of America analysts think banks are better prepared to weather this rate-cutting cycle than any in recent memory. Plus, lower rates in the context of a soft landing—an outcome some economists say is looking increasingly likely—should spur loan demand, reinvigorate mortgage lending, and boost trading activity, all bonuses for banks. The analysts, though, conceded that it's easier to calculate how much rate cuts will reduce NII than how much they’ll boost revenue. JPMorgan’s quarterly results could shed some light on that trade-off and move the stock, which is up 24% since the start of the year. Nike (NKE) will report results for the first quarter of its 2025 fiscal year on Oct. 1. and it will be the shoe retailer’s last report before incoming CEO Elliott Hill takes the reins on Oct. 14. The CEO transition marks the beginning of a new phase of Nike’s turnaround efforts. The company has been struggling for some time with sluggish sales in China, once considered its largest growth opportunity, and loss of market share to upstart rivals like On (ONON) and Deckers-owned (DECK) Hoka. Nike shares had their worst day on record after its most recent earnings report in June when the company forecast sales would decline by 10% in the fiscal first quarter. The stock plummeted 20% that day and, even after rebounding slightly, are down some 18% this year. As such, expectations aren’t exactly high heading into October’s report. Deutsche Bank analysts in a note on Thursday said they expect the company to reiterate its full-year guidance and indicate that sales declines had bottomed. “We think a narrative of improvement will be well received,” they wrote, adding that Hill’s appointment gave them confidence the company would refocus on “product innovation, marketing/storytelling, and rebuilding wholesale partnerships.” It has been a wild couple of months for chip giant Intel (INTC). Once the world’s most valuable chipmaker, its shares have shed more than 50% of their value this year as disappointing demand for its foundry services and the high cost of developing AI chips have saddled the company with billions of dollars of losses. Things have looked up a bit in recent weeks. Shares surged in mid-September after the company said it would restructure its foundry business. They were boosted just days later by reports of a possible acquisition by Qualcomm (QCOM) and a $5 billion investment from Apollo Global Management. had approached the company to discuss an acquisition. In October, investors will be looking for more evidence that Intel has the funds, or can raise the funds, to sustain investments in its manufacturing business. Those funds could from the federal government, with which Intel is reportedly working overtime to secure $8.5 billion in CHIPS Act funding before the end of the year. And some investors may still be hoping for transformational M&A.

Title: Nvidia and 6 other firms that could get in on OpenAI's next big funding round

Amid a spate of executive resignations and reports that it’s spending more than it’s making, OpenAI is reportedly preparing to close a $6.5 billion funding round that could value the artificial intelligence startup at $150 billion. Thrive Capital is reported to be leading the round, and tech behemoths Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA) are reportedly involved in talks too. Apple (AAPL), which has a partnership with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into its iPhone operating system, recently dropped out of talks to participate in the funding round, The Wall Street Journal reported. As OpenAI looks for investors for its multi-billion dollar round, it is also talking to investors about restructuring its non-profit status to attract investors, the Financial Times reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. And as it considers a for-profit structure, chief executive Sam Altman has reportedly told employees he doesn’t plan to get a “giant equity stake” in the company. During a meeting with Altman and Sarah Friar, OpenAI’s chief financial officer, both leaders told employees that the company’s investors are concerned over Altman not having equity, CNBC reported. Here are the companies expected to invest in OpenAI’s $6.5 billion funding round. Venture capital firm Thrive Capital is reportedly leading OpenAI’s funding round and investing over $1 billion. Thrive has invested $750 million into the round, and plans to use a special purpose vehicle to add $450 million more from other investors, The New York Times reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. Thrive did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Tiger Global, a venture capital firm, is reportedly investing an unclear amount of money into OpenAI. In 2021, Tiger purchased $125 million in shares of OpenAI, The Information reported. The firm was also part of a group of investors that pushed for Altman to be reinstated after he was fired from the startup in November. Tiger did not immediately respond to a request for comment. United Arab Emirates-backed investment fund MGX is reportedly participating in the funding round. MGX, which was launched by the U.A.E. in March to invest in AI projects, hasn’t decided the size of its potential investment, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. G42, a state-backed AI company, and the U.A.E.’s wealth fund, Mubadala Investment, are founding partners of the investment fund. MGX did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Khosla Ventures, which has previously invested in OpenAI, is expected to invest in the round through a special purpose vehicle, The Information reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. Instead of using money from its venture funds, Khosla plans to raise money from limited partners, the people said. Khosla Ventures did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The SoftBank (SFTBY) Vision Fund is investing $500 million in the funding round, The Information reported, citing an unnamed person familiar with the matter. The investment would be the venture capital fund’s largest in a generative AI startup. In July, SoftBank chief executive Masayoshi Son blocked an investment into French AI startup Mistral to avoid issues with OpenAI, an unnamed person told The Information. SoftBank did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Microsoft, which has already invested over $13 billion into OpenAI, is reportedly in talks to participate in its latest funding round. Microsoft declined to comment. Nvidia, which designs the chips that power some of the world’s most powerful AI models, has discussed investing around $100 million in OpenAI, Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. Nvidia declined to comment.

On Tuesday, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:META) stock received a Buy rating from Pivotal Research, with a new price target set at $780. The research firm highlighted Meta's status as the leading social media company worldwide, citing its substantial daily active user base of 3.3 billion across its platforms, including Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Reels, Stories, and Facebook Messenger. Pivotal Research commended Meta's management for its proven track record in developing new products and enhancements, particularly in response to competitors. The firm anticipates robust revenue growth for Meta, driven by increased usage, the introduction of new products, improved targeting, and higher pricing. This growth is expected to be further supported by cost efficiencies gained through artificial intelligence and a significant reduction in Reality Labs' losses. The research firm's outlook for Meta is bolstered by what it considers an attractive valuation. Meta's earnings per share (EPS) for 2025 are valued at approximately 24 times, and when factoring out 90% of Reality Labs' losses, the valuation is closer to 19 times EPS. Pivotal Research expressed confidence in CEO Mark Zuckerberg's ability to steer Meta successfully in an ever-evolving world propelled by rapid advancements in AI. The endorsement from Pivotal Research underscores Meta's potential for increased profitability and market dominance. With its array of popular social media platforms and ongoing innovations, Meta appears well-positioned to capitalize on the opportunities presented by AI and the digital landscape. In other recent news, Meta Platforms Inc. has been a focal point of several analyst updates and regulatory news. Monness, Crespi, Hardt raised Meta's 12-month price target to $620, maintaining a Buy rating due to the company's AI and metaverse potential. Rosenblatt Securities also increased its price target for Meta to $811, citing strength in AI and VR/AR. Meanwhile, Meta was hit with a €91 million fine by Ireland's Data Protection Commission for a security lapse involving user password storage. Oppenheimer maintained its Outperform rating on Meta following the company's annual "Meta Connect" developer event, which showcased technological advances, including a lower-cost mixed-reality headset and updates to its AI capabilities. Furthermore, Stifel reiterated a Buy rating on Meta, expressing confidence in the company's AI focus. These are among the recent developments in Meta's business landscape. As a reminder, this article reports on recent news and does not make any predictions or personal opinions. The information provided is based on past articles and is intended to offer a snapshot of recent events involving Meta Platforms Inc. Meta Platforms' strong market position, as highlighted by Pivotal Research, is further supported by recent financial data and insights from InvestingPro. The company's market capitalization stands at an impressive $1.45 trillion, reflecting its dominant status in the social media landscape. InvestingPro data reveals that Meta's revenue for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024 reached $149.78 billion, with a robust revenue growth of 24.28% over the same period. This aligns with Pivotal Research's expectations of strong revenue growth driven by increased usage and new product introductions. The company's financial health is underscored by two key InvestingPro Tips. Firstly, Meta "holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet," indicating a strong financial position. Secondly, it boasts "impressive gross profit margins," with the latest data showing a gross profit margin of 81.49% for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024. These factors contribute to Meta's ability to invest in innovation and AI advancements, as noted in the Pivotal Research analysis. Meta's valuation metrics also support the research firm's outlook. The company's P/E ratio (adjusted) stands at 26.86, which, when considered alongside its growth prospects, suggests a potentially attractive valuation. This is further reinforced by an InvestingPro Tip stating that Meta is "trading at a low P/E ratio relative to near-term earnings growth."

Title: How To Address The Global Talent Shortage?

75% of employers worldwide are struggling to find the talent they need. In Agreus Group's article 2024 predictions for the family office space, I touched upon a significant ongoing global challenge: a widespread shortage of skilled professionals. The 2023 ManpowerGroup Talent Shortage Study indicates that 75% of employers worldwide are struggling to find the talent they need. This difficulty spans several sectors, with accounting, financial services and investment roles facing some of the most pronounced shortages. Family offices must strategically contend with large corporations for this sought-after talent. Understanding the Global Talent Shortage The global job market today offers skilled professionals a plethora of career choices, presenting a challenge for those seeking to recruit the best. There is a particularly acute shortage of finance and accounting expertise. Avalara’s research reveals that 84% of Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) surveyed in the United States (U.S.) and the United Kingdom (U.K.) face a significant talent shortage within their teams. Family offices often require high-calibre talent in specialised areas such as accounting, financial services and investment, where specific expertise is essential for managing complex portfolios for Ultra-high-net-worth (UHNW) families. According to the 2023 BlackRock Global Family Office Survey, 40% of family offices see talent sourcing as a major hurdle in achieving their investment goals. Identifying and retaining top talent has become a major challenge for family offices worldwide. Strategies to Address the Talent Gap With intense competition in attracting top professionals, family offices must differentiate themselves. We recommend a well-rounded strategy to effectively tackle this talent shortage: Competitive Compensation Packages As an expert in the family office recruitment space, we know compensation plays a huge part in attracting and retaining talent. Professionals are often drawn to family offices from sectors where competitive compensation is standard. To engage and keep such talent, it is crucial to offer compensation that is on par with the industry standard, ensuring they match what these individuals may have received from their prior roles. Our 2023 Global Family Office Compensation Benchmark Report is an invaluable resource for benchmarking against other family offices and staying competitive in the market. Explore the Global Talent Pool Expanding your hiring criteria can be an effective strategy to tackle the talent shortage. One way to do this is by leveraging global recruitment and considering job seekers from other countries. With increased global mobility, family offices can have a more varied skill set from an extended talent pool. This will ultimately increase your chances of finding highly qualified candidates and filling vacancies successfully. Flexible Work Arrangements Embracing flexible work arrangements, such as remote work and flexible hours, can broaden the pool of potential candidates and improve employee satisfaction. Remote work also allows you to extend your reach beyond borders, which can help you overcome local skill gaps and save money in the process. Professional Development Opportunities Investing in employee development helps to build a positive work environment, enhances retention, and keeps your family office in the know with the latest developments. It is also a proactive approach to tackling the global talent shortage. The global talent shortage is undoubtedly a critical challenge for family offices worldwide. Family offices must implement a comprehensive strategy to effectively compete for top-tier professionals in the fierce market. By prioritising the strategies discussed above, family offices can attract and retain the skilled talent necessary to achieve their long-term goals.

Title: Open source is not a trust issue, it’s an innovation issue

Dmitry Nikolaev - stock.adobe.co No project is smooth sailing all the way. So perhaps it was appropriate that the Open Source Summit Europe kicked off amid some of the worst storms in memory, before finishing in clear blue skies and warm autumnal sunshine. The Linux Foundation-backed conference saw a raft of product announcements and initiatives, among which was the rolling together of distributed trust projects – including blockchain, ledger, identity and cryptographic efforts – into an LF Foundation Decentralised Trust. The Linux Foundation announced general availability of Valkey 8.0, the open source in-memory database project forked from Redis earlier this year, after the eponymous company behind the in-memory database changed its licence. Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services (AWS) donated the OpenSearch project to the Linux Foundation. The cloud giant launched the OpenSearch project in response to Elastic’s licence switch on ElasticSearch back in 2021. At the same time, the Linux Foundation and its mighty offshoot the Cloud Native Computing Foundation have partnered with Unified Patents to “defend open source software from non-practising entities”, by which they mean patent trolls. But while the “ecosystem” looks in rude health, what is happening in the community? Or more to the point, how are businesses really using and benefiting from open source software? The Linux Foundation’s Open source maturity in Europe report paints a robust picture, stating that between 2022 and 2024, “more than half of the respondents each year reported seeing an increased business value from using OSS compared to the previous year”. For this year, it revealed that just under two-thirds reported a rise in business value from the year before. “This indicates a compounding effect, where the value derived from open source software grows each year. Similarly, the benefits from contributions are also on the rise, with 52% of respondents in recent surveys reporting increased benefits compared to prior years,” said the report. Those benefits include increased productivity, cited by 62%, catalysed innovation (61%) and reduced operating costs (60%). Critically, over three-quarters believed open source software to be more secure than closed source software. But the research also found that resistant organisational cultures were a brake on open source adoption, particularly “in sectors traditionally resistant to openness, such as finance”. It added: “Open source is often mistakenly viewed as merely a technical matter, when in fact, it is a cultural change – it is a change maker and needs to be approached in a multidimensional strategy.” Achieving that cultural change can be critical when it comes to dealing with an increasingly volatile world, where organisations need to constantly innovate just to survive. In a panel on lessons from vertical industries, Mercedes-Benz open source programme lead Wolfgang Gehring said a modern vehicle was a datacentre on wheels, so “innovation and software [mean] open source”, and when it comes to common problems, “you can collaborate with other companies in the industry in open source”. Before open source, he added, “that was much more difficult”. On the same panel, Karel Rietveld, Open Source Program Office lead at the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration, said motivations and inhibitions could be slightly different in the public sector, with different regulations and layers of management and compliance to be aware of. Open source might be more cost effective, a big issue for cash-strapped public entities, he added, but there was also the cost of publicly funded time and people to consider. But, of course, these are the already converted, and it might be argued that many critical sectors will continue to have an instinctive distrust of open source and be extremely unwilling to embed it in their systems. A glib response might be that few companies are not taking advantage of open source in some form anyway. That might be the CEO’s Android phone. Or it could be their use of cloud technologies or services which rely on a cloud native stack predicated on containers and Kubernetes, and open source security tools, and open source-powered developer workflows. For all the talk about community, sometimes it’s more base common interest that will drive a company or a sector to use open source. Finance is generally secretive, but increasingly is adopting open source. That’s not necessarily for any utopian ideals. Rather, banks and other financial institutions will have common problems to code for, in the shape of compliance with regulations for example, so it makes sense from an efficiency point of view to find common answers to these problems. Gabriele Columbro, who heads up both the Linux Foundation Europe and the Fintech Open Source Foundation (FINOS), said if anything, financial services are ahead of “other traditional industries in their adoption and strategic understanding of open source”. The sector is already highly tech-centric, he said, with banks potentially employing tens of thousands of developers. “And not only the big banks – we have the buy sides, Blackrock, Fidelity, five or six buy side members, and everyone in between. The clearing houses started coming in … so the whole ecosystem is starting to harmonise around open standards and open source.” The power sector is another “conservative” industry that is increasingly relying on open source as it races to rebuild its systems and infrastructure to meet the climate change challenge. This requires new ways of managing and predicting demand, and that means new tools – fast. As with finance, all operators face these problems, making cooperation easier to contemplate. Jonas van den Bogaard, open source lead at Dutch power distribution company Alliander, and a member of the technical advisory council at LF Energy, said the power distribution sector in Holland – likes its counterparts worldwide – is racing to decarbonise the grid and underpin electrification. As well as building out physical capacity, this will require much better tools for management and forecasting. “We are actively searching for collaboration and partnerships with industry players – with vendors, both academia and also cross-sector – to bundle resources, knowledge and expertise to realise these new digital integrations,” he said. “We’ve seen open source more as one of the means to make this possible, and it has been very successful for building up several capabilities.” And power is not the only critical infrastructure that will be relying on open source. Timo Perala heads up Nokia’s open source projects office, having previously worked in standards. Ultimately, he said, its customers want products and services that work – they are not necessarily concerned whether they include open source elements, just as they wouldn’t necessarily care where Nokia sourced components like buts and bolts. Moreover, open source collaboration is a form of shared research and development, where everyone needs to solve a problem without necessarily capitalising on the solution. Perala likened it to how companies agree on a handover on a mobile network. “That is something that you just can’t charge for ... it’s a basic requirement, not a competitive advantage,” he said. It’s hard to think of more conservative industries than power, finance and telecoms. But they are also industries that are facing high levels of disruption and a corresponding need to innovate quickly. If they’re building their businesses on open source, the only reason the rest of the world hasn’t is because they’re not being confronted with the same level of potential disruption. Yet. As Mercedes’ Gehring told his audience: “Innovation nowadays happens in open source. Innovation in software happens in open source. And you’re either there and you participate, or you’re not. That’s basically it.”

Title: Gerry Thornley: Corinthians find their path by putting faith in youth
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2024/10/01/gerry-thornley-corinthians-find-their-path-by-putting-faith-in-youth/
Time Published: 2024-10-01T05:00:00Z
Full Content:
All has changed, changed utterly in grassroots rugby. Few games on the opening day of the Energia All-Ireland League season last Saturday week illustrated this more than newly-promoted Corinthians’ trip to Ballymena. They come from different provinces and for much of the AIL’s 34-year history from different worlds. Ballymena’s list of grandees includes Willie John McBride, Syd Millar and Trevor Ringland, among others. They were one of the initial nine clubs in the inaugural Division 1 when the AIL was formed in 1990-91. Save for a two-year stay in Division 2, Ballymena remained a top-tier club until 2009 and were champions in 2003 when beating Clontarf in the final. They have oscillated between the second and third tiers ever since. Corinthians have had their notable past players too, including Noel Mannion and Johnny O’Connor, and technically Mack Hansen is among their number too and has illuminated Corinthians Park with his off-field presence this season. However, the Galway club began AIL life in Division 2 and lasted only one season before being relegated back to the Connacht Senior League. They rejoined an expanded AIL in Division 3 in 1993-94 but were relegated to Division 4 the following season. The two clubs remained three and two divisions apart for 14 seasons before meeting for the first time in April 2011 in 1B (the second tier) when Corinthians beat Ballymena 29-27, although that didn’t stop the latter being promoted. Like ships passing in the night, Corinthians moved a division above Ballymena in 2013-14 in 1B for one year only and the following season they rubbed shoulders a second time. Promoted Ballymena won 20-0 at Eaton Park in September 2014 and the sides drew in Corinthian Park the following December as Corinthians were relegated. And that was it until last Saturday week, on foot of Corinthians winning promotion from 2B last season via the play-offs. But the novelty value of the fixture didn’t stop there. The average age of the Corinthians match-day squad was 19 years and 11 months, yet they returned from Eaton Park with a 27-10 bonus-point win. Last Saturday, an even younger Corinthians hosted Greystones, whose alumni include the late, great Paul McNaughton, as well as Tony Ward, Nick Popplewell and more. Although Greystones soon became a Division 1 club after also starting life with Corinthians in Division 2 the two are familiar foes. Greystones won 2B a couple of seasons ago, with Corinthians second. After a small lunch hosted by club president Roy Gibson in McHugh’s across the road, on a lovely sunny afternoon near Claregalway, props Billy Bohan, Fiachna Barrett, eye-catching 19-year-old flanker Max Flynn, classy outhalf Sean Naughton and left-winger James Nicholson (himself a Greystones lad) were all released from the Connacht academy and recalled. Including centre John Devine, younger brother of scrumhalf Matthew, this quintet are also current or recent Irish under-20s, while replacement scrumhalf Tomás Farthing is another in the Connacht academy. Conceivably one of the university clubs has fielded younger sides, but Corinthians’ youthful spirit is extraordinary for a club with no university affiliations. Perhaps it’s the mature head on him, his leadership qualities seeing him become club captain in just his second season, but Mark Boyle stands out as the old man of the team. And he’s only 23. The number eight was released by the Leinster academy and, after also being rejected by Connacht, he contemplated retiring as so many of his age do if denied a path into the professional game. But, living in Galway and working for Aviva, he is loving life and rugby more than ever. His older brother Paul was a replacement in Connacht’s 36-30 comeback win over the Sharks later that night, which made for a long day in Galway for their fortunate Dublin-based dad “Pablo”. Boyle hails the attention to detail of head coach Michael Harding as well as forwards coach Pat Cunningham and backs coach JJ Hanrahan. Harding will have a detailed breakdown of every player’s performance on their phones by 8pm on match night. Hanrahan, availing of his ACL injury to make his first foray into coaching, describes working with such talented young backs as “a dream”, while they must feel likewise given his knowledge. As the watching ex-Corinthians and Connacht outhalf Ciaran Smyth puts it, making hay, and scoring tries, while the sun shines before the wet days of winter is imperative for this young side. After a break from their own 22 by their Welsh centre Tom Waters (20), Barrett finished strongly inside four minutes. Naughton also converted their second try by 19-year-old lock Bryan Walsh, who has previously been donated size 16 boots by Connacht’s Pro12-winning lock Ally Muldownwey. As well as a howitzer of a boot, Naughton is creator-in-chief, with his ability to take the ball to the line, passing range off both hands and cross kicks. Corinthians sealed a bonus point by half-time through Sean Fox and Flynn. After a rally by Greystones and a try by centre Andrew Lynch, Corinthians finished strongly, with Naughton (20) and Fox (19) combining for full-back Orin Burke (19) to score before Charlie Leonard is driven over. Corinthians’ 40-10 win leaves them in a four-way tie atop 2A alongside Barnhall, Instonians and Cashel. Early days, and they won’t always have their academy stardust. But what makes their success just as impressive is that last weekend they also fielded two under-20 sides. This is at a time when under-20 sides in Irish clubs are in alarming decline. Their under-20s “firsts” beat their Blackrock counterparts 27-17 away on Sunday to seal promotion to the Leinster first division with two long-range tries by Walsh’s younger brother Sean, another Irish under-20 international, while their seconds beat Galwegians in the Connacht under-20 final. The driving force for this depth at under-20 level is largely attributed to the work of club stalwart John “Stack” Noone. Founded in 1932, Corinthians appear to have found their niche. gerry.thornley@irishtimes.com Sign up to the Irish Times weekly rugby digest for the view from the press box with Gerry Thornley © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Share this article BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF, also known as ETHA, has seen slower growth than its Bitcoin counterpart but Robert Mitchnick, the company’s head of digital assets, remains optimistic about its long-term prospects, especially considering its rapid accumulation of assets under management (AUM). “It’s very rare that you see an ETF get to a billion AUM in seven weeks, as ETHA did,” said Mitchnick, speaking at the Messari Mainnet conference in New York this week. “In most cases, it takes multiple years to never for a new ETF to get to a billion.” Launched in July following the SEC’s surprising approval, it took ETHA less than a month to reach $1 billion in net inflows. As of September 30, ETHA’s Ethereum holdings exceeded 380,601 ETH, valued at around $1 billion. Source: ishares.com Despite lagging behind BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), which amassed $2 billion in AUM within just 15 days of its launch, ETHA is still among the world’s top performing crypto ETFs. The stagnant performance is not entirely unexpected for BlackRock and other ETF experts. Mitchnick believes that the investment story and narrative for Ethereum are “less easy” for investors to “digest.” “So that’s a big part of why we’re so committed to the education journey that we’re on with a lot of our clients,” he explained. BlackRock’s head of digital assets said that he did not expect ETHA to ever reach the same level of flows and AUM as IBIT, but saw the current performance as a “good start.” Speaking at the Bitcoin 2024 convention in Nashville in July, Mitchnick said the company’s client base is primarily interested in Bitcoin, followed by Ethereum. There is “very little” demand for crypto ETFs beyond the two leading crypto assets, he noted. For BlackRock, Bitcoin and Ethereum offer complementary benefits, rather than competing for the same role. Mitchnick predicted that investors would allocate 20% of their crypto holdings to Ethereum and the remaining 80% to Bitcoin. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: Powering Data Centers Is A Herculean Task

There are numerous ways to invest in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) boom. Some high flying chip stocks like Nvidia have captured the spotlight, but there are more ways to invest in a broad wave of AI adoption than just semiconductor chips. Chips are essential, but without the infrastructure to support them they’re useless. Investors should also consider the sector powering the data centers needed for AI development. According to the Electric Power Research Institute, data centers are forecasted to consume up to 9% of US electricity generation per year by 2030, up from 4% in 2023. That doesn’t sound like much, but between replacing old power generation and turning on new power arrays, the step up is significant. The reason is AI. The energy needs for AI computing are immense. To put the energy consumption into perspective, AI queries – just asking ChatGPT to clean up that email to your boss – can require approximately ten times the electricity of traditional internet searches. Training new models and running more complicated queries suck even more power. The need for more power generation is so intense that it’s actually becoming the primary obstacle for companies looking to innovate in AI. The ideas are there, the computational chips are expensive, but they’re there, but you need to figure out how to meet the energy needs for the data center to function. As this space continues to play out, we think it’s worth exploring opportunities within energy generation where investors can benefit from partnerships between both the upstream and downstream players in the AI market. This picture taken on January 23, 2023 in Toulouse, southwestern France, shows screens displaying ... [+] the logos of OpenAI and ChatGPT. ChatGPT is a conversational artificial intelligence software application developed by OpenAI. (Photo by Lionel BONAVENTURE / AFP) (Photo by LIONEL BONAVENTURE/AFP via Getty Images) To explore the first-phase beneficiaries providing key inputs for AI advancements, it’s worth breaking down what data centers are used for when it comes to artificial intelligence. Data centers are the backbone of this AI boom as they store the hardware necessary to train AI models. As modern technology companies have grown larger and larger, and the amount of equipment needed to maintain operations and cloud services has skyrocketed, the energy demand from hyperscalers has followed suit. Hyperscalers – companies that operate cloud computing infrastructure – provide the storage and compute power necessary to train AI and are faced with the difficult task of deciding where to source the energy needed for their daily operations. Major players within this space include Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, all of which are forming partnerships with local utilities and power providers to ensure their energy demand is met. With the sweeping transition to cloud data storage, electricity demand has turned into the biggest problem facing the industry. Hyperscalers providing infrastructure and platform services just can’t get enough of it, and the world of institutional finance is taking advantage of the opportunity. As we’ve seen recently, Blackrock teamed up with Microsoft (MSFT) and MGX (an AI fund out of The United Arab Emirates) to announce the launch of a $30 billion AI infrastructure investment fund focusing on building out data centers and energy infrastructure. While this may seem like a massive investment initially, it pales in comparison to the total investment in AI from the top 5 hyperscalers over the next few years. For context, current projections indicate the investment levels will reach a combined $1 trillion in 2027 according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. The way power is generated and sold to large hyperscale consumers is going to change. Whereas in the past many data centers may have tapped into local electrical grids, the future of data center electrification involves dedicated power construction and long term power purchase agreements (PPAs). Hyperscalers prefer PPAs over market spot pricing since they’re able to guarantee stable energy prices for an extended period, typically over ten years. This level of certainty provides a hedge against unwanted price fluctuations that would affect hyperscalers’ bottom line and put upward pressure on already substantial model training costs. Perhaps more important though is the desirability of long term contracts for developers and investors. PPAs from cash flush hyperscalers give developers the ability to secure financing for rapid construction of new power generation facilities. Knowing you have a reliable counter party allows for better profit forecasting! Furthermore, many of the power generation projects are dedicated solely to the data center and disconnected from the broader grid – a contract stipulating a minimum rate of return is essential for a project that takes years to break even and only has a single customer. Finally, it’s worth pointing out that while renewables like wind and solar are the preferred long term source of power for the data centers, the demand right now is high enough that other options are on the table too. Nuclear power is back in the spotlight and natural gas turbines offer rapid deployment. Each power source comes with pros and cons – some are more flexible and some are harder to ramp up and down with data center demand. There will be a wide variety of solutions to the power conundrum over the next several years and many solutions that start off as off grid or dedicated power supplies may eventually end up becoming part of the larger power system. NENTMANNSDORF, SAXONIA, GERMANY - 2012/09/04: Photovoltaik solar panels in a row at sunrise.. (Photo ... [+] by Frank Bienewald/LightRocket via Getty Images) The long term demand for electricity is an opportunity to accelerate the build out of clean energy solutions. The top hyperscalers have set ambitious goals to reduce their carbon footprints – renewable power is a must for them over longer time frames. Among the top names, Google is targeting to operate its data centers on carbon-free energy by 2030, and Microsoft and Amazon both hope to shift to 100% renewable energy by 2025. The massive undertaking is already underway as Microsoft (MSFT) and Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP) signed the biggest-ever clean power deal this year for their data centers in the US and Europe, effectively penciling in 10.5 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity starting in 2026 and estimated to cost more than $10 billion. Keep in mind that 10.5 gigawatts is 3 times larger than the amount of electricity consumed by all data centers in Northern Virginia – commonly know as the data center capital of the world due to its favorable state tax incentives and best in-class access to power and internet connectivity. With the steadfast increase in renewable energy demand due to corporate mandates, there are several ways to invest. We’ve already touched on the financing side where groups like Blackrock or Brookfield are raising capital to fund the construction of new power projects. Then there’s the manufacturing side, companies that make solar panels or electrical components, or companies who build wind turbines like GE Vernova (GEV). Finally, there are the utilities who want to own and operate the power generation facitlities over the next several decades, companies like NextEra Energy (NEE) or Constellation Energy Corp. (CEG). Finally there are cutting edge innovations in the power space that are less proven. As an example, innovative nuclear technology, like small modular reactors, is progressing rapidly and has received extensive backing from the US Department of Energy. These new reactors, built by firms such as NuScale Power (SMR), are smaller than traditional reactors and don’t have to be custom-built on-site. The process of generating electricity through nuclear fission is the same, but the benefits include reduced construction time, enhanced passive safety features, greater flexibility in deployment, and more efficient fuel usage. For broad adoption with data centers in the US, we’ll need to see continued investment in generation capacity and regulatory compliance, so patience is key. CHANGJIANG, CHINA - AUGUST 10: Aerial view of the core module of China's Linglong One, the world's ... [+] first commercial small modular reactor (SMR), installed on August 10, 2023 in Changjiang Li Autonomous County, Hainan Province of China. Linglong One, which is self-developed by the China National Nuclear Corporation, was installed successfully in Hainan on August 10. (Photo by Luo Yunfei/China News Service/VCG via Getty Images) The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence and pursuing energy demand are creating significant opportunities in the energy sector. As hyperscalers like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft ramp up their AI infrastructure, the need for massive amounts of electricity will drive investments in both traditional and renewable energy sources. While fossil fuels may provide immediate solutions due to existing infrastructure, the long-term focus is shifting toward renewables, such as wind, solar, and even nuclear power to meet sustainability goals. Well-established and innovative companies in the energy sector, especially those forming strategic partnerships with hyperscalers can offer an alternative method to invest in the AI market besides buying chip companies or hyperscalers directly, even if the full societal benefits of investment end up taking years to play out. The ongoing collaboration between energy and AI firms will be crucial for supporting AI adoption and addressing challenges that lie ahead. Regardless of any short-term uncertainties, the unrelenting demand for energy remains far from being satisfied, and investors should continue to monitor the space for opportunities. One Community.

Title: BlackRock exec says new Ethereum ETF faces ‘narrative’ challenge

The volume and inflows for BlackRock’s recently-launched Ethereum ETF are vastly lower than their Bitcoin counterparts—and the company’s head of digital assets, Robert Mitchnick, doesn’t expect that to change anytime soon. Speaking at the Messari Mainnet conference in New York, Mitchnick conceded that the performance of BlackRock’s exchange-traded fund for Ethereum—known as ETHA—has so far been “underwhelming” compared to its Bitcoin ETF. But he urged the audience to compare ETHA against ETFs overall: “It’s very rare that you see an ETF get to a billion AUM in seven weeks, as ETHA did. In most cases, it takes multiple years to never for a new ETF to get to a billion.” The world’s largest asset manager launched their Bitcoin ETF in January to wild success, as IBIT reached $2 billion in assets under management within 15 days. ETHA’s debut in July was much less lucrative, accumulating about $1 billion within a month. Today, IBIT sits at $24 billion in assets under management, while ETHA remains at around $1 billion. “With ETH, I think the investment story and narrative is a bit less easy for a lot of investors to digest, so that’s a big part of why we’re so committed to the education journey that we’re on with a lot of our clients,” Mitchnick said. “And so, you don’t expect them to ever be quite as large in terms of flows and AUM as their Bitcoin counterparts are. But it’s still a pretty good start.” BlackRock is one of the largest asset managers to embrace crypto as an integral part of its business strategy, but it’s not the only one. BlackRock began trading spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, alongside ten others approved by the SEC at once, an unprecedented and transformative decision making cryptocurrency accessible to mainstream investors. Since then, spot Bitcoin ETFs have acquired $61 billion in cumulative total new assets, according to SoSoValue data. Recently, spot Bitcoin ETFs had a monster run, pulling in $365 million in a single day. BlackRock, Fidelity and ARK Invest consistently lead the charge in spot Bitcoin ETFs. More recently, the SEC approved nine spot Ether ETFs. BlackRock, Fidelity, Bitwise and Invesco are among companies that have launched Ether ETFs. Since their launch, these ETFs have collectively grabbed about $7 billion. During the course of his Mainnet interview, Mitchnick also discussed the upcoming election, decentralized finance and tokenization. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Focus On The Data To Avoid Future Bear Traps

Bear and bull in a trap. The stock market was able to rally last week despite the larger-than-expected 0.50% rate cut by the FOMC. As is often the case the averages gyrated after Fed Chair Powell's press conference and higher open the Dow Industrials closed down 293 points. Most will be happy that September is now over as the stock market had a rough start for the month as on September 3rd the S&P 500 gapped 25 points lower and closed down 2.1% while the Nasdaq Composite was down 3.1%. Nvidia Corp (NVDA) was down 9.5%. The selling accelerated for the next three days dropping to a low of 5402.62 which was a decline of 4.3% from the pre-labor day weekend close of 5649, point a. In my view, the drop was due in part to the widespread stock market commentary warning investors and traders of September’s poor seasonal track record. Therefore many were on the sidelines or short when the S&P reversed to the upside on September 11th, point b, in reaction to the CPI report. This I felt “ reflected an important change in the market outlook.” The bullish action of the advance/decline lines set the stage for the upside breakout in the S&P 500 in reaction to the FOMC announcement. My view of investing or trading based on seasonal tendencies was reiterated in 2015. “I have written many times in the past about seasonal tendencies and I have always stressed that one should only invest or trade a seasonal trend when the technical studies are in agreement.” Some investors and traders fail to recognize that comments like “the worst performance of any month” are mostly based on averages. In this case, going back to 1945. The unanimity of the commentary I think led to an oversized short position heading into September. Many who took a bearish bet would be surprised to learn that since 2006 the S&P 500 has had September gains of 2.46%, 3.58%, 3.68% and even up 8.71% in 2010. In fact, over the past seventeen years, it has been higher nine times. Exposure to this data may have kept some from selling their positions or buying puts based on the long-term averages. The lower close after the FOMC announcement had some prepared for heavier selling the next day. Instead, the overnight trading was very positive as the Spyder Trust (SPY Principal Shareholder Yield Index ETF SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust ) opened 10 points higher or 100 points higher on the S&P 500. This was likely quite tough for those on the wrong side. Markets The bullish end to the week moved most of the averages higher led by the Dow Jones Transportation Average which was up 2.7%. It was followed by a 1.2% in the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD SPDR Gold Shares ) which was up 1.2% just barely stronger than the Nasdaq 100 (NDX) 1.1% gain. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were both up 0.6% while the iShares Russell 2000 (IWM iShares Russell 2000 ETF ) was down 0.2%. For the week on the NYSE, 1672 issues were advancing and just 1190 declined. NYSE Composite Monthly The data is still pointing higher as the monthly chart of the NYSE Composite completed a flag formation, lines a and b, in December of 2023. At the time both the NYSE Stocks Only Advance/Decline line and the NYSE All Advance/Decline were above their EMAs and therefore positive. In January of 2024, both advance/decline lines moved through their long-term resistance, lines c and d, which confirmed the positive price action. As we move into October both A/D lines are positive as they are well above their rising EMAs. The widening gap does mean they are getting overbought. In addition to the advance/decline data I also focus on the price and volume data. The price data determines the moving averages and I concentrate on the 20-period exponential moving averages (EMAs) on the monthly, weekly, daily, and even the hourly data. Invesco QQQ Trust The price data is used to determine the pivot levels as well as the starc bands. This weekly chart of the Invesco QQQ Invesco QQQ Trust Trust (QQQ) includes the yearly pivot levels for the past four years. These are based on the prior year's data. From early 2020 until early 2022 QQQ stayed above its pivot. In March 2023, QQQ closed back above the pivot and opened 2024 well above the yearly pivot at $358.78. The weekly Nasdaq 100 Advance/Decline line broke out above the long-term resistance, line b, in November of 2023 (point 3). It has been forming higher highs and higher lows since then as the decline in April 2024 held support before it again surged higher. The weekly relative performance (RS) is one of the key tools I use to determine whether SPY or the QQQ is going to be the best performer. The RS peaked in November 2021 and then dropped sharply. The RS support, line c, was broken in early 2022 (point 1) which indicated that QQQ was now lagging not leading the SPY. The RS downtrend, line d, favored the SPY over the QQQ in 2022. The break of this downtrend and the move above the rising EMA was a sign that QQQ was again leading the SPY. In 2023 the RS stayed above its EMA but it has crossed above and below it several times in 2024. Currently, the RS is below its EMA but rising. If the RS is now able to move back above its EMA that will be a sign that QQQ is again a market leader. Given the global risk factors and the upcoming election, I would not be surprised if there is a sharp 1-3% pullback or two in October. But the strong trend in the advance/decline lines is a positive factor for stocks after the election and into the end of the year. Going forward try to just use hard data in your decision-making process for investing or trading. Avoid making decisions based on any general market commentary, seasonal analysis, or the public investing stance of any large hedge fund. This will help you avoid future bear or bull traps.

Title: ‘National Security’ Officials Who Endorsed Harris Tied To Intel Agencies, Defense Contractors

Over 700 members of National Security Leaders for America (NSL4A) signed a letter endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris last week, but many of the officials are aligned with defense contractors and organizations pushing for U.S. involvement in foreign conflict. Some of the officials voted for the U.S. invasion of Iraq – including former Secretaries of State John Kerry and Hillary Clinton – which amounted to a nearly $140 billion boon to private contractors, according to CNN. In addition to bureaucrats and veterans of the intelligence community, the list features numerous individuals affiliated with defense contractors, government-funded think tanks, and organizations partnered with arms manufacturers. The letter asserts Harris will defend democracy while former President Donald Trump will enable authoritarianism, touting her support for Ukraine. Harris recently toured a munitions factory in Pennsylvania with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The letter does not mention that Russia invaded Ukraine during the Biden-Harris administration. (RELATED: “Many People Died, And What For?”: Ukrainians Increasingly Willing To Make Peace With Russia As War Rages On) “America’s national security requires a serious and capable Commander-in-Chief.

For example, former Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson serves on the board of directors of Lockheed Martin, according to the company’s site. NSL4A member Rear Admiral John D. Butler spent a decade at Lockheed Martin, including as Vice President for Naval Strategic Systems, according to his bio at University of Texas at Austin. Former Acting Secretary of the Navy, Buddie J. Penn, worked for Loral Federal Systems, which was acquired by Lockheed Martin in the late nineties, the Naval Historical Foundation states in his biography. In a world of rising conflicts, we need a leader who stands up to dictators, not one who offers praise.

Former CIA director and Deputy Secretary of Defense, John Deutch, served as director of Raytheon, according to the EFI Foundation. Former National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Director, Letitia A. Long, was elected to Raytheon’s Board of Directors in 2015, according to PR Newswire (although she is not presently listed on Raytheon’s site). Brett B. Lambert, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, served as Vice President of Corporate Strategy for the defense contractor from 2015-2019, according to Stimson. (RELATED: Biden Pentagon Rolls Out $1.7 Billion Arms Package To Ukraine) If the endorsers are not directly tied to the arms industry, some are involved in organizations supported by major defense contractors — notably, think tanks that influence U.S. national security and foreign policy. Over 50 of those who signed the letter are members of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), which publishes Foreign Affairs and is a heavyweight in the D.C. influence industry. CFR is partnered with various companies, from Blackrock to defense contractors. Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman are listed as Bronze level members of the Council. A Bronze corporate membership is at least $50,000, according to CFR. Members include former Secretary of Homeland Security and Democratic Arizona Governor Janet Napolitano, as well as former Under Secretary-General of the United Nations, Catherine Bertini. The next president will face serious foreign policy challenges. CFR offers a full suite of resources to keep track of developments on critical issues and the U.S. role in the world: https://t.co/72dyjTXpdW pic.twitter.com/Yla27la9Sr — Council on Foreign Relations (@CFR_org) September 27, 2024 More than a dozen of the officials are members of the Atlantic Council, which partnered with Lockheed Martin in 2022. NSL4A member and former Ambassador Stuart Eizenstat is listed as a lifetime director for the Council, according to its website. In 2022, Lockheed Martin Corporation and General Atomics both contributed at least $250,000, according to its 2022-2023 annual report. The Council also received over $1 million in contributions each from the Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of State in 2022. Notably, the Atlantic Council’s Scowcroft Center “directly shaped key US and allied strategy documents, including through private meetings with senior officials on the National Security Strategy, National Defense Strategy, and NATO’s Strategic Concept,” according to its report. Multiple members of NSL4A – including John Kerry – are also affiliated with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. That group received funding from The Boeing Company, according to its 2023 annual report. Additionally, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Open Society Foundations – the latter founded by left-wing billionaire George Soros – contributed to the organization. (RELATED: Trump Pledges To ‘Bring Peace To The World’ After ‘Very Good’ Phone Call With Zelensky) Around a dozen officials are connected to the military think tank the RAND corporation. RAND is funded by the U.S. government, according to USA spending. Over half of its nearly $200 million in government funding this past year came from the DOD, according to the database. Former Secretary of the Navy Richard Danzig is listed as a member of RAND’s Board of Trustees, along with Chuck Hagel, according to RAND’s site. A member of NSL4A’s steering committee, former Ambassador Jeff Bleich, serves on the board of RAND Australia, according to RAND. Last year, RAND published a report detailing the potential consequences of prolonging the Ukraine-Russia conflict. However, two RAND directors later wrote an article in Foreign Policy advising against a peace deal with Russia.

The group’s president, Rear Admiral Michael E. Smith, founded National Security Leaders for Biden, according to the NSL4A site. Obama administration officials including former Ambassador Susan Rice and former national security advisor and speechwriter Ben Rhodes also signed the letter. There are at least 68 members who served in the intelligence community. Democrats overwhelmingly have a positive view of intelligence agencies while Republicans are increasingly skeptical, according to a Gallup poll. Just look at what complete authoritarians today’s liberals are: they revere CIA, FBI, the Pentagon and even the Homeland Security: the once-controversial creation of Bush/Cheney in 2002 for the War on Terror. Dick Cheney and Bill Kristol’s support for Dems makes perfect sense. pic.twitter.com/xJT9KPjy7s — Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) September 25, 2024 Various high-ranking intelligence officials were present, including former CIA Director John Brennan. Notably, Brennan previously signed a letter that characterized the New York Post story on Hunter Biden’s laptop as “Russian disinformation.” The Post’s story was verifiably true, as the Daily Caller News Foundation confirmed. Former Director of National Intelligence Jim Clapper and Senior Counselor at Palantir Technologies Wendy R. Anderson are listed among the members. Palantir is partly funded by the CIA, according to Reuters. Former Republican Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, although not on the list, also endorsed Harris.

Title: Bitcoin: THIS key level hints at BTC’s next bull run

Time Published: 2024-09-30T22:00:54Z

Bitcoin’s recent price performance has been quite bullish. Here is a key metric to track further bullish momentum. Bitcoin [BTC] has recently shown signs of stabilization above the $64,000 mark, although it initially surged to $66,000 in the early hours of the 30th of September. Since then, a correction has brought the asset down to $64,633, marking a slight 1.4% decline. Despite this short-term dip, a broader view reveals Bitcoin’s growth, with the asset up by 10.2% over the past two weeks. However, the question remains: when will Bitcoin start the bull run that many experts predict could push its price into six figures? To provide clarity for investors, CryptoQuant, an on-chain data provider, has shared critical metrics for tracking Bitcoin’s bullish momentum. The platform published a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter) aimed at helping investors understand where Bitcoin might be headed. They noted that Bitcoin’s strong momentum over the past three weeks—rising over 23% from $52,500 to above $65,000—has been partly fueled by increased demand for spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). Notably, combined inflows from BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark totaled $324 million on the 26th of September, signaling heightened interest from U.S. investors. Source: CryptoQuant According to CryptoQuant, one of the key drivers for Bitcoin’s recent rally is the resurgence of short-term holders back into profit territory. These holders, defined as investors who have moved their Bitcoin within the last 155 days, have an average purchase price of around $63,000. As Bitcoin’s price hovers above this level, it could act as a strong support level, reinforcing bullish sentiment. Source: CryptoQuant The futures market also offers significant insights into Bitcoin’s price trends. CryptoQuant revealed that Bitcoin’s Open Interest was $19.1 billion at press time. Historically, surges past $18.0 billion have led to price corrections. Source: CryptoQuant This marks the seventh time such a threshold has been crossed since March 2024, prompting caution around the possibility of a short-term dip. Despite this, the overall trend of increasing futures activity reflects growing investor confidence. Another notable development is the transformation of spot Bitcoin ETF holdings into long-term holder supply. As coins surpass the 155-day holding period, they are increasingly categorized as part of the long-term supply. Source: CryptoQuant While this shift might suggest a bullish outlook, CryptoQuant warns that such movements are often observed in the later stages of a bull market, indicating potential market maturity or a transition phase in Bitcoin’s trajectory. Beyond the fundamental metrics, several analysts have shared their perspectives on where Bitcoin could head next. Javon Marks, a prominent crypto analyst, suggested that Bitcoin was nearing a critical resistance level defined by a “descending broadening wedge” pattern. Source: Javon Marks/X According to Marks, a bullish breakout past this resistance could propel Bitcoin to a target range of $99,000 to $100,000, an increase of over 51% from its current price. His outlook emphasized that Bitcoin may be gearing up for a significant move in the coming weeks. Similarly, another analyst, Captain Faibik, noted that Bitcoin bulls currently hold a strong position in the market. Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024–2025 With Bitcoin approaching a crucial resistance level of $68,000, Faibik speculated that a successful breakout from the broadening wedge could see the cryptocurrency reach $88,000 to $90,000 by the end of December. However, he also cautions that failure to break through this resistance, or a potential fake-out, could see Bitcoin retest support zones around $57,000.

Title: SoftBank to Invest $500M in OpenAI for the First Time—Is It Late to the Party?

SoftBank (SFTBF) is looking to invest in OpenAI for the first time. The Japanese conglomerate helmed by billionaire Masayoshi Son has reportedly agreed to chip in $500 million via its second Vision Fund in a round that values the ChatGPT maker at a staggering $150 billion, The Information reported today (Sept. 30). The round is set to be led by Thrive Capital, which is investing $1 billion. Other participants could include Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Tiger Global Management and the United Arab Emirates-backed fund MGX. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. SoftBank’s involvement would represent one of Son’s most significant bets on A.I. so far. It would also follow missteps made by the conglomerate’s first Vision Fund, which infamously backed WeWork and suffered heavy losses after its collapse in 2023. Until now, Son’s most notable A.I. investment has been SoftBank’s majority ownership of Arm, a U.K.-based chip designer. SoftBank in May reported a $4.6 billion gain for its Vision Funds for the fiscal year, largely driven by Arm’s 2023 IPO. In the past few years, the conglomerate has been on “defense mode,” said Son during SoftBank’s 2023 annual shareholder meeting last June. “Three years ago, we didn’t have a lot of cash on hand,” said Son at the time, noting that SoftBank has since amassed more than $35 billion. “We are ready to shift to offense mode,” he declared, adding his primary interest was playing a large role in the “A.I. revolution.” Besides partaking in an investment round for Perplexity AI, an A.I.-driven search engine, earlier this year, the company has largely taken a backseat to A.I. startups and reportedly passed on investments in OpenAI competitors like Mistral AI, Anthropic and Cohere. Its willingness to back OpenAI, however, should come as no surprise—Son has repeatedly sung the praises of the company, stating that he is a “heavy user of ChatGPT” and calling OpenAI CEO Sam Altman “one of the key people on Earth.” SoftBank and OpenAI did not respond to requests for comment from Observer regarding SoftBank’s investment. SoftBank’s bet on OpenAI is quite late by venture capital standards, given its already colossal valuation. But the high-flying A.I. company still has room for growth, according to analysts. The company hit $3.4 billion in annualized revenue in June and is “progressing towards $5 billion in annual recurring revenue, driven primarily by its ChatGPT product,” Brendan Burke, PitchBook’s senior emerging technology analyst, told Observer via email. PitchBook estimates OpenAI is set to benefit from a generative A.I. software market that is on pace to double next year and exceed $30 billion, he added. “This revenue growth supports further valuation growth, which encourages employees to remain at the company and progresses toward the trillion-dollar valuation that CEO Sam Altman believed the company can grow into,” said Burke. SoftBank’s investment comes at a time of uncertainty for OpenAI. The company last week lost three top executives, and Altman is reportedly planning a restructuring that will change the company’s capped-profit model. “Leadership changes are a natural part of companies, especially companies that grow so quickly and are so demanding,” said Altman in a post on X announcing the recent departures.

Title: How Meta’s Metaverse Bet Went From Awkward to Wow

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily With Meta’s Orion AR glasses, photorealistic virtual spaces and Puma’s mixed-reality shopping, fashion has a lot to ponder. Tech Reporter All of a sudden, virtual technology seems less like a fading fad and more like a viable wave of the future — and Meta, keeper of chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg’s metaverse dreams, must be thrilled. The major takeaway from the Meta Connect developer conference last week was that the company finally succeeded in building full holographic, augmented reality glasses, or at least a prototype. Though early, the implications matter because, as Zuckerberg sees it, this is the technology that will someday replace smartphones. But that just scratches the surface, especially for the fashion business. Because Meta also unleashed a slew of new reality-bending features and experiences that could change how brands operate and communicate in the near, not far-off, future. Related Articles Technology Tech Tuesdays: ChannelEngine Now on SAP Beauty Features Marla Beck on Her Plans for Hydrafacial Parent Company BeautyHealth Holographic AR Glasses You May Also Like Seven months after Apple launched its Vision Pro mixed reality headset, the Meta CEO surprised the crowd by showing off the Orion prototype. Forget bulky and heavy headsets, or holding up a smartphone screen. For Meta, stepping into an AR or MR experience will be a matter of putting on a pair of spectacles. This was always the goal of its EssilorLuxottica partnership. First, they created the Ray-Ban smart glasses, which continue to get smarter with evolving artificial intelligence features and expanded styles and colors, including a new transparent frame. Lessons learned along the way were then applied to the Ray-Ban’s bigger, techier cousin. And Orion is just that. The prototype is set in a thicker frame with beefier specs, including projection technology that can beam interactive visuals onto the lenses. It also features AI-powered voice control, eye- and hand-tracking — so users can select elements by reaching for or looking at them — as well as a wrist-based neural interface. Imagine designers collaborating on a new capsule collection using AR or MR, conceptualizing ideas together or tweaking virtual pieces in real time. With gestures, they can easily switch colors, bring up the hemline, add embellishments and do other things, and visually see the work progress — as if the item was physically on the table between them. Extend that to shopping, and it gives a whole new meaning to browsing products. Meta embarked on the Luxottica partnership four years ago, but the effort to build full-fledged holographic AR glasses goes back further. It started with the 2014 acquisition of virtual reality developer Oculus, which eventually became Meta’s Reality Labs division. So Zuckerberg has been talking about virtual experiences for 10 years, and specifically glasses-based AR for four years. Now with a tangible prototype — which isn’t Meta’s first, but it’s the first to be showcased publicly — the vision looks more than just feasible. It is actually on the way. “So with Orion we are getting closer to achieving the dream of Reality Labs, to create the next major computing platform that delivers a deep sense of presence — like you were right there with another person,” Zuckerberg explained. “This is where we are going.” The big reveal set off plenty of buzz in tech circles, but analysts seem mixed. While some are skeptical, others are so impressed, they actively wonder why the CEO started off by talking about Meta Quest, Ray-Ban and Meta AI updates instead of Orion. The answer should be obvious. This is Zuckerberg’s “One more thing” moment, echoing Steve Jobs’ penchant for saving the most exciting Apple debuts for last. Bank of America Securities analyst Justin Post, who put a “buy” rating on Meta stock, told clients that interest will swirl around Orion more than the Quest headset. Perhaps someday. But for now, the Quest is an actual product circulating in the market, which is why the next item may be more immediately gratifying. Fashion, Meet Hyperscape According to Counterpoint Research, Meta already accounts for 74 percent of the global VR and AR market, as of the second quarter of 2024, and with a new budget headset, the Quest 3S, that number could jump even further. A cheaper device will surely please some consumers, but brands may be more intrigued by the new photorealistic avatars and environments coming to this and other models. “We call this Hyperscape,” said Zuckerberg, “and the way this works is, you can use your phone to scan a room and then recreate it, or you can step into a room that someone else has scanned and shared.” He then showcased visual artist Daniel Arsham’s studio in New York and an L.A. music studio used by Green Day. More will be available in the Horizon Hyperscape beta app over time, he added. The potential for photo shoots or runway scenes that are never broken down, but virtually memorialized jumps to mind. Brands could also give customers access to behind-the-scenes spaces, as a way to forge a personal connection. Rise of the Visual Döppelbots Another fascinating tidbit is a new Meta AI power, specifically AI Studio. The set of tools gives creators a new capability to create AIs that can interact with their communities on social media. In a demo, creator and author Don Allen Stevenson III showed an AI version of himself that he trained to respond to frequently asked questions, just as he himself would respond to fans. This is essentially a visual bot — perhaps a döppelbot — that looked and spoke like him. Meant to be helpful, this one can get creepy. But if curated and trained well, it might be a novel way for a renowned designer to offer some face time with fans, clients and others without the time drain. For users, real-time styling advice will now be possible using the Ray-Ban smartglasses, thanks to multimodal video AI. “Meta AI is now going to be able to give you real-time help as you are doing things, like trying to figure out what outfit you want to wear to a party that you’re going to,” said Zuckerberg. For example, if a person sifts through various clothes to weigh options, the camera on the smart Ray-Bans can see them too, recommending that dress on the right or remembering something it saw earlier. Meta AI can even give that advice in some familiar voices, including John Cena, Judi Dench, Kristen Bell, Keegan Michael Key or Awkwafina. Learn a Second Language — Fast Another new Threads feature uses AI to power real-time language translation dubbing with automatic lip syncing. So forget captions or dubbed voiceovers. A video by a Spanish speaker could be viewed in English, or vice versa, as if the spokesperson, model or other personality is actually speaking the other language. International or multiregion brands, take note. Meta’s Puma Collab Brings Mixed-reality Shopping Unlike the others, Meta’s Puma collaboration wasn’t part of the keynote. But it should have been. During the conference, Meta’s Web Platform Team teased “the future of e-commerce” through a new web-based extended reality shopping scenario. Extended reality, or XR, is a blanket term covering virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) or mixed reality (MR). The Puma shopping experience works as a virtual overlay of product on the headset’s camera pass-through view. But it’s not a lean-back proposition. Shoppers can swipe to change the item’s color, and “experience how each colorway transforms the environment around them,” according to a representative. Every design will come with a unique atmosphere. The experience will officially roll out for Quest users this fall. However, it looks like a better fit for Orion. There’s a sense of separation in seeing the world through the headset’s live camera feed, whereas eyeglasses offer a direct view of reality. In other words, there’s nothing to stand between the consumer and the product. “A lot of the stuff we’ve been talking about for a long time … glasses, mixed reality, AI — it’s happening,” Zuckerberg said at Meta Connect. “And you know, we can start to see how the future of computing and the future of human connection are going to look and it’s pretty awesome.” Analysts apparently need more convincing, at least when it comes to Orion. Martin Yang, of Oppenheimer, told clients in a note that Orion is no Apple Vision Pro killer, citing cost. There’s no ship date or retail price announced yet — again, because it’s a prototype — but it will likely top the rival device’s $3,500. Some estimates say Orion costs $10,000 or more to build. Yang still called it “impressive,” given that “most other AR glasses on the market, despite heavier designs, have much narrower FOVs [fields of view] of 40-50 degrees,” he said. Post, of Bank of America, believes Orion is “several years (and tens of billions) away from general release.” In the meantime, Meta is giving creators and brands plenty of other tools to play with.

Title: The Memo: To AI or no?

Hello, Memo readers! AI is gaining some fans in a place where many also fear it: the office. People who use AI in the office seem to have a “healthier” relationship with their work, compared to those who don’t use AI at all, according to a survey of 15,600 workers commissioned by HP (who’s hardware and software is increasingly being infused with AI). “Knowledge workers who use AI are +11-points happier with their relationship with work than their colleagues who don’t,” HP said in its latest Work Relationship Index report. The study also found that 90% of surveyed AI users say the tools have helped them save more time, 85% say the tools helped them dedicate more time to important and timely tasks, 84% reported that AI helped them be more creative, while 83% said such services helped them to find pleasure in their work. But while some employees use AI tools to improve their work lives, many are concerned about the downsides of the rise of workplace AI, including its role in layoffs. “It’s a good warning that with more automation and decision support tools, less human interactions will be necessary,” said Christoph Wollersheim, consultant at leadership advisory firm Egon Zehnder. “There are great benefits that will come with the automation, but also risks that personal relationships will suffer or will get replaced by AI,” he told Quartz. Read the full article here. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is creating technology likely to upend humans’ relationship with the written word. But when Altman needs to keep his thoughts organized, he still relies on pen and paper. “There’s all these like fancy notebooks in the world. You don’t want those. You definitely want a spiral notebook because one thing that’s important is you can rip pages out frequently, and you also want it to lie, like, flat and open on the table,” Altman said on the “How I Write” podcast hosted by David Perell.

By Laura Matthews, Suzanne McGee NEW YORK (Reuters) -The Texas Stock Exchange announced a board of directors on Monday in its latest step toward building a national exchange to rival long-established platforms in New York and said it was gearing up to launch trading next year. TXSE announced in June that it plans to register with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission with backing from BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and Citadel Securities. It said on Monday it had secured $135 million. The exchange also said on Monday that Rick Perry, a former governor of Texas and former U.S. energy secretary, will be a board member. Other directors include Rick Roberts, a former SEC commissioner, and Alex Bussandri, global head of strategy at Citadel Securities. The exchange has also drawn staff members from Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange, a division of the Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE), as well as other trading platforms, it said on Monday. "Texas Stock Exchange is pulling big names in preparation for the potential launch in 2025," said Owen Lau, a senior analyst at Oppenheimer & Co, noting that the space is competitive. Nasdaq announced last week it put in place a regional management structure for its global listings franchise and appointed Texas-native Rachel Racz, as head of listings for Texas, Southern U.S. and Latin America. It didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. James Lee, founder and chief executive of TXSE Group Inc, said the exchange plans to submit a SEC registration in the coming months. After approval, he added that TXSE will execute its first trades by the end of 2025 and launch its listing early in 2026, making Dallas "a new hub for capital markets in the United States". Texas Governor Greg Abbott said on Monday that the exchange will ensure that businesses have access to capital and that market participants have more choice. The exchange also named Cam Smith as its global head of trading and co-president. Smith began his career working for electronic trading platforms and served as president of Quantlab, an automated proprietary trading firm. Jeff Brown, a former acting general counsel at Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW), is serving as general counsel of TXSE Group Inc and chief regulatory officer of the exchange. Nicole Chambers, who handled the Texas market for Nasdaq, will run corporate listings. Jeff Karcher and Marc Cunningham, who covered the southeast U.S. and Texas while working at the NYSE, will serve as global managing director.

Title: Ever Lose Track of Time in a Costco? You're Not Alone

Not only does Costco Wholesale (COST) do a good job of getting its 76 million members in the door—but, according to a new report, manages to keep them there, too. The average Costco visit lasted 37.3 minutes for U.S. customers in the first half of 2024, according to a Monday report from Emarketer citing data from Placer.ai. That’s more than Walmart (WMT) (31.8 minutes) and Target (TGT) (28.7 minutes), according to the report. Costco is also the only one of the three to see its average "dwell time" for customers staying in-store increase from the first half of 2021 to the same period this year. One likely reason for the extended stays is that Costco frequently changes its layout, creating a "treasure hunt" experience for customers. The membership-based retailer isn’t alone in changing things up, but it is notorious for rotating its stock of items. In general, grocery stores are often known to stock essentials, like bread, milk, and eggs near the back of the store so customers have to walk all the way through to find them. Costco had 76 million members at the end of its most recent quarter, but starting Sept. 1 those members are paying more. After the retailer raised its membership price for the first time in seven years, executives said on an earnings call last week that they haven't seen any meaningful changes to renewal trends in the first month.

Time Published: 2024-09-30T18:57:19Z
Full Content:
Stocks defied the odds in September, ticking up to trade at record highs despite the month's reputation as a notoriously rough patch for equities. The S&P 500 rose 5.5% in the third quarter, putting the index up nearly 21% in the first three quarters, its best year-to-date performance of the 21st century. But it was a tumultuous three months. In July and August, stocks recorded some of their best and worst days in years as investors grappled with recession fears and uncertainty about interest rates. Equities were given a lift in September by the Federal Reserve, which joined the ranks of global central banks easing monetary policy when it cut interest rates—by 50 basis points—for the first time in four years. The cut, according to officials, was a preemptive step to support the labor market, which data suggests is cooling but not falling apart. The fourth quarter is historically a strong one for stocks, and analysts—despite noting the likelihood of elevated volatility—are broadly optimistic about the outlook. As in the third quarter, the economy is likely to be top of mind for investors throughout the fourth quarter. Wall Street will especially be looking at labor market data for evidence of deterioration that would worry the Fed. Initial unemployment claims will be a key data point to keep an eye on, according to analysts at Russell Investments. Claims data, which is released weekly, has less of a lag than other labor market data. "These will provide the clearest real-time guidance on whether the U.S. economy is rebalancing or drifting towards recession," they say. Initial claims sustainably above 260,000 per week would be a red flag, in their view. The four-week average as of late September stood at about 225,000. Fed officials, in their most recent economic projections, penciled in another half-percentage-point cut from interest rates this year. An uptick in unemployment coupled with job losses could spur the Fed into more aggressive action at one of its two policy meetings. That would bring interest rates more in line with market expectations, but would likely also spook investors and do some damage to stock portfolios. The consensus on Wall Street is that the Fed is likely on track to achieve the soft landing it's been chasing for years, which bodes well for stocks. As of late September, the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow calculator estimated the U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 3.1% in the third quarter. Six of the last 10 rate-cutting cycles coincided with recessions. In those instances, the S&P 500 fell on average in the year after the first cut. In the four cycles that coincided with soft landings, the average return was in the high teens. Conventional wisdom says that small-cap stocks should benefit most from interest-rate cuts since they are more likely to have floating-rate debt. However, BlackRock analysts found that large caps have outperformed small caps during rate-cutting cycles since 1984, and that the outperformance is most pronounced outside of recessions. At the sector level, healthcare and consumer staples have performed the best during rate cuts, while communication services and tech have been the worst performers. The S&P 500, excluding the Magnificent Seven, in the second quarter grew aggregate earnings for the first time since 2022. Third-quarter results, which companies will begin reporting in mid-October, are expected to show the profitability gap between tech mega caps and the rest of the market is continuing to narrow. The Mag 7, meanwhile, faces the challenge of convincing Wall Street that their massive investments in artificial intelligence (AI) will pay off. They struggled to do so over the summer, sparking selloffs that the group has yet to fully rebound from. These stocks could continue to face pressure if their earnings fail to live up to Wall Street's lofty expectations. Political developments are likely to amplify stock volatility through the rest of the year, even if they don’t fundamentally change the economic or business outlook. The presidential election in November is one such event that could deliver Wall Street a short-term shock. BlackRock analysis found that, more often than not, the market's knee-jerk reaction to a presidential election is not indicative of its performance over the next year. Still, the presidential candidates have staked out positions on tariffs and corporate taxes that, if enacted, would surely change the outlook for U.S. businesses. Conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine could also keep the stock market on edge as long as they threaten to disrupt global trade or roil energy markets. Experts note, however, that volatility is a two-way street that can provide canny investors with opportunities to buy stocks at attractive valuations. Heightened volatility can also turbocharge short-term returns. Since 1990, the S&P 500 has returned 16% on average in the six months after the Cboe Volatility Index has risen to 29 or higher, compared with an average return of 5% in less volatile periods. Update—Sept. 30, 2024: This story has been updated with the S&P 500's quarterly performance as of the market close on Sept. 30.

Title: DoubleVerify stock hits 52-week low at $16.8 amid market challenges

Full Content:
In a challenging market environment, DoubleVerify Holdings Inc. (NYSE:DV) stock has recorded a new 52-week low, touching down at $16.8. This latest price level reflects a significant downturn from previous periods, marking a stark contrast to the company's performance over the past year. The digital media measurement and analytics firm has seen its stock value decrease by 39.71% over the last year, underscoring the broader market volatility and sector-specific headwinds that have impacted investor sentiment towards DoubleVerify. The 52-week low serves as a critical indicator for investors monitoring the company's trajectory in a rapidly evolving digital landscape. In other recent news, DoubleVerify, a leading software platform for digital media measurement and analytics, reported a 17% increase in Q2 revenue to $156 million, spurred by strong performance in social and Connected TV measurement and a growing supply side platform business. The company also reported an 83% gross margin and $47 million in adjusted EBITDA. Notably, Needham, Truist Securities, and Canaccord Genuity revised their stock price targets for DoubleVerify, while maintaining a Buy rating. In addition to financial outcomes, DoubleVerify introduced its Inflammatory Politics and News category on Meta (NASDAQ:META), a tool designed to protect advertisers from aligning with controversial content. This initiative is supported by DoubleVerify's Universal Content Intelligence, an AI-powered engine that ensures precise content categorization across the platform. DoubleVerify has also established new partnerships and anticipates a positive revenue impact starting early 2025 following the closure of competing services like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL)'s Moat and Grapeshot. The company's growth strategies were highlighted during investor meetings, including expansion into social media properties, adoption of new pre-bid optimization products, and scaling in international markets. These are the recent developments for DoubleVerify. DoubleVerify's recent 52-week low of $16.8 aligns with InvestingPro data showing the stock has taken a significant hit over the last six months, with a price total return of -51.19%. Despite this downturn, the company maintains some financial strengths. According to InvestingPro Tips, DoubleVerify holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, indicating a solid financial foundation amidst market challenges. Additionally, the company boasts impressive gross profit margins, which stand at 82.18% for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024. While the stock is trading near its 52-week low, it's worth noting that DoubleVerify's P/E ratio is 47.09, suggesting it's still trading at a high earnings multiple relative to its current market position. This valuation metric, combined with the company's strong gross margins and cash position, presents a complex picture for investors to consider. For those seeking a deeper understanding of DoubleVerify's financial health and market position, InvestingPro offers 12 additional tips, providing a more comprehensive analysis to inform investment decisions in these volatile times.

Title: Netflix Cancellations Nearly Tripled After Chairman Reed Hastings Endorsed Kamala Harris

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA Enterprise and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply. Netflix chairman Reed Hastings believes Kamala Harris will be good for America — even if his support for her may not be good for Netflix. Days after Hastings, the co-founder of Netflix and former co-CEO, endorsed Harris for president, Netflix had its most cancellations in a year, according to Antenna data. From July 25 through July 29, Netflix’s average daily cancels increased by 2.7x compared to the prior two weeks, the streaming-measurement company found. July 26 was Netflix’s biggest day for churn in the past year. After July 29, Netflix’s churn levels returned back to normal and have not elevated since. All told, July’s churn of 2.8 percent was elevated versus both June (1.8 percent) and August (2.0 percent). Related Stories ‘Jailbreak: Love on the Run’ Wins Battle of Netflix Docs; ‘It Ends with Us’ Tops VOD ‘No Good Deed’ Teaser: Lisa Kudrow and Ray Romano Lead All-Star Cast in New Netflix Mystery Series Bloomberg first reported the news of the temporary churn uptick. Hastings’ support came via a post on X a bit after midnight on July 23. All Hastings tweeted was “Congrats to Kamala Harris — now it is time to win.” It didn’t take more than that for the cancellations to come pouring in. Congrats to Kamala Harris — now it is time to win Hastings did do more than tweet though. He later donated $7 million to a super PAC supporting Harris’ run for president, the Republican Accountability PAC. Hastings said it is the most he’s ever donated to a single candidate. A spokesperson for Netflix did not immediately respond to IndieWire’s request for comment on the Antenna findings. We suspect Netflix will be OK. As of June 30, 2024, Netflix had 277.65 million global paid subscribers. These days, the streamer is making nearly $10 billion in revenue each quarter — with more than $2 billion in profit — and its stock price is over $700 per share. Netflix (NFLX on the NASDAQ) shares had fallen below $200 in 2022 after the company shocked the streaming world with back-to-back quarterly losses. Coincidentally, September 30 is the final day of the third quarter of 2024, which we colloquially refer to as the summer quarter. Netflix will announce the results from July-September on Thursday, October 17, 2024 at 4 p.m. ET/1 p.m. PT. Antenna plans to share its own September data on October 20, a spokesperson told IndieWire, give or take a few days. Hastings, who stepped down in January, will watch from afar as co-CEO Ted Sarandos, Sarandos’ own co-CEO Greg Peters, the company’s CFO Spence Neumann, and its VP of Finance, IR & Corporate Development Spencer Wang present the Q3 results to shareholders and the greater stock market. Netflix is far and away the most impactful streamer in the marketplace; Amazon’s Prime Video and the Disney Bundle are its only real competitors. Election Day is November 5.

Title: Nuclear Power Won’t Solve A.I.’s Energy Problem, Says Hedge Fund Mogul David Tepper
URL: https://observer.com/2024/09/hedge-fund-billionaire-david-tepper-ai-nuclear-energy/
Time Published: 2024-09-30T18:05:19Z

With Big Tech locked in an arms race to become the next dominant A.I. player, companies like Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) are heralding nuclear power as a solution to the technology’s energy problem. But the hedge fund billionaire David Tepper, founder and president of Appaloosa Management, believes nuclear power simply won’t be enough for A.I.’s development needs. “Some of these projections are crazy,” he told CNBC on Sept. 26. “If you’re going to meet the power needs of what they need for A.I., you’re going to have to use natural gas,” he said.

You can opt out anytime. As the likes of Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta spend billions of dollars on building data centers to power A.I. models, they have also sought out ways to offset these data centers’ massive energy consumption. Data centers are expected to double their energy use by the end of the decade and take up 9 percent of the power supply in the U.S., according to the Electric Power Institute. Nuclear power, including the revival of dormant nuclear plants, has emerged as a way to pursue these ambitions without increasing carbon emissions. Microsoft earlier this month signed a power purchase agreement with Constellation Energy, the owner of Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island plant and the site of a 1979 partial reactor meltdown, in a deal that will reopen one of the site’s two units. And in March, Amazon Web Services struck a $650 million deal with the energy company Talen Energy to acquire a nuclear-powered data center in Pennsylvania. Despite the tech world’s optimism about nuclear as a carbon-free alternative, Tepper, who is “exploring different parts of the energy side of the tech market,” said there are too many hurdles to cross when it comes to reviving nuclear power. Governors around the country “aren’t going to let their nuclear power come offline—it’s not going to happen, it’s a joke,” Tepper told CNBC. “It will never get by these individual [public utility commissions].” Tepper currently has an estimated net worth of $21.3 billion. His hedge fund is one of the most successful in recent history, having gained a total of $35 billion since its inception in 1993 and $2.7 billion in 2023 alone. Tepper is also the owner of the NFL’s Carolina Panthers team, which he acquired for around $2.2 billion in 2018. Energy consumption isn’t the only aspect of A.I. that Tepper is unsure about. In June, Tepper unloaded more than 80 percent of his stake in Nvidia (NVDA), the chip maker leading the A.I. boom. The move, which reduced his Nvidia holding to around $85 million, was caused by Tepper’s belief that the stock “was too high at the time and would come down.” “Unfortunately, we didn’t buy it when it came back down,” he said. While the billionaire said Nvidia is looking great for 2024 and 2025, he’s less confident about the company’s prospects—and the sustainability of current A.I. hype—in 2026 and 2027. “I just don’t know how you know,” he said. “It’s not my preferred vehicle versus other things that I have more confidence in.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: Goldman Trades Billions in Thames Water Debt as Hedge Funds Buy

(Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has executed around £3 billion ($4 billion) of trades in Thames Water’s bonds in September, as it makes a market between original investors exiting the beleaguered utility and opportunistic players scooping up the debt at a discount. Hedge funds and distressed funds are continuing to bid for the debt of the UK’s largest water provider, said dealers at the US bank in a note to clients and seen by Bloomberg on Monday. The trading comes as the company has kicked off talks with creditors as it struggles to raise equity. Worries the firm will soon run out of cash led S&P Global Inc. and Moody’s Ratings to downgrade its Class A debt — deemed the safest — by five and six notches respectively last week. They also downgraded its riskier Class B debt. “The Thames structure remains topical at GS as risk continues to change hands post downgrade,” the bank said in the note. “Selling was initially in Class B debt, but more recently we’ve been sellers of Class A risk as well.” Buyers are favoring the more illiquid and lower cash price paper, as the market difference between shorter-dated and longer-dated bonds flattens, the note added. Companies with large amounts of debt often have bonds with wildly differing cash prices because notes are issued over multiple years at different points in the rate cycle. Goldman Sachs has also been trading some of Thames’s bank debt, with £145 million changing hands via its desk since April, according to the note. A spokesperson for Goldman Sachs did not immediately respond to a request for comment. S&P sees a debt restructuring — and consequently a default — as likely in the coming 12 months. The company has said it does not expect to receive funds in the form of equity ahead of a final determination by regulator Ofwat, expected at the earliest on Dec. 19. Thames has been negotiating with a group of creditors holding £10 billion of the company’s Class A debt over options to delay a potential liquidity shortfall. The group of creditors — including investors from BlackRock Inc. and Elliott Investment Management — has been working on its own plan to address the need for new funds and the unsustainable debt pile.

Merritt Wever and Ethan Embry will also star in the David Michôd-directed movie from Black Bear Ben Foster, Merritt Wever, Katy O’Brian, Ethan Embry, Jess Gabor and Chad L. Coleman have joined Sydney Sweeney in the untitled feature about boxer Christy Martin from director David Michôd. The script for the movie was written by Mirrah Foulkes and Michôd. Production commenced Monday in North Carolina, Black Bear announced while revealing the full cast. The official description for the movie reads: “The film tells the unbelievable true story of formidable Christy Martin, who rose to fame as America’s most successful female boxer in the 1990s. A naturally gifted fighter, Christy’s life transformed in 1989 when she met her manager, and later husband, Jim Martin. Breaking boundaries, she became the first woman to sign with iconic promoter Don King, and the only female boxer to appear on the cover of Sports Illustrated. Christy’s charisma, good looks and unwavering resilience in the ring won her a wide fan base and propelled her to become welterweight champion. Behind this well-honed public persona, Christy tackled personal demons, toxic relationships, and an attempt on her life, proving that a fighter’s hardest won victories aren’t always in the ring.” The untitled project is being produced by Kerry Kohansky-Roberts for Anonymous Content, David Michôd for Yoki, Inc., Justin Lothrop and Brent Stiefel for Votiv, Sweeney for Fifty-Fifty Films and Teddy Schwarzman for Black Bear, who is also fully financing. Executive producers include Michael Heimler and John Friedberg for Black Bear, Foulkes, Brad Zimmerman for Yoki, Inc., David Levine, Ryan Schwartz and Nick Shumaker for Anonymous Content, and Harrison Huffman.

Title: BlackRock closes in on purchase of Thames Water contractor Lanes

The asset management behemoth's private markets arm has seen off competition from rival bidders in a deal likely to be worth more than £300m, Sky News learns. City editor @MarkKleinmanSky Monday 30 September 2024 17:39, UK An arm of BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, is closing in on a takeover of a major contractor to Thames Water even as the utility teeters on the brink of collapse. Sky News has learnt that BlackRock's private markets division could strike a deal to acquire Lanes Group, which is based in Leeds, within days. City insiders said that BlackRock had seen off competition from other suitors. It was unclear on Monday how much the asset management behemoth had agreed to pay for Lanes Group, although Sky News reported last month that the contractor was valued at up to £350m. BlackRock has begun to play an increasingly active role as a bidder in processes populated by conventional private equity firms. Lanes Group provides wastewater and drainage services, and generates a significant chunk of its revenues from Thames Water alongside other major water utilities. The industry is under intense pressure from the new Labour government, industry regulator Ofwat and other stakeholders amid public anger over wastage and pollution levels. Thames Water is battling to avoid temporary nationalisation as it faces running out of money within months unless it can raise additional funding. Sky News reported at the weekend that advisers to the utility, which has about 15m customers, have added Carlyle, the private equity firm, to a list of potential rescue investors. Blackrock declined to comment.

Drive business and brand growth with winning media strategies at Mediaweek. Hear from experts at TIME, Peloton, YouTube, Google and more, October 29-30 in New York City. Register. Will it take a maximum effort for Ryan Reynolds to go public? MNTN, the connected TV advertising platform where Reynolds serves as chief creative officer, tapped Morgan Stanley to explore a potential initial public offering, Bloomberg reports. The IPO could take place as soon as early next year, according to Bloomberg, with ongoing discussions being held about matters such as its timing and whether more financial institutions will participate. MNTN provides software that enables brands to create and manage ad campaigns on CTV platforms, highlighted by its MNTN Performance TV platform, a suite of automated optimization technology, measurement, and targeting tools. After collaborating on the first two Deadpool films, Reynolds and George Dewey formed Maximum Effort Marketing in 2018, and its campaigns for another Reynolds venture, Aviation Gin, fueled the agency’s rise to prominence. In June 2021, MNTN agreed to acquire Maximum Effort, permitting it to retain its identity as a creative agency within the MNTN portfolio, retaining Dewey as Maximum Effort’s president, and naming Reynolds CCO of MNTN. Dewey told ADWEEK shortly after the deal was announced, “The biggest benefit is cultural. We wanted to grow, but not in a way where it meant adding layers and pitches and processes that can sometimes take the joy and speed out of marketing.” The company raised $119 million in a Series D financing round in 2021, according to Bloomberg, co-led by funds and accounts managed by BlackRock and Fidelity Management & Research. MNTN added three members to its board of directors in March 2023 to help it manage the company’s growth: retired accountant Joe B. Johnson, Code.org founder and CEO Hadi Partovi, and Deep Sync CEO Grant Ries. Jay Stevens joined the company in June 2023 as general manager, international, after serving as president of omnichannel media buying and media accounting software company Hudson MX.

In recent market activity, Saba Capital Management, L.P., a notable ten percent owner of BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Health Sciences Term Trust (NYSE:BMEZ), has increased its position in the company through a series of stock purchases. On September 26 and 27, Saba Capital acquired a total of 49,504 shares, with the transaction value amounting to approximately $782,788. The purchases were made at prices ranging from $15.81 to $15.89 per share. Following these transactions, the investment firm now holds a total of 20,653,378 shares in BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust. This move by Saba Capital Management demonstrates a growing interest in the health sciences-focused trust, which may be of interest to investors monitoring the sector. Boaz Weinstein, associated with Saba Capital as a ten percent owner, also has a stake in these transactions, aligning with the investment firm's activities. The accumulation of shares by significant owners such as Saba Capital Management often signals a strong belief in the company's future prospects or undervaluation. Investors and market watchers alike may find these purchases noteworthy as they reflect the actions of experienced market participants with substantial knowledge of the company. BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust, traded on the NYSE under the ticker BMEZ, represents an investment opportunity within the health sciences sector, which continues to garner attention amidst ongoing innovations and developments. The recent share purchases by Saba Capital Management in BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust (NYSE:BMEZ) align with some intriguing financial metrics and insights provided by InvestingPro. BMEZ currently boasts a substantial dividend yield of 13.4%, with the most recent ex-dividend date on September 16, 2024. This high yield supports one of the InvestingPro Tips, which notes that BMEZ "pays a significant dividend to shareholders." This generous dividend policy might be a factor attracting large investors like Saba Capital. The trust's market capitalization stands at $1.69 billion, with a P/E ratio of 25.31. While this P/E ratio might seem elevated, it's important to consider it in the context of the health sciences sector, which often commands higher valuations due to growth potential. Interestingly, BMEZ has shown strong performance over the past year, with a 20.16% price total return. The trust is also trading at 95.96% of its 52-week high, indicating recent strength in its share price. This positive momentum could be another factor influencing Saba Capital's decision to increase its stake. However, investors should note that InvestingPro Tips also highlight some potential concerns. The trust "suffers from weak gross profit margins" and its "valuation implies a poor free cash flow yield." These factors may warrant closer examination by potential investors. For those interested in a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers additional tips and insights that could provide a fuller picture of BMEZ's investment potential.

Title: TikTok's owner is reportedly developing an AI model with Huawei's chips

As the U.S. escalates export controls on China, TikTok’s owner is reportedly planning to use a homegrown chipmaker for an artificial intelligence model it’s developing. ByteDance is planning to build an AI model using chips from Huawei, Reuters reported, citing three unnamed people familiar with the matter. The company wants to use Huawei’s Ascend 910B chips to train the model, the people said. ByteDance has reportedly ordered over 100,000 of Huawei’s chips, but, as of July, has received less than 30,000 of them. One person told Reuters the model under development is expected to be less powerful than ByteDance’s Doubao model, which was released last August. “The entire premise here is wrong,” a spokesperson for ByteDance said in a statement shared with Quartz. “No new AI model is being developed.” Huawei did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company’s Ascend 910B chip is used for less intense AI model inferencing, people told Reuters, but training requires more compute power, and therefore, more advanced chips. And Huawei was reportedly having a hard time increasing production of the Ascend 910B — China’s best alternative to Nvidia’s (NVDA) chips that cannot be sold to Chinese customers under U.S. trade restrictions. The chip fabrication machines Huawei uses to produce the advanced chips are designed for older generations of chips, The Information reported, and repurposing them was causing certain components to break down. Since the U.S. began implementing trade restrictions on advanced chips, including those designed by Nvidia, in 2022, ByteDance has sought chips from Chinese companies, and worked on developing its own. ByteDance has designed two chips with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) that it plans to mass produce by 2026, The Information reported. The Chinese government, meanwhile, is encouraging tech companies to buy AI chips from local companies, and become less dependent on Nvidia, Bloomberg reported. Nvidia has developed three AI chips for the Chinese market in compliance with export controls, including the H20, which ByteDance has ordered hundreds of thousands of.

Title: New weight loss drugs could be developed much faster if Roche gets its way

Roche told investors on Monday that it plans to make significant cuts to both the cost and time it takes for it to develop new drugs, including its slate of experimental weight loss and diabetes medications. At an investor event, the Swiss pharma giant announced its goal to reduce the average development costs of launched drugs by 20% and shorten the timeline from early drug discovery to the completion of phase 3 trials by 40% by 2030, according to a presentation posted on the company’s website. These targets include the company’s recently acquired weight loss treatments. Roche is one of several pharma companies racing to break up the anti-obesity drug duopoly held by Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY), which produces Zepbound and Mounjaro. Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts anticipate the global market for these drugs, known as GLP-1/GIP treatments, will reach $105 billion by 2030. The medications work by mimicking hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite. They were originally used to treat type-2 diabetes, but have become highly sought after for their slimming side effects. The 127-year-old Roche first entered the weight loss drug game earlier this year when it bought Carmot Therapeutics for $2.7 billion. The deal included three candidates, CT-996 — a daily pill — and the weekly injectables CT-388 and CT-868. Roche said on Monday that together the three drugs have the potential to reach more than 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.6 billion) in annual sales. In May the company said that patients taking CT-388 lost 18.8% of their weight on average after 24 weeks on the drug in a small clinical trial. As a result, the company said in July that it is fast-tracking the development of its weight loss drug candidates. Its stock has risen over 37% since May.

Title: Super Micro Computer's big stock split is today. Here’s what to know
URL: https://qz.com/super-micro-computer-stock-split-1851660648
Time Published: 2024-09-30T14:35:00Z
Full Content:
Super Micro Computer (SMCI) is set to undergo a stock split after the market closes on Monday, aligning itself with other prominent AI-driven companies like Nvidia and Broadcom, which also executed stock splits earlier this year. Following the split, the stock will begin trading Tuesday at its adjusted—and substantially lower—price. Shortly after the market opened on Monday morning, Super Micro Computer’s shares were priced at $426, reflecting a 1.5% increase. Super Micro Computer’s 10-for-1 stock split is expected to boost demand for the company’s shares. In a stock split, the company increases the number of shares, reducing the share price, but the total dollar value of all shares outstanding remains the same and doesn’t affect the company’s valuation. Super Micro Computer’s 10-for-1 split means that, for each SMCI share an investor owns, they will receive an extra nine after the split is completed. The San Jose-based IT company, which makes hardware that supports AI applications, thrived this year due to the high demand for AI and entered the Fortune 500 at No. 498. As a key partner and reseller of Nvidia’s (NVDA) GPUs and other components, Super Micro integrates its technology into its servers to support AI workloads. Super Micro CEO Charles Liang and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, are both Taiwanese immigrants and have a long-standing relationship. Super Micro Computer went through a rough phase in September when a short seller, Hindenburg Research, published a scathing report accusing the company of accounting red flags and questionable business dealings, including potential sanctions evasion from exports to Russian and Chinese firms. Following these accusations, Super Micro’s stock price took a significant hit. The company refuted the claims, stating that the report contained misleading and inaccurate information and that it would address the allegations in due course.

Title: US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Become Second-Largest Holder Of BTC Behind Satoshi

Since their approval in January 2024, Spot Bitcoin ETFs have been steadily gaining traction in the United States, with the issuers buying hundreds of thousands of BTC as their popularity spread. This has led to a large stash of BTC by these issuers as BlackRock leads the charge. Given their buying spree so far, the number of BTC being held by the Spot Bitcoin ETFs has been rising and is almost at the 1 million mark, The United States Securities and Exchange Commission approved a total of 12 Spot Bitcoin ETFs for trading back in January 2024. Now, only eight months later, these ETFs have managed to acquire more than 4% of the total Bitcoin supply. Combined, this makes the Spot Bitcoin ETFs some of the largest BTC holders. So far, the BlackRock IBIT has been one of the largest buyers of BTC, surpassing even Grayscale’s GBTC, which had a 600,000 BTC head start. Currently, Grayscale holds more than 350,000 BTC, making the firm a top Bitcoin holder. Grayscale is still in second place when it comes to the number of BTC held. However, the Bitcoin fund has recorded more outflows than inflows since January, losing more than half of its stash before the Spot Bitcoin ETF approvals. Now, Grayscale holds less than 250,000 BTC after losing more than $20 billion to other Spot Bitcoin ETFs due to their lower fees. Other Spot Bitcoin ETFs such as the Fidelity FBTC and the Ark Invest/21Shares ARKB has reached almost 50,000 BTC. So far, the funds have been able to garner 924,768 BTC, putting their total holdings very close to the 1 million BTC milestone. In total, the Spot Bitcoin ETFs now boast 4.685 of the total Bitcoin supply. The top Bitcoin wallet with the largest BTC holdings still remains the Satoshi Nakamoto wallet with 1.1 million BTC in it. However, this wallet has been long dormant, and often left out of the top Bitcoin wallets list due to its inactivity. According to the BitInfoCharts website, topping the Bitcoin rich list is the Binance old wallet with 248,598 BTC worth over $16.3 billion. Next is the Bitfinex Hack Recovery wallet with 94,643 BTC, with $6.2 billion. The Mt Gox Hack wallet holds 79,957 BTC for the third-largest at $5.2 billion. The wallet holding the BTC confiscated from the Silk Road bust with 69,370 BTC is in fourth position worth $4.56 billion, and the Binance BTCB Reserve wallet has 68,200 BTC in it, worth $4.49 billion.

Title: Five Frugal Things

The Non-Consumer Advocate by Katy on September 30, 2024 · 59 comments { 55 comments… read them below or add one } The last time we ordered Covid tests they never arrived. However, our insurance company allows us to get 8 tests per month from Walgreens or CVS. Hubby got his last week; as there are only two of us in the house I will wait and pick mine up down the line. Reply 90% of the time when I meet up with friends, we go for a walk in our neighborhood, or a hike at the adjoining nature preserve. A free workout + bonus friend time? Sign me up. I did three of those last week, and my steps are also looking great. 😉 1) Used up absolutely ancient carrots in a crockpot chicken & dumplings recipe (one of my faves). I rinsed the carrots, and they smelled fine, so in they went. I’m the only soup eater in my house, so I made enough for a couple of meals, & froze the rest in single serving containers for easy lunches. 2) Sold some stuff on eBay & relisted a bike on FB Marketplace. I find bikes bring out the biggest negotiators, and I really dislike that part of selling, so I’m giving myself a huge pat on the back for getting this listed & dealing with all of the crazy shenanigans. 3) I really wanted a turkey sandwich on sourdough with sharp cheddar. Thought of stopping by a deli when I was out running errands. Instead, I bought everything I needed to make my own at the store. It was about the same for the ingredients as the sandwich, but so far, I’ve made three sandwiches & another grilled cheese for DS17. Cheaper would have been finding something to eat at home, but this was a good compromise. 4) We allow our home to be a study destination for DS17 & his friends, while they are all studying for their AP classes. They love the library, but it closes early some days. By studying at our house, they avoid having to buy something at a coffee shop or restaurant. 5) Continue to eat from our garden: tomatoes, lettuce, peppers, herbs. And, the pomegranates are almost ripe! Reply Not sure if this was frugal–last Monday we drove to southern Maryland to a produce auction. It was organized twenty-some years ago when the Old Order Mennonites decided to stop growing tobacco and switch to produce. Farmers drove their horse-drawn carts through a gap in the auction house. One paid by the item but had to buy the whole lot. Last year I got 32 long-necked pumpkins someplace else. We had eaten them all by mid-April. So I bid on a lot of 42 winter squash–and won. We schlepped them all home, and I weighed them as Bill brought them into the basement. They average 15 pounds compared to last year’s five and the lot included 46 rather than 42 squash. I have 682 pounds of delicious winter squash. It was time to call women I know who feed large families, hungry neighbors, or the homeless. I rehomed 15 of them yesterday and invited women to come back when they need more. I paid only 30 cents per pound at a time when winter squash run $2-3 per pound in stores. Other than that same old, same old–drinking water, cooking at home, reading library books, and meeting my fabric needs by helping sort donations for my guild’s yard sale. Reply Mary in MD, that’s a wonderful story about the squash! You’ve spread a circle of blessings far and wide. Reply Where is the auction? My daughter lives in Maryland. Is it a regular thing or just a one and done? Reply It’s the Loveville produce auction, slightly southeast of Leonardtown. Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday through December. They have a website she can check out. Big lots and there is a small lot auction as well. I would have picked up cabbage, but the Prius was packed. Reply Thanks Reply Wow, I always wanted to go to one of those auctions, what a steal on the squash! Are they all the same or different? I have at least 200 squash (squashs?) from my garden this year – couldn’t believe how many grew, some are kind of weird (what IS that plant) but pretty, so may become decorations. Got 5 big cinderella type pumpkins and three lovely big white knobbly pumpkins, as well as a multitude of acorn, red kuri, baby pumpkin and medium pumpkin, delicata, plus a selection of dark green and light grey and blotchy and … names to be determined when I re-read the packages… I am now like the zucchini growers, looking for open car windows, LOL. How do you like to cook your squash? Recipes appreciated! * as for sharing your bounty with families you know, that is what the deal-finders do – let their friends know! Reply I think I have Boer, Musque de Provence, and New York cheese squash. I typed out my killer recipe for them last fall in these comments. Robin Robertson’s VEGAN ON THE CHEAP’s peanutty pumpkin stew. I bake them at 350 in halves if I can get them open, whole if I can’t. The ones with tan skin I chop in big chunks and bring to high in my pressure cooker, then turn off the burner. I use my immersion blender to puree them still in the cooker. Eating the skin isn’t a problem, but some people find green flecks off-putting. Reply 1. Used a package of gluten-free pizza dough mix to make two big batches of Italian herb flat bread. It came out quite nice. I cut it into single servings and froze it for my husband’s future meals. 2. My son accidentally bought a package of chicken sandwich meat he was never going to eat, so I chopped it up and used it with some last bits of frozen veggies, homegrown cherry tomatoes and rice to make a very tasty little casserole. 3. Rearranged our pantry to get some bulk purchased food from the clearance store off the floor. 4. Decluttered the pan shelf in the kitchen and found some items to donate, as I just do not bake desserts much any more. 5. The wind that came through from the hurricane tore loose a section of our bamboo fence, which I repaired with some bungee cords and filled in a spot where a bamboo cane shattered with straight sticks cut from some shrubbery. The giant catalpa leaves blown all over the yard got picked up and laid over some muddy areas to keep down the mud my dogs track into the house. Reply Glad you’re okay after the hurricane and only the fence needed bungee cords to hold it together. Don’t know what we’d do without bungee cords and duct tape! Reply Bungee cords are one of the most useful things. Right now one is holding my folded up clothes drying rack up off the floor so the puppy can’t chew on it and another is a divider in the metal mesh document holder on the side of the fridge. The uses are near endless! We need to replace the bamboo fence, but everything is so freaking expensive. Thst’s going to be a project to save up for. Reply Used up the last of the hello fresh discounted meals. Now making comprehensive shopping list We each get our $40 quarterly HABA allowance from United Healthcare so making a separate list for Walmart Sold 2 items via FB both happened to be dog show friends. Delivered 1 to a local dog show I happened to be going to. The other I’ll deliver at a show in the future Reply I really prefer going for a walk with a friend or just sitting on the front porch with a glass of wine rather than dinner out. My daughters, mother and sister have a girls night out once a week. I’ve said I wouldn’t mind if girls night became a bottle of wine with takeout and then help each other fix something or do a project around the house. Anyway here’s my FFT. 1. After many, many years of shopping for a new kitchen table and chairs I finally bought a set off of marketplace. It looks like it belongs in my kitchen and although it’s 25 years old it looks almost new. The only thing is I also had to take the china cabinet too. I don’t need another one and although it’s beautiful I’m not sure whether I’ll keep it. Right now I have the bottom half placed in my great room. I might sell it on marketplace or keep it in my basement for my next house. 2. I picked up a few ball jars on a free table while I was out of town. My daughter slammed on the brakes when she saw the free sign. That’s my kid. My other daughter took home a very cool vintage lamp. We are all very enthusiastic about free piles. 3. I finished a library book on my Kindle and started another. I’m most of the way through The Stone Girl by Dirk Wittenborn. It’s kind of dark but I can’t put it down. 4. My daughter is returning to her previous work schedule M-F which means I’ll be dog sitting for her a few days a week. Her husband stayed with my dog while we were out of town. I’ll also keep their dog while they are on their honeymoon. My oldest daughter and her husband will be gone for three weeks and my mom will keep their dog for them. It sounds crazy but it all works out. 5. I’m eating leftovers from an event I hosted at my house. All leftovers were divided and shared with whoever wanted them. I had several out of town guests that stayed with me which was a significant savings. Reply I’m also included in girls night…insert eye roll. Reply Some of my best time with my friends and family are when we go for walks in the neighborhood or do yard work. Maybe that makes me boring, but I’m ok with it. 1. Due to Hurricane Helene, which missed my area of Florida I was afforded a paid day off of work and some much needed down time. My son scored two days off school which he was able to make up some work. 2. I forced myself to look at sales adds and use Ibotta and some other apps when organizing my grocery list. The savings didn’t feel large, but I believe they add up. I can now cash out $23 in ibotta money. 3. I scanned my receipts into Fetch and Shopkick to also work toward giftcards in the future. I have stopped using Receipt Hog, a similar app, I scan but it doesn’t register the receipts. I tried! 4. I am considering going back to doing a sidegig delivery service. I signed up for Ubereats and realized I had to update my phone. I deleted over 2 gigs of data and updated only to find out that my model iphone will never udpate into ios 16 or higher which leaves me out of the Ubereats app…..back to the drawing board on weird sidegigs I can do to make more money. 5. I cooked from home for the last four days with us going for icecream twice. It felt nice to cook at home…..and a bit time consuming. But yay for eating what we already have at home and packing lunches. Reply 1. I too ordered free Covid tests and shared the news with my daughter and my sister. 2. The New York Times offered to upgrade my digital subscription to full access for the price I was paying ($1/week) for one year. Since this extended the time period I would pay that amount by several months I said yes. I noted the cancel date on my calendar. It is nice to have access to recipes and other things. 3. The grocery store had an offer to save $10 on groceries when you spend $50 on a certain gift card. I decided that was the cheapest way to obtain nutmeg. The nutmeg rang up for more than the shelf price so I received it for free. 4. I made a big pot of chili and used canned tomatoes that most needed to be used and low sodium beans I’d bought on clearance. 5. While we were in the Midwest we ate lunch at Culver’s and took the survey to receive free frozen custard. Reply Oh Culver’s! My fast-food weakness! Lucky I live in New England where there aren’t any or I would be there more than is healthy for me or my wallet. When we travel to an area that has Culver’s, we always make sure to pop in for something delicious. Reply Culver’s is quite prevalent in my area. Their food is well worth the price. I like it that they and another locally founded “fast” food restaurant will raise prices rather than skimp on quality. Reply I was gifted a prayer plant in 2003 and it’s still living, having been re-potted a few times. Interesting when the new leaves start to open. You can actually hear them if things are very quiet – scared me the first time it happened. LOL! Reply This is not frugal, but it makes my husband happy and that makes me happy: we bought an upright freezer with drawers that you pull out. So, now we have a drawer for meat, one for chicken and fish, another for…well, you get the point. His back has been hurting him and he would get so frustrated and in more pain trying to rummage around our chest freezer, so I would not ask him to get anything out of the chest freezer and things would get freezer burned. He is thrilled and, thus, so am I. It is our Christmas gift to each other because, really, we could have stumbled along the way we were. It is so wonderful to have things organized and easy to access. To compensate for this not frugal thing, I: 1. made myself list 10 items on eBay. Four have already sold! Turns out antique jewelry is a hot item. This alone paid for 75% of the freezer cost. 2. Took several bags of things to Good Will. Made sure to get a tax receipt. 3. Did 2 more post office mystery shops that were a longer drive from the house but were being paid with a bonus more than large enough. Another 3% of the freezer paid for. 4. Sent off a birthday gift with one of the post office shops, and a sold item with the other one. This saved me about $20, so more of the freezer paid off. 5. Took the chance and waited for an oil change mystery shop to have a bonus attached because no one wanted it. $160 paid for the oil change we get at the start of every winter, plus some cash. More of the freezer paid off. Only about $40 left to go and the freezer will not have taken anything out of our savings to pay for it. Reply Lindsey, the freezer sounds like an excellent use of your money. May you and your DH have less back pain and less freezer waste as a result. Reply The arthritis in my back was why I bought a small upright freezer to replace our little, very old chest freezer. The new freezer has fixed shelves, but I measured carefully and found baskets to fit at Dollar Tree that pull out so easily. Reply Your new freezer sounds wonderful and I’m sure your DH’s back will thank you both. I never saw one with pull-out drawers…how very convenient! Reply Lindsey, this made my heart sing. I love reading about the love you and your husband have for each other, the organized freezer you now have, and all of the ways you found to pay for it. Reply I’m so glad you got a new freezer that works for you and I like how you’re paying for it. That is awesome. Reply 1. Had some expired (with no extended dates) COVID test kits, so I opened them and recycled as many papers and boxes that I could before tossing the rest. Ugh, I hate waste. 2. Thanks to Heidi Louise’s tip, I ordered free COVID tests from our government. 3. Fed the exterior painting team chocolate cookies I received from a friend and Gatorade that I had received as part of a random take-all Buy Nothing post. I was planning to serve the painters lemonade and chocolate chip cookies, so the timing of the gifts worked out great. Now I can give those cookies and the lemonade to the landscape crew that will be here for three days. Among other things, they will be placing the 70+ boulders that came with our property within the new landscape and for rock walls needed for better drainage. The previous homeowner had the boulders in a pile in the backyard for years and never got around to using them. 4. Saved $1,200 in landscaping costs by moving rocks and plants ourselves and giving away other items on Buy Nothing. Not to mention free workouts! Also brought a carload of rocks to a dear neighbor and used the smaller-size rocks as fill where our driveway has washed out. Used part of the $1,200 savings to buy another tree and expand a planting area. 5. Attended an economist’s presentation at our financial advisor’s office and received a free lunch. Which is ironic since it was economist Milton Friedman who said, “There’s no such thing as a free lunch.” Brought in papers for shredding as the office provides that service for free. Reply @MB in MN – technically your lunch was not free. Time is our most precious resource and you spent time. My micro econ teacher had a true/false test question “If lawyers didn’t charge fees, their services would be free”. False – you’d have to spend time due to the demand of the lawyer’s services. But I do consider free shredding a good deal. Disappointed my go-to local bank has no shred day planned for the rest of this year. A local non-profit offered shred services but I think that went by the wayside during Covid. I should call and ask. I don’t mind paying. Reply FFT, Freebies Galore Edition: (1) On my usual early a.m. stroll through the ‘hood, I came across several interesting finds. The first = two grocery bags full of books in the recycling containers of a nearby apartment complex. The bags were so full that I wasn’t able to get them out of the containers, let alone carry them home on foot. But I reached my “picking stick” into one bag and fished out one book–which turned out to be a nice paperback translation into English of Virgil’s epic The Aeneid?!? (As Mrs. Rachel Lynde says in one of the Anne of Green Gables books, “You’re never safe from being surprised till you’re dead.”) So I’m planning a predawn return tomorrow to this site with the Honda Element and will persuade the bags out of the containers by whatever means. (2) This one’s for you, texasilver: My next surprise came at the local Dollar General’s dumpster–which is usually kept locked, but which was unlocked and open this morning, with a heaping helping of clean, undamaged, and within-date foodstuffs (mostly cereals and crackers) on top. Fortunately, I had a clean backup bag with me, so I loaded it with a family-size box of Kellogg’s Raisin Bran, a box of Ritz crackers, and two boxes of Nature Valley “blueberry muffins” bars (new to me, and I look forward to trying them). And I’m going to take the Element around there tomorrow too, in the hope of scoring more stuff–although this may be chancier. (3) On the set of Depression-era brick steps connecting the main drag below us (where the Dollar General is) with our cul-de-sac at the top of the hill, I found not only more NY State deposit bottles and cans–which were what I was really looking for in my (1) and (2)–but a good solid steel made-in-USA pry bar. I scooped that up immediately, both on general principles and in case whoever left it on the steps was planning to use it for petty crime. (4) One of my later morning errands today was a stop at the pop-up thrift shop run out of a disused bowling alley on Monday mornings only by a local Catholic church, in aid of its food pantry. In addition to my purchases (two Chico’s tops, a pair each of Lane Bryant and Martha Stewart brand jeans, and four skeins of yarn for my next-door neighbor’s close friend, for a grand total of $10), I took a just-past-sell-by date package of Thomas’s English muffins from the free bin. (5) And I’m about to head over to the link provided by Katy for the free COVID tests. Thanks, Katy, and let’s all be prepared! Reply A. Marie, I just want to say that you seem like a very good and caring person and I always enjoy your comments here and on The Frugal Girl. Reply Holy Smokes!! I cannot believe the Dollar store bounty. We do not have one of those in Fairbanks, and I have never been to one when we go Outside, so when people talk about the great deals there I am envious. But to get them for free from their dumpster!! I do have a dumpster story. I once picked up my mail from the post office (there was no delivery to the cabin I was living in, back in the hills) and as I was leaving, I stopped at the open dumpster in the back of the post office to throw away junk mail. Just as I flung some in, I realized I had also thrown in a check for an article I had written. The dumpster was nearly empty so I could not possibly reach the check…I decided to climb in to retrieve it. As it turned out, I was a lot more athletic in my dreams than I was in reality. I could not get out. I finally had to shout for help and eventually this guy peered in and asked me if I was okay. I did not answer with sarcasm, as he was my knight in shining armor. He stood there a minute and said (and I will never forget this), “Miss, getting you out of there is going to be a two man job. I’ll be back.” I was in my 20s and as thin as I ever was going to be…He was good to his word, returning with a real bruiser of a guy who had been drinking. The post office was three doors from a bar, so he probably went in there and grabbed the nearest big man. They tried, heroically, to yank me out by my arms, to no avail. Finally the bigger one said, “I think I can push her ass up and if you can finish pulling her out.” It was very humiliating to have this guy help me put a foot up on the inside brace of the dumpster, and then he put his back against my rear and with a lot of groaning hoisted me up enough that the other guy and I, working together, could pull me out. I was filthy and there was a moment when we thought the inebriated fellow was going to have to be rescued, but eventually it was all over and I went home to wash my clothes. So, when I hear of you and others going into a dumpster, I know that not even bars of gold could tempt me back into one of those things. Reply Lindsey, just to clarify: I have climbed into a few dumpsters back in the days when I was young and agile, but not this time. I simply reached in with my picking stick and retrieved enough items to fill my clean bag that way. I no longer take witless chances. But that’s quite a ripping yarn about you and the check and the two rescuers (one sober and one not so much). Count me in among the many fans who think you should write an autobiography, in addition to the Adventures of Houndini and Clobber Paws. Reply Frugality inspires resourcefulness! Whatever method you need to employ to retrieve your foodstuffs is a good one. Reply What a great story! Reply I’ve done a lot of trash picking but never actually crawled into a dumpster. I was shocked a couple years ago when we were staying at the shore in a house with a bathtub. I decided a long soak with exfoliation would be a great vacation activity. When it was time to get out, I couldn’t. By the time the Mister got back, the water and I were both very cold. Reply That story made me laugh so hard!! I could see it in detail in my mind!! You really should write a blog or book Reply You made me smile A. Marie! You never know what treasure a Dol Gen dumpster will contain. Reply A. Marie, those giant size boxes of Raisin Bran sell for $6.99/box in my area (SW Ohio), so I’d say you got a great deal with the other things you snagged! Reply Thanks Katy and Heidi Louise for the tip about the Covid tests. Like A. Marie, I’m headed over to the site after I finish my FFTs to order some. 1. While out walking with DH, I saw something in a familiar shape in the dirt by the side of the road. Turned out to be a quarter, dirty and almost unrecognizable, but I brought it home, cleaned it up and into the found change jar it went. 2. I found a deposit can on another walk with DH. Only worth 5 cents in my state but I wouldn’t walk by a nickel laying on the ground, so I grabbed it. 3. Like Jill A and others here, I much prefer hosting guests at my house or going to others’ houses for get togethers. It’s not only for the savings but because we can sit around and eat, drink and talk until the cows come home and nobody cares. In a restaurant, there’s always the old side eye from the waitress or hostess who want to keep things moving. I understand in that business time is money which is why I prefer socializing in other ways. Walking is a great way to socialize and get steps in, I find. 4. Speaking of…we had a couple we’ve been friends with for years come over on Friday night for the above-mentioned way of entertaining. DH wanted pizza so we bit the bullet, ordered two and sat on the deck gabbing and talking for five hours! They brought beer and we had seltzer (store brand) on hand. Great time. 5. Reading a library book: The Witches Daughter by Orenda Fink. Great book if you like memoirs. Reply 1. I did another mystery shop with a *relatively* good payout of $22 to eat a hot dog and some fries, and it was in the neighborhood of several errands. 2. Almost stuck to my list at the grocery store, but I did purchase a $2.50 container of dolmas (for 10). I’ll have a couple for my lunch “on the road” and it will keep me from stopping somewhere. Like Katy, I also did used Fetch to get all of my 25 points, as I rarely get anything more due to lack of name brand purchases. 3. I stopped into the more expensive Stop & Shop to pick up 3 items from FlashFoods, which I notice now charge a 5% processing fee (lame). While there, I bought 1 loss leader and picked up a free jar of Chosen Mayo (who would pay $8.67 for a jar is beyond me, but I’ll happily pay $0.00). 4. I signed up for my free Covid and Flu shop. I hate getting shots (or anything with a needle) but this will means 20 points toward the 200 points that I have to “earn” to get 10% off my annual cost of health insurance. 5. I did a survey for Nielson’s of my media usage. It took less than 5 minutes and I got a $10 gift certificate of my choosing. Reply Loved your 5 FFTs. It’s the small and medium savings that can really add up. And I agree…$8.67 for a jar of mayo sounds like highway robbery. Reply While I consider mayo on the bottom of the food pyramid, I really can’t believe $8.67 a jar is far superior to anything else on the market. We did try Duke’s, not bad but I would not put it above anything other mayo I’ve consumed. Reply 1. I made a hashbrown casserole, using up some eggs and cream that needed to be used. Now I have several breakfasts ready in the freezer for when I need something quick. 2. I cancelled my Walmart+ subscription. I had tried it for a month, and I did use it enough in September to make the cost worthwhile, but I don’t want to keep paying for it long term. 3. I bought only items that were on sale at Kroger. I was pretty pleased with some of the deals I got, especially a $0.39 chocolate bar from a fancy brand that normally would be out of my price range. 4. Same old, same old otherwise. Reply 1. I also ordered the free Covid tests and they are en route to us now. Our library also had free tests, so I was able to get one more box there. 2. Had a free trial week of Paramount and when I clicked cancel on the last day, they offered me a free month. I watched Mayor of Kingstown and Yellowjackets, but there’s not a lot I’m tempted by. 3. Attended the fall rummage sale at a local church. I think it’s one of the few places left that still has items priced at a nickel and a dime. I found a few things for myself, and a bunch of good stuff to resell, including a vintage leather Coach purse for $3, and brand new LL Bean boots for $2. 4. I had a poor experience at Kroger, and sent an email when I got home. They apologized and gave me a $15 store credit. 5. Not a frugal win for me, but I created one for someone else. I found a wallet in the street on my morning walk. I tracked down the owner online and they picked it up later that day, and sincerely thanked me. Reply That’s how you and I differ, as I love all the StarTrek series! Reply Thanks for letting me know about the Covid tests. I just ordered more. 1. We were supposed to have a yard sale Saturday and Sunday but it rained all day Saturday so we moved it to Sunday and Monday. My daughter and FIL both set up tables too. My son had to work but gave me a few things to sell. Between all of us we made over $700. The truck is full of leftovers and we are dropping it off tomorrow morning at our church thrift store. 2. I cooked in the crockpot both days to avoid takeout. 3. We gave several items to our neighbor that she was interested in for her grand kids. She brought us bagels as a thank you. Yummy. 4. A fan my FIL was trying to sell didn’t, so I kept if for our guest room. 5. My daughter and I did a fall deer painting class that was free at the library. I picked up 2 new to me puzzles while I was there. I dropped off 1 in return. Reply 1. Got my Covid shot today. I had already gotten a flu shot where I work, but they don’t have Covid vaccines. For that, I went to a CVS located inside a Target store. My Medicare card allowed me to get the shot free, no copayment, and I asked them about coupons; I’d read where some stores give you freebies for getting your vaccine with them. The pharmacist was just going to let me walk off without one, but since I spoke up, I got a coupon for $5 off a $20 purchase, good for 30 days. 2. We have new neighbors and they came and brought me some home-baked loaves of bread. He’s a home chef. 3. Signed up for more substitute teacher gigs. 4. Cut up more limbs and brush and put them out for garbage pickup. Hid them in 2 huge contractor’s bags which I put in the bottom of the regular trash can. Came home and they’re all gone….or at least THIS weekend’s batch was gone. Slowly but surely I am getting all the brush hauled off without paying the landfill fee to dump them. City Garbage Dept. only picks up brush twice monthly, so I have to get creative about disposing of same. 5. Went to the bank to check on my finances. All is well. Reply 1. Many years ago I gave my niece and her husband a dresser when they were first starting out as newlyweds. 12 years later she offered to give it back. I accepted as I have been saving to buy a new dresser for my new primary bedroom which will be in my addition, which isn’t quite finished. So now I can use that money elsewhere. 2. My cousin who lives on a nearby island had me over for two days, taking me out for dinner one night (which was lovely) and cooking for me one night (also lovely). He picked me up from the ferry terminal so I didn’t have to pay for my car. I also have a discount card for the ferry which saved me about $4. We went for a walk to a beautiful beach and had a picnic lunch from leftovers, some of which I had brought from home. It was a wonderful mini vacation for me. 3. Dh managed to remove two bathroom windows (without breaking them) which we can now sell. 4. Picking my own dahlias for a bouquet to decorate my Airbnb cottage whenever I have guests. 5. Gave my friend’s 88 year old mother some kale and cherry tomatoes out of my garden, and she gave me a jar of her strawberry jam. Reply 1. While doing some citizen science collecting water at a creek, found $8 in loonies ($1 coins) and twoonies ($2 coins). Took all but one, as they were sitting on a rock in the middle of a creek that was going to flood the next day. Whoot, $7 for the found money jar that I didn’t have until now. The next day, when back for another citizen science collection, I noted that the coin was gone, although the water hadn’t yet risen that far. It will be a mystery to me why those coins were there in that lovely neat pile. (down a very slick steep route – not a path, more like a slide, hold on to trees and hope you don’t misstep. Who would GO down there?) 2. Made fajitas with chicken legs I had cooked in the instant pot (bones back in the pot for broth), and discount purple and yellow peppers, as well as a couple of sad onions. I have made up a spice mix that saves me time when making mexican food, so the meal came together quickly with rice from a discount bag bought (ahem) a while ago. Homemade tomatillo salsa and some tortillas I had picked up on discount, I was in heaven. 3. Had a not-frugal 4 days as I flew a long way up north in my province to ask for signatures so that my political party will have a candidate in that riding for the upcoming provincial election. After two full days of talking to a LOT of very nice people, I successfully collected the required number of signatures (went out for insurance signatures, just in case) and completed the applicaiton with 1/2 day to spare. I am now the ‘paper’ candidate in that riding – where I have not a hope of being elected, due to some pretty divisive politics up there, however people who are looking for an alternative to the big two will have a choice on their ballots. Democracy for the win! (kind of…). My flight and hotel and car rental were paid, and I was very careful with the meals I purchased to save the party money – the hotel had a very good breakfast for free so I ate well in the morning then did without until evening. So glad to be home, though. 4. As mentioned in a comment above, I harvested a LOT of winter squash with the help of a young friend. It was SO much fun, and a lot of work – my lawn tractor trailer was full 4 times! I lent a pickup truck bed’s worth of squash to another young friend who needed them for his work (they were doing a photo-shoot) and I gave him two huge stalks of multiple sunflowers when he came over – might as well share them when they are perfect, eh? The remainder of the squash were washed with the help of Wonder James, and put into my grow room, resting on Bread Trays for air flow and under lights for curing. (best gardening hack – old bread trays are useful for so many things) 5. Got a huge load of firewood delivered (not frugal), and while Wonder James was stacking it in the woodshed/hayshed, he had to temporarily pull out the haybales. He came and knocked on my door with his shirt front bulging out – he had found a hidden chicken nest, and presented me with 18 eggs! GAH. Then, when I went out to check on things, I saw that he hadn’t brought in the nest I knew about (another 16 eggs) and THEN he started pulling eggs from between two bales. I think I have 8 dozen ‘found and questionable’ eggs! The birds had been suddenly unproductive about 2 weeks ago, so now I know where they were laying, instead…ANYWAY, I am using these eggs by washing them, ensuring they are lying flat while in the water (indication of age, if they float one end up they are older. Not BAD per-se, but older)/ Any ‘good’ ones I am breaking one-by-one into a small bowl before using, and they are all fine. The dog gets the partial floaters, if there are any. I am researching frozen quiches… 6. Oh, and if I haven’t mentioned it, I am now a grandmother of a lovely little boy – born August 30th. Was a last minute caesarian, so Mom and Dad were in a bit of shock, however this kiddo is just about the easiest baby one could imagine, so they are having a break there as mom recovers (and struggles with some issues). Both Mom and Dad caught covid, so I haven’t seen the baby for a week, hope to change that tomorrow, now that I am back from my travels Reply Congratulations Grandma!! Reply Fair play to you for spreading the plant love! 5 frugal things: * The cauliflower in Lidl has a price per piece and there just happened to be a piece in the box that was double the size of all the others so I did of course buy that very one! 🙂 There was enough for a side dish for one evening and for cauliflower cheese soup for the day after. * I attended several free talks as part of a local festival. * Somehow managed to rip my pants on the car and promptly mended them. * Found a beautiful handmade pottery dish and set it aside for the Christmas presents stash. * The teens declared a packet of grapes that I had gotten as “too soft” so I suggested they freeze the grapes and have them as a frozen snack. They didn’t love them but they ate them! Reply fwiw, I was curious and clicked on your Fetch referral link but it didn’t work for me: “app_not_found.” Thanks for all your frugal five posts, Katy. Wishing a very speedy continued recovery for your mom… Reply @Dmarie, I had the same problem, thought it was ’cause I am in Canada? Reply I just tried it and had the same problem and I’m in Colorado Reply 1. I mentioned getting a chest freezer in the last edition of 5 frugal things…but didn’t elaborate. It was $199 from a local grocery store and the store added $199 worth of coupons for free items to my account. Lots of snacks/treats…ice cream, pizza rolls etc. 2. I grabbed a gift for a birthday party from my “gift closet” – it was a board/card game I had gotten for free after a rebate. I put it in a recycled gift bag and used recycled tissue paper also. & My son made his friend a card. 3. I got a free jar of mayo from the local grocery store. It’s not something we’ll eat, so we’ll donate it to my son’s flag football food drive next week. 4. I have my bi-annual mammogram later today. Yesterday afternoon I got a call from my doctor’s office asking if I want to have my visit directly after the mammogram to save myself another trip to their office in a few weeks. Yes please! 5. I have a book on hold at the library that was recommended to me for my son (who is a history buff) Reply Leave a Comment Name * E-mail * Website Previous post: Five Frugal Things Get smart with the Thesis WordPress Theme from DIYthemes.

Title: Why Amazon’s Back To Work Order Is A Warning For The Future Of Work
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/annkowalsmith/2024/09/30/why-amazons-back-to-work-order-is-a-warning-for-the-future-of-work/

Amazon's return-to-work mandate threatens trust, collaboration and workplace culture. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy last week called all of the company’s employees back to the office five days a week, part of an effort to preserve the company’s culture and return to a pre-Covid reality. By clawing back the pre-pandemic era, Jassy reminded the world that companies have officially regained the upper hand — hiring, firing and changing the rules at will. And Amazon has certainly flexed that power, laying off more 27,000 of its workers since 2022 and now rescinding flexibility for the rest. Amazon’s decision isn’t just another episode in the return-to-work soap opera. It’s actually the canary in the coal mine for a dangerous problem. The relationship between employers and employees has become one based on power, not mutual respect and collaboration. And that’s seriously eroding trust, which drives engagement, loyalty, belonging and performance. And leaders know this full well. PWC’s Invesco Dynamic Market ETF 2024 Trust Survey found that 93% of business executives say building and maintaining trust is critical to the bottom line. Yet only 23% of employees trust their company leaders to do the right thing. And 40% of employees don’t feel trusted by their leaders. Little wonder with so many companies using surveillance devices to measure keystrokes, police attendance and test loyalty. This is a far cry from the pandemic-promised “new normal”–a clean sheet of paper to design and build the winning workplace of the future. We imagined a place where productivity and flexibility worked hand in glove, where employees could learn, grow and collaborate in innovative new ways–together. But this vision has stalled–with whiplash-level force. Through the lens of Amazon’s actions, the workplace looks more like Game of Thrones: a battle to control and conquer rather than create a community of collaborative colleagues. Here are three ways we’re all going to lose if the battle continues. To state the obvious, the last few years have seen a lot of upheaval. First, demand for talent in a tight labor market empowered employees to make significant inroads in work-life balance. Employers offered flexible and hybrid work options, wellness benefits and rising wages. As the economy became uncertain, employers reclaimed control, leveraging an extraordinary number of layoffs that destabilized and disenfranchised workers. Flexible work had become a common, even expected, feature of the modern workplace, until many organizations, like Amazon, arbitrarily pulled employees back to offices. This power struggle takes a toll on both employees and the organization—replacing relationships with transactions. Employees are not widgets. Rapidly growing technologies, diverse generational norms and a tough competitive landscape are bringing seismic changes to the workplace, requiring individuals to work together more than ever. The transactional tenor of many recent workplace decisions forces people to protect themselves, to act competitively instead of collaboratively. Employees who trust that their employers have their back are 260% more motivated at work. When people feel valued, share a strong common purpose, and have invested in the skills to work better together, they are more innovative and collaborative. Turning the workplace into a zero-sum game undermines workers, erodes culture and damages productivity. As work becomes more transactional, the underlying social contract among colleagues becomes frayed. Many assume that the social contract is an agreement between employer and employee on treating each other with respect and consideration. That's not a social contract, it's a code of conduct. The social contract is the fabric that holds a company together. It's grounded on an understanding among colleagues, from the CEO to the front line, that collective success is powered by individual commitment–to the mission and more importantly to each other. Colleagues in an organization with a healthy social contract ask themselves, “what do we owe each other?” What does this look like in real time? A manufacturing executive in a company with a fledgling apprentice program for urban youth cosigning bank accounts so that they can build productive and fiscally sound habits. Another skipping a family dinner to help an apprentice with their algebra homework, because success at work starts with confidence and self-efficacy in life. Or a female software engineer who adds hours to her week mentoring younger women so that they can advance in their careers, finishing her own work late at night. An effective social contract requires a strong sense of agency, where each person has the power and autonomy to represent the organization and its values from a place of authenticity and belonging. Layoffs and work mandates rob employees, at all levels, of that agency. When they stop caring, they give up. And the social contract dies–taking productivity and profits to the grave. In his missive, Amazon CEO Jassy leans hard on culture, citing it as a critical success driver for the company. He justifies his decision to “strengthen” a face-to-face culture, where “collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective; teaching and learning from one another are more seamless; and, teams tend to be better connected to one another.” What exactly does he mean by culture? Does it jive with what his employees believe the culture might be? Culture has come to loosely mean “how I like to work.” For example, the evidence is mounting that hybrid workplaces yield the strongest productivity and creativity. But for older leaders, the nostalgic pull of the watercooler remains steadfast. Many of Jassy’s frustrated employees (especially members of the massive water-bottle carrying generation who have no memories of the communal fountain) may describe Amazon’s culture as “toxic,” a commonly heard refrain when workers are at odds with their employers. Remember quiet quitting? Culture is not a weapon to be thrown around by the person with the largest muscle. Admittedly elusive, culture encompasses the norms and practices that guide the way we work together; it’s the how, not the where. It’s about productivity and engagement and a healthy social contract. And while it’s tough, it’s not impossible to take a more evidence-based approach (both qualitative and quantitative) to understand when it’s at its best. Until we agree on what a healthy culture looks like, it’s just another pawn in the workplace power struggle. The Amazon decision clearly signals the where-we-work conversation is not over. And although Amazon may have broken from the tech pack, we will now see other companies (tech and beyond) following suit with RTO orders. The only thing we know for sure is that the pendulum keeps swinging. When the economy gets tough, companies win the throne. In boom times, employees wrestle it back. And trust takes a hit every time. Sustainable success requires more than survival of the fittest. It’s time to end the battle and make an authentic commitment to working together. The future of work depends on putting away the sword and picking up the social contract. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Mark Zuckerberg’s Metaverse Gamble Pays Off With $201 Billion Fortune

Photo Credit: Meta Meta struggled to find its footing with short-form video while competitor TikTok rose in popularity Mark Zuckerberg's bet on the metaverse initially looked like a colossal mistake, wiping more than $100 billion (roughly Rs. 8,39,113 crore) from his net worth. But now it's paying off big-time. Buoyed by a record-high Meta Platforms share price, Zuckerberg's net worth has climbed almost sixfold in less than two years to $201 billion (roughly Rs. 16,86,617 crore), the first time he's exceeded the $200 billion mark (roughly Rs. 16,78,226 crore), according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He's moved to fourth place on the list of the world's 500 richest people behind Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Bernard Arnault. While other tech titans made big jumps in net worth this year — Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang, for example, has more than doubled his wealth to $106.2 billion (roughly Rs.8,91,138 crore) — none has grown as much as Zuckerberg's. He's added $73.4 billion (roughly Rs. 6,15,908 crore) to his fortune since January 1, thanks to his 13 percent stake in Meta. The stock closed at an all-time high on Wednesday and is up 60 percent this year. It's a far cry from 2022, when the stock, and Zuckerberg's net worth, took a nosedive after his company had undergone massive changes, including a name change and big investments in the metaverse. At the time, Meta struggled to find its footing with short-form video while competitor TikTok rose in popularity. Now, analysts think that the pivot from Facebook to Meta is finally coming to fruition as the company heavily leans into its Orion Augmented Reality glasses. “With the confluence of Meta's hardware improvements over the last five years and progress with AI, Orion represents Meta's evolution from a social media company to a Metaverse company,” JMP Securities analysts wrote in a note to investors this week. Since 2022, Meta has cut tens of thousands of employees, shrinking its global workforce by 25 percent. The Menlo Park, California-based company has made moves to improve its stock performance, including a $50 billion (roughly Rs. 4,18,928 crore) share buyback program and Meta's first-ever quarterly dividend. It has also hopped onto the Artificial-Intelligence (AI) bandwagon, spending heavily on data centers and computing power as Zuckerberg works to build a leading position in the industry-wide AI race. The company recently announced further investments into AI-generated creators, which interact one-on-one with online fans. Zuckerberg's public image has also changed dramatically from two years ago. Previously portrayed as a nerdy techie, the 40-year-old CEO has taken up wakesurfing and mixed martial arts. A photo of a seven-foot statue of his wife, Priscilla Chan, recently went viral on Instagram, with Zuckerberg claiming that he was “bringing back the Roman tradition of making sculptures of your wife.” He's also said he plans to stay out of politics. After earlier offering up his views on social justice, inequality and immigration issues, he has since publicly expressed regret about some of his political activity. “The political environment, I think I didn't have much sophistication around, and I think I just fundamentally misdiagnosed the problem,” he said during a live podcast event in San Francisco. © 2024 Bloomberg LP For the latest tech news and reviews, follow Gadgets 360 on X, Facebook, WhatsApp, Threads and Google News.

Inflows into crypto-related investment products continued for the third consecutive week, with $1.2 billion flowing into the sector, according to CoinShares’ latest weekly report. James Butterfill, CoinShares’ head of research, attributed the strong inflows to expectations of a dovish US monetary policy and positive market momentum. These factors pushed total assets under management up 6.2% to $92.7 billion. The US Securities and Exchange Commission approved options trading for BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF, which also lifted market sentiment. Despite these inflows, weekly trading volume in the sector dipped by 3.1%. Bitcoin’s dominance continues The CoinShares report showed that Bitcoin continued to dominate the flows, with investors pouring in $1 billion to BTC-related investment products. This can be linked to its strong price performance and also the improved inflows to spot Bitcoin ETF products last week. Notably, the funds run by Bitwise, BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark 21 Shares all saw positive performance during the reporting period. However, Grayscale’s crypto funds continued their net outflow trend, dropping its total assets to $21.2 billion. Meanwhile, BTC’s recent uptrend to around $65,000 fueled an $8.8 million inflow into short-Bitcoin products, as some investors expect the current rally to fade. Regionally, sentiment was divided. The US led with $1.2 billion in inflows, while Switzerland trailed with $84 million. In contrast, Germany and Brazil experienced outflows of $21 million and $3 million, respectively. Ethereum-related products ended a five-week outflow streak, bringing in $87 million—the first significant inflow since early August. Data from SosoValue showed that spot Ethereum ETFs saw the second-highest weekly flows since their launch in July. On the other hand, large-cap alternative digital assets had mixed results. Litecoin and XRP recorded inflows of $2 million and $0.8 million, respectively. Meanwhile, Solana and Binance faced outflows of $4.8 million and $1.2 million. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: The Billion-Dollar AI Gamble: Data Centers As The New High-Stakes Game

High-tech Data Centers Powering Critical AI And Digital Applications Require Careful And Intense ... [+] Planning. In today’s hyper-connected world, data centers have become the nerve centers of our digital economy. Hyperscale tech giants like Microsoft and global investment powerhouses like BlackRock are pooling their vast resources and pouring billions into data center construction, betting that these facilities will underpin the next wave of technological innovation. With artificial intelligence evolving at a dizzying pace, the stakes have never been higher. A prime example of this is the recent announcement of a groundbreaking 1 GW data center near Houston—an off-grid, hydrogen-powered hub designed to fuel AI. This colossal project underscores the immense scale of the high-stakes AI gamble. The U.S. government is paying close attention. The White House has created a Task Force on AI Datacenter Infrastructure to prioritize AI data center development as a matter of national security and economic interest. CEOs of the biggest data center operators and tech firms—CoreWeave, QTS, Google, AWS, Meta, Microsoft, NVIDIA, OpenAI, and Anthropic—recently met with utility industry leaders to ensure that the U.S. maintains its competitive edge in AI infrastructure. But with these massive investments come immense risks. As tech investors begin to scrutinize the timing of returns on these AI ventures, it’s critical to understand the specific use cases of data centers before committing billions of dollars to their development. Data centers are not fungible or easily repurposed without massive capital expenditure. The adage “measure twice, cut once” has never been more appropriate—especially when a 100 MW facility could set you back $1.4 billion. This financial reality is why titans like Microsoft and BlackRock are joining forces to tackle these high-stakes projects in partnership, rather than going it alone. Data centers are built to handle staggering volumes of data and traffic with minimal latency, making them indispensable for a wide range of critical functions. But the design of these data centers must be closely tied to their intended use case. For instance, crypto mining prioritizes cheap power over low latency, which profoundly affects location, design, and redundancy requirements. Meanwhile, AI inference workloads require high computational power and very low latency, demanding a different approach altogether. The importance of data centers in today’s digital economy cannot be overstated—they are the lifeblood of everything from: These are just a few examples of how data centers are integrated into every corner of modern life. As digital needs continue to grow, the complexities of building and managing these facilities also expand. Building a data center is no simple task. A typical facility houses racks of physical servers, cutting-edge networking equipment, and massive storage devices—all supported by a highly redundant power and cooling infrastructure designed to ensure near-perfect uptime. Today’s data centers are increasingly reliant on smart control systems, like Data Center Infrastructure Management software, to optimize performance and energy efficiency. But data centers are not cookie-cutter solutions. They require significant upfront planning and capital. Each type of data center is designed to meet specific needs, and changing use cases down the line can have disastrous effects on long-term viability and profitability. When building or investing in a data center, understanding the different types is crucial: Data centers are also traditionally ranked by tier, based on their expected uptime and reliability: As AI and machine learning become more central to the global economy, data centers will play an even more critical role in powering our digital world. But with this expansion comes significant risk and complexity. The rapid growth in AI workloads adds pressure on data centers to deliver more computational power with lower latency, but the costs of getting it wrong are enormous. That’s why carefully assessing the intended use case of a data center before committing to construction is essential. The companies that approach data center investments strategically—by aligning technology with specific business drivers—will be the ones to succeed in this rapidly shifting landscape. Those who fail to understand the nuances of data center design, construction, and operation could face enormous financial losses and miss out on the AI-driven future. One Community. Many Voices.

On Monday, JPMorgan reiterated its Neutral rating on Okta, Inc. (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:OKTA) with a steady price target of $105.00. The firm's commentary followed a virtual investor meeting held last week in Asia with Okta's SVP of Investor Relations, Dave Gennarelli. The discussions covered a range of topics including the identity market, Okta's growth prospects, long-term potential, competitive dynamics, and recent events such as the FBI raid on Carahsoft. "The company continues to take a thoughtful approach toward building a competitive platform while balancing necessary investments with profitability," said JPMorgan analysts in a note. In other recent news, Okta Inc . has seen adjustments in its financial outlook following its second-quarter fiscal year 2025 results. The company reported a 16% year-over-year revenue increase to $646 million, primarily due to a 17% rise in subscription revenue. However, Okta's third-quarter calculated remaining performance obligations (cRPO) guidance fell short of projections. Analyst firms such as Piper Sandler and Canaccord Genuity adjusted their price targets for Okta to $100 and $90, respectively. In contrast, BMO Capital Markets raised its price target to $103, citing Okta's robust growth in remaining performance obligations. Deutsche Bank lowered its price target for Okta's shares to $115 while maintaining a Buy rating. To complement JPMorgan's analysis, recent data from InvestingPro offers additional context on Okta's financial position and market performance. Despite the company's focus on balancing investment and profitability, InvestingPro data shows that Okta was not profitable over the last twelve months, with an adjusted operating income of -$228 million. However, the company's gross profit margin stands at an impressive 75.82%, reflecting strong pricing power in its identity management offerings. InvestingPro Tips highlight that Okta holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, which could provide financial flexibility as it navigates market challenges and invests in growth. Additionally, 31 analysts have revised their earnings upwards for the upcoming period, suggesting a potentially positive outlook that aligns with JPMorgan's steady price target. It's worth noting that Okta's stock has taken a significant hit over the last six months, with a price total return of -29.28%. This decline might present an opportunity for investors, as the RSI suggests the stock is in oversold territory. For those interested in a deeper dive into Okta's financials and market position, InvestingPro offers 10 additional tips that could inform investment decisions.

According to the company's preliminary data, approximately 99.89% of the outstanding public warrants were exercised for cash at $11.50 per share of Class A common stock. This led to the exercise of 13,581,996 public warrants, leaving only 260,987 unexercised as of the redemption date. The final results of the redemption will be confirmed after the broker protect period expires on October 1, 2024. Following this redemption, AST SpaceMobile has no public warrants outstanding. The redemption follows an announcement made on August 28, 2024, in which AST SpaceMobile stated its intention to redeem these warrants as per the Warrant Agreement from September 13, 2019. The public warrants have ceased trading and were delisted from the Nasdaq Global Select Market, with the trading suspension taking effect on September 27, 2024. The company's Class A common stock continues to be traded on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol "ASTS."

This article is based on a press release statement and does not constitute an offer to sell AST SpaceMobile securities or a solicitation of an offer to buy. The press release includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ from those projected. In other recent news, AST SpaceMobile has made substantial progress with its satellite launch and financial growth. The company successfully launched five commercial satellites, named BlueBirds, advancing its mission to establish the first space-based cellular broadband network. These satellites are designed to provide cellular broadband speeds directly to mobile phones, with an aim to deliver non-continuous coverage across the United States and selected global markets.

AST SpaceMobile's recent warrant redemption aligns with its ambitious plans to develop a space-based cellular broadband network. According to InvestingPro data, the company's market capitalization stands at $7.16 billion, reflecting investor optimism about its potential. InvestingPro Tips highlight that ASTS holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, which could provide financial flexibility as it pursues its innovative technology. This strong cash position is particularly crucial given the capital-intensive nature of space-based communications projects. The company's stock has shown remarkable performance, with a 773.1% price total return over the past six months. This surge aligns with the growing interest in space-based technologies and the potential disruption of traditional telecommunications. However, investors should note that ASTS is not currently profitable, with a negative operating income of $238.34 million in the last twelve months. The InvestingPro Tip indicating that analysts do not anticipate profitability this year underscores the long-term nature of the company's ambitious projects. For those interested in a deeper analysis, InvestingPro offers 13 additional tips for ASTS, providing a comprehensive view of the company's financial health and market position.

Title: Bernard Arnault leapfrogs Mark Zuckerberg on wealth rankings with $30 billion boost, but analysts warn it may be short lived
URL: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/09/30/bernard-arnault-mark-zuckerberg-wealth-lvmh-luxury-industry/
Time Published: 2024-09-30T10:54:46Z
Full Content:
The fortunes of luxury titan Bernard Arnault—and the raft of plush brands he oversees—seem to have turned around in the past week, courtesy of changing tides in China and a bet on a new fashion house. Per the Bloomberg Billionaire’s Index, Arnault’s fortune leapt from $177 billion on Tuesday to $207 billion less than a week later. Bernard Arnault’s Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy (LVMH) has suffered a bumpy few months, down near-15% at the time of writing over the past half year. Its problems included Chinese consumers tightening their purse strings and a significant drop in its wine and spirits divisions. But in the past week Beijing has announced a raft of fiscal stimulus to boost consumers, and LVMH announced it has acquired a stake in Italian fashion house Moncler. A more optimistic regional outlook paired with new investment by the Parisian-based group has led to a surge in the business’s stock price. From Wednesday to Friday last week LVMH’s share price bounced 14% from €617.50 to €703.40 ($690.74 to $786.83). The bounce has led to a corresponding surge in Arnault’s fortunes—after all, he owns a 48% stake in the consumables giant. The 75-year-old entrepreneur saw his worth leap by approximately $30 billion—leapfrogging Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg’s net worth to put him at number three on the rich list. However, Arnault still comes in behind Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. While being the third-richest person on the planet might be alright for some, Arnault as the former world’s richest man is unlikely to be satisfied. He reportedly once said: “As long as I’m not the richest man in the world, I won’t really be happy.” While LVMH rounded out last week with an indirect investment in outdoor apparel maker Moncler, Wall Street remains unconvinced that the luxury sector as a whole is still the best value for investors. LVMH bought a 10% stake in Double R, the investment vehicle owned by Remo Ruffini—the CEO of Moncler—and one of the brand’s largest shareholders. But while increasing LVMH’s influence over European luxury houses might have led to a temporary uptick, analysts are concerned prevailing winds will slow the sector further. A Bank of America note released last week declared: “The luxury consumer is all shopped out.” It added sector growth is likely to continue into the second half of this year and early next, leading to margin pressure and no EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) growth. Analysts downgraded LVMH from a ‘buy’ to a ‘neutral’ position—the same that was applied to Italian fashion house Zegna and Yves Saint Laurent and Gucci owner, Kering. Research analysts Ashley Wallace, Daria Nasledysheva, Ioanna Ziarti, Joffrey Bellicha Meller, Adam Gildea and Niccolo Serra urged the luxury sector to get customers back through the doors instead of relying on trends. “‘Quiet luxury’ has supported average selling price at the expense of volumes,” the group wrote. “The industry needs to pivot back to creativity, fashion content and newness at €1-2k ($1,100-$2,200) to drive higher engagement (as it did in 2016).” And despite hopes for a turnaround in China, BofA insists that its demand will be muted on a more permanent basis. Instead, analysts expect the U.S. to come through and account for more than 50% of sector growth in 2025 with the rest of the demand comprising of global tourists and the Middle East. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

What does it take to be a rising star on Wall Street?If our list is anything to go by, you have to be an intensely hardworking, intellectually curious team player who's willing to go the distance to drive the biggest deals, win the most sought-after clients, or build the most successful businesses. Every year, Business Insider taps its contacts to put together a list of who to watch on Wall Street. For the past seven years, we've received recommendations from bosses, colleagues, recruiters, and financial industry experts to create our annual feature. We ask that nominees be based in the US, be 35 or younger, and stand out among their peers to be eligible. The editors make the final decisions. These young professionals reflect the future of finance. A number of them are shaping the future of clean energy and artificial intelligence by financing the infrastructure that will underpin it. Some have seen their focus go from niche to hot asset. Others are influencing how Wall Street interacts with Main Street, using their skills and savvy to create new products and services for ordinary investors or giving employees at portfolio companies ownership stakes. Business Insider asked these rising stars from leading firms like JPMorgan, Bridgewater, and Apollo to reflect on their successes, challenges, and best career advice. One of the most memorable days of Song's KKR career was when the firm sold Minnesota Rubber and Plastics for $950 million in August 2022. She had served on the business' board while getting her MBA and led the monthslong sales process. The best part, however, was traveling to the firm's Plymouth, Minnesota, manufacturing plant to tell employees they'd be receiving a payout as equity holders in the company. Since trialing its employee-ownership program in 2015, KKR has awarded billions of dollars of equity to over 100,000 nonsenior management employees across more than 50 portfolio companies. The firm bet that giving portfolio company workers a piece of the private-equity pie would actually grow the size of the pie. Since graduating from Harvard in 2015, Song has worked on KKR's industrials portfolio team, which has been a proving ground for the employee-ownership program. She worked for four years on the firm's CHI Overhead Doors deal, which has become the case study for its employee-engagement model. All five deals she's worked on at KKR have an employee-ownership component. Song, who grew up in Silicon Valley after her family emigrated from China when she was 3, has long been a community builder. She rose through the ranks of Future Business Leaders of America in middle and high school to become the California state president before serving as copresident of Harvard's Undergraduate Women in Business program. Song, now a principal at the firm, said the feeling of community on the industrials team is one of the reasons she's stayed at KKR for nearly a decade. She said her friends and family were surprised she ended up investing in industrials, but she's become fascinated by the sector. "Everything that you can learn about in a business textbook, this role takes it to the real world, and I can see it in action here," Song said. While researching investment-banking internships in college at Emory, Cheslin contacted a family friend who invited her to visit his trading floor and experience Wall Street for herself. It was love at first sight. "I walked onto the trading floor and never looked back," Cheslin told BI. "As soon as I walked onto the floor, heard the energy, heard the noise, I was like, 'This is somewhere that I want to be.' Maybe that sounds cliché." Today, Cheslin is a managing director in high-grade municipal trading at Wells Fargo. She joined the bank in 2012 as an analyst based in the firm's Charlotte, North Carolina, office, but later transferred to New York. She became a managing director in February. Cheslin, who's part of a team that manages billions, works with institutional clients to address their liquidity needs. She recalled an inflection point in her career in early 2022 when she was on maternity leave and the market was hit by volatility stemming from the Fed's interest-rate hikes. She recalled returning to work in what she characterized as a "completely different market landscape." But the team pulled through and logged a record year. "Knowing that I was a visible part of the effort to grow Wells Fargo's market share and to be growing our municipal franchise to be one of the top sales and trading desks on the Street is something that I'm incredibly proud of," she added. She said one key quality that's helped fuel her rise is staying open to whatever work opportunity has come her way. "Being visible not only on your desk as someone who is willing to do any task — I think that's the mindset that I've tried to keep from analyst to managing director is that I'm never bigger than any task that I would do myself." Anton got an early start in finance, buying stocks in high school during the 2008 financial crisis. Some bets, like buying Bank of America stock at its trough, paid off. (He chalks up less-successful bets, such as one on Bear Stearns, to experience.) This introduction came in handy for his first job after college as a financial institutions group analyst at Credit Suisse's investment bank. He spent two years there and another two at Kohlberg and Company before joining Apollo in 2018. The 32-year-old principal's work runs the gamut from insurance to agriculture. He helped raise capital for Apollo's retirement services unit, Athene, by developing a fundraising strategy that allows third parties to invest alongside the firm. These funding vehicles, or "sidecars," have raised $9.3 billion in committed capital as of June 30. Anton was also Apollo's day-to-day lead on Vallourec, the French steel giant. Apollo sold its 28% stake for 955 million euros, about $1.04 billion, in March. Anton helped lead the acquisition of Vallourec during the COVID-19 pandemic and the firm's restructuring, which included moving operations from Germany to Brazil. He anticipates more opportunistic metals deals on the horizon as prices decline. Anton, who majored in history at Princeton, credits his versatility to his fondness for learning about different sectors and the successes and failures in each field. "A lot of stuff has been done before," he said. "If you have the curiosity and build up your knowledge of the past, I've found that to be really beneficial as you think about covering new sectors or moving to a new job." As Apollo courts wealthy individuals, Anton is developing new investment products that allow the firm to partially cash out quarterly or monthly in exchange for somewhat lower returns. Apollo sells about $1 billion a month in semiliquid products spanning private credit and real assets. "It's going to be a really big growth area for the firm," he said. Carper has spent his career carving out a specialty in a niche area of finance: continuation vehicles, also known as "secondaries." He helps private-equity firms raise new funds to purchase companies they already own — giving existing investors a return while keeping the company's current management team and extending the life cycle of the asset for the PE firm. "Effectively, what we do is we help private-equity firms sell their highest-conviction, favorite portfolio companies to themselves," Carper said. He spent the first five years of his career as an investor on the buy side, including stints at Morgan Stanley and Coller Capital, before joining Lazard's private capital advisory business in 2018 and Jefferies in 2021. Earlier this year, Carper helped Vestar Capital Partners close a $1.2 billion continuation vehicle for its stake in the research company Circana. He also helped Calera Capital close a $750 million continuation vehicle for the linen and laundry service company ImageFIRST. Over Carper's career, these structures have switched from being a solution to a liquidity problem to a strategy that allows PE firms to hold on to some of their best portfolio companies and raise new capital, he said. When he entered the industry, he estimated there was less than $10 billion in continuation-vehicle volume annually. Now, there's more than $60 billion, and he thinks that will only grow. "I'm really excited to say that I think as a portion of the overall ecosystem, it's quite likely to grow," he said. "There's a lot of capital that is being formed to attack the opportunity right now." Cecil, one of two deputy chief investment officers at $108 billion Bridgewater Associates, was so ready to work full time at the firm that he dropped out of Columbia University to jump-start his career. "The thing I really liked was the intensity, the competitive nature of markets, the authenticity of Bridgewater's culture," Cecil, who first interned at the firm before joining full time in 2017, said. In his current role, he works closely with co-CIO Greg Jensen to gather insights and research from different teams and turn them into trades for the flagship strategy, Pure Alpha, which was up more than 14% through the first half of the year. "The oversight is about innovation — what's the big thing we might be missing?" Cecil said. Reams of deep research don't go far if there's not "a trader's mentality" to actually extract "a piece of alpha" from them, he said. He said he's constantly thinking about how to make sure the portfolio is "the expression of the things we believe about the world." He was promoted to his current role at the start of this year after making his name at the firm with his research on currencies. That background has pushed him to search beyond stock and bond markets for alpha — and to consider how different assets will work in a single portfolio. "There's a lot more room for us to think about how all these asset classes come together," he said. Being named a portfolio manager of BlackRock's Total Return Fund in 2022, alongside the managers Rick Rieder and David Rogal, was a defining moment for Chen. "Becoming a named PM — it is incredible," Chen told BI. "I see that as a result of the ongoing contribution that I have had toward this set of funds and to the group." Chen calls herself a BlackRock lifer. She's been at the company 13 years and started out as an intern in the same fixed-income investment division she's currently in — only now she's comanaging a total of $60 billion across BlackRock's core, core plus, and global government portfolio mandates and leading research efforts for US rates. The Total Return Fund has about $20 billion in assets. Chen grew up in China and moved to the US by herself at 17 to attend high school in Ohio. She studied economics and statistics at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts and joined BlackRock full time in 2012 as an analyst focusing on US interest rates. She also had a stint as a macro researcher on the economics team. BlackRock's managing director credits her rise to the quality of her research. He said she was always willing to dig deep into the data to uncover differentiated views, which the group's leaders noticed. "The intention or the motivation for me really was wanting to turn my ideas into action and see how they play out in the market," Chen said. Her parents, who spent their entire careers in China's postal service, began working in their teens and studied part time to earn college degrees. They instilled a strong work ethic and passion for learning. "They basically immersed in me to just spend time at the library," she said. "I think my mindset of always trying to explore and trying to see more of the world came from a very young age because of that." White started his career working in franchising for Burger King, where his job was to bring on larger, better-capitalized franchisees, which usually turned out to be a PE firm or a family office. "The stories from the families and the entrepreneurs and the funds and their thesis were super interesting to me," he said. "So I decided to go to school and scale that up." After completing his MBA at Northwestern in 2017, White joined Bank of America's consumer and retail investment banking team in New York. He's since played a key role in introducing a new focus for Bank of America as part of its emerging growth and regional coverage team. "A lot of our strategy was to take all the resources and all the talent that we were putting against bulge-bracket opportunities and bring it to the middle market and try and find opportunities that normally Bank America would not have been as tuned in to," White said. He took "a leap of faith" and joined the team in Chicago in 2019. "It was kind of full circle, having started my career with entrepreneurs," said White, who now advises family-owned businesses, founders, and early investors in those companies to deepen the bank's relationships in private capital markets and attach that to its public capital markets business. Even in a time of muted IPOs, White led a large industrial IPO this year. In 2023, he was key in advising a large financial sponsor client in a take-private transaction in healthcare. He also helped lead a buy-side transaction for a family-owned consumer business, where Bank of America was both the advisor and financing partner to the client. He has advised on more than 30 transactions totaling over $25 billion. Since White joined the Chicago team, he has helped it grow from three to 25 people. His advice to young professionals in the industry is to "be your own feedback loop." "Don't wait for someone to tell you something did or didn't go well. Assess every situation yourself, almost obsessively think about, 'How can I have done that better?'" Kolwicz's parents worked in education in Warwick, New York, and though Kolwicz became an investment banker and not a teacher, he has adopted some of their characteristics. "My dad, for better or worse, anytime I asked him a question, it turned into a lesson with him," Kolwicz, a managing director in mergers and acquisitions at the elite boutique investment bank Moelis, told BI. "Sometimes, I find myself doing that a little bit too much with the people below me," he added with a laugh. "I want them to feel as invested in it from a junior level as I do from a senior level." He landed an internship at UBS in 2010 on the media and communications team. That led to a full-time job at the Swiss bank. He joined Moelis nine years ago and was elevated to the role of managing director in December. Kolwicz has advised on nearly 50 deals across various industries, collectively valued at about $125 billion. The deals span verticals from healthcare to media to energy. One of the largest deals he's advised on was last year's roughly $21 billion all-stock merger of WWE with Endeavor, the owner of Ultimate Fighting Championship. He's also been key to building Moelis' mergers business in the emerging cannabis sector. He's made a name for himself working on transactions like the $2.1 billion sale of Harvest Health & Recreation to Trulieve Cannabis Corp in 2021. The Harvest Health sale was a watershed opportunity for Kolwicz to plant his flag. He worked on the deal as an executive director before his promotion, collaborating closely with a colleague on executing the deal and presenting to the client's board every week. "The amount of experience for me to be able to do something like that" as an executive director, he said, "you don't really get it that often." Cardona approaches her often high-pressure job as a lead banker at RBC with a perspective not many on Wall Street possess. "I was illegal for 15 years of my life. I had to go through a lot of issues just getting through school," said Cardona of her move to New Jersey from Manizales, Colombia, when she was just 6 years old. "These are really big, real-world problems that I had to face on my own. So working, I would say I'm probably the most levelheaded of anyone on the team, because nothing really is that serious." Cardona worked multiple jobs to pay her way through her financial engineering degree at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey. She landed a spot in RBC's 2016 summer investment-banking internship and joined the firm once she graduated. Over the past six years, she's risen from analyst to vice president. As a member of RBC's communications, media, and entertainment banking team, Cardona worked on Apollo Global Management's $5 billion acquisition of Cox Media Group in 2019, the first and largest LBO in the TV broadcasting industry. She also helped close the radio broadcasting company MediaCo's acquisition of Estrella Media earlier this year. The COVID pandemic and subsequent interest-rate hikes stalled a lot of deal flow in her coverage area, but Cardona said she has high hopes for what's in store in the next year or so. She's seeing a lot of clients and media company owners waiting for the election and interest-rate cuts to play out. She aims to be a mentor to young Latinos who aspire to go into banking. This year, she's leading a new program where she and other RBC employees will mentor 30 high schoolers from three New York City public schools. Cardona's message to other Wall Street hopefuls is to be unapologetically persistent, she said. "If I had let any doubt fill my mind in these 10 years, I would not be here. I was set up to not be here, actually." Going into energy investing was a natural choice for Stone Redding, who hails from a suburb between Dallas and Fort Worth. "Growing up in Texas, you're definitely exposed to energy as an important part of the economy and the state," she said. "And the cost of energy and the form of energy are such a core part of driving the broader global economy. That was always really fascinating to me." Stone Redding started her career at Morgan Stanley's investment bank in 2013 after graduating from the University of Texas at Austin's business school. She joined TPG in 2015, working on buyouts in traditional energy such as oil and gas. She left after 2 ½ years for a promotion at Warburg Pincus but returned in 2021 to work on clean-energy deals when TPG raised its Rise Climate fund, which closed in 2022 with $7.3 billion. Over the past three years, she has been involved in five deals that total about $1.5 billion in equity, per TPG. The principal helps lead North American deals in energy transition and sustainable fuels. She executed TPG's investment in the solar-tech company Nextracker, its spinoff, and its initial public offering. Nextracker now has a market cap of $5.7 billion. Stone Redding is interested in "the picks and shovels," aka the equipment-and-services providers that benefit from renewable-energy adoption but carry less risk than energy producers. In May, TPG Rise Climate acquired Olympus Terminals, a Southern California firm that stores and distributes renewable diesel fuel, for an undisclosed amount. Clean energy spans a wide range of business models from manufacturing to software. Stone Redding said setting priorities and sticking to them is the hardest part of her job. "There's a lot of exciting things to do in our space, and we have a small but mighty team," she said. Wilson is a top credit underwriter at Blue Owl Capital, overseeing nearly $5 billion in deals across some 20 transactions in her five years there. Wilson was primed early on for a life in leveraged finance thanks to some formative bonding moments with her mother over, well, bonds. She has fond memories of visiting her mom — now retired after 25 years working in municipal bonds — on the Deutsche Bank trading floor in Boston and playing around with the Bloomberg Terminal. This inspired a fascination with how companies operate and also a belief that women could succeed in the male-dominated finance industry. Years later, after graduating from Boston College in 2015, Wilson joined a mid-market credit firm as the only woman on a six-person investment team analyst class. "I didn't have any real reservations or qualms about joining an analyst class where I was the only woman," Wilson said. She moved to Blue Owl, then known as Owl Rock, as an associate in 2019 and quickly garnered trust and was given more responsibilities by senior leaders. She credits her success, in part, to her knack for fastidious preparation — anticipating the critical information a busy exec may need and having concise answers at the ready. Wilson, who was promoted to vice president in January, has helped underwrite and execute loans to firms including Inspira Financial and Worldwide Clinical Trials, and in 2020, she also took a lead role in Blue Owl's small-business lending program during the COVID-19 pandemic, which provided working capital to 11 borrowers. She has watched private credit's explosion into a $2 trillion market firsthand. Blue Owl's credit AUM has grown from roughly $15 billion when she joined to over $95 billion today. Even as deal sizes have ballooned — what were once $1 billion transactions are now commonly $3 billion to $5 billion or more — her approach hasn't. "Fundamentally, the job hasn't changed, but the scale and scope of opportunities has grown," Wilson said. Khosla was climbing mango trees at 12 years old in his native India long before he climbed the ranks of Wall Street to become a managing director at Goldman Sachs. "I am very much a proponent of luck and gratitude," Khosla said. "I mean this when I say it: Never in my wildest dreams did I assume I would be here, when you asked the 12-year-old boy." Today, Khosla leads the investment-grade financing and corporate derivatives business for healthcare and real estate within Goldman's global banking and markets unit. He works with clients on their financing needs and advises them on deal-specific risks — like changes to interest rates — with the goal of positioning Goldman as a "top-tier" financier to strategic clients and asset managers. Khosla said that being part of the team that rolled out Goldman's transaction-banking business, which handles cash for big corporate customers, helped distinguish him. But when asked what attribute has most contributed to his success, he pointed to the emotional — not just the technical. "Some of my most successful transactions have been where I've really doubled down on that EQ and compassion," he said, "which is to truly get to know your clients, not just as corporations, but actually as the people that they are." It's likely a big factor in his promotion to managing director in 2019. Khosla moved to the US full time in 2006 to study at Georgetown, where he landed a gig as a bank teller at the student-run Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union. Khosla became the credit union's chief financial officer and treasurer in 2008 — before he was even of legal drinking age. "I was the CFO of a $15 million balance sheet in the heart of the financial crisis," he said. He went on to join Goldman as an analyst in 2010. Away from work, Khosla, a married father of two, is passionate about improving education in the juvenile-justice system and sits on the board of the nonprofit BreakFree Education. When Dan joined Citadel Securities in 2022, he was given an ambitious mandate to establish the firm's presence in Japan. Dan, who was born in China and grew up in Japan, was mostly starting from scratch. Citadel Securities had neither Japanese clients nor an office in Japan, and Dan, one of the first hires on his team, worked mostly as a one-man show advising clients on their fixed-income trades. But as one of the largest foreign holders of US Treasurys with more than $1 trillion in holdings, Japan represented an untapped gold rush for Ken Griffin's market maker. Citadel Securities now has trading relationships with at least 30 top fixed-income firms in Japan, Dan said, covering nearly all the major investment firms in the country. As a senior vice president of fixed-income sales, Dan offers his perspective on the economy and market moves to Japanese banks, asset managers, pensions, and life insurance companies. From his home base in New York, he acts as a sounding board for clients' investment ideas to ultimately win more trades for Citadel Securities. Before Citadel Securities, Dan spent the prior 10 years fostering relationships with Japanese financial institutions for Deutsche Bank, where he worked on the fixed-income sales team. Becoming a part of clients' everyday routines has also helped Dan grow market share. Dan usually starts and ends his day the same way: on the phone with his clients. He gives them market updates every day over the phone; for some key clients, that's been the case for the last five years, he said. "Consistency is key. I think no matter what you do," Dan said, "do it every day so that clients remember you, and then it becomes their custom to read your comments." DiGia is a professional investor who has supported roughly $1 billion worth of investments during his time at General Atlantic. In some ways, he's also a professional taste tester. As a vice president who leads food-and-beverage investing and focuses on restaurant franchising and apparel, his love of food has become an important part of his job. "I love trying new brands and new restaurants, and the thought of working with brands that I'm a consumer of every day was really appealing," DiGia, who joined General Atlantic after spending two years as an investment banker on JPMorgan's consumer and retail team, said. "But I didn't realize how exciting the job could be on the investing side." At General Atlantic, an investment in the Austin chain Torchy's Tacos turned every fast-casual lunch into a case study, with DiGia often asking staff about the business' operations. He left General Atlantic for a short stint in 2020 to get an MBA at Stanford, though he didn't get far. He interned with his old portfolio company, European Wax Center, assisting in the chain's 2022 IPO. He now sits on the boards of Joe and the Juice, Restore Hyper Wellness, and Athletic Brewing. While DiGia's tastes might influence his investments, becoming a shareholder of Athletic Brewing actually altered them. Athletic Brewing is the top-selling beer, alcoholic or otherwise, at Whole Foods Market, DiGia said. Athletic's success and the rapid growth of the nonalcoholic beverage category, compared with a flatter trajectory for traditional beer, prompted General Atlantic to lead a $50 million equity financing. When DiGia began working on the deal, he didn't have much of an interest in nonalcoholic beer. But now, he fits them into his social life, replacing his usual drink during a work dinner. Elliott was Bank of America's top vice president globally in interest-rate sales last year, generating nearly $30 million from large hedge-fund clients — production more in line with directors and managing directors. There's no obvious connection between Elliott's background and his ascendance in Bank of America's global markets division. How does food services and catering experience translate into elite hedge-fund sales? Elliott grew up in Charlotte, North Carolina, the son of two small-business entrepreneurs. His father ran a cleaning business and his mother a catering company, which meant a tenacious approach to work "was just kind of drilled into me — the idea of outworking everyone else in order to shine, in order to get visibility," he said. That ethic helped him earn his first internship in high school when the CEO of a food-procurement corporation saw Elliott's hustle at one of his mother's catering jobs and offered him an opportunity typically reserved for college students. Wall Street didn't emerge as a career path until the summer before his sophomore year at Duke when he attended a Bank of America diversity summit. "It was terrifying because I knew nothing about finance, but it was amazing to see senior people who looked like me could succeed on Wall Street," Elliott said. He didn't let lack of expertise discourage him from a great opportunity, studying to get up to speed after the bank offered him a summer internship. "I didn't have the most technical finance background, but I did consider myself, in most rooms I'd go into, the hardest worker." But success serving hedge funds requires savvy, not just intensity. Elliott said he treats every client meeting or dinner as if it's the most important moment of the day, and he comes armed with strategies and ideas that cut against the grain. "You don't want to be a salesperson that always agrees with the client," Elliott said. "You want to have different perspectives for them to analyze." Elliott also helps further the company diversity efforts that once helped him, including serving as recruiting cochair for Bank of America's group committed to developing and engaging African American leaders. Rooney, a sub-portfolio manager at the multistrategy hedge fund Eisler Capital, literally took an off-the-beaten-path route to his current role. While Rooney and Eisler declined to comment on this story, the 27-year-old investor told his former Citadel colleague Michael Watson about his circuitous journey to investing last year on the latter's podcast. Growing up in Ohio, Rooney said he didn't finish high school, choosing instead to bounce around jobs, including leading wilderness trips. While leading a canoeing trip in Canada, he met a college administrator who told him to get in touch if he wanted to return to school. He ended up at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where he studied math and statistics and interned for the agriculture trading shop Louis Dreyfus. He said a senior trader told him hedge funds would try to woo him but that he should ignore their pitches for a steadier career at a place like Dreyfus — unless it was Citadel on the other line. "I didn't even know who Citadel was at the time," Rooney, who promptly went to the firm's careers website and applied to be a commodities trader, said. Nowadays, he knows that "no 23-year-old is a portfolio manager at any hedge fund, much less Citadel." But he was hired as an associate after a long Zoom call with an agricultural trading executive at the firm and told to dive into livestock trading. He taught himself how to code in Python and added biofuels to his remit during his more than two years working for Ken Griffin before joining Eisler in October 2022. He now trades derivatives across different asset classes at Eisler's New York office but still has his wilderness experience in the back of his mind. "If there's a thunderstorm and you're in the middle of a 20-mile-wide lake, you got to get to shore," he told Watson. Rooney said it gives "you a real appreciation of the fact that random stuff can happen, and there's real risk imbued in that randomness." No workday for Williams has been the same for nearly a decade. Williams was the first hire by the activist lawyer David Rosewater for Morgan Stanley's new shareholder activism and corporate defense team in 2015. Since then, Williams has worked for General Motors as the automaker beat back proposals from David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital to create two classes of stock and Bristol Myers Squibb, which came under attack from the activist Starboard Value over its $74 billion acquisition of Celgene in 2019. "I always have loved the strategic aspect of it," she said. "There is no typical theme; there is no typical evolution. Each client is different." Defense is in her blood — her father's a retired vice admiral in the Navy, and her brother is a US Naval Academy graduate. While she considered the same path for herself, she didn't see herself becoming an officer for the long term. Instead, she gets to do "my own version of defense, in finance." "My parents tell everyone I'm still in the family defense business," she said. Her focus is on keeping Morgan Stanley's well-regarded team among the industry's leaders while also "constantly evolving." While the big-name activism campaigns and contentious proxy fights get the most headlines, she relishes working with companies on their strategies preemptively. "Every situation is incredibly unique," Williams, who has worked on hundreds of different defense strategies over the years, said. "You help them think through and plan how they can control their own destiny," she added. Zhu joined Blackstone in 2015 as the company was raising $4.5 billion for its second energy fund. Since then, Zhu has helped mentor a team that has grown to more than 30. And in the past year, he's worked on more than $2 billion in energy-transition investments. Zhu invests in assets that support renewable-energy adoption. He's worked on acquisitions of companies that will be central to upgrading the electric grid, including Blackstone's 2021 deal for Sabre Industries, which manufactures steel utility poles and towers, and its 2023 acquisition of Power Grid Components, which makes safety devices for substations. Zhu grew up with his grandparents in China, but at 17, he decided to challenge himself by applying to college in the US. He didn't speak English at the time but was accepted to the University of Guam, one of the few places that would take him without an SAT score. From there, a postgraduate business course helped him get into Duke's Fuqua School of Business. He then spent two years working in energy investment banking at BMO Capital Markets, where he realized he was more interested in working on the tangible versus the theoretical. He said he's so drawn to why things happen and the factors that make up people's lives and communities that he sometimes wonders if he should've majored in sociology or psychology. It's a big reason he enjoys working in energy transition: The real assets he helps buy can make a difference to people around the world. While he was negotiating a deal for the backup power company Trystar earlier this year, Texas experienced a catastrophic seven-day power outage. Zhu quickly saw how the company's growth could make an impact. "The benefit would be incredibly tangible and would impact a lot of lives," he said. Eid-Holm considers himself a "social nerd." The 32-year-old is a principal at Ares Infrastructure Opportunities, a $12 billion arm of the Los Angeles-based alternative asset manager Ares Management, where he focuses on digital assets, including data centers. "I'm a math person, but I also like to talk to people," Eid-Holm said. That flexibility comes in handy in a business that sits at a complicated intersection between real estate and the utility and technology industries. "Often the hardest part of getting a project off the ground is not an engineering problem; it's getting the right permits, working with the community," Eid-Holm said. Data-center development is booming, driven in large part by the proliferating need for the computing power and storage necessary to develop and commercialize artificial intelligence. Eid-Holm has helped Ares push into the asset class, including an undisclosed investment by the company in Prime Data Centers, a prominent data center developer and operator. As power has been exhausted on the grid, Eid-Holm has had to get creative. "Traditionally, the utility would build all the transmission lines and a substation next to the data center," Eid-Holm said. "We're increasingly seeing an opportunity/requirement for the developer to take on more and more of that role." Eid-Holm said he began to notice investment opportunities in the data-center space in the mid-2010s when he was a young executive at Deutsche Bank. "One deal the first year became two deals the next year became my full-time job," he said. "For me, it's been: Work very hard, and lean into good opportunities." Eid-Holm was raised in Ottawa and came to New York to work in finance after graduating from the University of Waterloo. He has a fiancé and said he often reads books "directly or tangentially related to my job" in his free time. "I'm very passionate about what I do," he said. "I work too hard for it to be only about financial results." Gilbert's first foray into finance was a flop. "I vividly remember going into my first interview with Barclays, and I totally bombed the interview," he said. "I have joked that the interviewer pulled out his phone five minutes into the interview and was replying to work emails." But growing up as a competitive athlete, playing everything from basketball and soccer to being a double black belt in karate, Gilbert was conditioned to try to rebound from the losses. "It was, kind of, the kick in the ass that I needed in order to put my career into hyperdrive," Gilbert said. Gearing up allowed Gilbert to rise from UBS's investment bank to Summit Partners, a growth equity firm in Menlo Park, California. He's now the managing director of capital markets at Thoma Bravo, one of the world's largest technology-focused buyout firms, with some $142 billion in assets under management. Gilbert's team of six works with banks, other PE firms, and direct lenders to secure financing that enables Thoma Bravo's dealmakers to make investments. The credit can come from new investments but also from refinancing and repricing existing investments. Through his relationships with about 150 banks and direct lenders, Gilbert has led the industry with pioneering financing structures — such as utilizing private debt markets — to arrange more than $84 billion in total funded debt since 2018. One loan helped finance Thoma Bravo's $10.7 billion acquisition of the planning software provider Anaplan. Gilbert and the team bypassed traditional banks to secure a $2.9 billion loan from PE lenders, including Blackstone and Apollo Global Management, within eight days. This year alone, Gilbert and the capital markets team have led 25 refinancings and repricings totaling over $23 billion in transaction volumes. Those efforts have saved Thoma Bravo more than $250 million in annual interest savings across the firm's portfolio. Spending her first years at BlackRock as an analyst in its corporate mergers-and-acquisitions advisory arm gave Ding, now an infrastructure investor, a front-row seat to the firm's push into private markets. The Princeton grad joined BlackRock in 2015 after a stint at the investment firm Harding Loevner. In the years she spent on the corporate strategy team, BlackRock acquired First Reserve Corporation's energy-infrastructure investment platform and the private credit firm Tennenbaum Capital Partners. More recently, BlackRock made its biggest push into private markets, agreeing to buy Global Infrastructure Partners for $12.5 billion. The chance to learn where the world's largest asset manager was placing its bets was a "very compelling place to be," she said, and it ultimately convinced her to join the infrastructure business in 2019. As the head of Americas for BlackRock's infrastructure solutions unit, Ding advises on about $15 billion in capital commitments and oversees the origination, underwriting, and management of infrastructure investment opportunities in the US, Canada, and Latin America. She has directly led or co-led over $2 billion of investments, ranging from renewable energy to data-center businesses to waste-management companies. She sees a "tremendous amount of opportunity" in companies related to energy transition, security, and reliability. She also focuses on the infrastructure players set to benefit from the decarbonization of carbon-emitting industries such as transportation and waste. Her path to private markets was influenced by her mentor, the late Jerry Kenney, an advisor to BlackRock and a former Merrill Lynch executive who led the bank's expansion into investment banking. As an analyst, Ding took on side projects for Kenney, who was working on ways to grow BlackRock's alternative-investments business. Ding says she continues to raise her hand to take on extra work her team needs to succeed. "It doesn't matter if you're a director or a VP and you consider it analyst-level work," she said. "If it needs to get done to move the business or a team forward, you just do it." In two years, Alcalay has built a high-performing business in a buzzy macro strategy for the quant behemoth Two Sigma. Few hedge-fund trades have inspired more hype lately than Alcalay's niche, the lucrative basis trade, which harvests small price discrepancies from highly levered government-bond positions. "It's really hard to hire good people for that seat because, for the most part, the good people are doing really well, and their firms are clinging on to them tightly," Colin Teichholtz, a senior portfolio manager who was looking to build out a team at BlueMountain in 2018, said. He was thrilled to happen upon a young, relatively unknown trader at Barclays. Alcalay comes from an unorthodox background. He's a former information warfare officer with the US Navy, where he earned the prestigious Joint Service Commendation Medal for his work in Afghanistan. He subsequently worked with the National Security Administration, briefing senior military leaders on strategic-level threats. After leaving active duty, he joined Goldman Sachs in interest-rates trading, an uncommon career path for military veterans. But Alcalay's war-zone experience sharpened skills — such as making sense of raw data and sources of intel and judging their limitations to draw a conclusion — have proved well-suited to bond trading, a trader close to him said. He has the "capability to layer human intuition on top of technology," the trader said. At BlueMountain, Alcalay identified trades not just in US Treasurys but also in the European and UK markets. Alcalay covered it all and did so with poise, Teichholtz said. When panic struck the repo funding markets in 2019, he kept his cool. "He generated returns in excess of our targets with a really high Sharpe," Teichholtz said. Alcalay joined Brevan Howard two years later. In 2022, Two Sigma sought out Alcalay to build a bond basis trade strategy. His trading book has since grown substantially, and the firm continues to scale up around his strategy, people familiar with the matter said. Alcalay founded a group to support other veterans involved in trading, and he helped organize a recent networking event and panel at Two Sigma for translating a military background to quantitative finance. Portfolio manager Gnedin grew up in a family full of astrophysicists and rocket scientists — which is part of the reason she never wanted to be one. "I guess for me, acting out was choosing the econ path," Gnedin said. The Princeton alum was inspired by her economist grandfather, the "lone black sheep" of the family who "was always the most interesting man at any dinner party," she said. But after two years as an analyst in investment banking, Gnedin, "a little bit jaded on finance," went in search of something new. In 2017, she landed a position at the largest publicly traded hedge fund, Man Group, where Gnedin has forged a path that marries her family's backgrounds. Gnedin originally joined as a quantitative researcher building algorithms for the firm's systematic investment arm, which relies on mathematical models to make investment decisions. One algorithm that Gnedin developed systematically reviewed existing model performance and identified which models should be retired. Since launching in 2019, the algorithm, one of the first of its kind at the firm, has led to about two to three models a year being dropped, she said. In 2020, Gnedin moved to the portfolio management side of the business, where she directly manages about $1.4 billion in equities in developed markets. As a quant PM, Gnedin said her job is more about managing models than specific stocks. She still spends plenty of time researching modeling techniques in old textbooks and tinkering with algorithms. When she's not nose-deep in economic research or alternative datasets, you can likely find the San Franciscan taking in the views on the Stonewall-Panoramic Trail in the East Bay with her husky. When she entered the University of Georgia, Osteen planned to pursue a career in science, but she fell in love with economics after taking an introductory course at the end of her sophomore year. After graduating in 2016, she interned at the Federal Reserve full time while studying applied economics at George Washington University. She earned her master's degree and spent another four years at the Federal Reserve as a research assistant and financial analyst. Osteen became more interested in working on Wall Street as she learned the ins and outs of stress testing and analyzed pending mergers-and-acquisition proposals from large banks. Seeking a faster-paced environment, Osteen left in 2022 to join Fidelity's asset management division as a fixed-income portfolio analyst. "Taking on challenges and trying to figure out puzzles really gets me motivated and passionate, and I feel like that is what asset management and fixed-income markets are all about," she said. "You're constantly trying to figure out and use all your resources and information to piece the puzzle together." She works with a team of three portfolio managers with about $72 billion in assets, including a low-duration bond ETF that has amassed $374 million since its February launch. In addition to her day-to-day account management work, she oversees due diligence and relationship management with bank and insurer partners for the desk's $35 billion book of stable value funds, a popular low-risk product that is guaranteed by insurers. Osteen, who had no experience in asset management before joining Fidelity, credits her swift transition to her willingness to speak up. "Not being afraid of ask questions and give your opinions and thoughts constructively is very important," she said. "It's just really being comfortable and willing to put yourself out there." At JPMorgan Asset Management, Lenihan manages $21 billion in 8,000 customizable portfolios that provide generous tax advantages for the firm's clients. He is an architect of the bank's booming Tax Smart Separately Managed Account platform, which leverages the technology of 55ip, a fintech that Lenihan helped identify for a partnership and JPMorgan then acquired. The dual role of fund manager and product developer combines his interest in finance with his engineering background. An engineer by training, Lenihan began his career monitoring the quality of suppliers' parts at Chrysler. Soon, however, he found himself thinking more about the economics of how truck and car parts played into the company's profitability than the manufacturing aspect. Hung up on these questions, and after talking to friends from the University of Michigan about their finance internships, Lenihan decided he wanted to know more about investing. He was hired into a rotational analyst program for JPMorgan's private bank, and to get closer to an investing role, he took on additional projects with portfolio managers and earned his CFA. Learning about how companies make money, why they should be financed, or their value, was "really intriguing to me," Lenihan, who also has an MBA from Wharton, said. "And as I got there, it was something that I just kind of fell in love with — really dove in since day one." His programming skills and willingness to pitch in on different projects led to opportunities like building out the firm's robo-advisor with his mentor, Ted Dimig. Lenihan led the development of a product that required buy-in from across internal tech teams, third-party partners, and operations. "That was the genesis of a lot of my passion and love for that dual-hat role was being able to flex multiple skill sets," he said. He still dedicates time to finding fintech partners to work with or acquire. Lenihan also launched a mentoring program that seeks to build connectivity among different teams at the asset manager. "I have learned firsthand about how successful you can be with those close partnerships when you work together, " he said. Jump to

Title: Meta's SWOT analysis: AI-driven growth fuels stock optimism
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/metas-swot-analysis-aidriven-growth-fuels-stock-optimism-93CH-3638852

Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has been making waves in the technology sector with its strong financial performance and strategic focus on artificial intelligence (AI). The company's recent earnings report and subsequent analyst updates have painted a picture of a tech giant poised for continued growth, despite facing challenges in an ever-evolving digital landscape. Meta's second quarter of 2024 showcased impressive results, with revenue growth of 23% year-over-year, excluding foreign exchange impacts. The company reported operating income of $14.8 billion and an operating margin of 38%, exceeding analyst expectations. Earnings per share (EPS) also surpassed estimates, coming in 7% to 10% above consensus projections. Looking ahead, Meta's guidance for the third quarter of 2024 suggests continued robust performance. Analysts are projecting revenue growth of over 20% year-over-year at the high end of the company's forecast range. This optimistic outlook has led several firms to raise their price targets for Meta's stock, with some analysts setting targets as high as $660. The company's financial strength is further underscored by its substantial cash reserves of $40.7 billion, which provide ample liquidity for ongoing investments and potential acquisitions. However, Meta's increased capital expenditure (capex) guidance for 2024 and 2025 has raised some eyebrows among analysts, with projections reaching up to $51 billion for fiscal year 2025. At the heart of Meta's recent success and future prospects lies its significant investments in AI technology. The company has effectively leveraged AI to enhance user engagement across its platforms and improve advertising efficiency. Meta's AI assistant is anticipated to become the most widely used globally by the end of the year, showcasing the company's progress in this critical area. Meta's AI initiatives extend beyond user-facing applications. The company has introduced AI Studio, a tool designed to enhance business messaging and sales interactions. Additionally, over one million advertisers are now using Meta's generative AI features, demonstrating the rapid adoption of these technologies within the company's ecosystem. The focus on AI is not limited to short-term gains. Meta's product development pipeline includes medium-term projects centered on AI chatbots, search capabilities, and business messaging, as well as long-term investments in the metaverse concept. This multi-faceted approach to innovation positions Meta to capitalize on emerging trends in digital interaction and commerce. Meta's core business of digital advertising continues to show strength, with the company outperforming many of its peers in the sector. Global advertising demand remains robust, with online commerce being the largest contributor to year-over-year growth. The company's ability to maintain strong revenue growth, even in the face of challenging year-over-year comparisons, speaks to the effectiveness of its advertising platform. The integration of AI into Meta's advertising tools is seen as a significant driver of future growth. These AI-powered solutions are improving ad delivery efficiency and return on ad spend for marketers, potentially leading to increased advertising budgets allocated to Meta's platforms. Moreover, Meta is exploring new avenues for monetization across its family of apps. The scaling of WhatsApp and the launch of Threads present opportunities for additional revenue streams, although the full monetization potential of these platforms remains to be realized. While Meta's core advertising business thrives, the company continues to invest heavily in its Reality Labs division, which focuses on virtual and augmented reality technologies. This long-term bet on the metaverse concept has been a point of contention among analysts and investors. Reality Labs is expected to see increased operating losses in 2024, reflecting the substantial investments required to develop next-generation computing platforms. However, many analysts view these expenditures as necessary for Meta to position itself at the forefront of future technological shifts. The recent showcase of Meta's holographic, AI-enabled Orion glasses prototype at the Meta Connect developer conference has reignited interest in the company's AR/VR ambitions. While still in early stages, this technology demonstrates Meta's commitment to pushing the boundaries of immersive computing experiences. Meta's dominant position in social media and digital advertising provides a strong foundation for growth. The company's vast user base, with nearly 3.3 billion daily active users across its services, offers a significant competitive advantage. This scale allows Meta to gather extensive data and refine its AI models, potentially widening the gap between itself and smaller competitors. However, the digital landscape remains fiercely competitive. Platforms like TikTok continue to challenge Meta for user attention, particularly among younger demographics. Additionally, tech giants such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are making their own strides in AI and augmented reality, ensuring that Meta must continue to innovate to maintain its market position. Despite Meta's strong performance and positive outlook, the company faces several risks and challenges. Regulatory scrutiny remains a persistent concern, with potential privacy regulations and antitrust measures posing threats to Meta's business model. The company must navigate these regulatory waters carefully to avoid significant disruptions to its operations. The substantial increase in capital expenditures and operating expenses, particularly related to AI investments, could pressure profit margins in the short term. While many analysts view these investments as necessary for long-term growth, they may impact near-term financial performance. Privacy concerns continue to be a challenge for Meta, as the company balances data collection for advertising purposes with user privacy expectations. Any missteps in this area could lead to user backlash and potential regulatory action. Lastly, macroeconomic uncertainties and potential shifts in advertiser behavior present ongoing risks to Meta's revenue growth. The company must remain agile in adapting to changing market conditions and consumer preferences to sustain its current trajectory. Meta's significant increase in capital expenditures and operating expenses, particularly related to AI investments and Reality Labs, could put pressure on the company's profit margins in the short to medium term. Analysts have noted that the projected capex for fiscal year 2025 could reach up to $51 billion, a substantial increase from previous years. This elevated spending level may impact Meta's free cash flow and earnings per share growth in the near future. While many analysts view these investments as necessary for long-term competitiveness, there is a risk that the returns on these investments may not materialize as quickly or as substantially as expected. Additionally, if advertising revenue growth slows due to market saturation or economic headwinds, the high fixed costs associated with these investments could lead to margin compression. Investors will need to closely monitor Meta's ability to balance these investments with maintaining profitability and shareholder returns. The company's management will be under pressure to demonstrate that these expenditures are translating into tangible benefits and future revenue streams. While Meta has shown impressive resilience in its advertising business, maintaining this growth trajectory in the face of intensifying competition presents a significant challenge. Platforms like TikTok have gained substantial market share, particularly among younger users, potentially threatening Meta's dominance in digital advertising. Moreover, changes in privacy regulations and platform policies, such as Apple's App Tracking Transparency feature, have made it more difficult for advertisers to target users effectively across platforms. This could lead to a shift in advertising budgets away from social media platforms like Meta's towards other channels. The company also faces competition from other tech giants investing heavily in AI and digital advertising capabilities. If Meta fails to stay ahead of the curve in terms of ad targeting efficiency and return on investment for advertisers, it could lose market share to competitors. Additionally, economic uncertainties and potential shifts in consumer behavior could impact overall advertising spend, making it challenging for Meta to maintain its current growth rates. The company will need to continuously innovate its advertising products and demonstrate superior ROI to advertisers to defend its market position and sustain revenue growth. Meta's substantial investments in artificial intelligence have the potential to create significant long-term value across multiple dimensions of its business. The company's focus on AI is already yielding tangible benefits in terms of user engagement and advertising efficiency. First, AI-driven improvements in content recommendation algorithms are enhancing user experiences across Meta's platforms. This increased engagement translates to more time spent on the apps, creating additional opportunities for advertising and monetization. The company's AI assistant, expected to become the most widely used globally by year-end, could open up new avenues for user interaction and data collection. Second, Meta's AI investments are revolutionizing its advertising platform. The introduction of generative AI features for advertisers is improving ad creation, targeting, and performance optimization. As these tools become more sophisticated, they could lead to higher return on ad spend for marketers, potentially increasing ad budgets allocated to Meta's platforms. Third, AI is enabling Meta to explore new product categories and revenue streams. The development of AI chatbots and advanced search capabilities could position the company to compete in markets currently dominated by other tech giants. Additionally, AI-powered features in emerging platforms like WhatsApp business messaging could unlock new monetization opportunities. Lastly, Meta's long-term AI investments in areas such as computer vision and natural language processing are laying the groundwork for future innovations in augmented and virtual reality. These technologies could be crucial in realizing the company's metaverse ambitions, potentially creating entirely new markets and revenue sources. By continuing to invest heavily in AI research and development, Meta is positioning itself at the forefront of technological innovation. If successful, these investments could lead to sustained competitive advantages, new market opportunities, and long-term value creation for shareholders. Meta's ability to monetize emerging platforms such as WhatsApp and Threads represents a significant opportunity for future revenue growth. While these platforms currently contribute minimally to the company's bottom line, their large and growing user bases present substantial monetization potential. WhatsApp, with its massive global user base, offers particularly promising prospects. The platform's business messaging features are gaining traction, with Meta reporting increased adoption by advertisers and businesses. As the company continues to develop AI-powered tools for business interactions on WhatsApp, it could unlock new revenue streams through features like automated customer service, in-app purchases, and targeted advertising. Threads, Meta's recently launched text-based conversation app, has shown rapid user adoption. While still in its early stages, Threads could evolve into a significant platform for user engagement and, eventually, advertising. The app's integration with Instagram's existing user base and Meta's advanced ad targeting capabilities could make it an attractive option for advertisers looking to reach engaged audiences. Moreover, Meta's expertise in monetizing social platforms through advertising and its vast trove of user data position it well to develop effective monetization strategies for these emerging platforms. The company's ongoing investments in AI and machine learning could further enhance its ability to deliver personalized and relevant content and ads across all its apps, including WhatsApp and Threads. Successfully monetizing these platforms could diversify Meta's revenue streams, reducing its reliance on Facebook and Instagram advertising. This diversification could provide more stable and sustainable long-term growth, potentially leading to a higher valuation multiple for the company. However, Meta will need to carefully balance monetization efforts with user experience and privacy concerns to ensure the continued growth and engagement of these platforms. If executed successfully, the monetization of WhatsApp and Threads could represent a significant driver of future value for Meta and its shareholders.

We recently compiled a list of the 20 AI News That Broke The Internet This Month. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) stands against the other AI stocks that broke the Internet this month. AI is transforming industries and reshaping the world by enhancing efficiency, driving innovation, and opening up new economic opportunities. A recent McKinsey report estimates that AI could add up to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy by 2030. The rapid growth of AI technologies — especially generative AI — has enabled organizations to streamline processes, automate complex tasks, and develop personalized services. In healthcare, AI is revolutionizing diagnosis and treatment. For example, AI-powered diagnostic tools, such as those developed by Google Health, achieve accuracy rates that rival or surpass human doctors in detecting diseases like cancer. These advancements can reduce diagnostic errors and improve patient outcomes. Gartner predicts that by 2025, 50% of healthcare providers will invest in AI-driven technologies to improve patient care, underscoring the potential for massive growth. Read more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave. Financial services are also being transformed by AI. According to a 2023 report from PwC, AI could increase global GDP by up to 14% by 2030, with financial services being a key driver. Banks and fintech companies are leveraging AI to enhance fraud detection, streamline customer service through AI chatbots, and offer personalized investment advice. Manufacturing is another sector experiencing rapid change due to AI. AI-powered robots are automating production lines, reducing human error, and increasing efficiency. According to the International Federation of Robotics (IFR), global sales of industrial robots are expected to reach $31 billion by 2025. These robots, coupled with AI-driven predictive maintenance systems, are lowering downtime and operational costs for manufacturers. Tesla, for instance, uses AI in its Gigafactories to streamline the production of electric vehicles, aiming to achieve greater sustainability and lower manufacturing costs. The retail industry is embracing AI to optimize supply chains and enhance customer experiences. AI-driven recommendation systems, like those used by Amazon and Alibaba, have significantly improved customer satisfaction by offering personalized shopping experiences. A Forbes report suggests that AI could reduce supply chain forecasting errors by 50%, helping retailers better meet consumer demands. However, as AI adoption grows, so do concerns around job displacement. The World Economic Forum estimates that AI will replace 85 million jobs by 2025 but also create 97 million new roles, particularly in sectors like AI development, data science, and cybersecurity. This transition will require workers to adapt and reskill to remain relevant in the evolving job market. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. Our Methodology For this article, we selected the most important AI news by combing through news articles, stock analyses, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a complex network of integrated circuits used in logic semiconductors. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 156 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) makes and sells integrated circuits and semiconductors. The company posted August sales numbers earlier this month, revealing that revenue for the month came in at approximately $7.8 billion, up 33% from August 2023. JP Morgan highlighted the strong sales in August for the chipmaker and suggested the global foundry could surpass third-quarter guidance. Latest reports suggest that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is mulling plans to partner with electronics giant Samsung to build mega chip factories in the United Arab Emirates. These factories would help satisfy soaring demand for artificial intelligence computing, per The Wall Street Journal. Overall TSM ranks 7th on our list of the AI stocks that broke the Internet this month. While we acknowledge the potential of TSM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Market Performance So Far: The USD/JPY pair has been under scrutiny since Shigeru Ishiba’s election as Japan’s new prime minister, with a drop of over 400 pips reflecting the market’s anticipation of potential policy shifts. Currently, the pair appears to be in a period of consolidation after the sharp decline, with traders focusing on the 144.30 level for signs of bearish price action. The market is still digesting Ishiba’s election and its broader implications, and traders may hesitate to make moves until more concrete policy direction is provided by the new government. Meanwhile, the broader USDX is showing mixed signals, having made a new weekly low on Friday, with traders eyeing this as a potential buying opportunity. The 99.00 level is seen as a critical support zone, and if the dollar index dips to this point, it could trigger a bullish reversal, especially if market sentiment turns in favor of the USD amid perceived risks stemming from Japan’s new foreign policy initiatives. In terms of the EUR/USD, there is a strong chance the pair could drop further from its current area, with a possibility of making one final push higher before retreating. Traders looking at bullish price action around the 1.1100 or 1.1040 zones may find opportunities, but the overall sentiment appears to lean towards a decline in the near term. GBP/USD is showing a similar pattern, with the potential for the pair to either come down from its current area or make one more push higher before reversing. If it does rise, the 1.3500 level becomes a key resistance point, and bearish price action around this zone will likely set the tone for the following week. However, if the pair declines sooner, the 1.3300 level could provide a solid area for a bullish reaction, offering some short-term opportunities for traders seeking to capitalize on volatility. Lastly, gold has continued its downward movement after testing resistance at 2670, with a potential consolidation expected, and bullish price action around the 2590 area could set the stage for a rebound. What’s Happening This Week: As we head into the first week of October, several key economic data points are expected to drive market movements. On Monday, Germany’s Preliminary CPI data is forecasted to come in at 0.1%, following a previous reading of -0.1%, which could influence the EUR/USD pair. On Tuesday, the focus shifts to high-impact U.S. reports, including the ISM Manufacturing PMI, expected at 47.6, and the JOLTS Jobs Opening report, with 7.64 million jobs forecasted. A weaker-than-expected JOLTS report could fuel speculation that the U.S. job market is softening, adding pressure to the dollar. On Wednesday, the ADP Non-Farm Employment Change takes center stage, with a forecast of 124K jobs added, and traders will be watching closely to see whether the actual data meets expectations. A stronger-than-expected ADP figure could reinforce the view that the U.S. labor market remains resilient, while a weaker figure could lead to dollar weakness. On Thursday, the ISM Services PMI is forecasted at 51.6, and any data supporting a strong U.S. services sector will likely reinforce dollar strength. The end of the week brings the most closely watched reports: Friday’s Non-Farm Employment Change and the Unemployment Rate. The Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) data is forecasted at 144K, and the unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 4.2%. A stronger-than-expected NFP report, combined with a stable unemployment rate, could drive the dollar higher, while a weaker NFP could lead to dollar softness. Markets will likely respond with heightened volatility around Friday’s release, making it an important day for traders in dollar-denominated assets. Welspun Corp announced the receipt of order from the Middle East for supply of Coated LSAW Pipes and Bends for sour service. Shares rise 1.77% on the NSE to ₹753.60. Here is the Live event updates Market is likely to move into a consolidation phase in the near-term. One significant factor that is influencing foreign portfolios is the outperformance of the Chinese stocks which is reflected in the massive surge in the Hang Seng index by around 18 % in September. This surge has been triggered by hopes of revival in the Chinese economy in response to the monetary and fiscal stimulus announced by the Chinese authorities. The cheap valuations of Chinese stocks are keeping the momentum intact. This can prove to be a tactical trade which can sustain for some more time. This means FIIs may continue to sell in India and move some more money to better performing markets. FII selling is unlikely to impact the Indian market significantly since the massive domestic money can easily absorb whatever the FIIs are selling. Investors can use dips to buy quality largecaps which are fairly valued. Crude oil prices recovered from their lows on Friday but prices fell last week amid demand concerns and higher supply from global oil markets. As per market sources, OPEC+ will increase production by 1,80,000 barrels per day each month starting from December. The Libyan dispute has also settled and its exports could resume soon. Also, the Chinese central bank announced a cut in RRR by 50 basis points and undertook stimulus measures to revive the Chinese economy thus supporting crude oil prices at lower levels. Escalating tensions in the Middle-East are also supporting crude oil prices. We expect crude oil prices to remain volatile in today’s session. Crude oil is having support at $67.55-66.90 and resistance at $69.10-69.80. In INR, crude oil has support at Rs5,630-5,570 while resistance is at Rs 5,775-5,840. Gold and silver prices rose for the third straight week in the global market after the U.S. Fed undertook big interest rate cuts in September. The dollar also weakened, which helped push prices higher. However, both metals dropped slightly from their record highs as some investors sold to book profits. Gold is nearing $2,700 per troy ounce, and silver recently hit its highest level in 11 years. Gold and silver are gaining strength because of interest rate cuts by central banks around the world, stimulus efforts from China, and rising global tensions. Gold has support at $2651-2640 while resistance is at $2684-2699. Silver has support at $31.42-31.24 while resistance is at 31.87-32.05. In INR terms, gold has support at Rs 74,750-74,570, while resistance is at Rs 75,190-75,380. Silver has support at Rs90,850-90,150, while resistance at Rs91,990-92,680.

Amid concerns of rising investor trading in the F&O segment, the new securities transaction tax (STT) levied on sale of futures and options contracts will kick in from October 1. Experts say that this could rein in excessive speculative F&O trading. NLC India share price has been consolidating sideways for almost two months now. The price action on the charts indicate that this consolidation could come to an end soon. The combined market valuation of eight of the top-10 most valued firms surged ₹1,21,270.83 crore last week, with Reliance Industries becoming the biggest gainer, in line with an outstanding rally in benchmark equity indices. Last week, the BSE benchmark jumped 1,027.54 points or 1.21 per cent. The BSE Sensex hit its record high of 85,978.25 on Friday. The initial public offer (IPO) of Afcons Infrastructure, the flagship firm of Shapoorji Pallonji group, may be revised, likely upwards, with overwhelming interest coming in from institutional investors, but a decision on this is yet to be taken. While the fresh issue amounting to ₹1,250 crore that the company is raising, will remain the same, the offer for sale portion may see a revision. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have put in more money than any other category of investors in initial public offerings (IPOs) this year. FPI investments amount to ₹17,477 crore, which is 27 per cent of the ₹63,860 crore raised via IPOs this year. In comparison, domestic institutional investors (DII)-- comprising mutual funds, insurance firms, financial institutions and banks -- have invested ₹17,277 crore. Here’s an interesting stock idea: The stock idea that we have for you today is NLC India. The stock has been consolidating sideways now. The price action on the charts indicate that a bullish breakout is possible this week. That breakout can boost the momentum and take the share price higher in the coming days. Check out the latest episode of bl.Today’s Pick to learn more. The rise to 26,200 on the #Nifty happened last week in line with our expectation. The overall picture is still positive. #Nifty can continue to rise from here in the coming weeks. Supports are there to limit the downside. Any dip from here will be limited as fresh buyers are likely to come into the market at lower levels. Global trends, trading activity of foreign investors and domestic macroeconomic data announcements would dictate terms in the equity market in a holiday-shortened week ahead, analysts said. Equity markets would remain closed on Wednesday for Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti. “Looking ahead, it will be interesting to monitor Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) and their flow into India. September saw the highest FII inflows into Indian equities this year. Movements in commodity prices, the US dollar index, and key macroeconomic data from the US will also be pivotal in shaping the market’s direction.

September 29, 2024 14:00 ET | Source: Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC NEW YORK, Sept. 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Attorney Advertising--Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC, a nationally recognized law firm, notifies investors that a class action lawsuit has been filed against CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (“CrowdStrike” or “the Company”) (NASDAQ: CRWD) and certain of its officers. Class Definition This lawsuit seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the federal securities laws on behalf of all persons and entities that purchased or otherwise acquired CrowdStrike securities between November 29, 2023, and July 29, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”). Such investors are encouraged to join this case by visiting the firm’s site: bgandg.com/CRWD. Case Details The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants repeatedly touted the efficacy of the Falcon platform while assuring investors that CrowdStrike’s technology was “validated, tested, and certified.” The Complaint alleges that these statements were false and misleading because Defendants had failed to disclose that: (1) CrowdStrike had instituted deficient controls in its procedure for updating Falcon and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (2) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of the Company’s customers; and (3) such outages could pose, and in fact ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to CrowdStrike. The Complaint further alleges that as a result of these materially false and misleading statements and omissions, CrowdStrike stock traded at artificially high prices during the Class Period. What's Next? A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to review a copy of the Complaint, you can visit the firm’s site: bgandg.com/CRWD or you may contact Peretz Bronstein, Esq. or his Client Relations Manager, Nathan Miller, of Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC at 332-239-2660.

Title: Mark Zuckerberg’s Fortune Swells To Over $200 Billion—The Metaverse Masterstroke
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/mark-zuckerbergs-fortune-swells-to-201-billion/
Time Published: 2024-09-29T17:00:26Z
Full Content:
The trek into the metaverse for Mark Zuckerberg has been anything but smooth. His once-risky bet, which cost him more than $100 billion, appears to be paying off handsomely now. His net worth has increased dramatically to $201 billion in less than two years, nearly sixfold. The skyrocketing stock price of Meta Platforms Inc., which has increased by about 60% just this year, is mostly the impetus for this surge. Consequently, Zuckerberg is once again the fourth richest person in the world, behind only Jeff Bezos, Bernard Arnault, and Elon Musk. Despite these amazing numbers, the metaverse remains controversy-ridden. While Zuckerberg maintains that it is the future of social interaction, many remain skeptical about it. Some doubters think Meta’s performance produced more loses than advantages. Some critics have argued that Zuckerberg’s fortune has been less in the metaverse concept itself than in his endeavors to benefit from recent AI leaps. Interestingly, Meta made huge financial stabilization efforts. This includes the initiation of its $50 billion share buyback program and also reduced 25% of its workforce for the sake of streamlining the organization. Zuckerberg continued to support the metaverse despite financial issues. He passionately discussed integrating the actual and virtual worlds at recent events, envisioning a period when people communicate via holograms or avatars. Nonetheless, a few shareholders and insiders are advising caution. They’ve voiced reservations about investing further funds in what many consider to be a project that is still a long way from becoming widely accepted. Furthermore, there’s a growing belief that Zuckerberg ought to focus on Meta’s main applications, which generate almost all of the company’s income: Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. As the tech sector gets more competitive—especially with rivals like Google and Amazon making major advances in artificial intelligence— Zuckerberg might wish to rethink his goals. As Meta continues to introduce fresh goods, such as the Quest 3 VR helmet and Ray-Ban smart glasses, these innovations should eventually help the business to increase its income. Still, many investors who would rather see gains sooner rather than later harbor great skepticism. Future prosperity of the company will depend critically on its capacity to include fresh technologies into its current systems.

By David Pierce, editor-at-large and Vergecast co-host with over a decade of experience covering consumer tech. Previously, at Protocol, The Wall Street Journal, and Wired. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Hi, friends! Welcome to Installer No. 54, your guide to the best and Verge-iest stuff in the world. (If you’re new here, welcome, so psyched you found us, and also you can read all the old editions at the Installer homepage.) This week, I’ve been reading about AI slop and sports betting and Jony Ive, clearing my schedule for the new season of The Great British Bake Off, watching Sicario and Pirates of the Caribbean and A Quiet Place: Day One on plane-seat screens like their directors intended, insta-subscribing to Hasan Minhaj’s new YouTube show, and just relentlessly trolling people with Vergecast clips through Pocket Casts’ new feature. I also have for you a couple of new Meta gadgets, the mobile game that will eat up all your free time, a couple of hotly anticipated new movies, the best Spotify feature in forever, and much more. So much going on! Let’s dig in. (As always, the best part of Installer is your ideas and tips. What are you into right now? What should everyone else be reading / watching / playing / trying / building out of clay this week? Tell me everything: installer@theverge.com. And if you know someone else who might enjoy Installer, tell them to subscribe here.) / A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. Fun fact: Joanna Stern is the main reason I ever got a job at The Verge in the first place. (That story is long and, if I remember correctly, involves her playing a fairy in a video? But I promised her I wouldn’t tell that story.) These days, she’s a columnist at The Wall Street Journal, an Emmy winner, and most recently, the creator of Joannabot, the AI chatbot that will tell you everything you need to know about the iPhone 16. (And apparently also do some other things, if you’re clever enough, but again, we’ll leave that alone.) I asked Joanna to share her homescreen because she just reviewed the iPhone 16, which means she just had to set up a homescreen. And because she’s forever using new gadgets and switching between things, I was curious what always made it to the top of the pile. Here’s Joanna’s homescreen, plus some info on the apps she uses and why: I’m submitting my homescreen and my Control Center screen because I’m proud of the work I did on the Control Center. I may submit it for an award. But really, I’d like to just use this as a forum to complain about the all-in-one connectivity widget in the new Control Center in iOS 18. I don’t like it. I like the single buttons so I can easily just turn them on and off or long-press to get in there. Sadly, they have gotten rid of the single Wi-Fi button, but I read on this great website that it’s coming back in iOS 18.1. The phone: iPhone 16 Pro Max. The wallpaper: This is my dog Browser. It isn’t the best shot of him, but the framing is nice for putting him in the middle of the screen. My lockscreen wallpaper is this awesome retro iPod made by a designer named Shane Levine. I bought it through this site last year after featuring it in my newsletter. The apps: WSJ, ChatGPT, Apple Notes, Google Maps, Google Docs, Google Calendar, Instagram, YouTube, Clock, Threads, Signal, Photos, Slack, Spotify, Phone, Safari, Messages, Gmail. My apps are so basic and make me feel so basic. I work (Slack, Gmail). I message (Messages, Signal). I listen and watch things (YouTube, Spotify). I social media (Threads, Instagram). I work more (Google Docs, WSJ). If it isn’t on this main homescreen, I usually just search for it. Before iOS 18, I had a widget stack on the homescreen with weather and time zone widgets, but I moved it off to another screen. I might move it back. I might not. Got to live a little. I also asked Joanna to share a few things she’s into right now. Here’s what she shared: Here’s what the Installer community is into this week. I want to know what you’re into right now as well! Email installer@theverge.com or message me on Signal — @davidpierce.11 — with your recommendations for anything and everything, and we’ll feature some of our favorites here every week. And for even more great recommendations, check out the replies to this post on Threads. “Sliding Seas. It’s a match-three (or four!) game but also so much more: there’s real strategy required behind your moves to beat levels at the higher end, but it’s never unfair, and while there are in-app purchases and power-ups you can buy to make a level easier, you crucially never need to. It is the most compelling and well-suited-to-mobile game I’ve ever found and a gem I recommend without reservation.” – Jamie “Gisnep is another daily puzzle game, this time by David Friedman of Ironic Sans. It appears as a crossword-esque grid, but the words only go across and wrap around. The goal is to reveal both a quote and the source by filling in letters from vertical columns. I’ve gotten a number of my friends hooked already.” – Kyle “Satisfactory 1.0 launched a week ago or so. A great group of devs have effectively made a game that feels like work but is fun. If you love conveyor belts and staying up all night, this might be for you.” – Matt “Can’t believe you haven’t mentioned switching to OmniFocus! As a fellow perennial ‘task manager switcher,’ this app is a staple in my rotation.” – Pedro “I previously recommended App in the Air as a great travel companion, but unfortunately, it’s shutting down. If you’re looking for an alternative, Flighty is excellent, especially for travel stats, and they’re building an importer for App in the Air users.” – Vivian “We’ve been watching English Teacher on FX. Constant laughs and, so far, each episode has been better than the last. Easily one of the funniest shows on TV right now.” – Danial “I was gifted the Humanscale FR300 Ergonomic Foot Rocker, which is a very tech-sounding name for a very manual / mechanical rocking footrest. It’s very pleasant to use. I’ve also been standing on it sometimes... which I’m not sure is safe but sure is fun!” – Wisdom “Repeatedly putting in my Amazon cart the Black Milanese Loop for the Apple Watch Ultra 2. I was so close to buying it like three times. Now it’s out of stock. Even Apple says early November for shipping.” – Scott “Been playing with different LLMs using LM Studio. Integrated it into my Obsidian vault to help summarize and organize things into specific formats. It’s been extremely cool!” – Cody I’ve had back-to-back-to-back-to-back trips over the last two weeks, and I would just like to quickly shout out my new No. 1 travel hack: a wall charger that doubles as a big-ass portable battery. I have this Anker model, which is $55, charges a USB-C and a USB-A device simultaneously, and also charges itself so I can get 10,000mAh of power when there’s no outlet nearby. (There’s also a newer one with two USB-C ports and even faster charging but less battery capacity.) It’s huge and heavy, but this thing and a long cable are now the only charging gear I travel with, and they’re the only reasons my gadgets have survived trains and plane rides. Here at Installer, we love a sensible charging strategy, and this is as sensible as it gets.

Title: Are Stocks Overvalued?

With the backdrop of further expected Fed rate cuts, resilient economic growth, and stocks closing ... [+] at highs last week, are stocks overvalued? Chair Powell and the Federal Reserve recently delivered a larger-than-expected half-percentage point decrease in short-term interest rates, igniting another leg of the stock rally. Because of the aggressive first move from the Fed, markets have priced in a higher likelihood of avoiding recession and sent stocks to new highs. Stocks and the Magnificent 7 continued their march higher this week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed the S&P 500 on the week and are now only 5.1% below their early July highs. The S&P 500 is almost 22% higher year-to-date, while the S&P 500 technology sector is nearly 30% higher. With the backdrop of the Fed rate cut cycle, resilient economic growth, and stocks closing at highs this week, are stocks overvalued? Stock Returns Trying to value the stock market is simple on the surface but is never easy. Since shareholders own a piece of an operating company, not just a piece of paper, stocks are valued based on the expected future cash flows accruing to shareholders. Complicating the process and providing the occasional opportunity for investors, prices are also impacted by human emotion. Based on a multiple of next year’s estimated earnings, also known as the forward price-to-earnings ratio, stocks do not look cheap relative to the past. However, historically, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is correlated with return-on-equity (ROE), which measures how efficiently companies produce profits from the capital provided by their shareholders. Though ROE is down from its recent highs, it remains above average and argues for an above-average P/E ratio, assuming this elevated ROE is sustainable. S&P 500: P/E & ROE Warren Buffett has said, “The value of a business is the cash it’s going to produce in the future, discounted back to the present.” Free cash flow measures the cash left over after a company supports its operations and maintains or invests further in its business, providing a good measure of the money accruing to us as owners. Free cash flow yield is the free cash flow divided by the stock price. Consistent with price-to-earnings, cash flow yield points to a stock market that is not cheap, though it has been more expensive at times in the past. This metric assumes free cash flow remains static, so it can also be interpreted as investors having more confidence that free cash flow will continue to grow. Indeed, investors should be willing to pay more for a company in which one can have high confidence that the corporate profits accruing to owners will continue to grow. As a subset of the S&P 500, technology stocks are priced at an even lower free cash flow yield. This valuation premium reflects the optimism about the future of many of these companies and, as will be illustrated, the superior fundamentals of the group. S&P 500: Free Cash Flow Yield Like the exceptional return on equity noted earlier and supporting the rich stock valuations, profit margins are elevated relative to history. Profit margins measure the percentage of top-line sales that become bottom-line profits. As a business owner, higher profit margins, all other things being equal, are more valuable. Notably, the profit margins for the technology sector are close to double the market as a whole, which helps explain the premium valuation assigned by the lower free cash flow yield. S&P 500: Profitability As noted, free cash flow yields look in the rearview mirror and don’t explicitly consider growth. Over the last five years, the S&P 500 has grown free cash flow per share at a 5.1% annualized rate, while the technology sector has grown at a much faster 8.6% annualized rate. Both are impressive growth rates considering that this timeframe includes the COVID-19 economic shutdown, which saw the U.S. economy shrink at a 32.9% annualized rate in the second quarter of 2020. Technology’s superior free cash flow growth further reinforces why those stocks have been dominant, and their valuation is above the S&P 500. Free Cash Flow Growth As Buffett noted, the last piece of the puzzle is to discount those future owner’s cash flows to the present using an interest rate. All other things being equal, valuations should be lower for the same stream of profits when yields are higher and vice versa. Now that the Federal Reserve has begun reducing short-term interest rates, the expectation is that yields for longer-maturity bonds will also decline. Indeed, an analysis of past monetary easing cycles shows that stocks usually rose in the twelve months after the cuts started. 10-Year U.S. Treasury Real Yields If one looks at how the more economically sensitive cyclical companies are performing versus the less sensitive defensives, stocks currently assign a lower risk of recession. In addition, consensus S&P 500 earnings estimates for 2025 call for 15% growth, according to FactSet. The soft landing does seem like how things should play out, but it is far from a certainty. Warren Buffett spoke to the situation when he said, “It’s been an ideal period for investors: A climate of fear is their best friend. Those who invest only when commentators are upbeat end up paying a heavy price for meaningless reassurance.” In other words, prices are usually high when the majority are optimistic. Cyclicals Versus Defensives So, where does this leave us in our answer to the question of stock valuation? It isn’t an easy or straightforward answer. As a means of defense, even Warren Buffett has said, “In the business world, the rearview mirror is always clearer than the windshield.” Investors have rightly sent stocks higher, particularly technology stocks, based on improving fundamentals, but that is the past. If one believes that the economy continues to chug along and free cash flow, perhaps driven by artificial intelligence, continues to grow at a robust pace, then stocks could be underpriced. Further, the leading technology companies have dominant competitive positions, and delivering intangible goods allows for profit margins and earnings growth rates that were not previously possible. There are reasonable arguments that artificial intelligence can lift profits across many industries, not just the technology sector. The challenging part is the current starting line of exceptional profit margins and above-average valuations, which leaves less margin for error since the future free cash flows matter to the valuation of businesses. In addition, the COVID-impacted economic cycle likely leaves our typical economic indicators less effective, so confidence in forecasts should be less than usual. Though it doesn’t feel that way, the risk of eventual disappointment is higher in stocks when valuations are above average, and forecasts are rosy. For long-term investors who can withstand the inevitable volatility, the discussion of overvaluation is moot since stocks have provided the highest after-inflation returns of any asset class despite the ups and downs throughout history. Since the short-term path of stocks is always unknown and subject to human emotion, investors should be mindful of their asset allocation and risk tolerance. It is an excellent time to consider rebalancing to an appropriate risk level after the robust stock gains, especially in light of possible higher capital gains tax rates next year. In addition, owning some high-quality and less economically sensitive defensive stocks is analogous to buying an umbrella when it is sunny. The purchases are cheaper than when it rains, and investors will be happy to have them if it storms. Because some dominant technology companies have exceptional fundamentals and long-term outlooks, abandoning them altogether, barring evidence to the contrary, is unwise.

With the backdrop of further expected Fed rate cuts, resilient economic growth, and stocks closing ... [+] at highs last week, are stocks overvalued? Chair Powell and the Federal Reserve recently delivered a larger-than-expected half-percentage point decrease in short-term interest rates, igniting another leg of the stock rally. Because of the aggressive first move from the Fed, markets have priced in a higher likelihood of avoiding recession and sent stocks to new highs. Stocks and the Magnificent 7 continued their march higher this week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed the S&P 500 on the week and are now only 5.1% below their early July highs. The S&P 500 is almost 22% higher year-to-date, while the S&P 500 technology sector is nearly 30% higher. With the backdrop of the Fed rate cut cycle, resilient economic growth, and stocks closing at highs this week, are stocks overvalued? Stock Returns Trying to value the stock market is simple on the surface but is never easy. Since shareholders own a piece of an operating company, not just a piece of paper, stocks are valued based on the expected future cash flows accruing to shareholders. Complicating the process and providing the occasional opportunity for investors, prices are also impacted by human emotion. Based on a multiple of next year’s estimated earnings, also known as the forward price-to-earnings ratio, stocks do not look cheap relative to the past. However, historically, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is correlated with return-on-equity (ROE), which measures how efficiently companies produce profits from the capital provided by their shareholders. Though ROE is down from its recent highs, it remains above average and argues for an above-average P/E ratio, assuming this elevated ROE is sustainable. S&P 500: P/E & ROE Warren Buffett has said, “The value of a business is the cash it’s going to produce in the future, discounted back to the present.” Free cash flow measures the cash left over after a company supports its operations and maintains or invests further in its business, providing a good measure of the money accruing to us as owners. Free cash flow yield is the free cash flow divided by the stock price. Consistent with price-to-earnings, cash flow yield points to a stock market that is not cheap, though it has been more expensive at times in the past. This metric assumes free cash flow remains static, so it can also be interpreted as investors having more confidence that free cash flow will continue to grow. Indeed, investors should be willing to pay more for a company in which one can have high confidence that the corporate profits accruing to owners will continue to grow. As a subset of the S&P 500, technology stocks are priced at an even lower free cash flow yield. This valuation premium reflects the optimism about the future of many of these companies and, as will be illustrated, the superior fundamentals of the group. S&P 500: Free Cash Flow Yield Like the exceptional return on equity noted earlier and supporting the rich stock valuations, profit margins are elevated relative to history. Profit margins measure the percentage of top-line sales that become bottom-line profits. As a business owner, higher profit margins, all other things being equal, are more valuable. Notably, the profit margins for the technology sector are close to double the market as a whole, which helps explain the premium valuation assigned by the lower free cash flow yield. S&P 500: Profitability As noted, free cash flow yields look in the rearview mirror and don’t explicitly consider growth. Over the last five years, the S&P 500 has grown free cash flow per share at a 5.1% annualized rate, while the technology sector has grown at a much faster 8.6% annualized rate. Both are impressive growth rates considering that this timeframe includes the COVID-19 economic shutdown, which saw the U.S. economy shrink at a 32.9% annualized rate in the second quarter of 2020.

Investors have until October 7, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in Ford securities. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan and is captioned Guzman v. Ford Motor Company, et al., No. 24-cv-12080. What is the Lawsuit About? Ford is an automotive manufacturing company that develops, delivers, and services a range trucks, cars, and luxury vehicles worldwide. The complaint alleges that during the relevant period, the company misrepresented its warranty reserves and that it had completed a sequence of organizational changes designed to ensure higher quality and lower costs. In truth, Ford was experiencing higher warranty costs, and the warranty reserves did not accurately reflect the quality issues in its vehicles. On July 24, 2024, after the market closed, Ford announced second quarter 2024 financial results (the “2Q24 Press Release”). The 2Q24 Press Release revealed that the Company’s “[p]rofitability was affected by an increase in warranty reserves” and “higher warranty costs.” It was reported that, in the second quarter, Ford’s warranty and recall costs totaled $2.3 billion, $800 million more than the first quarter and $700 million more than a year ago. This news caused the price of Ford’s stock to decline by $2.51 per share, or over 18%, to close at $11.16 per share on July 25, 2024.

Title: Angry Amazon employees are ‘rage applying’ for new jobs after Andy Jassy’s RTO mandate: ‘I will not go back’

Laura was working from home when her husband forwarded her a link to the news: Amazon tells employees to return to office five days a week. It was the first time the working mom, who has been with Amazon for over four years, learned she would need to add another four hours to her weekly commute. “At first, I didn’t quite believe it,” she tells Fortune. “After all, who expects to get career-altering news from a news article instead of your employer.” “Which, to be honest, is a pretty horrible way to find out about something that’s going to impact your life in a huge way. I really, really would have liked a personal communication from my manager, but that didn’t happen for a couple of days.” Laura says she was hired virtually during the pandemic with the understanding that there was no expectation to return to Amazon’s offices. That was, until 2023 when CEO Andy Jassy announced that he wanted workers to “go back to being in the office together the majority of the time”—at least, three days per week. “The original RTO mandate was a tough pill to swallow, but the latest one is impossible,” she says. After the initial shock of the news blew over, Laura says a sense of calm and clarity washed over: “My months of struggling to make three days a week are over, and I know that my time at Amazon has to end.” Even if she could commit to commuting into the office full time, Laura says she would still quit over Amazon’s remote work bait and switch. “Honestly, I’ve lost so much trust in Amazon leadership at this point,” she adds. “I’ve been updating my resume and portfolio, and rage applying to new jobs on LinkedIn.” Laura’s not alone: A handful of Amazon employees told Fortune that they’re so frustrated with the tech giant’s war on working from home that they’re officially on the job hunt. Two say they learned the news—and its implications—via the media, rather than a manager. One says they’ve already handed their notice in. Another says they’ve had two interview offers within 48 hours of the RTO announcement. Amazon did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has repeatedly warned remote workers that it’s “not going to work out” for them at the company. Despite this, it’s clear that a number of Amazon employees (and managers, for that matter) have been ignoring the guidelines up until now. Experts previously told Fortune that Amazon’s 5-day mandate is a “negotiation game” to get employees in the office for the 3 days it originally asked for. “I was not complying,” Ben, who lives three hours away from an Amazon office, comments on the previous hybrid policy. He briefly considered moving before thinking again: “I decided not to make life choices as Amazon can fire me at will anyway, and I do not want to make long-term life changes because some manager decided I should start going to the office when I was hired virtual and promised I could work from wherever I want.” Some managers were still assuring their new hires could work from home after the 3-day mandate came into effect. One employee told Fortune that he was hired remotely in May 2023—a month after the company announced its initial RTO policy. “I left a decent company I live near to go to Amazon since it was working from home,” Luca, a millennial analyst, complains. “For me, it’s not that I don’t want to go in the office, there is no office close to me.” He says that his manager has been covering for his absence from any office, but that will no longer work. “He told me he would not be able to help, they’ve made him go into an office too,” Luca says, adding that he couldn’t get a firm answer on whether he will be expected to head into the office despite being promised otherwise in the interview room. “I like my job at Amazon, but I need firm ground to stand on and they are not providing that.” Whether Jassy’s latest move is to make employees show their faces more frequently or not, workers have until Jan. 2, 2025 (the date he’s given them to relocate if needed) to call his bluff—or quit. Most of the people Fortune spoke to think that Amazon is secretly hoping for the latter anyway. While Jassy positioned Amazon’s changes—which also include a flattened hierarchy and no more hot desking—as a better way to work, disgruntled employees are adamant that it’s a thinly veiled headcount reduction. “It’s a rob Peter to pay Paul situation of short-term gains from voluntary layoffs in exchange for losing top talent and reducing productivity for years to come,” Gen X program manager Jared says. Although he’s only been working at Amazon for six months, he’s already changed his LinkedIn status to #opentowork, reached out to former colleagues, and updated his resume in the hopes of finding a more flexible job before Jan. 2. “The new policy is less flexible than pre-COVID and does not respect the needs of employees to take care of their health, their family, or work-life balance,” Jared scoffs. “I will not go back.” While he was complying with the three-day policy, he refused to return to working in a cubicle five days a week when Amazon’s competitors are still offering some working from home—and he thinks many others will do the same. “As a top performer with prior MAANG (Meta, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google) experience in this tight market, I believe it will be fairly easy to find a new role that is at least hybrid,” Jared adds. “One of my co-workers put in his notice on Monday. I expect others to follow.” He’s not wrong. Rumors of a stricter RTO were enough ammunition to inspire Ben to quit—he took “voluntary termination” two months ago and has now started his own firm. Likewise, Lisa, a marketing leader in Europe, has called time on her four years at Amazon. After hearing about Jassy’s announcement via the news, the 40-something says she immediately started reaching out to recruiters. “This new mandate goes against so many of the leadership principles that we supposedly hold so dear,” she says, adding that she has been a “top-rated employee year on year” thanks to working from home. “I’ve constantly delivered for this business and their reward is to order me back into the office, where I will sit at my desk either writing docs or sitting on calls,” Lisa adds. “I don’t want to work for a business that clearly has so little respect for me.” Every job that Lisa has applied for offers hybrid work, and she’s confident she’ll find a more flexible employer before the New Year. Within 48 hours of Amazon’s new policy going public, she had already secured two job interviews. “I will always work hard, but now I want to work for a company that works hard for me too.” Interviewee names have been changed for anonymity. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week. InvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today! D.A. Davidson analysts downgraded Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) from a Buy to a Neutral rating on Monday, maintaining their $475 price target. The firm pointed to increasing competition in AI as the reason for the revision, noting that rivals have largely caught up to Microsoft’s AI capabilities. This, they argue, "reduces the justification for the current premium valuation." Microsoft’s stock has soared by 92% since January 2023, significantly outperforming the S&P 500, which gained 49% over the same period. But now, D.A. Davidson analysts believe that Microsoft's lead in cloud and AI is narrowing. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services (AWS) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Cloud Platform (GCP) have demonstrated similar growth rates, which has closed the gap in cloud business expansion. “Our new proprietary hyperscaler semiconductor analysis indicates AWS and GCP are far ahead in terms of deploying their own silicon into their data centers, which gives them a significant advantage over Azure going forward,” they said in a note. Microsoft’s Maia chips are still behind Amazon and Google by several years, with their current use limited to Azure OpenAI Services workloads. This, according to D.A. Davidson, places Microsoft in a challenging position in the competitive data center landscape. Another concern raised by the analysts is Microsoft’s reliance on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) for data center operations, which could lead to a shift of value from Microsoft shareholders to Nvidia’s. Microsoft’s operating margins are under pressure due to rising data center capital expenditures, which have jumped from 12% to 21% of revenue. “This is a higher rate of increase compared to Amazon and Google, a result of Microsoft’s greater reliance on NVIDIA,” analysts continued. “Every year Microsoft over-invests at these rates, it will diminish margins by at least 1pp in a cumulative manner. Microsoft would need to lay off ~10,000 employees for every year of over-investment in order to offset the margin drag.” Also, the firm expressed concerns about the sustainability of Azure’s revenue growth, hinting that it could be inflated by contributions from OpenAI's self-funded revenue. This week, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) kicked off its developer-focused event, Meta Connect, unveiling its latest hardware and software innovations. One of the key highlights was the launch of the Quest 3S, the newest virtual reality (VR) headset from Meta's Reality Labs division, offered at a more affordable price than its predecessor. Also, Meta introduced a new prototype of augmented reality (AR) smart glasses and revealed updates to its Meta AI chatbot. The chatbot now includes a voice interaction feature, allowing users to engage through both spoken and written commands. Here’s what analysts said after the event: Citi: “Meta’s new AI products, features, and devices announced at Connect ‘24 make us incrementally confident that its product innovation can deliver increased engagement and monetization as the ROI from its AI investments continues to expand.” Bank of America: “We think AI Glasses have much broader market potential than VR Googles. While Metaverse spend still seems hard to justify, with glasses long-term investors may have some renewed optimism on Meta’s opportunity to be at the forefront of the next generation of personal computing devices. “More importantly, the company appears to be successfully innovating around new AI capabilities, driving usage growth which can offset terminal value concerns, and we see Meta as the top AI pick in consumer Internet.” JMP Securities analysts said earlier this week that Google's enterprise AI adoption is accelerating, driven by increased use of its Gemini platform. "We are seeing signs that enterprise adoption of AI is inflecting." At Google's "Gemini at Work" event, the tech giant highlighted a 35x surge in Gemini platform usage, with 75% of daily users reporting improvements in work quality due to AI. JMP Securities views this as a clear signal of a turning point in enterprise AI adoption. The firm credits Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) for removing barriers to AI adoption by achieving compliance with key standards like SOC 1, 2, 3, and HIPAA, and forging integration partnerships with major companies such as Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), SAP, Microsoft, and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). These efforts have resulted in 85 new enterprise use cases over the past six months, driving meaningful cost savings and revenue growth opportunities for businesses. JMP Securities also stressed the growing importance of AI as corporations focus on technological transformation. Google’s integration of AI solutions with both first- and third-party data is improving accuracy and functionality, further boosting enterprise AI usage. The firm noted that generative AI usage by enterprises has surged 15x, while adoption of AI agents has grown by 6x. Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) saw its shares jump nearly 15% on Thursday after delivering an optimistic first-quarter revenue outlook, driven by strong demand and pricing for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which are crucial to the rapidly expanding generative AI sector. The chipmaker, a key supplier to Nvidia, added approximately $15 billion to its market capitalization as its stock surged around 27% over the past three weeks. “It’s really not a good day to be short memory and semi-cap equipment stocks,” a Mizuho analyst remarked after the report’s release and Micron’s stock jump. “For the memory and semi cap equipment bears, I would advise against going down in a ball of flames and cover shorts and consider getting long some key semi winners even if you dislike MU and not willing to chase this 15%+ rip at the open,” the analyst added. “Personally, I think the MU rally will sustain and pull in many of these long/short haters who will flip from short to long at least for the near term.” Micron is shifting its focus away from lower-margin segments like PCs and smartphones to higher-margin, high-value products, such as HBM chips for servers and data centers. Mizuho highlighted that Micron management is confident their technology leads in both power and performance, outperforming competitors like SK Hynix and Samsung (KS:005930). Following Accenture's (NYSE:ACN) latest earnings report published this week, Piper Sandler analysts upgraded the stock from Neutral to Overweight, raising the price target to $395 from $329. Despite Accenture's overall FY25 guidance meeting expectations, analysts are optimistic about several underlying metrics. The company's first-quarter forecast exceeded consensus, with strong bookings of $20.2 billion and a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2x. moreover, Accenture’s workforce expanded significantly, adding 24,000 employees, marking a 3.2% quarter-over-quarter increase. “The setup for FY25 seems attractive as full-year guidance assumes no improvement beyond 1Q,” analysts wrote. One of the key growth drivers was in Generative AI (GenAI), where bookings and revenues grew approximately tenfold. In FY24, GenAI bookings hit $3 billion, with revenues of $900 million, up from $300 million and $100 million, respectively. “Importantly, the company is starting to see some scaled GenAI projects; and an increase in the number of data projects and security-related work ($9B in revenues, +23% growth),” Piper Sandler’s team noted. “Overall, we believe owning ACN is attractive, given improving top-line metrics, a conservative guide, and that it is a key beneficiary of GenAI-related work.”

Title: Hollywood's big boom has gone bust
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj6er83ene6o
Time Published: 2024-09-28T23:18:00Z
Full Content:
Michael Fortin was at the heart of Hollywood’s golden age of streaming. The actor and aerial cinematographer turned his hobby of flying drones into a profitable business in 2012 just as the streaming wars were taking off. For a decade, he was flying high above film sets, creating sleek aerial shots for movies and TV shows on Netflix, Amazon and Disney. Now he’s on the verge of becoming homeless - again. He was evicted from the Huntington Beach home he shared with his wife and two young children and now is being booted from the Las Vegas apartment they moved to because they could no longer afford to live in Southern California. “We were saving to buy a house, we had money, we had done things the right way,” he says. “Two years ago, I didn't worry about going out to dinner with my wife and kids and spending 200 bucks." “Now I worry about going out and spending $5 on a value meal at McDonald's.” For over a decade, business was booming in Hollywood, with studios battling to catch up to new companies like Netflix and Hulu. But the good times ground to a halt in May 2023, when Hollywood’s writers went on strike. The strikes lasted multiple months and marked the first time since the 1960s that both writers and actors joined forces - effectively shutting down Hollywood production. But rather than roaring back, in the one year since the strikes ended, production has fizzled. Projects have been cancelled and production was cut across the city as jobs have dried up, with layoffs at many studios - most recently at Paramount. It had a second round of layoffs this week, as the storied movie company moves to cut 15% of its workforce ahead of a merger with the production company Skydance. Unemployment in film and TV in the United States was at 12.5% in August, but many think those numbers are actually much higher, because many film workers either do not file for unemployment benefits because they’re not eligible or they’ve exhausted those benefits after months of not working. As a whole, the number of US productions during the second quarter of 2024 was down about 40% compared to the same period in 2022. Globally, there was a 20% decline over that period, according to ProdPro, which tracks TV and film productions. That means fewer new movies and binge-worthy shows for us. But experts say the streaming boom wasn’t sustainable. And studios are trying to figure out how to be profitable in a new world when people don’t pay for cable TV funded by commercials. “The air has come out of the content bubble,” says Matthew Belloni, the founder of Puck News, which covers the entertainment industry. “Crisis is a good word. I try not to be alarmist, but crisis is what people are feeling.” Part of the boom was fuelled by Wall Street, where tech giants like Netflix saw record growth and studios, like Paramount, saw their share prices soar for adding their own streaming service offers. “It caused an overheating of the content market. There were 600 scripted live action series airing just a few years ago and then the stock market stopped rewarding that,” Mr Belloni says. “Netflix crashed – all the other companies crashed. Netflix has since recovered – but the others are really struggling to get to profitability.” And along with the streaming bubble bursting, some productions are also being lured away from California by attractive tax incentives in other states and countries. Los Angeles leaders are so concerned about the slowdown that Mayor Karen Bass created a task force last month to consider new incentives for film production in Hollywood. “The entertainment industry is critical to the economic vitality of the Los Angeles region,” Bass said announcing the plan, explaining it is a “cornerstone” of the city’s economy and supplies hundreds of thousands of jobs. Recent data shows the entertainment industry contributes over $115bn (£86bn) annually to the region's economy, with an employment base of over 681,000 people, the mayor said. The writers' and actors' strikes lasted for months and resulted in union contracts that offer more money and protections against artificial intelligence. Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the chief negotiator with the Screen Actors Guild union, told the BBC that some consolidation in Hollywood was inevitable. He says he is optimistic that production will be ramping up soon. “What makes these companies special, what gives them their unique ability to create value is their relationship with creative talent,” he said while visiting a picket line outside a Disney office in September, where video game voice actors are currently on strike fighting for similar protections. Hollywood “always thinks it’s in crisis,” he says. “It is a town that constantly faces technological innovation - all kinds of change - which is part of the magic. Part of keeping content fresh is everyone having the idea that things don't always have to be the way they've been.” Mr Fortin’s drone company was operating nearly every day before the strikes. Now he’s flown the drones just 22 days in the year since the strikes ended. And as an actor - he often plays tough guys - he has worked just 10 days. He used to work as a background actor to get by, but the pay barely covers the gas money to get to Los Angeles from Las Vegas. “It was a great wave, and it crashed,” Mr Fortin said after a day flying his drones on the AppleTV+ show Platonic - his first gig with drones since April. “Things are coming in little by little,” he says in his van before driving back to Las Vegas for a court hearing to fight his eviction order. “Hollywood gave me everything,” he says. “But it feels like the industry has turned its back on lots of people, not just me.” President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris are due to visit badly-hit states on Wednesday. Economy, immigration, abortion and other top issues - here is where the two candidates stand. The tiny vessel was found at Avon Beach in Christchurch in 2022 after being launched in the US.

Title: Super Micro: Assessing the Potential Risk and Reward

Time Published: 2024-09-28T20:43:18Z
Full Content:
Super Micro Computer (SMCI) got off to an incredible start this year as shares more than quadrupled from January to mid-March. This surge made Super Micro eligible for S&P 500 inclusion, with the technology hardware stock (with links to AI) being added to the index on March 18, 2024. In hindsight, that would have been a great time to take profits or Short the stock, as shares are down by more than 50% since then. One of the major developments has been the report by Hindenburg Research, which contained worrying allegations about the company’s financial reporting. In assessing those allegations along with Super Micro’s fundamentals I hold a neutral rating on the stock. The Hindenburg report is actually the main reason I am neutral instead of bullish on SMCI stock, and I believe it has caused hesitancy among many AI stock analysts and investors. The accusations are pretty straightforward. According to Hindenburg, Super Micro engaged in accounting manipulation which included “sibling self-dealing and evading sanctions”. Anyone who thinks this sounds far fetched may wish to remember that the SEC charged Super Micro with widespread accounting violations in August 2020. Hindenburg’s report also argued that most of the people involved with that accounting malpractice are back on Super Micro’s team. Hindenburg’s team interviewed several Super Micro salespeople and employees when compiling their report. It doesn’t help that Super Micro delayed its 10-K filing to assess internal controls shortly after Hindenburg went public with its concerns. While this might simply be a coincidence, the timing is worrisome. Looking back several years, Super Micro had failed to file financial statements in 2018 and was briefly delisted from the Nasdaq as a result. Near the beginning of this month, Super Micro publicly issued a denial of the accusations, with CEO Charles Liang hitting back, stating that Hindenburg’s report contained, “misleading presentations of information”. Super Micro hasn’t provided any additional statements since then. Super Micro’s status as part of the fast moving world of AI is one of the few reasons that I am neutral instead of bearish SMCI stock. The exciting prospects for the company’s business and the serious nature of the Hindenburg allegations basically offset each other. It’s hard to know what’s real and what’s false here, but most people concede that the AI industry as a whole offers compelling growth prospects. Nvidia (NVDA) has been posting triple-digit year-over-year revenue growth for several quarters. Other tech giants have incorporated artificial intelligence into their core businesses and delivered impressive results for their shareholders. For instance, Alphabet (GOOGL) saw its cloud revenue rise by 28.8% year-over-year as many businesses rushed to create their own AI tools. The artificial intelligence industry is also projected to maintain a 19.3% compounded annual growth rate from now until 2034, according to Precedence Research. The AI industry should continue to grow, and that should lift Super Micro. The company should benefit from Nvidia’s growth, which is why the company posted exceptional revenue and net income growth during Nvidia’s ascent. That’s what we saw for several quarters. We just don’t know how accurate all the numbers were, if the allegations targeting the firm have merit. While it’s impossible to overlook Hindenburg’s allegations against Super Micro, it’s still worthwhile assessing the company’s previous quarterly results. Shares were dropping even before Hindenburg released its report. While in March 2024 I argued that SMCI stock faced risks, I felt that shares presented a tremendous buying opportunity in late-summer, until Hindenburg muddied that optimism. For its last reported quarter, Super Micro posted net sales of $5.31 billion, representing a 143% year-over-year jump. Meanwhile, net income rose by 82% year-over-year, reaching $353 million. At the time of the release, my primary concern was Super Micro’s declining net profit margin. Super Micro currently trades at a 20x trailing P/E ratio, seemingly enough to compensate for any further erosion in profit margins. SMCI stock has a ridiculously low 13.6x forward P/E ratio, but with the recent speedbumps (the Hindenburg report and DOJ investigation) investors seems reluctant to bid the valuation multiple any higher right now. We don’t yet have tangible proof that Super Micro has engaged in any wrongdoing, as alleged by Hindenburg. Their report, however, has certainly cast a black eye on the stock. I expect that Super Micro would have significantly outperformed its fiscal 2023 results even excluding any misdealings. The Super Micro controversy added a new chapter on September 26, as news crossed the wires that the U.S. Department of Justice is now probing the company. SMCI stock tumbled an additional 12% on this news, and shares were recently trading at less than one-third of their all time high in March. There’s a high risk/reward on the shares at this point, but the elevated risks have relegated me to the sidelines with a neutral rating. Super Micro shares bounced back by more than 4% on Friday, September 27, suggesting that many investors believe that the long-term potential for the business is worth the heightened uncertainty. Although the ratings for this stock could change quickly, Super Micro currently has 2 Buy ratings, 10 Hold ratings, and 1 Sell rating from the 13 analysts that cover the stock. The average price target for SMCI is $613.92, which implies potential upside of nearly 50%. Again though, it’s quite possible that several research brokerages have placed their SMCI ratings under review. SMCI stock does have a few low price targets including $454, $375 and $325 from CFRA, Wells Fargo (WFC), and Susquehanna respectively. All of these price targets were established before the DOJ probe was announced, so even they could drop lower. There’s an old adage that suggests, “You either die a hero or live long enough to be the villain”. That quote seems apropos for this company. Super Micro earned many investors hefty profits during its rise above a stock price of $1,000 per share. Those who entered the story late, including after SMCI stock was added to the S&P 500, have not fared well. Many investors are sitting on significant losses right now. Depending on what those investors do, it’s hard to tell how much more downside Super Micro shares may have until more clarity on the ordeals is available. If the company’s recent financials are accurate, SMCI shares look quite attractive here. Shares can surge quickly if the Hindenburg report loses relevance, although that outcome difficult to predict. I’m a big fan of Super Micro’s industry and business potential related to AI, which prevents me from being downright bearish. I have a neutral stance here. Meanwhile, I don’t expect shares of SMCI to rebound above $460 (the approximate price prior to news of the DOJ probe) without any resolution to the two main threats to shareholder value.

September 28, 2024 15:40 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike faced intense scrutiny on Capitol Hill on September 24 as lawmakers demanded answers for a catastrophic software update that crippled essential services across the nation. Hagens Berman urges CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD) investors who suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: Nov. 29, 2023 – July 29, 2024Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Sept. 30, 2024Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/CRWD Contact the Firm Now: CRWD@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mark Green (R-Tenn.) castigated the company's CEO, George Kurtz, for evading direct testimony and dispatching a subordinate to address the crisis. “This was a systemic failure with far-reaching consequences,” Green declared, “and we cannot let it happen again.” Adam Meyers, CrowdStrike’s senior vice president, offered a mea culpa for the incident, attributing the widespread outage to a faulty configuration update that caused a "Blue Screen of Death" on millions of Windows devices. However, his apology fell short of assuaging lawmakers' concerns. Congress’ interrogation of CrowdStrike comes on the heels of a September 12 report by SEMAFOR, wherein former CrowdStrike employees painted a picture of a company culture that prioritized speed over quality. Multiple sources described a workplace where mistakes were commonplace, and workers were often undertrained. One former manager even recalled warnings about the potential for catastrophic failures if the company continued to release untested products Securities Class Action Against CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (CRWD): The outage has also sparked litigation against CrowdStrike, with plaintiffs alleging that the company misled investors about the reliability of its flagship Falcon Sensor product. The complaint accuses CrowdStrike of failing to disclose significant risks associated with its update process and of downplaying the potential consequences of a major outage. The truth began to emerge on July 19, 2024, when CrowdStrike issued an automatic update for its flagship Falcon Sensor security product which contained a bug and caused a massive overnight outage that affected 8.5 million Windows computers around the world, disrupting businesses, airports, train stations, banks, broadcasters, and the healthcare sector. Many affected machines were unable to restart, instead showing a blue error screen sometimes called “the blue screen of death.” Then, on July 29, 2024, news outlets reported that one of CrowdStrike’s customers (Delta Airlines) which suffered more than 6,000 flight cancellations hired a prominent attorney to seek damages caused by the faulty update. These events have driven the price of CrowdStrike shares down nearly 16% since the outage.

Title: How to Create AI Images: A Complete Guide With Expert Advice
URL: https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/how-to-create-ai-images-a-complete-guide-with-expert-advice/
Time Published: 2024-09-28T16:30:00Z
Full Content:
Here's what to know about creating AI-generated imagery, including the best programs, practical tips and legal considerations. AI image generators open up a world of creative possibilities. A picture is worth a thousand words. But with generative AI, you'll need to start with words to get that image. Generative artificial intelligence tech has exploded in the past few years, leading to a lot of creative services that can generate entire images and video clips. That's the "generative" aspect of gen AI -- it can produce content seemingly from just a simple text prompt. Of course, the actual process is more complicated. AI image generators rely on a database of existing content (text, images, videos, etc.), and/or scrape the open web for information to create new images to fulfill your request. They allow anyone with an account and a prompt to create almost any kind of image (usually within reason). There are a lot of AI image services available, but not all will deliver quality results or adequately protect your data. They also vary in price and features offered. While AI generators can be exciting to explore, getting started can quickly feel overwhelming. That's where this guide comes in handy. I've tested and reviewed multiple AI image generators for CNET and covered how the new tech affects digital creators. These services are certainly interesting and serve their purposes, but there’s a learning curve to them. While they're not good enough to replace human creators, they offer a range of creative possibilities. Here's how you can create custom AI images. I've had hands-on experience with many AI image generators and creative programs. The best program for you is going to depend on your project, budget and experience level. You can check out our full reviews and rankings, but these are my three program recommendations. CNET's Editor's Choice is Dall-E 3 by OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT. Dall-E boasts impressive prompt adherence, handling more complex prompts with ease. Its conversational flow -- meaning you can follow up easily by typing in the chat window -- allows for easy post-generation editing. Dall-E is also one of the more creative programs we've tested. You'll need a ChatGPT Plus account to access the program -- $20 per month -- and note that OpenAI may use your content for model training. But you can submit a request for it to stop training on your data. If you're looking for a free program, I recommend Leonardo AI. Canva recently acquired it, but you can still use it on its website. Leonardo offers a robust free plan, with more editing tools behind its paywall, and several artistic styles to choose from. It also provides a unique prompt improvement tool, which can take a simple idea and rewrite it, filling in details that make for beautiful end results. If you're really balling on a budget and have no creative experience, check out Canva's Magic Media generator. It's extremely intuitive and easy to navigate, which is great for beginners and non-creatives. Canva offers you 50 free credits for image generation (those are lifetime credits -- you'll have to upgrade for more credits on the paid Pro plan after using up your free tier allowance) and automatically opts you out of training its AI on your content. Once you've picked your program, create an account and make your way to the prompt window. Your best chance of success starts with a well-written prompt. Every prompt should include the basics of the characters, the setting, other elements and the image's dimensions. But to really hone in on the image you want, add descriptions of the artistic style you're looking to mimic, the aesthetic, vibe and specific colors. Leonardo might not understand a prompt that asks for "cottage core coastal grandma," but it does understand "rustic feel with blues and warm light." AI image generators rightfully have limitations around what you can generate. This is to prevent people from abusing these services to create illegal content and potentially dangerous or offensive content. For example, Dall-E 3 will decline to generate images that request public figures by name, like President Biden or Taylor Swift. Be sure to check out your service's safety policies before generating. Prompt engineering -- the process of writing the right prompt to get your desired results -- is something you get better at with practice. It also varies between each image generator. Canva, for example, tends to do better with simple prompts, whereas Dall-E encourages longer, more detailed prompts. Playing around with your program is the best way to get to know it. You can also check out my complete guide to image prompt engineering for more tips and tricks. Once you've got your best prompt, go ahead and generate! Even with the best generator, you're likely need to edit your images after they're created. Depending on the service you use, you may have access to editing tools or the ability to request changes. Be wary of over-editing your images. I've found that services can only handle so many changes before the image becomes too wonky, and ultimately unusable. Take this image I made in Midjourney as a cautionary tale of what happens when you over-edit. Sometimes it's best to start anew. Post-generation editing tools are one area where AI services tend to shine or fall flat. If your service doesn't offer them (or they don't work very well), try editing your prompt rather than the picture. In my experience, that's going to give you better odds of success rather than trying to incrementally edit existing images. It's extremely important to label your images as AI-created content. As AI image services improve, it's essential that all creators clearly identify the origins of an image, especially to distinguish it from human-created art and photography. In the bottom left corner, Meta AI watermarks all its AI-generated images. Some services automatically add a watermark or other marking indicating it's AI-generated, but too many don't, like Dall-E, Adobe Firefly, Midjourney, Canva and Leonardo. If you're sharing your image online, make sure to include the AI service you used in the caption, credit and/or alt text. You can also add a disclaimer to your posts if you're sharing on social media -- Meta might flag them as containing AI content on Instagram and Facebook, but adding a line to your caption will help ensure there isn't any confusion. As of publication, the use of AI image generators is legal. But there are important legal and ethical considerations you should be aware of when creating AI images. Here are a couple of quick frequently asked questions. AI image services like Midjourney and Dall-E rely on existing content to help them create pictures. This content, either in a database or on the open web, is typically created by humans. As such, some creators and artists have major concerns about how these programs are designed and trained. That's led to uproar in the industry and a couple of notable lawsuits, including an ongoing case against Stable Diffusion, an AI model used by popular generators. If you're worried about using a service that might potentially mistreat creators, pick one that clearly discloses how it trains its model. Some AI services rely on public databases, like Adobe Stock and Getty Images, where creators sign agreements with the companies to enter their work into those collections for specific uses. Adobe Firefly, for example, says it only uses content from its Adobe Stock public databases and images whose copyrights have expired. It also won't train on your content. As these AI services evolve, the legalities and ethics around them are poised to change as well. If you're going to be a regular AI art creator, make sure you stay up to date with the latest requirements, which we'll cover in our AI Atlas guide.

Title: BMO maintains Outperform rating on Costco stock, citing strong customer trends

Full Content:
On Friday, BMO Capital adjusted its outlook on Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), raising the stock's price target from $950.00 to $980.00. The firm has maintained an Outperform rating for the retailer. The revision follows Costco's reported earnings for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2024, which showed strong performance indicators, including better-than-expected gross margin percentages and comparable sales. The company's recent earnings report highlighted a robust increase in global customer traffic, up by 6%, with a significant 11-12% rise on a two-year stack basis. The strong performance metrics have led to an above-average growth in earnings per share (EPS) for the fiscal year 2024. Despite this growth, BMO Capital projects a more conservative EPS growth rate in the coming years, taking into account Costco's pattern of reinvesting market funds incrementally (MFI) increases. Costco's momentum in E-commerce was also a notable point in the analysis by BMO Capital. The retailer's continued expansion in the digital space is seen as a positive driver of its business model. While acknowledging that the company's valuation has reached new heights, the firm still finds Costco's stock attractive, citing the slightly higher EPS revisions as a basis for the increased price target. The analyst from BMO Capital highlighted the company's solid underlying financials in the fourth fiscal quarter, which surpassed the firm's forecasts. The statement underscored the strength in gross margins and comparable sales, which contributed to the positive outlook. "We continue to be encouraged by COST's momentum in Ecommerce growth and while valuation has expanded to new highs, COST remains attractive in our view," said the analyst from BMO Capital. With the new price target set at $980, BMO Capital's stance reflects confidence in Costco's ongoing growth trajectory and its ability to maintain a strong position in the market. The firm's analysis suggests a belief in the retailer's strategic investments and its potential for sustained financial success. In other recent news, Costco Wholesale reported mixed results in its fourth-quarter earnings, with earnings per share (EPS) of $5.29 surpassing both Goldman Sachs and consensus estimates, but falling slightly short on its revenue target of $79.70 billion. Despite the slight miss, same-store sales witnessed a 6.9% increase, exceeding the anticipated 6.4%. In response to potential disruptions due to a possible strike at U.S. ports, Costco's CEO, Ron Vachris, outlined extensive contingency plans. The company's recent performance has led to varied reactions from analyst firms. Baird maintains an Outperform rating on Costco with a price target of $975, highlighting the company's strong comparable sales momentum and healthy membership key performance indicators. However, Roth/MKM, DA Davidson, and Citi have maintained a Neutral stance, while Truist Securities, Redburn-Atlantic have expressed valuation concerns, downgrading or maintaining neutral stances on the company's shares. Goldman Sachs remains optimistic, maintaining a Buy rating and raising the price target to $995. These are recent developments for Costco Wholesale. As BMO Capital raises its price target for Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), it's important to note some key financial metrics and insights that underscore the retailer's market position and valuation. According to InvestingPro data, Costco boasts a significant market capitalization of $399.64 billion, reflecting its substantial presence in the industry. The company's P/E ratio stands at a high 55.9, which, while indicative of investor confidence, also points to a premium valuation relative to near-term earnings growth. This is further emphasized by a PEG ratio of 2.86, suggesting that the market may be pricing in optimistic growth expectations. Costco's revenue growth remains healthy, with a 7.75% increase over the last twelve months as of Q3 2024, and a gross profit margin of 12.5%, which, although solid, may be considered modest in comparison to some industry peers. It's also noteworthy that Costco has maintained dividend payments for 21 consecutive years, with a recent dividend yield of 0.51% and a 13.73% dividend growth in the same period. This consistent return to shareholders reflects the company's financial health and disciplined capital management. InvestingPro Tips highlight that while Costco is trading at high earnings and EBITDA valuation multiples, it holds more cash than debt, indicating a strong balance sheet. Additionally, the company's cash flows can sufficiently cover interest payments, providing further evidence of its financial stability. For those seeking more in-depth analysis, InvestingPro offers additional tips, with a total of 15 tips available that delve into Costco's performance and market valuation. Costco's strategic positioning as a prominent player in the Consumer Staples Distribution & Retail industry, combined with its strong return over the last year, suggests that the company is well-equipped to navigate market challenges and capitalize on growth opportunities.

September 28, 2024 08:07 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Sept. 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of Class A common stock of CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD) between November 29, 2023 and July 29, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important September 30, 2024 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased CrowdStrike Class A common stock during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the CrowdStrike class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=27534 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2024. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) CrowdStrike had instituted deficient controls in its procedures for updating its Falcon software platform, and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (2) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of the CrowdStrike’s customers; and (3) such outages could pose, and in fact ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to CrowdStrike. As a result of these materially false and misleading statements and omissions, CrowdStrike stock traded at artificially high prices during the Class Period. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the CrowdStrike class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=27534 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: Meta Debuts the Quest 3S, Its Cheapest Mixed-Reality Headset

Time Published: 2024-09-28T09:30:00Z
Full Content:
Meta announced several products at its Meta Connect 2024 event in California, but Quest 3S stood out for many reasons. It’s the company’s cheapest mixed-reality headset, featuring a similar chipset (Qualcomm’s Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2) and software functionalities as the older and pricier Meta Quest 3. Meta Quest 3S features a refreshed Meta Horizon OS that better supports 2D applications. Meta says the new OS will also deliver improved spatial audio and better Passthrough contrast and color. The new Quest 3S is compatible with all applications and games in the Meta Store. Also, the headset comes bundled with exclusive games (like Batman: Arkham Shadow) and Quest 3-specific performance updates. Despite sharing a similar form factor, the Quest 3S and Quest 3 have varying display quality, optical lenses, and camera setups. The new Quest 3S has its sensors and Fresnel lenses arranged in triangular clusters, while the Quest 3’s Pancake lenses and sensors have a pill-shaped setup. Additionally, Quest 3 has a better display (2,064 x 2,208 pixels per eye) and will provide more realistic graphics and sharper videos than the Quest 3S (1832 x 1920 pixels per eye). The Quest 3 remains Meta’s most powerful mixed-reality headset. However, the new Quest 3S doesn’t seem like a watered-down version, especially spec-wise. Quest 3S starts at $299.99 for the base (128GB) version and $399.99 for 256GB, while the 512GB version will retail for $499.99. Interested buyers can pre-order the Quest 3S from Meta’s website before it hits the shelves on October 15. In other news, the retail price for the 512GB Meta Quest 3 is dropping from $649.99 to $499.99. Meta is also discontinuing the Quest 2 and Quest Pro. The company says it’ll sell whatever’s left of both models through the end of 2024 or until they’re out of stock. According to Meta, the new Quest 3S will provide outstanding value “both for those new to VR and those looking to upgrade from Quest or Quest 2.

Title: ICYMI: the week's 7 biggest tech stories from the PS5 Pro preorders to Meta announcing its Orion AR glasses

Here's your firmware update for September 28, 2024 When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. What a week this was, folks. Meta Connect 2024 introduced us to a new VR headset, its first AR glasses prototype and slew of Meta AI upgrades – including an in-development skill to live dub Instagram reels. We also said hello to the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE, reviewed the new Legend of Zelda title, and prepared ourselves for heartbreak in 2025 with the arrival of The Last of Us season 2's first teaser trailer. In case you missed all that, we've rounded up all of these top tech news stories below so you can get up to speed on everything that happened in the last seven days. On Tuesday (September 24), Nothing unveiled its inaugural set of open-ear buds and TechRadar’s audio editor couldn’t help but share her initial thoughts. She’d already said she thought it was the best idea Nothing's had in ages (questionable ‘Ear Open’ moniker aside), and after slipping them on for a few hours, they didn’t disappoint. Ear Open are so very Nothing; their friendly praying mantis aesthetic is so very likeable. And just as the company's Nothing Ear (a) impressed for a competitive fee, these buds are likely to be a huge hit in the open-ear space. That's particularly true given that they cost just £129, ie. the same price as the flagship Nothing Ear (which means your US and Australian prices are almost certainly $149 / AU$249). Compare that to the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds, with their $299 / £299 / AU$449.95 price-point. See? Slip 'em on and they feel like nothing, too. The fit is excellent – even putting both on at the same time is a cinch. You get the trademark transparent-meets-monochrome-meets-titanium Nothing design language, plus on-ear pinch control, although there’s a knack to it now, purely because you need to locate where the old 'stem' idea is, to pinch. Oh, and the Advanced EQ setting? It's another level… We won't be surprised if not too many Nintendo fans are reading this, because right now they're probably all playing The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom. This highly anticipated entry in the long-running Nintendo franchise is something of a landmark, letting players explore Hyrule through the eyes of Princess Zelda for the first time. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. And the good news is that it's great. It combines elements from classic Zelda titles with a wealth of new mechanics for an adventure quite unlike anything that we’ve seen before. Tasked with closing sinister rifts that threaten the kingdom, you journey through a charming open-world and experiment with a suite of magical abilities. These let you create copies of certain objects whenever you need, which is just as fun as it sounds; a summoned bed might be good for a quick nap in isolation, but makes for the perfect bridge over a perilous chasm when multiplied and stacked. You can even spawn friendly versions of enemies to fight on your behalf. It’s all wrapped up in an adorable art direction, making everything from the characters to the world look like it was plucked straight from a cute diorama. Check out our review below. This week we were treated to our first new trailer for The Last of Us season 2, and we’re convinced it's going to be as emotionally devastating as the videogame it’s based on. Released as part of this year’s The Last of Us Day celebrations (September 26 is the day the Cordyceps infection ravaged the world of the game/show) we got both a two-minute S2 teaser and a confirmation that it’s coming sometime in 2025. The teaser gives us our first glimpse of characters players know from the games, including Abby and Ellie's love interest Dina, as well as providing hints at what Ellie and Joel have been up to following the 'five years of peace' that followed the events of season 1. Fans of the games know it’s not all sunshine and roses for the survivors, though, so we’re going to take these next few months to emotionally prepare ourselves for what The Last of Us has in store for us come 2025. Samsung launched the Galaxy S24 FE alongside the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra this week, and the new phone looks like it’ll prove the cheapest route into Samsung’s Galaxy AI ecosystem. Among the S24 FE’s hardware upgrades over the Galaxy S23 FE are a bigger 6.7-inch display, a new Exynos 2400e chipset, and longer battery life. But while that would be enough to make it a contender in the cheap flagship stakes, it's the phone's AI tricks that we're most excited about. Chief among them are its AI-powered ProVisual photography engine, which it inherits from the standard Galaxy S24 and which should bring improved low-light performance and optical zoom quality. In our hands-on Samsung Galaxy S24 FE review, we described Samsung’s new device as “a great value phone for its power and features,” so here’s hoping it lives up to that billing once we’ve put it through our full review process. 3. Meta’s affordable Meta Quest 3S broke cover The least surprising announcement of Meta Connect 2024 was nevertheless an exciting one – the much-leaked Meta Quest 3S. This affordable alternative to the Meta Quest 3 still packs a solid punch with its Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chipset, and 8GB of RAM, but only costs $299.99 / £289.99 / AU$499.99. In exchange you will have to accept a couple of downgrades – less sharp displays, a bulkier body, and the loss of the depth sensor – but by all accounts the Quest 3S is an impressive VR headset at its price, and looks like it could be perfect for people looking to dip their toes into XR as we head into the holiday season. We also saw Meta’s first fully functional AR glasses – the Orion prototypes. These aren’t something anyone will be able to buy (though some are being given out as developer kits to help software creators make apps for the official specs), but from what we’ve been shown Orion looks amazing. And it’s only set to get better, with Mark Zuckerberg promising the consumer pair will boast better displays, a more fashionable design, and a more affordable price. Although on that last point, Meta’s CTO Andrew Bosworth later clarified that Meta meant affordable in terms of smartphone and laptops rather than at “a Quest 3S price point, or even a Quest 3 price point.” It suddenly feels rather like 2020 all over again. That's because pre-orders for the forthcoming PS5 Pro and the limited-edition PS5 30th Anniversary Collection went on sale this week – with predictable results. Such as? Well, such as the official PlayStation Direct website quickly being inundated with would-be buyers all eager to get their hands on Sony’s upcoming consoles and kit. Many had to wait in digital queues for upwards of an hour, just to be in with a chance of pre-ordering the mid-gen refresh, and there were reports of crashes and timeouts and (inevitably) scalpers. Most PlayStation Direct stock sold out completely that same day; the 30th Anniversary Edition bundle was gone in minutes across the US and UK, while the limited-edition PS5 Slim, DualSense Edge and PlayStation Portal models were quick to follow. Some stock still held on, however, and at the time of writing, Sony’s website still has PS5 Pro units available to pre-order.

Title: Grayscale’s Bullish Forecast: The Top 20 Crypto To Watch In Q4
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/grayscales-bullish-forecast-the-top-20-crypto-to-watch-in-q4/
Time Published: 2024-09-28T05:00:30Z
Full Content:
Crypto asset manager Grayscale has published an in-depth report outlining sectors poised for bullish growth in the final quarter of the year amid a notable recovery in the cryptocurrency market, particularly for major players such as Bitcoin (BTC) and various altcoins, which have reached price levels not seen in over two months. In its Thursday report, Grayscale updated its Crypto Sectors Indexes, showcasing emerging themes within the digital asset industry. Key trends include the rise of decentralized artificial intelligence (AI) platforms, efforts to tokenize traditional assets, and the growing popularity of memecoins. Notably, Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency sector have outperformed other market segments in 2024, likely due to the successful launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) in the US earlier this year and favorable macroeconomic conditions following the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) interest rate cut on 18 September. While gaining 13% this year, Ethereum has underperformed Bitcoin but still surpassed many other cryptocurrencies. Grayscale’s Crypto Sectors Market Index (CSMI) has seen a slight decline of about 1% year-to-date, with the Smart Contract Platforms Crypto Sector Index down approximately 11%, making Ethereum’s performance relatively stronger than its peers. Despite its challenges, the asset manager finds that Ethereum remains the Smart Contract Platforms sector leader, boasting the highest number of applications, developers, and fee revenue. In producing its quarterly Top 20 list of cryptocurrencies, Grayscale thoroughly analyzes hundreds of digital assets. This list represents a diversified selection of assets with high potential for the upcoming quarter. Among those highlighted by the firm are standout performers such as Sui (SUI), Bittensor (TAO), Optimism (OP), Helium (HNT), Celo (CELO) and the UMA Protocol (UMA). However, below is the full list with other assets beyond these to which Grayscale pays particular attention. Sui, a third-generation blockchain created by former Meta engineers, has made waves following a recent network upgrade that enhanced its transaction speed by 80%, surpassing Solana’s capabilities. Optimism, an Ethereum Layer 2 solution, plays a critical role in scaling the Ethereum network. It has developed a framework called the “Superchain,” which is utilized by platforms like Coinbase’s Layer 2 BASE. Celo and UMA are capitalizing on unique trends, with Celo focusing on stablecoin use and payment solutions in developing regions, particularly in Africa. The platform recently surpassed Tron in stablecoin usage, while UMA serves as an oracle network for decentralized applications like Polymarket. Helium’s inclusion in the Top 20 reflects Grayscale’s preference for category leaders with sustainable revenue models. The project has established itself as a leader in decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), growing its network to over one million hotspots and generating significant fee revenues. Bittensor, which focuses on the intersection of AI and crypto, has recently gained recognition within Grayscale’s framework due to improvements in market structure, offering a decentralized platform for AI innovation. In this quarter’s adjustments, Grayscale has rotated out several assets, including Render, Mantle, ThorChain, Pendle, Illuvium, and Raydium. While Grayscale sees value in these projects, the revised Top 20 list aims to offer more compelling risk-adjusted returns for investors in the coming months. At the time of writing, the biggest winner across all time frames in Grayscale’s top 20 list is Bittensor’s TAO token, which has seen gains of 86% over the fourteen-day time frame and a substantial 841% year-to-date, resulting in a current trading price of $536.

In a recent move, Berkshire Hathaway Inc . (NYSE:BRKa) has sold a significant portion of its shares in Bank of America Corp (NYSE:NYSE:BAC). The transaction, which took place over a series of days, resulted in the sale of over $460 million worth of Bank of America stock. The shares were sold at prices ranging from $39.2728 to $39.5226. The sale began on September 25, 2024, with 2,305,415 shares sold at a weighted average price of $39.2728. The selling continued on September 26, with an additional 5,457,825 shares sold at an average price of $39.4641. The final day of sales, September 27, saw 3,915,126 shares sold at a weighted average price of $39.5226. The transactions were disclosed in a recent SEC filing by Berkshire Hathaway, which is led by the renowned investor Warren E. Buffett. Following these transactions, Berkshire Hathaway's remaining holdings in Bank of America amount to 802,668,860 shares. The sales represent a significant divestment but indicate that Berkshire Hathaway still maintains a substantial stake in the financial institution. Investors and market watchers closely monitor the investment moves of Berkshire Hathaway, particularly those involving large stakes in major corporations like Bank of America. The company's investment decisions, often seen as a signal of Buffett's confidence in the market and specific companies, are followed as indicators of broader market trends. The SEC filing included footnotes detailing the price ranges of the shares sold and affirmed the company's commitment to providing full information on the number of shares sold at each separate price within the stated range upon request. Additionally, the footnotes clarified the ownership nature of the shares, indicating that the shares are indirectly owned by Berkshire Hathaway through its subsidiaries. The recent transactions underscore the dynamic nature of Berkshire Hathaway's investment strategy and its ongoing management of a diverse portfolio. As of the latest filing, the exact reasons behind the sales or future investment strategies regarding Bank of America remain undisclosed. In other recent news, Bank of America's CFO, Alastair Borthwick, expressed optimism about the Federal Reserve's efforts in tackling inflation, following a significant reduction in interest rates.

Deutsche Bank upgraded Bank of America's stock from Hold to Buy, citing potential for revenue growth, while Piper Sandler maintained a neutral rating. Berkshire Hathaway, led by Warren Buffett, has continued to reduce its stake in Bank of America, selling shares worth nearly $7 billion since mid-July. Despite this, Berkshire remains the bank's largest shareholder. A recent Federal Reserve decision to cut interest rates is anticipated to alleviate the financial burden on borrowers and lower deposit costs for banks, potentially reducing loan default risks. This development has been welcomed by the banking sector. Furthermore, BofA Securities initiated coverage of BrainBees Solutions Ltd, commonly known as FirstCry, with a Buy rating and a target price of $770, citing strong growth outlook in the Indian mother and baby care market.

According to InvestingPro data, Bank of America boasts a market capitalization of $306.66 billion, underlining its position as a major player in the industry. The bank's P/E ratio of 13.78 suggests that it may be reasonably valued compared to its peers. This valuation metric, coupled with the bank's price-to-book ratio of 1.14, indicates that investors are not paying an excessive premium for the company's assets. InvestingPro Tips highlight Bank of America's commitment to shareholder returns. The company has raised its dividend for 10 consecutive years and has maintained dividend payments for an impressive 54 consecutive years. This consistent dividend policy aligns with Berkshire Hathaway's preference for companies that provide steady returns to shareholders. Despite Berkshire's recent stock sale, Bank of America's financial health appears robust. The company has been profitable over the last twelve months, with analysts predicting continued profitability this year. This positive outlook is supported by the bank's operating income margin of 31.39% for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024. It's worth noting that InvestingPro offers additional insights, with 7 more tips available for Bank of America.

From disinformation campaigns to soaring skepticism, plummeting trust and economic slumps, the global media landscape has been hit with blow after blow. World News Day, taking place on Saturday with the support of hundreds of organizations including AFP, aims to raise awareness about the challenges endangering the hard-pressed industry. In 2022, UNESCO warned that "the business model of the news media is broken". Advertising revenue -- the lifeline of news publications -- has dried up in recent years, with internet giants such as Google and Facebook owner Meta soaking up half of that spending, the report said. Meta, Amazon and Google's parent company Alphabet alone account for 44 percent of global ad spend, while only 25 percent goes to traditional media organisations, according to a study by the World Advertising Research Center. Platforms like Facebook "are now explicitly deprioritising news and political content", the Reuters Institute's 2024 Digital News Report pointed out. Traffic from social to news sites has sharply declined as a result, causing a drop in revenue. Few are keen to pay for news. Only 17 percent of people polled across 20 wealthy countries said they had online news subscriptions in 2023. Such trends, leading to rising costs, have resulted in "layoffs, closures, and other cuts" in media organizations around the world, the study found. Public trust in the media has increasingly eroded in recent years. Only four in 10 respondents said they trusted news most of the time, the Reuters Institute reported. Meanwhile, young people are relying more on influencers and content creators than newspapers to stay informed. For them, video is king, with the study citing the influence of TikTok and YouTube stars such as American Vitus Spehar and Frenchman Hugo Travers, known for his channel HugoDecrypte. The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has renewed concerns about disinformation -- rife on social platforms -- as the tool can generate convincing text and images. In the United States, partisan websites masquerading as media outlets now outnumber American newspaper sites, the research group NewsGuard, which tracks misinformation, said in June. "Pink slime" outlets -- politically motivated websites that present themselves as independent local news outlets -- are largely powered by AI. This appears to be an effort to sway political beliefs ahead of the US election. As part of a national crackdown on disinformation, Brazil's Supreme Court suspended access to Elon Musk's X, formerly known as Twitter. The court accused the social media platform of refusing to remove accounts charged with spreading fake news, and flouting other judicial rulings. "Eradicating disinformation seems impossible, but things can be implemented," Reporters Without Borders (RSF) editorial director Anne Bocande told AFP. Platforms can bolster regulation and create news reliability indicators, like RSF's Journalism Trust Initiative, Bocande said. AI has pushed news media into unchartered territory. US streaming platform Peacock introduced AI-generated custom match reports during the Paris Olympics this year, read with the voice of sports commentator Al Michaels -- fuelling fears AI could replace journalists. Despite these concerns, German media giant Axel Springer has decided to bet on AI while refocusing on its core news activities. At its roster, which includes Politico, the Bild tabloid, Business Insider and Die Welt daily, AI will focus on menial production tasks so journalists can dedicate their time to reporting and securing scoops. In a bid to profit from the technology's rise, the German publisher as well as The Associated Press and The Financial Times signed content partnerships with start-up OpenAI. But the Microsoft-backed firm is also caught in a major lawsuit with The New York Times over copyright violations. With journalists frequently jailed, killed and attacked worldwide, "repression is a major issue," said RSF's Bocande. A total of 584 journalists are languishing behind bars because of their work -- with China, Belarus and Myanmar the world's most prolific jailers of reporters. The war in Gaza sparked by Palestinian militant group Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel has already left a "terrible" mark on press freedom, Bocande added. More than 130 journalists have been killed by Israeli airstrikes since October 7, 2023, including 32 while "in the exercise of their duties". She said a "quiet repression" campaign is underway in countries around the world, including in democracies -- with investigative journalism hampered by fresh laws on national security.

It's partly a lack of trust, partly an attempt to avoid the endless toxic, depression-inducing stream of bad news, war crimes, moral panics, activist demands, nudge unit manipulation, propaganda and geopolitical posturing, laced with threats of an imminent climate apocalypse and nuclear war. fake news - bad times? good for us. tired from your lies. It takes money to do real journalism as opposed to hosting Russian/Chinese disinformation. When the corporate controlled media in cahoots with the government are the ones propagating the misinformation. No wonder the legacy media is quickly becoming passe. And their response is to double down and try to control us even more.

Given the evident bias in media reporting, such as calling Argentina’s Milei “far-right”, and prefixing any report of something Trump says with “falsely claimed”, or “without evidence”, I am less likely to pay for the current media options than ever. I am the one who decides (for me) what is false, evidence, and “far-right”, or loony left. This is why we have juries to judge people when they are out on trial for alleged crimes - not just turned over to some faceless body that shall decide.

Title: Everything Meta Announced At Connect 2024
URL: https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-connect-2024-everything-announced/
Time Published: 2024-09-27T21:26:54Z
Full Content:
Meta announced so much at its Connect 2024 conference that you may have missed some of it. But never fear! Here's a brief summary of every important Meta Connect 2024 announcement. For full context and details, read the articles linked. Meta launched a new headset, simplified its Quest 3 lineup, discontinued Quest 2 and Quest Pro, and launched new official accessories. After months of leaks, Meta finally announced its new headset: Quest 3S. Effectively, Quest 3S is a cheaper Quest 3 with a bulkier design, inferior lens clarity, and lower resolution. Quest 3S has the same Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chipset and color passthrough mixed reality capabilities as Quest 3, but uses the old fresnel lenses and fixed single panel from Quest 2 to achieve a starting price of $300. All purchases of Quest 3S until May will come with Batman: Arkham Shadow. Meta is discontinuing the 128GB base model of Quest 3 and cutting the other 512GB model to its $500 price. Until stock is gone, the 128GB model is on clearance sale for $430. Like with Quest 3S, all purchases of Quest 3 until May will come with Batman: Arkham Shadow. Quest 2 and Quest Pro will no longer be available when stock runs out or at the end of the year, whichever comes first. Quest 2 was the first mainstream VR headset and Quest Pro was an innovative failure. Quest 3S will take Quest 2's place in Meta's lineup. But there's no direct replacement for Quest Pro. When it's gone, Meta will no longer offer a headset with eye tracking or face tracking. One aspect of Quest Pro that Meta will offer a replacement for is its open periphery design, because it's releasing an official Open Facial Interface for Quest 3. Instead of being a halo strap, the official Open Facial Interface still presses against your face. But the space between the interface and the headset itself is empty, allowing you to see the real world. Quest 3S is getting its own exclusive facial interface accessory. The "Breathable" Facial Interface makes the tradeoff of not being opaque to "help you keep cool while working out or playing intense games". You can now buy the Logitech MX Ink tracked stylus for Quest headsets. Logitech MX Ink is designed for both 2D drawing on a physical surface via its pressure-sensitive tip and for 3D creativity via full 6DoF positional tracking (via the headset cameras), multiple buttons, and a haptic feedback actuator. When Quest 2, Quest Pro, and the 128GB Quest 3 are gone, Meta's headset lineup will be: Official YouTube cowatching will finally launch as a beta next week. YouTube cowatching will take place in Horizon Home, meaning you'll see other people as their Meta Avatar alongside you. Quest 3 owners in the US can try photorealistic scenes via Meta's new Horizon Hyperscape demo app. UploadVR's Don Hopper tried Horizon Hyperscape and found it to be significantly higher quality than Gracia, with a "stark difference" in visual clarity. Amazon launched an all-new Prime Video Quest app that supports passthrough and downloads. Prime Video is the first major streaming service officially available on Horizon OS to support downloads, making it ideal for use on airplanes with the Travel Mode Quest headsets now have since May. Quest headsets will be able to extend Windows 11 laptops by just looking at them, without installing any software, later this year. Meta says this will be possible thanks to a partnership with Microsoft. Your laptop's screen will turn off and be replaced by a giant virtual screen, and you'll be able to spawn entirely virtual extra monitors. The new Meta Avatars system with overhauled graphics will launch on Tuesday. And some time next year, Meta will allow users to generate a new outfit by typing, leveraging generative AI. In Horizon Worlds, Meta says it will also support "fantastical avatars", non-human forms which users can unlock in specific worlds. In a surprise announcement, Meta revealed that it will give developers access to the passthrough cameras of Quest headsets via a new API next year. Meta hasn't yet said whether there'll be any restrictions to the Passthrough API, but we'll keep a close eye on the company for any further details of this exciting upcoming capability, which could unlock entirely new use cases for Quest headsets. Meta says Horizon Worlds creators will be able to add AI NPCs to their worlds next year. These AI NPCs will be able to "engage in conversations, help people out, and even compete in games". Meta teased "the future of Horizon OS", showing a concept of a complete redesign. Meta didn't give even a rough timeline for the new Horizon OS interface, and what was shown appears to be a concept. Triangle Strategy, a turn-based tactical RPG from Square Enix, is being adapted for VR this year on Quest. On Quest, Triangle Strategy's VR adaptation promises a "whole new look" across the battlefield, letting you reach out to units and issue commands directly. Home Sports is a new mixed reality multi-sports game that rolls five sports into one collection on Quest 3. An exact release date remains unconfirmed. Resolution states Home Sports "will be launching soon" for the Meta Quest 3 family. Supernatural Together is a new expansion that adds group-based workouts to the fitness app on Quest. Team Workouts feature special Challenge Zones and Victory Tunnels that "require teamwork and coordination to complete." Meta Horizon Store, the app store on Quest headsets, will allow developers to submit 2D Android apps. Meta will be hoping this brings some of the most useful and entertaining apps from the Google Play Store. However, the lack of Google Play Services will make it challenging for some apps to be ported. Meta Spatial SDK lets developers easily build apps for Quest's Horizon OS with traditional mobile development tools, without a game engine. It provides rendering, optional passthrough, controller and hand tracking, support for flatscreen and immersive media playback, physics, and spatial audio. The Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses are getting a swathe of new software features, as well as new transitions lenses styles. The following features are coming "soon": And these features are coming "later this year": Further, EssilorLuxottica and Meta launched new style options with Transitions lenses: Meta showed off integrated prototype AR glasses with a field of view that's remarkable given their form factor. However, the Orion glasses won't be sold as a product, as Meta admitted each costs on the order of $10,000 to produce. The company said Orion will be used as a demonstrator and internal development kit, describing it as "a time machine that lets us live in the future".

Title: 20 Geopolitical Events with Highest Impact on S&P 500
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-geopolitical-events-highest-impact-211037361.html

In this article, we will look at the 20 geopolitical events with highest impact on S&P 500. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, go directly to the 5 Geopolitical Events with Highest Impact on S&P 500. The geopolitical events impact the financial markets across the world depending on the nature of the event. The assassination attempt on former US President Donald J. Trump is the latest geopolitical event investors have had to grapple with in recent years, alongside two major wars including Russia-Ukraine and ongoing Israel’s aggression on Gaza. Wars have far-reaching effects such as an impact on financial markets, in addition to enormous human toll. Geopolitics events that affect the economy drastically caution investors to look for safe haven investments or be out of the market until the situation comes to normal. According to JP Morgan Private Bank’s recent client survey, 34% of the investors were potentially worried about geopolitical risks, while 29% of investors were bothered by potential recession fears in 2024. Whereas, almost 90% of the geopolitical events have not changed the direction of the world economy, as per Citigroup Inc.’s Global Wealth Report 2024. Geopolitical events mostly have short-term impacts on global asset prices. However, World War II and the 1973 OPEC Oil Embargo had the gravest impact on the financial markets. The 1973 oil shock did have a lasting impact on equity returns. During the first 90 days, the S&P 500 plunged by nearly 13.04%, the highest among geopolitical events since 1940. The oil supply was limited for an extended period, leading to a macro state of ‘stagflation.’ In simple terms, high oil prices essentially stopped the economy from operating efficiently in the 1970s. On the other side, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine shocked global energy markets in 2022. However, additional oil supply limited the economic and market impact compared to its 1970s counterpart. Today, the US has a more secure oil supply compared to its heavy reliance on the Middle East. In recent times, the rising conflicts in the Middle East and the Russia-Ukraine war have had major consequences. The US has been aiding Ukraine and Israel with military assistance. According to the US State Department, the US government has provided more than $55.7 billion in military assistance to Ukraine to fight against Russian invasion since the war began in February 2022. Whereas, the US government has supported Israel through legislation providing at least $12.5 billion in military aid, as of April 2024. It has been a see-saw year for the global economies. The intensified conflict in the Middle East may impact oil prices with a potential disruption in regional supply. As of September 23, oil prices have been high as the conflicts soar, and due to last week's outsized US interest rate cut expectations. As reported by Reuters, Yeap Jun Rong, the market strategist at IG International, said: “Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East have edged up a notch between Israel and Hezbollah, which could leave oil prices well-supported on the risks of a wider regional conflict." Brent crude futures for November were up $0.60, or 0.8% at $75.09 per barrel, while the US crude futures for November were up $0.64, or 0.9%, at $71.64, as of September 23. In addition, both oil benchmarks soared over 4% last week due to the US rate cut, weaker demand sentiment in top oil importer China is capping the upswing, reported Reuters.

Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is one of the leading American multinationals in the oil and gas sector. The company engages in the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas both domestically and internationally. Exxon Mobil Corporation recently signed a MOU with an EV maker SK On. The oil and gas company has agreed to provide 100,000 metric tons of MobilTMLithium from its first planned project in Arkansas. This deal will help ExxonMobil’s goal of supplying lithium for almost 1 million EV batteries annually by 2030 and support the build-out of a US EV supply chain. For the second quarter of 2024, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) surpassed earnings estimates, reporting an EPS of $2.14, up by 6.51% compared to anticipated earnings of $2.02 per share. Exxon Mobil posted $9.2 billion in earnings, making its second-best Q2 performance in the past decade. The company achieved this feat following record production in Guyana and the Permian Basin, where the output reached 1.2 million barrels per day. The company’s revenue came in at $93.06 billion, exceeding estimated revenue of $89.68 billion. Alongside strong operational results, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) gave back $9.5 billion to shareholders, including $4.3 billion in dividends. XOM has more than 40 years of consistent dividend growth and averaged a 2.20% yield over the past five years. In addition, Exxon Mobil plans to invest between $20 billion and $25 billion annually in capital expenditures through 2027. With strong hedge fund sentiment, XOM is one of the 10 Best Affordable Stocks To Buy Right Now. Hedge fund interest in Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) soared from 81 in Q1 2024 to 92 in Q2 2024. Madison Dividend Income Fund pointed out regarding XOM in the Q1 2024 investor letter: “Our thesis on XOM is that it will grow production volumes of oil and gas moderately over the next few years, while limiting excessive capital investment that plagued the industry from 2014-2020. Production growth will come from its 2023 acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources, which is the largest producer in the Permian basin. XOM plans to double its Permian output by 2027, to 2 million barrels per day. Capital spending will be limited to $20-25 billion per yearthrough 2027, which should allow for significant amounts of cash to be returned to shareholders including a $35 billion share repurchase program and continued dividend increases. Higher oil prices would provide a tailwind to our thesis but are not necessary. We think XOM can grow earnings and cash flow if oil prices remain above $60 per barrel…” (Click here to read the full text) While we acknowledge the potential of XOM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

You are here: Influencer Marketing Hub » Social Media » 6 Best Paid Social Marketing Campaigns to Pay Attention to Sure, the great thing about social media marketing is that it’s essentially free. However, social media networks’ impressive targeting capabilities and wealth of campaign data make them ideal for running paid ads. Plus, when you combine influencer marketing and paid social, you can maximize the reach and impact of your campaigns further. Here are campaign examples of how some of the leading brands have leveraged paid social marketing, along with actionable advice to generate the same level of results. Top Paid Social Media Marketing Examples:1. JBL2. Oscar Mayer3. Lidl 4. Volkswagen5. Warner Bros.6. PricelineHow Can Brands Create Better Paid Social Marketing Campaigns?Key TakeawaysFrequently Asked Questions For an example of how to combine paid social with influencer marketing and use a disruptive product message, there’s JBL’s JBLiens Ear-n-vasion campaign which ran in December 2023. Apple has been dominating the true wireless stereo (TWS) market since 2020 and JBL needed to use an unconventional way to cancel the noise that Apple was making. JBL’s products focus on customization, allowing users to express their individualism and be their authentic selves. To communicate their focus on individualism, JBL worked with Nick Kosir (aka The Dancing Weatherman) who shared sightings of JBLiens, easily observable by their “ear-dividuality” as breaking news. A post shared by Nick Kosir (@nickkosir) They also worked with Flyana Boss, an American hip hop duo with nearly half a million YouTube subscribers. In addition to YouTube and Instagram, they also used TikTok. Katie A. Raymond, Director of Strategy, Content, Social Media and Paid Media at HARMAN International, JBL’s parent company, sums up the campaign’s success in a LinkedIn post as follows: “The campaign’s success was measured in how it drove the business, and also by the conversations it started, the community it built, and the path-to-purchase traffic it drove.” “The campaign’s success was measured in how it drove the business, and also by the conversations it started, the community it built, and the path-to-purchase traffic it drove.” Oscar Mayer, a Kraft Heinz brand that sells meat and cold cuts, brought home the bacon with the #OscarTakeMeToProm campaign. It’s a great example of how to combine: As part of their marketing efforts, Oscar Mayer uses an iconic wienermobile that gets driven around by their brand ambassadors across America. Each year, they receive several requests for rides in their wiener-on-wheels. These requests typically come from students. Oscar Mayer However, social listening revealed that teens thought that the Wienermobile would make a pretty cool ride to the prom. Oscar Mayer then turned to their group of brand ambassadors to create and share content via their official Oscar Mayer social accounts. Using paid and organic efforts, they launched a UGC contest on Instagram and TikTok. The campaign did exceptionally well on Instagram. It generated a 65% increase in reach on Instagram, while the content’s engagement rate exceeded the platform’s benchmarks more than 170%. For an example of how to use social media for a holiday campaign, there’s Lidl GB’s multi-channel Christmas activation. The discount retailer chain released a spoof of East 17’s only number-one single, “Stay Another Day”. The campaign parodies both the song and original music video. One of the reasons why this paid social campaign works is because the spoof also features Tony Mortimer, one of the English pop band’s original members. As Coolr, the social media agency behind this campaign, explains in their “Save Another Way (...the Lidl Way)” case study, his inclusion works on two levels. It improves the sense of familiarity among viewers as well as adds a type of endorsement. It also works because it combines social good marketing. Aside from promoting their rewards app, Lidl GB also donated £100,000 to NSPCC’s Childline service. The campaign was run on: It was particularly successful on TikTok and Instagram where it generated nearly 68 million impressions. To maximize reach and awareness on TikTok, the agency used the premium TopView placement on TikTok. The judges of the Global Social Media Awards commended it for its “social-first approach”. The content was created with social media in mind from the start. For example, the full, 4-minute music video was uploaded onto YouTube, while a shorter version was shared on TikTok, known for short-form video content. Plus, this way they could also encourage users who watched the short version on TikTok to go to YouTube to watch the longer version. The short version on TikTok generated nearly 1 million clicks to YouTube. PHD, one of the globe’s media agencies with the most awards (which includes being named Adweek’s Global Media Agency of the Year), created this campaign for Volkswagen to help them launch their new ID. Buzz. Electric vehicles might be quiet, but the market is noisy. With Volkswagen boasting only a 4.2% share in terms of unit sales, it needed a special force to create a buzz. To do this, they partnered with Disney and Star Wars to connect the automotive brand strategically with these iconic cultural elements. The social strategy used familiar and beloved characters like C-3PO, R2D2, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Ewan McGregor to improve electric vehicle consideration. McGregor also happens to have loved the VW brand since a kid and owns a couple of VW buses, elevating him to a level of brand ambassador. The strategy was adjusted for each social channel. For example, Meta was reserved for video-only campaigns using the platform’s available video placements. On TikTok, the agency could be slightly more playful. Here, they created a Star Wars community for fans. As two major brands were working together on this campaign and each had their own marketing agency, a solution was needed to collaborate without confidential info getting shared. The Force Is Strong, United! case study shared on The World Media Group’s website, explains how they created a Data Clean Room directly in PHD’s planning tool. This way, they could optimize all digital bidding strategies. Using an AI-powered automated process, data could be compared so that bids across both campaigns could be matched to prevent mutual high-bidding effects. The Warner Bros. Discovery’s “Did we do ‘Kenough’” campaign is another example of how the agency PHD UK used paid social effectively. PHD Linkedin post The strategy included: As a case study of this award-winning campaign explains, the challenge of this campaign was to change the movie’s perception. Unlike the actual dolls, the movie’s plot didn’t have the same target audience. As the movie had a broader appeal, it made PHD UK’s keyword audience strategy so much more effective. That said, while the plot tackled more serious topics like feminism, the agency found more than “kenough” room to add elements of playfulness. Plus, it also helped to set it apart from Oppenheimer, Barbie the Movie’s summer release competition sharing the same release date. To do this, all communication touchpoints had to place the movie and its trademark pink into pop culture and be positive. The Drum Like Volkswagen, Priceline also worked with a TV star, Kaley Cuoco, best known for her roles in The Big Bang Theory and The Flight Attendant, for their social media campaign. This way, they could also leverage the Emmy-nominated actress’ huge following on social media. In the ads created as a series of funny episodes, Kaley encourages her coworkers to book their dream vacation by using Priceline’s affordable travel options. As incentive, more than $5 million in hidden, interactive deals were made available exclusively via social ads, making the campaign a great example of how to add an element of gamification. MIRIMAR If that were not enough to grab attention, each episode features an original theme song. This theme song was also released on streaming platforms. In addition to streaming platforms and social media takeovers on Meta, TikTok, and YouTube, they also used audio and podcast ads. Combine these deals with the original music and travelers were given multiple reasons to break into song. In addition to illustrating the benefit of using elements like music and gamification, this campaign also highlights the importance of target audience research. A survey commissioned by Priceline revealed that 76% of US workers are happier when they travel, yet more than 50% identify price as a reason for not traveling. With this data, they could ensure that the core messaging of their campaign offers a solution to their target audience’s pain point. These 6 award-winning paid social marketing campaigns highlight a few tips that brands and their marketing teams can use. Here’s what they teach us: Understanding your target audience is crucial, even more so when you’re running a paid campaign. Social media platforms have exceptional audience targeting capabilities, but to use it properly you need to know and understand your audience. For example, in the case of the campaign for Barbie’s movie release, segmenting audiences based on demographics like age was essential. The movie was, in fact, aimed at teens and women, not tweens like the doll. Demographics, though, are only one criteria. The campaign created for Priceline illustrates how knowing your audience’s pain points are crucial too. You might know who your target audience is, but you can always get to understand them better. Plus, needs and interests change which can impact your campaign’s approach. In the case of Priceline, a simple survey already revealed key information regarding travelers’ pain points, but you can also use more robust audience research tools like: Depending on your budget, you can incorporate influencer-generated content. According to The Influencer Marketing Factory, 90% of influencer marketing campaigns include paid media. This way, you can add that element of trust and validation which are important to social media users. Another benefit is that you grow your reach. Your ads will grab the attention of the influencer’s followers too. You don’t necessarily need to use the likes of Ewan McGregor or Penny from The Big Bang Theory. In fact, our Influencer Marketing Benchmark Report 2024 found that mega/celebrity influencers are used least often. Only 12.9% of brands plan to use mega influencers in 2024, compared to 44% that plan to use mostly nano-influencers. Influencer Preferences Cost isn’t the only reason. Nano and micro-influencers in some instances have higher engagement rates. This is especially true if you plan on using Instagram or TikTok. Data shared by Captiv8 with EMARKETER reveals that Instagram influencers with fewer than 10,000 followers have the highest engagement rate at 6.23%. On TikTok, the picture looks similar. Here, nano-influencers also have the highest engagement rate, according to Statista’s numbers. Engagement rate of TikTok influencers worldwide What is essential when selecting influencers is that target audiences must align with the influencer’s followers. Ideally, there should also be a link between the influencer’s own interests and that of your product. In the case of Volkswagen’s campaign, the fact that Ewan McGregor is a longtime Volkswagen driver, helps to create that trust and validation that makes this form of marketing so effective. Crafting successful social ad campaigns requires more than just a budget and creativity. By leveraging analytics tools, you can gain profound insights into your target audience, ensuring your content resonates and engages effectively. Prioritizing social-first content tailored to each platform's unique environment can significantly boost your campaign's performance. For example, on TikTok and Instagram videos designed for mobile viewing are a must. And, if your budget allows it, combine your paid social efforts with influencer marketing. It can amplify your reach and credibility, making your social media ads more impactful. Facebook is considered one of the best social media platforms for paid advertising. It has advanced audience targeting features, various ad formats, and allows for different campaign objectives such as awareness, traffic, engagement, leads, app promotion, and sales. What’s more, Facebook is the most-used social media platform worldwide, offering a large and diverse audience for brands to reach.

Title: From Land Grabbers to Carbon Cowboys: A New Scramble for Community Lands Takes Off
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/land-grabbers-carbon-cowboys/5868860
Time Published: 2024-09-27T18:04:13Z
Full Content:
In a recent interview with the New York Times, billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates was asked if there were types of projects that he would not invest in to offset his greenhouse gas emissions. “I don’t plant trees,” he replied, adding that planting trees to deal with the climate crisis was complete nonsense. “I mean, are we the science people, or are we the idiots? Which one do we want to be?”[1] Microsoft, the company he built his fortune on and, according to insiders, still actively advises, sees it differently. In June 2024, the tech giant bought 8 million carbon credits from the Timberland Investment Group (TIG), a fund owned by the Brazilian agribusiness lender BTG Pactual.[2] TIG is raising US$1 billion to buy and convert pasture lands to large-scale eucalyptus plantations across the Southern Cone of Latin America.[3] As these trees grow, they draw carbon from the atmosphere and store it in their roots, trunks and branches. TIG will estimate the amount of carbon removed and then sell it as carbon credits to Microsoft and other corporations. Each carbon credit that Microsoft buys from TIG is supposed to offset one tonne of the emissions Microsoft generates burning fossil fuels. This is one of the main ways that Microsoft and many other companies are planning on getting to “net zero” emissions, while still burning fossil fuels. Microsoft’s deal with TIG, reportedly the largest “carbon dioxide removal credit transaction” in history, is just one of many investments Microsoft is making in tree plantations as a way to offset its emissions.[4] The Dutch agribusiness lender Rabobank is another source of carbon credits for the tech company. It too is acquiring land in Brazil for tree plantations, in this instance with a local agribusiness family with a track record of illegal deforestation and fraud.[5] But most of the carbon credits Rabobank sells to Microsoft are from its programme to plant trees on the lands of small coffee and cacao growers in Latin America, Africa and Asia. This programme, called Acorn, uses satellites and a Microsoft digital platform to measure the number and size of shade trees that small farmers plant on their farms and then calculate the carbon they’ve removed from the atmosphere. It then sells the carbon to Microsoft as “carbon credits” for about US$38 a piece, taking a 20% cut for itself and its local partner, and paying farmers what’s left of the proceeds.[6] A big problem with Rabobank’s scheme, identified in an investigation of its project with cacao farmers in Côte d’Ivoire, is that it is vastly overestimating the carbon removed — in this case by 600%![7] What’s more, the Côte d’Ivoire government says Rabobank is likely double dipping as its project overlaps with a World Bank-funded scheme that has already generated and sold carbon credits from trees planted on small cacao farms in the same area. All of this “nonsense”, as Gates calls it, has not stopped an increasing number of corporations, governments and billionaires — not to mention a new industry of climate consultants and carbon brokers — from promoting the idea that emissions from fossil fuels can and should be offset by planting trees or other crops that sequester carbon. Such projects have a chequered history that goes back to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, but they really only took off after the 2016 Paris Climate Agreement, when governments endorsed the notion of offsets and carbon markets as an effective means to get corporations to cut their emissions.[8] Today, most offset projects are in the so-called “voluntary market”, where private companies from the global North manage the certification and sale of carbon credits to corporations that want to show they are taking action to deal with climate change. The projects, largely in the global South, can be for anything from the distribution of clean cook stoves in Malawi to the preservation of rainforests in Indonesia. The premise is that the project either prevents emissions that would have occurred without it, or that it leads to the removal of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. Cook stoves and rainforest preservation are examples of emissions avoidance. Planting trees, on the other hand, is the most popular form of removal. In a 2024 study, the World Rainforest Movement (WRM) says that the number of tree planting projects for carbon credits has tripled over the past three years.[9] WRM says the surge is partly driven by the large number of high-profile scandals in emissions avoidance schemes, known as “REDD+”.[10] Numerous projects to preserve forests have been withdrawn or suspended from carbon markets after investigations showed they were based on implausible stories about the threat of deforestation or that they caused human rights violations and other harms to local communities. As a result, WRM says corporations are turning their attention to tree planting as a source of “high-integrity” carbon credits. This is now spawning a mad rush to secure lands where trees can be planted. Activists and scientists have been warning for years that schemes to offset carbon emissions by planting trees or other crops would lead to a surge in land grabbing, especially in the global South.[11] These warnings are now proving true. GRAIN combed through the various registries of carbon offset projects to try and get a better sense of this new land grab and how it is unfolding. We identified 279 large-scale tree and crop planting projects for carbon credits that corporations have initiated since 2016 in the global South. They cover over 9.1 million hectares of land — an area roughly the size of Portugal. (See Box 1: What’s included and what’s not included in the land deal dataset) The deals (view the dataset here) add up to a massive new form of land grabbing that will only increase conflicts and pressures over land that are still simmering from the last global land grab spree that erupted in 2007-8 in the wake of global food and financial crises. They also signify that new sources of money are now flowing into the coffers of companies specialised in taking lands from communities in the South to enrich and serve corporations, mainly in the North. Box 1: What’s included and what’s not included in the land deal dataset What’s in? Our data covers projects from all the major voluntary offset project registries. These are: American Carbon Registry (ACR), Climate Action Reserve (CAR), Gold Standard (GS), Verra (VCS), BioCarbono (BC), Cercarbono (CV) and Plan Vivo (PV). It also includes cases on the website farmlandgrab.org that are not yet found in the registries. The projects in our dataset are limited to projects that: – involve the large-scale planting of crops and/or tree species on a combined area of land over 100 ha for the purpose of producing carbon credits; – are driven by companies from outside the communities; – were initiated since 2016 and up to 31 March 2024 (roughly post-Paris Agreement); and – are located in the global South. The projects involve either 1) the creation of large-scale plantations or 2) contract production with small farmers. But all the projects bind the use of the land to the terms of the project for 20 years or more. What’s not in? REDD+ projects, which aim to avoid deforestation, are not included. Some types of projects that produce carbon credits through tree planting or agriculture on large areas of land are not included either. These are: – projects to manage pasture lands, which affect the access to lands and traditional practices of pastoralists; – projects to restore or create mangroves, where large areas of coastline are taken over for the planting of mangrove trees; and, – projects which generate carbon credits by enrolling farmers to implement agricultural practices that are said to build up carbon in the soils, often called “carbon farming”. These projects are extremely important and can have equally severe impacts on communities, including land grabbing, but they are not covered here to keep the dataset manageable.[12] Our data also does not cover projects located in the global North, such as in New Zealand, Scotland and Australia, where national schemes that endorse tree planting for carbon offsets have led to a displacement in food production and undermined farmers’ access to land.[13] To date, 52 countries in the global South have been targeted by these projects. Half the projects are in just four countries: China, India, Brazil and Colombia, which are developing their own industries of carbon project developers. But projects in these countries account for less than a third of the total land area involved. The most affected region, in terms of land area, is Africa, with projects covering over 5.2 million hectares.[14] Many of the projects involve land deals to set up giant eucalyptus, acacia or bamboo plantations. Typically, these are pasture lands or savannahs that were used until now by local communities for grazing livestock or growing food. . . The money that investors plan to capture from these deals is immense. The projects we pulled from the Verra and Gold Standard registries alone will generate 2.5 billion carbon credits (1 credit = 1 tonne of CO2 removed) over their lifetime. With an average price of about US$10 per credit, that adds up to a potential bounty of US$25 billion.[15] While these projects are exclusively set up in rural areas with extremely low emissions per capita, it is quite the opposite when it comes to the companies orchestrating the projects. With the exception of what’s happening in India and China, most carbon projects are led by foreign companies in rich countries with atrocious emissions records — such as the Netherlands, the US, Singapore, Switzerland, the UK, France, Germany and the UAE.[16] There is a clear colonial dynamic at work, with companies and big NGOs from the North once again using the lands of communities in the global South for their own agendas and their own benefit. . GRAIN and UChicago Data Science Institute (click here for better resolution) . A good number of actors driving this new wave of land grabs are in fact repeat offenders from the global farmland grab that took off a decade and a half ago. This is especially the case in Africa. (See Box 3: Africa’s land grabbers are back in business) There are also several companies from the forestry sector with histories of land grabbing and conflicts with local communities. Much of the vast eucalyptus plantations of Brazilian paper giant Suzano, for example, which is involved in three large-scale carbon plantation projects, have been grabbed from Brazil’s indigenous and traditional peoples.[17] And a non-negligible number of project developers have records of illegal dealings and financial scandal. They include: The money being hustled by these carbon cowboys comes mainly from the world’s most polluting corporations, who are interested in buying carbon credits to greenwash their emissions. At the top of the list of credit buyers are fossil fuel companies (See Box 4: Tree planting for oil pumping). But there are also tech giants like Meta and Apple, food companies like Danone and Coca-Cola, and supermarket chains like Mercado Libre and Carrefour. Amazon and the philanthropic arms of its billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos, are heavily involved, too. Bezos both buys credits and funds the NGOs and companies running the plantations, through initiatives like the AFR100 fund, which aims to plant trees on 100 million hectares in Africa.[23] The same goes for development banks, like FMO of the Netherlands, the US International Development Finance Corporation or the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation, which provide cheap loans, political risk insurance and even equity investments to many carbon plantation companies. Box 2: Carbon colonialism On 15 April 2022, a group of about 150 farmers gathered outside the operations of Belgian supermarket Colruyt. Standing behind wheel barrows of soil, the farmers accused the company of “stealing lands” by buying up hundreds of hectares of the country’s scarce farmland, ironically as part of a campaign to buy local. “Each piece of land that Colruyt buys is a piece of land taken away from Belgian family farms,” they said.[24] Far away, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the supermarket chain is also acquiring land, but for decidedly not “local” reasons. In 2021, Colruyt got a 25-year, 10,656 ha concession in Kwango province — about 50 times the size of its Belgian farmlands. It plans to establish tree plantations to offset its emissions on these lands, which are currently used by local people for food crops, and to hire security guards to protect the trees from villagers and their “slash and burn” agriculture.[25] In neighbouring Uganda, the Swedish hamburger chain Max is also buying credits from a carbon plantation project, but with a different approach. Rather than displacing local farmers, it gets them to plant trees on their own lands. Participating farmers sign a contract stating that they will plant and maintain trees, get seedlings and a little training, and submit to periodic checks. In return, they get payments for the carbon credits bought by Max to offset its hamburgers. But when a team of journalists from the Swedish media site Aftonbladet visited the farmers in early 2024 they found a horror show.[26] The farmers said they had planted the trees as they were told, not knowing that these trees were offsetting a corporation’s pollution. Things started off fine, but the trees are fast growing and quickly started taking over their fields, sucking up all the sunlight, nutrients and water. The US$100 a year in payments from carbon credits did not cover the loss of food and income from their crops. Eight years into the project, the Swedish media crew found farmers starving — and some were chopping down the trees despite threats of prison for breach of contract by the project proponent. “I used to be something called a model farmer,” says Samuel Byarugaba, one of the farmers. “People came to me to learn about farming and I was proud to show our farm. We had enough food to feed ourselves and could sell the surplus. Now it’s all disappeared.” Corporations from the financial sector are also starting to get involved — a worrying sign that much more money could be mobilised. Rabobank and BTG Pactual are leading examples of financial players establishing specialised funds to invest in carbon plantations on behalf of pension funds, billionaires, sovereign wealth funds, university endowments, development banks and other institutional investors. Their investment in carbon plantations dovetails with the landholdings that many of these actors have already amassed through timber and farm land investments.[27] The Renewable Resources Group, for instance, is a US private equity firm whose investors include Goldman Sachs and the Harvard University endowment. It specialises in “monetising” water by buying up land in parts of the world where it can get access to cheap irrigation to produce high value crops for export, like grapes and berries. It has already acquired over 100,000 ha of agricultural lands in parts of Mexico, the US, Chile and Argentina where there are water scarcity issues.[28] Recently it established a “nature-based solutions” division through which it acquired the German-based private equity fund 12Tree. Since 2017, 12Tree has acquired 20,000 ha in Latin America and Africa to establish “regenerative” farms where it plants trees and generates carbon credits.[29] One big difference between earlier land grabs for food production and today’s land grab for carbon offsets is that the carbon deals are “certified”. Verra and Gold Standard, two of the top certifiers, are paid large sums of money to ensure that offset projects are done in consultation with local communities, avoid displacing them and even provide them with some benefits. It’s the kind of system that agencies like the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation and the World Bank have long claimed would solve the ills of the global farmland grab. Yet, our dataset and the growing number of investigations by academics, media and civil society into projects certified by these companies put the lie to such claims.[30] How could anyone expect that a market premised on acquiring lands from rural and indigenous communities in the global South, for the benefit of corporations in the global North, could amount to anything other than a massive land grab? No benefit-sharing mechanism, often baked into these carbon deals, alters that outcome. Box 3: Africa’s land grabbers are back in business The rush for land that followed the food and financial crises of 2007-8 hit Africa hard. Hundreds of communities were displaced from their lands to make way for large-scale industrial farms. Yet, even though many of these farms failed badly, the communities are still struggling to get back their lands.[31] Some culprits in that land rush (and near cousins) are now trying to get lands for carbon plantations. Below are some examples. Gagan Gupta: As President of agribusiness giant Olam International, this Singaporean businessman oversaw the company’s 300,000 ha land deal in Gabon in 2011 to build Africa’s largest oil palm plantation. The operation has been mired in conflicts with communities ever since. Now Gupta is running a UAE-based tree plantation company, Sequoia Plantation, which is in the process of securing 200,000 ha in Togo, Gabon and the Republic of the Congo for large-scale tree plantations with carbon offset components, despite protests from affected communities.[32] Kevin Godlington: This UK businessman orchestrated several failed large-scale land deals in Sierra Leone. One was an oil palm plantation in the District of Port Loko that cleared forest and displaced people from their lands before it went bankrupt. Undeterred, Godlington is now going after the same lands with a new venture listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange that claims to have lease rights to 57,000 ha to plant trees for carbon credits, some of which have already been bought by British Petroleum. As with the first round of land deals, no matter how things pan out, Godlington has already pocketed millions of dollars from the scheme.[33] Carter Coleman: This UK businessman built the infamous Kilombero Plantation Limited rice farm on 5,818 ha of contested community lands in the heart of Tanzania’s Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor. Despite heavy backing from foreign development banks and investors, it went bankrupt in 2019. Coleman is now back with a new company called Udzungwa Corridor Limited that will generate carbon credits by planting “rare tropical hardwoods” on a 7,500 ha stretch of land leased from local farmers along the Kilombero Nature Reserve.[34] Andrea Tozzi: This Italian businessman, CEO of his family’s company Tozzi Green, acquired 11,000 ha of land in three communes in the Ihorombe region of Madagascar in 2012 and 2018 to grow the biofuel crop jatropha. That project failed, and the company switched to growing maize for animal feed and essential oil crops. All the while the communities have been fighting to get their lands back, which they say they need to graze their cattle and grow food for their families. Tozzi is now trying to save his project by replacing the maize with plantations of acacia and eucalyptus for carbon credits — which communities, especially those in Ambatolahy, are still firmly resisting. [35] Karl Kirchmayer: This Austrian businessman, who spent years buying up 147,000 ha of farmlands in Eastern Europe, now has an African land grab venture, ASC Impact. It is partnering with a Senior Advisor to the President of Uganda and a Dubai businessman close to the royal family to sell 60 million tons of carbon credits to UAE companies from mangrove and tree plantation projects, mainly in Africa. ASC Impact is currently negotiating for 27,000 ha in Ethiopia, 25,000 in Angola and 270,000 in the Republic of the Congo! Frank Timis: This Romanian-Swiss businessman is the founder and majority shareholder of African Agriculture Holdings Inc, a US company listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange, that took over 25,000 ha of lands from a failed Italian company that local communities in Senegal have been fighting to get back for over a decade. His company is also responsible for the largest land deal in our database — a ridiculous pair of 49-year leases covering 2.2 million ha in Niger, where the company will produce carbon credits by planting pine trees. And while nine million hectares is already too much, things could get much worse. The UN climate negotiations are moving towards establishing an international carbon trading mechanism that would allow heavy polluting country governments and their companies to offset national emissions through deals for carbon projects in other countries, mainly in the global South.[36] If and when this happens, the value of carbon credits could surge, generating even higher demand for land to plant trees. Pressure is also coming from efforts to establish markets for biodiversity offsets, which will trigger a feeding frenzy among investors eager to make a buck from the territories of small farmers, indigenous peoples and pastoralists.[37] The idea that planting trees or other means of generating carbon credits can compensate for fossil fuels emissions is a dangerous distraction, incompatible with the real cuts to emissions that are required to deal with the climate crisis.[38] Consider, for instance, that even if the dubious emission removal estimates of the 279 projects in our dataset were true, they would only amount to 55 million tonnes of CO2 per year– not nearly enough to even cover last year’s 90 million tonne increase in global CO2 emissions from fossil fuels.[39] Social movements and organisations need to be relentless in exposing these contradictions, harms and frauds. We also need to get more information to the communities on the ground. They are often confused by what the project proponents tell them and not exposed about what other communities have experienced. They are almost never informed about how the projects are designed to enable big corporations to keep polluting and how this pollution is connected to the terrible impacts they are suffering from climate change. The hype about the money to be made, under the misnomer of benefit sharing, can create divisions within communities and draw some families into signing contracts they may soon regret. As all these carbon projects are premised on formal land ownership, they can also undermine community systems of land management. There are already cases where communities have faced violence and intimidation for resisting carbon offset projects and this is only going to escalate. It is therefore becoming increasingly urgent to share information and experiences about the carbon grabs – locally, nationally, regionally and internationally — so we can put a stop to them. The double threat to communities – both from climate change itself and from these criminal solutions to it — should not be allowed to play out. Box 4: Tree planting for oil pumping In September 2023, the oil company Shell shocked carbon markets when it abruptly cancelled plans to plant trees on 12 million hectares of land by 2030 – an area three times the size of its home country, the Netherlands.[40] There wasn’t much to celebrate, however, as the company also scrapped plans to reduce oil production.[41]It’s not clear if Shell was backing out entirely from the carbon offset industry, either. Shell still owns a controlling stake in a Dutch biodiesel company seeking to generate carbon credits by planting pongamia on 120,000 ha in Paraguay. Shell’s European cohorts have not yet lost their enthusiasm for carbon plantations. Italy’s Eni has a biofuel venture pursuing carbon credits in Kenya contracting farmers to grow croton plants on an initial 40,000 ha. British Petroleum (BP) paid Canada’s Carbon Done Right US$2.5 million earlier this year for carbon credits from a 57,000 ha tree plantation project the company is pursuing in Sierra Leone. And the French oil company TotalEnergies has a massive 38,000 ha acacia plantation project to offset its emissions in the Republic of the Congo. Investigations into all three projects point to severe impacts on local farmers.[42] Two of Japan’s top energy firms are also deep into carbon offset plantations. Marubeni has a 31,000 ha pine and eucalyptus plantation project in Angola with an Argentinian businessman.[43] Mitsui, through its Australian subsidiary New Forests, is erecting tree plantations for carbon credits on leased farmlands in northern Tasmania and, through its African Forestry Impact Platform, it recently acquired Green Resources AS, “a Norwegian plantation forestry and carbon credit company notorious for its history of land grabbing, human rights violations, and environmental destruction across Uganda, Mozambique, and Tanzania”.[44] * Click the share button below to email/forward this article to your friends and colleagues.

Title: Dell says sales team must work on-site 5 days a week to drive productivity
URL: https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/09/dell-says-sales-team-must-work-on-site-5-days-a-week-to-drive-productivity/

"... sales teams are more productive when onsite." Most members of Dell’s sales team will no longer have the option to work remotely, starting on Monday, Reuters reported this week, citing an internal memo. The policy applies to salespeople worldwide and is aimed at helping “grow skills,” per the note. Like the rest of Dell's workforce, Dell's salespeople have previously been allowed to work remotely two days per week. A memo, which a Reddit user claims to have posted online (The Register reported that the post “mirrors” one that it viewed separately), says that field sellers aren’t required to go into an office but “should prioritize time spent in person with customers and partners.” The policy doesn’t apply to “remote sales team members,” but Dell said to expect additional unspecified communications regarding remote workers “in the coming weeks.” Bloomberg reported that top sales executives Bill Scannell, Dell’s president of global sales and customer operations, and John Byrne, president of sales and global regions at Dell Tech Select, signed the memo, saying: … our data showed that sales teams are more productive when onsite. Dell is viewing mandatory on-site work as a way to maintain its sales team’s culture and drive growth, according to the memo, which mentions things like “real-time feedback” and “dynamic" office energy. Moving forward, remote work will be permitted as an exception, Dell said. Notably, the letter, which was reportedly sent to workers on Thursday, doesn’t give employees much time for adjustments. The memo acknowledges that workers have built schedules around working from home regularly but doesn’t offer immediate solutions. In a statement to The Register, a Dell spokesperson confirmed the policy change. “We continually evolve our business so we’re set up to deliver the best innovation, value and service to our customers and partners," they said. "That includes more in-person connection to drive market leadership." After permitting full-time remote work in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in February, Dell started requiring workers to go into the office 39 days per quarter (or about three days per week) or be totally remote. The latter, however, seemed discouraged, as Dell reportedly told remote workers they were ineligible for promotions in March. Still, nearly 50 percent of Dell workers chose to stay remote, Business Insider reported in June, citing internal Dell Data. Dell’s return-to-office (RTO) mandates have reportedly been enforced with VPN and badge tracking. Some employees have accused Dell of trying to reduce headcount with RTO policies. Other companies pushing workers back into offices have also been accused of this; there’s research showing that at least some companies have used RTO policies to lower headcount while avoiding layoffs. Dell laid off 13,000 people in 2023 and plans more layoffs. In August, it announced plans to lay off an undisclosed additional number of people. The company is expected to have 120,000 employees. Dell’s RTO change follows an announcement this week requiring Amazon employees to work on-site five days a week starting next year. Following the announcement, a survey of 2,585 US Amazon employees found that 73 percent of Amazon workers are “considering looking for an another job” in response. The memo, according to Reddit, acknowledges to workers, “Yes, this is a shift from current expectations.” Dell’s RTO push represents an about-face from previously stated positions on remote work from the company. In 2022, for example, CEO and founder Michael Dell wrote a blog that said Dell “found no meaningful differences” between remote and on-site workers, including before the pandemic. Dell COO Jeff Clarke made similar arguments in 2020. The idea that remote work hinders productivity has been a hot topic of debate, especially as companies grapple with their remote work policies following pandemic restrictions. Dell says that its decision to force sales workers back into offices is backed by data, and its claims of boosted productivity could potentially be true when it comes to this specific Dell division. However, there have also been studies suggesting that return-to-office mandates hurt productivity. For example, a Great Place to Work survey conducted in July 2023 of 4,400 employees concluded that “productivity was lower for both on-site and remote employees when their employer mandated where they work.” Workers with companies allowing employees to choose between remote and on-site work were more likely to give “extra effort," the survey found.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Most Active Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other active stocks. The economic landscape is currently marked by mixed signals. The Fed has indicated the potential for additional rate cuts due to weaknesses in the manufacturing sector, despite signs of recovery. While the overall economy remains strong, currency dynamics have shifted, with the US dollar weakening and the euro strengthening. Interest rate yields have fluctuated, suggesting potential changes in investor sentiment. Amidst this complex environment, the Dow continues to hover near record highs, reflecting cautious optimism among market participants. As stakeholders navigate these developments, they will need to carefully consider how they may influence investment strategies and market behavior in the coming months. CNBC's Rick Santelli recently covered this situation, which we talked about in our article on the 10 Best Performing Stocks in 2024. Here's an excerpt from it: “Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee has indicated that many more rate cuts may be necessary over the next year due to signs of weakness in the manufacturing sector. CNBC’s Rick Santelli, who was reporting on September 23, noted that while manufacturing has faced challenges, there are indications it might be recovering slightly, as evidenced by a recent production increase of 0.8%. He referenced comments.... that the economy is experiencing strong growth and robust consumer spending, which he believed contradicted the concerns raised by Goolsbee. Santelli pointed out that the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently at all-time highs, suggesting that market sentiment remains positive despite underlying economic weaknesses. Further discussing the economic landscape, he remarked on the currency markets, noting that the US dollar has fallen to its lowest level since March 2022. In contrast, the euro has reached its strongest level since April 2022. This shift in currency dynamics reflects broader economic trends...” However, a lot of analysts do not have an opinion as nuanced as that of Santelli. For instance, Michael Kantrowitz, Piper Sandler's chief investment strategist joined CNBC's 'Power Lunch' on September 23 to discuss why smaller businesses and consumers need the benefits from more rate cuts. In a conversation regarding the challenges facing US car manufacturers, it was noted that the biggest threat they encounter is the influx of Chinese automobiles into the US market. This concern contrasted with the insights from the President of the Bank of Chicago, who stated that ongoing rate cuts will continue to benefit smaller businesses and consumers who are currently adjusting to higher interest rates. Kantrowitz emphasized the significant impact that lower interest rates can have on the consumer economy, particularly given the substantial amount of debt tied to credit lines and credit cards. As adjustable-rate mortgages decrease, this easing of financial conditions is expected to be beneficial. Kantrowitz pointed out that before last week, financial conditions had been easing primarily for larger corporations, as evidenced by the S&P 500, which did not require a rate cut. However, small businesses and consumers, who are more closely tied to the prime rate set by banks, had not experienced similar relief until recently. The last report indicated that small businesses were paying an interest rate of 9.5% for 3-month borrowing. This recent easing represents a crucial first step for Main Street, although the strategist believes further cuts are necessary. He noted a broadening market trend following the July 11 CPI report, highlighting that commercial real estate has emerged as one of the best-performing sectors this quarter, alongside utilities and regional banks. However, it was emphasized that while rate cuts can benefit certain areas indirectly, such as those affected by lower tenure rates, they do not necessarily provide direct support. Looking ahead at interest rates, there was speculation about how low they might go in the next year. Kantrowitz suggested that policy rates could indeed fall into the 3% range but cautioned that markets might be overly aggressive in their expectations. The anticipated rise in unemployment will play a critical role in shaping equity and fixed-income markets; however, if unemployment increases at a slow and steady pace, as it has been, it may not pose significant challenges to market stability. Kantrowitz's opinion reflects a cautious optimism regarding economic conditions as stakeholders face uncertain conditions while keeping an eye on interest rates and their broader implications for various sectors within the economy. Methodology We sifted through Yahoo Finance's list of the most active stocks that are experiencing high trading volumes. We looked at the top 15 stocks to find the ones that were the most popular among elite hedge funds. We then narrowed down our list to the 10 stocks with high trading volumes and that were the most popular among hedge funds. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their trading volumes, as of September 23. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Volume: 120.458 million Average Volume (3-Month): 327.422 million Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 179 NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a technology company that designs, manufactures, and sells graphics processing units (GPUs), artificial intelligence (AI) chips, and other computing technologies. Its GPUs are widely used in gaming, professional visualization, and AI applications, and the company has been a pioneer in the field of GPU computing, with a significant role in the development of AI and deep learning. In FQ2 2025, the company's revenue was 122.40% from a year-ago period. Data center revenue was up 54% year-on-year, driven by strong demand for NVIDIA Hopper, GPU computing, and networking platforms. Cloud service providers contributed ~45% of data center revenue. Partnerships with healthcare institutions and increasing demand for AI-powered solutions in diagnostics have contributed to this strong financial performance. At its GPU Technology Conference earlier this year, the CEO estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion, with a potential total of $1-2 trillion over the next decade. The company won't dominate the entire market, but analysts estimate its market share between 2025 and 2029 will be over $950 billion. Elon Musk's AI startup, xAI, has brought Colossal, an AI training system, online. Powered by 100,000 H100 GPUs from NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Colossal is the most powerful AI training system in the world. Musk plans to double the size of Colossal by shifting to H200 GPUs in the coming months. Blackwell chips, which are even faster and more efficient, could further enhance Colossal's capabilities. The company faces pressure to launch new products to maintain investor confidence. Delays in Blackwell chip production and concerns about high GPU prices impact demand. The company's future success depends on effective AI monetization. By the end of fiscal year 2025, it aims to achieve 100% renewable electricity for its offices and data centers. Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA’s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock’s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia’s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today’s accelerated computing infrastructure.” Overall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the most active stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

WeightWatchers (WW) International said Friday that CEO Sima Sistani is stepping down immediately. She will be replaced by Tara Comonte, a board member and the former CEO of Shake Shack (SHAK), who was appointed as interim chief executive effective immediately. Sistani leaves the parent company of the once popular points-based weight loss program as it faces challenges in adapting to the growing popularity of weight loss drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound. “On behalf of the Board, I want to sincerely thank Sima for her leadership in advancing our strategy, for adding WeightWatchers Clinic to our offerings and for her unwavering commitment to our mission,” Thilo Semmelbauer, chairman of the WeightWatchers board of directors, said in a statement. “We wish her all the best in her future endeavors.” Sistani joined WeightWatchers in 2022 and led the company for about two-and-a-half years. Under her leadership, WeightWatcher acquired the the telehealth platform Sequence and started offering its members the highly-coveted weight loss drugs. But the bet hasn’t seemed to pay off yet. WeightWatchers stock is down more than 90% since the beginning of the year. In August, Sistani revealed that the struggling company would cut $100 million in costs over the next year by streamlining its operations and reducing its workforce, including a 40% cut in positions at the vice president level and above. The news comes at a time when a class of weight loss dugs known GLP-1 treatments have been putting pressure on WeightWatchers. These drugs, which mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar, have shown remarkable effectiveness in treating obesity and type 2 diabetes. Market leaders Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY), the pharmaceutical giants behind popular GLP-1 drugs Wegovy and Zepbound, respectively, have seen their stock prices soar as a result. Novo Nordisk stock has climbed 39% over the past 12 months, while Eli Lilly shares have surged 68%. Media mogul Oprah Winfrey, who has acknowledged taking weight loss drugs, left her spot on the WeightWatchers board earlier this year. She had been a member of the board since 2015. At the time, Winfrey said she was donating all her WeightWatchers shares to the National Museum of African American History and Culture. WeightWatchers said it supported Winfrey’s decision, which it added would “eliminate any perceived conflict of interest around her taking weight loss medications.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: What fueled this week’s record-breaking stock rally | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: The stock market is racking up record highs again. Investors are wasting no time moving into riskier assets from bitcoin to tech stocks after last week’s long-awaited rate cut from the Federal Reserve. Last week, the S&P 500 and Dow surged to new highs after the Fed said it is cutting interest rates by half a point, marking a pivot from the aggressive hiking cycle that brought rates to a 23-year high. CNN’s Fear & Greed Index, which measures seven barometers of market sentiment, is at a “greed” reading. Strong economic data this week has kept the party going. The S&P 500 on Thursday marked its 42nd record high close in 2024, while the Dow marked its 32nd record high close of the year on Friday. All three major indexes notched a positive week. The Dow gained 0.6%, the S&P 500 added 0.6% and the Nasdaq Composite climbed about 1%. The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, showed that the prices consumers paid for goods and services rose 2.2% last month on an annual basis, down from 2.5% in July. The reading was below expectations from economists polled by FactSet, and is a step closer towards the Fed’s 2% inflation target. Related article A dual win for consumers: Inflation cooled last month, paving way for borrowing costs to come down more Fresh data this week has offered further encouragement that the economy is on solid footing. The third estimate for second-quarter gross domestic product showed that the US economy expanded at a solid 3% clip from the prior year. “What seems to be unfolding before our eyes is a soft landing scenario that only the most optimistic could dream of,” wrote Gregory Daco, chief economist of EY, in a Thursday note. A soft landing is a scenario in which inflation comes down without the economy entering a recession. Elsewhere, the average rate on a standard, 30-year fixed mortgage fell to its lowest level since September 2022 this week, according to Freddie Mac data, providing relief for Americans stung by the tough housing market. Applications to refinance a mortgage soared 20% last week from the prior week, according to Mortgage Bankers Association data. The housing market is known for being sensitive to the ebbs and flows of the economy. Investors are now looking to the September labor report due next Friday. Employers added an estimated 142,000 jobs last month, up from July’s dismal number, while the unemployment rate ticked lower, to 4.2%, offering hope that the labor market is weakening but still on solid footing. With the Fed’s focus now squarely on keeping the labor market healthy, Friday’s report will likely offer clues for the Fed’s next move at its November policy meeting. Related article Americans are fretting over the job market Meanwhile, tech shares continued to gain this week on rate cut optimism and strong earnings from Micron. Nvidia shares jumped 4.6%, Tesla shares rose 9.3% and Meta Platforms shares added 1.1%. In China, stocks ripped higher this week after the central bank introduced a package of measures aimed at stimulating its struggling economy, including lowering interest rates. Oil prices fell for the week. The national average price of gas is about $3.21, according to GasBuddy. The Financial Times reported Thursday, citing anonymous sources, that Saudi Arabia is planning to scrap its $100 a barrel price target for oil. Gold futures retreated from a fresh record high reached Thursday, the latest in a string of records it has set this year. Gold has notched repeated record highs this year, driven by central bank buying of the yellow metal and worries about the US economy’s health. Bitcoin popped this week. The price of the cryptocurrency was last trading at about $65,747 a coin. As stocks settle after the trading session, levels might change slightly.

Title: These 5 Stocks Grew More than Bitcoin Over the Last Year

Time Published: 2024-09-27T15:44:00Z

While Bitcoin's 130% surge grabbed headlines this past year, a select group of stocks outpaced the cryptocurrency behemoth. AppLovin (APP), MakeMyTrip (MMYT), NVIDIA (NVDA), Powell Industries (POWL), and TG Therapeutics (TGTX) all rode waves of market demand to deliver eye-popping returns. These five companies found remarkable success in their sectors, from AI breakthroughs to fronting an industrial boom. Moreover, their stellar performance wasn't just a flash in the pan. Standing behind their stock price increases are robust fundamentals and impressive metrics like revenue growth and return on equity (ROE), which suggest these stocks could keep outshining Bitcoin, one of the most volatile assets. Below, we dig into how they did it. Over the past year, BTC has had one of its best years, more than doubling in price. This was driven by the start of trading for spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), market sentiment, and other major financial catalysts. In late October 2023, BTC pierced the $30,000 level in a rally spurred by anticipation of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approving the spot BTC ETFs. The approval of ETFs from BlackRock and Fidelity significantly increased the institutional demand for BTC, increasing demand for the cryptocurrency. By January 2024, BTC's price surged to $49,000. There was also anticipation for the upcoming BTC halving event. However, the cryptocurrency didn't climb all year. In late January 2024, BTC corrected, dipping 20% to a low of $38,500. This was only a pullback, and by mid-February 2024, the cryptocurrency had rallied past $50,000. The BTC spring halving was another major catalyst for the cryptocurrency, as halving events reduce BTC's supply by cutting mining rewards in half, usually leading to a spike in its price. By mid-March 2024, BTC reached an all-time high of $73,835, fueled by solid demand, particularly from ETFs. Despite this peak, BTC began consolidating, trading between $49,000 and $73,895. In the preceding 12 months, the price of Bitcoin rose approximately 151%. The gauges for the stocks selected below are as follows: Below, we discuss the criteria further, but let's get to our analysis first: Among the top performers, APP led the pack with an impressive one-year return of 227.6%, supported by robust revenue growth of 37.3%. NVDA was close on its heels, delivering a 180.7% price return, kickstarted by extraordinary revenue growth of 194.7%. This was primarily thanks to surging demand in AI and data center sectors. TGTX stood out with its remarkable revenue growth of 1,341.6%, though its one-year price return of 160.1% was comparatively modest. POWL Industries and MMYT had consistent performance, with one-year returns of 179.7% and 182.1%, respectively. POWL's growth was particularly noteworthy at 44.8%. Regarding profitability and valuation metrics, NVDA emerged as a leader with an impressive return on equity (ROE) of 123.77% and a strong price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, indicative of its market dominance. TGTX was also quite strong, with a high ROE of 87.8%, though its P/B ratio at 21.0 was more modest. AppLovin's ROE of 70.7% was solid, but its particularly high P/B of 52.2 suggests investors are placing a significant premium on its expected growth. POWL appears lower in risk as a stock, given its P/B of 5.9 and steady ROE of 34.2%. MakeMyTrip rounded out the group with an ROE of 22.2% and a relatively high P/S of 14.4, reflecting a balanced growth trajectory and investors' optimism about its future in the expanding Indian travel market. AppLovin Corporation specializes in mobile app development and marketing products. The company provides a platform where developers can review metrics on their growth, work to increase user engagement, and review their mobile app revenues. AppLovin has demonstrated strong growth, with its stock price increasing by 228% over the past year. Several factors have driven this performance: AppLovin's high P/B ratio suggests that investors are placing a premium on the company's assets, likely because of its strong growth prospects and market position in the mobile app industry. That said, the company is in the highly competitive mobile technology sector. Its suite of tools and strong AI capabilities have positioned it as a leader in helping developers monetize their apps, particularly game developers. Holders of APP shares should be aware of potential risks: Despite these potential drawbacks, AppLovin's recent performance and strategic position have made it a standout in app development, allowing it to outpace even the impressive gains seen in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin over the past year. MakeMyTrip is a major online travel company primarily serving the Indian market. Founded in 2000 and based in Gurgaon, India, the company offers the typically comprehensive range of travel-related services travelers expect from today's major platforms. MakeMyTrip has shown significant growth, with its stock price increasing by 182% over the past year. Several factors have driven this performance: MakeMyTrip is a dominant player in India's online travel space, benefiting from the country's large and growing middle class, increasing internet availability, and rising disposable incomes. The company's strong brand recognition and wide service offerings have helped it maintain a leading position in a competitive market. The company's high P/S and P/B ratios suggest that investors are optimistic about its future growth in the rapidly expanding Indian travel market. However, investors should consider the following risks: Despite these risks, MakeMyTrip's strong market position and the robust growth of India's travel sector have contributed to its impressive stock performance, NVDA is one of the dominant companies producing advanced computer graphics processors, chipsets, and multimedia software. Founded in 1993 and based in Santa Clara, California, the company plays a significant role in AI, autonomous technology, and high-performance computing, helping to shift the evolution of visual computing and AI. NVIDIA has achieved record-breaking quarters recently, which has been driven by several key factors: NVIDIA is dominant in the GPU market, particularly in AI and high-performance computing. The company's technology is driving advances in many industries, including autonomous vehicles, healthcare, and scientific research. However, investors should be aware of potential risks: Despite these risks, NVIDIA's strong market position and growing demand for AI and high-performance computing products have contributed to its exceptional stock performance, outpacing even the significant gains seen in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin over the past year. Powell Industries, Inc., based in Houston, Texas, develops, designs, and manufactures custom-engineered systems and products for the energy and industrial sectors. The company is known for providing engineered products for electrical power infrastructure. Powell Industries has seen significant growth driven by several factors: The company's focus on custom products for critical infrastructure has helped it maintain a competitive edge. However, investors should consider the following risks: Despite these risks, Powell Industries' strong performance in recent quarters and its strategic position in essential infrastructure markets have contributed to its impressive stock performance. TG Therapeutics, Inc., founded in 1993 and based in North Carolina, is a biopharmaceutical company that acquires, develops, and brings to market therapies for B-cell malignancies and autoimmune diseases. TG Therapeutics has had excellent growth, driven by several key factors: The company's focus on novel therapies for B-cell-mediated diseases positions it well in areas where critical medical needs are unmet. However, investors should be aware of the following risks: Despite these risks, TG Therapeutics' recent commercial success and strong pipeline have contributed to its impressive stock performance. In identifying the stocks that outperformed bitcoin in the past year, we used measures that would highlight companies with strong growth potential, financial health, and market performance. By focusing on the key indicators below, we pinpointed stocks that showed both impressive past performance and had the strength in fundamentals to continue their upward trajectory: Market Capitalization Greater Than $300 million (Small Cap and Higher) Companies with the market capitalization described above are established but still have significant potential for growth. Small-cap and mid-cap stocks often outperform larger companies because of their potential for rapid revenue growth while still being large enough to withstand some economic changes. This ensures that the stock is less prone to extreme volatility when compared with microcaps, which can be highly speculative. In addition, larger companies provide more liquidity, making buying and selling shares easier. TTM Revenue Growth More Than 25% Consistent high revenue growth is a crucial indicator of a company's ability to expand its market share, innovate, and meet consumer demand. Revenue growth of more than 25% yoy indicates that the company is rapidly increasing its earnings. Strong revenue growth often leads to growth in earnings and stock price increases. TTM ROE Greater Than 15% ROE measures a company's profitability relative to its equity. An ROE of over 15% is an excellent figure, showing that management effectively turns shareholder equity into profits. High ROE companies are typically well-managed, competitive, and able to reinvest earnings effectively. P/B of 5 and Above A high P/B typically signals that investors are willing to pay a premium for the company's assets because they believe it will continue to generate superior returns. While a lower P/B is considered more value-driven, a higher P/B reflects increased expectations for growth and market confidence in the company's future performance. In high-growth stocks, a P/B of 5 or more suggests the company is well regarded for its potential. 1-Year Performance of More Than 150% A one-year price appreciation of over 150% demonstrates strong momentum, indicating that the stock has significantly outperformed the broader market. High performance over a year is often driven by strong earnings, revenue growth, and positive investor sentiment, all of which are necessary when selecting stocks that could outpace BTC's gains. Investors should focus on strong and consistent revenue growth and profitability metrics such as return on assets and ROE to identify stocks that may outperform cryptocurrencies like BTC. You should also review valuation ratios that show market confidence in future growth, such as high P/E or P/B ratios. Targeting industries with disruptive potential, such as AI or green energy, and selecting stocks with strong momentum and positive analyst reports are also worthwhile when selecting high-growth investments. Indeed, investing in stocks that could outperform BTC carries several risks, such as above-average market volatility. Valuation risks can also arise when stocks with high P/Es or P/Bs become overvalued. Industry-specific risks, such as regulatory challenges in sectors like technology and biotech, may hinder growth. In addition, stocks are sensitive to economic shifts like changes in interest rates and inflation. Company-specific or idiosyncratic issues, such as poor management or legal challenges, increase risk, requiring investors to look carefully before investing and diversifying their portfolios once they do. To diversify an investment portfolio with stocks and cryptocurrencies, investors should pick their holdings based on risk tolerance. Most investors will want to hold much of their portfolios in stable blue-chip stocks and other safer assets, with only a small portion for volatile cryptocurrencies. Over the past year, APP, MMYT, NVDA, POWL, and TGTX have had exceptional growth, outpacing even the stellar 150% rally in bitcoin's prices. Key drivers for these companies include strong revenue growth, high ROE, and market momentum. NVDA, in particular, capitalized on AI demand, while TGTX succeeded with its Briumvi therapy. APP and MMYT leveraged strategic new products, and POWL benefited from industrial sector growth, positioning these stocks as strong performers with robust fundamentals across very different sectors of the economy.

Title: The Secret Frameworks (Mental Models) Behind the Success of 10 Famous Entrepreneurs

jeffbullas.com Win At Business And Life In An AI World Topics: If we put all the data we have collected in the past year from our expanding digital universe into books, we would have created 80 quadrillion books. If we stacked them (assuming a thickness of 2.5 cm), it would reach the sun 13,333 times.Or 211 light years into space. But the irony is that with all that information, we are still struggling to find wisdom. Isaac Asimov said this about the mountains of data collected by technology:“The saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom.” The conundrum. More information and data does not lead to better decisions. So we need to pose questions that matter: One answer is applying “mental models.” A mental model is a simplified, conceptual framework that helps us understand and interpret the world, make decisions, and solve problems. It represents how certain things work, allowing us to predict outcomes based on past experiences, knowledge, or logic. One example of a mental model is applying the compounding effect. This can be used to accumulate wealth and knowledge over a lifetime. Example 1: Compounding effect of a long term approach to investing to build “wealth“—by investing in high-quality businesses or the stock market index that consistently grow earnings, reinvesting profits over decades to create exponential wealth. This was the mental model used by Warren Buffet to make his company the 8th most valuable business in the world at $982 billion. Example 2: Compounding effect of life term learning and “knowledge.” Learning something new every day adds to your knowledge and over a lifetime it can produce enormous benefits to life and business. This is one of Bill Gates key mental models and in an information world, knowledge is wealth. Microsoft is now valued at over $3 Trillion. Mental models help us cut through complexity and distill that into simplicity. They help us make sense of all the noise that overwhelms us and allow us to focus on the key principles that govern situations. And the proof of the “mental model” approach can be found in many successful people that have used that approach—these include Richard Branson, Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. If you want to see what their mental models are you can jump to the bottom of this post. Mental models can be applied to every aspect of life. The biggest decisions in life often shape our personal happiness, relationships, and long-term fulfillment. These include choosing a life partner, who you hang out with and where you have your home and how you invest your money. On the “who you hang out with,” I have a simple piece of advice:“If you want to fly like an eagle don’t hang out with turkeys.” I have told my children this many times. I hope they are listening. Here are some key decisions that we all face in life and some mental models that can help guide your thinking around them: Mental models: Mental models: Charlie Munger lived to the age of 99 and died in 2023. He, with Warren Buffet built the Berkshire Hathaway company to a valuation of $982 Billion and is the 8th most valuable company in the world after starting in 1965. He published a book titled “Poor Charlie’s Almanac” that was a distillation of all the information he had gathered over his lifetime that was instrumental in building a trillion dollar business. In it he revealed one of his secrets about how he did that. He distilled that information into wisdom using over 90 mental models, some he revealed in that book and others are still to be unearthed. In looking at his life, his mental models and his success it would suggest a strong correlation between age and experience producing wisdom. But he is not alone and there are many famous people that have developed wisdom and mental models from their life experiences to find success. Many top entrepreneurs and famous individuals utilize mental models as key tools for decision-making, problem-solving, and life optimization. Here are a few prominent figures who are known for applying mental models and the specific frameworks they employ in business and life: Sheryl Sandberg is an influential business executive, philanthropist, and as of 2023, her net worth is estimated to be around $1.6 billion, primarily derived from her stock holdings and compensation from her time at Meta, as well as her investments in other ventures. She is best known for her role as the Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Facebook (now Meta), where she helped grow the platform into one of the largest social media companies in the world. Sandberg is also the author of the bestselling book Lean In, which advocates for women’s empowerment and leadership in the workplace, and founded the Lean In Foundation to support gender equality initiatives. Here are 3 of her mental models and frameworks. The most powerful mental model here for me is the framework of “taking charge” and owning your future rather than one of victimhood. That is expanded on in her best selling book “Lean In.” Warren Buffet built the Berkshire Hathaway company to a valuation of $982 Billion that is now the 8th most valuable company in the world after starting in 1965. Invest as early as possible and let compounding make you rich over time. $10,000 invested in the USA sharemarket when you were 30 becomes $237,000 when you’re 60. Going deeper In a recent AFR publication there was a chart that revealed the power of compounding returns using an example of investing in stock markets. It compared the different stock markets total return if you invested $10,000 30 years ago. It displays the power of compounding and how a small change in return can produce a much bigger result from the power of compounding. This powerful visual comparison shows that $30,000 invested in the Australian Stock market 30 years ago vs the same $30,000 invested in the USA stock over the same period. Result Total value of $10,000 over 30 years with all dividends reinvested and no withdrawals. To put that in perspective a relatively small investment of $10,000 in the USA markets when you were 30 became $237,318 at the age of 60 but only worth $135,165 in Australia. That is a $100,000+ difference The other revelation was what a difference it made when there was only a 2% difference. Australia had a 9.1% return and the USA was 11.1%. Ray Dalio is a financial success as the founder of Bridgewater which is one of the worlds largest hedge funds. And his biggest mental model is “radical transparency” within his organization. It is a model that works for him and his business. It may not work for you. But it may. A good mental model will be what makes sense to you and your experience in life. It will be the intersection of your skills, life journey and curiosity. You need to own it. Make it yours. Sometimes I find road testing different ideas is a good first step. Here are some of Ray’s mental models to reflect on. Feedback loops make a lot of sense to me.They can be seen as using information and data to find what works and what doesn’t as quickly as possible. It can be very data driven and objective or more nuanced and subjective. Jeff saw a vision of an online bookstore in 1995. 30 years later he has grown Amazon into a trillion dollar company and with a personal wealth of $211 billion dollars is the second wealthiest person in the world. He plays the long game and one of his prioritized models is long-term thinking. The regret minimization model is something worth looking deeper at. This starts to become more obvious and apparent when you’re older. And many of us live with regret.It is a great question to keep asking yourself. Maybe try putting yourself a bit further into the future and take the time to reflect on your current situation and ask better questions. Charlie Munger was Warren Buffets sidekick at Berkshire Hathaway. The reality was that he was much more than that and it was a synergistic partnership that lasted 58 years. But they both had their own mental models and agreed on others. Charlie died in 2023 and had used 90 plus mental models to help him make wise decisions. The inversion mental model is counterintuitive as it makes you look at the consequences of the opposite of what you want to achieve. Instead of focusing on what would make a project successful, you think about what could cause it to fail, and then work to avoid those pitfalls. Example: Suppose you want to improve customer satisfaction in your business. Instead of asking, “What can we do to make our customers happier?”, you ask, “What are we doing that could be making our customers unhappy?” then take specific actions to eliminate these issues, thereby indirectly improving overall customer satisfaction. I don’t need to introduce Steve Jobs except to say that his birthday on February 24 was on the same date of the year as mine. So we are both Pisces. Let’s leave the comparison there. Finding or creating “Simplicity” in the middle of all the noise and complexity takes time and effort. So…simplicity takes hard work. Winston Churchill said it well. “I would have written you a shorter letter but I didn’t have the time.” To go back to comparisons between Steve and me. I love finding the simplicity in complexity. Let me say: Less is more. The founder of Facebook (now known as Meta) has maybe created the most information in the world by getting people to sign up to his social media platform and making it easy for the world to share their information without creating any of his own. That is “scaling economics” at its smartest. Key takeaway As competitors entered the market Mark quickly realized that he didn’t have to innovate all the time but buy or copy. Instagram and WhatsApp threatened to steal traffic, users and attention from Facebook so he bought them. And to show the middle finger to Elon Musk at Twitter (Now known as X) he copied Twitter and started “Threads”. In just a few months Threads had acquired 100 million users. Innovator’s dilemma solved. Elon is currently the world’s richest person. And Tesla and SpaceX are his biggest contributors to that wealth. And he didn’t get there without some clever thinking and using some powerful mental models that helped him. Long-term vision is one of his superpowers and one of his mental models. Going to colonize Mars is as long term as it gets! It’s not in my vision as I quite like the beach and I have heard that there are no beaches and sand there. But what is interesting is that this mental model is also one of the key mental models of Warren Buffet and Jeff Bezos. No more needs to be said. Bill along with Charlie Munger and Warren Buffet spends a lot of time reading. I am not talking about superficial reading (also known as doom scrolling) on Instagram, Facebook or TikTok. As the founder of Microsoft that he started in the 1980’s (that is now worth $3.22 trillion) he has certainly earned the right to give himself the permission to read, and gain knowledge. “Compounding” is not just something reserved for financial wealth. It also applies to knowledge wealth. Taking a long term approach to gaining knowledge and hopefully wisdom is one of Bill Gates approaches and frameworks for life. Take the time to keep feeding your mind with deep knowledge and the compound effect of that will surprise you. Richard Branson had trouble reading as he was dyslexic. But that didn’t stop him succeeding as he had the ability to choose the right people to hire and partner with. I surround myself with people that do the things I hate and I am bad at. That includes cleaners, accountants and tax advisers. So realizing that you are not good at something and choosing people to help you is leaning into the mental model of “People over process” Many of these models can be adapted to our big decisions in our personal life. They can also be applied to business and investing. The challenge is that there are many mental models and that alone will produce complexity and anxiety. Your next task is to create a mental model list and distill them into which ones are relevant for you and make a shorter list. And then start applying them and testing them. Ideas without action are just noise. Share this post: © Jeff Bullas. Privacy Policy

Title: The Secret Frameworks (Mental Models) Behind the Success of 10 Famous Entrepreneurs

jeffbullas.com Win At Business And Life In An AI World Topics: If we put all the data we have collected in the past year from our expanding digital universe into books, we would have created 80 quadrillion books. If we stacked them (assuming a thickness of 2.5 cm), it would reach the sun 13,333 times.Or 211 light years into space. But the irony is that with all that information, we are still struggling to find wisdom. Isaac Asimov said this about the mountains of data collected by technology:“The saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom.” The conundrum. More information and data does not lead to better decisions. So we need to pose questions that matter: One answer is applying “mental models.” A mental model is a simplified, conceptual framework that helps us understand and interpret the world, make decisions, and solve problems. It represents how certain things work, allowing us to predict outcomes based on past experiences, knowledge, or logic. One example of a mental model is applying the compounding effect. This can be used to accumulate wealth and knowledge over a lifetime. Example 1: Compounding effect of a long term approach to investing to build “wealth“—by investing in high-quality businesses or the stock market index that consistently grow earnings, reinvesting profits over decades to create exponential wealth. This was the mental model used by Warren Buffet to make his company the 8th most valuable business in the world at $982 billion. Example 2: Compounding effect of life term learning and “knowledge.” Learning something new every day adds to your knowledge and over a lifetime it can produce enormous benefits to life and business. This is one of Bill Gates key mental models and in an information world, knowledge is wealth. Microsoft is now valued at over $3 Trillion. Mental models help us cut through complexity and distill that into simplicity. They help us make sense of all the noise that overwhelms us and allow us to focus on the key principles that govern situations. And the proof of the “mental model” approach can be found in many successful people that have used that approach—these include Richard Branson, Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. If you want to see what their mental models are you can jump to the bottom of this post. Mental models can be applied to every aspect of life. The biggest decisions in life often shape our personal happiness, relationships, and long-term fulfillment. These include choosing a life partner, who you hang out with and where you have your home and how you invest your money. On the “who you hang out with,” I have a simple piece of advice:“If you want to fly like an eagle don’t hang out with turkeys.” I have told my children this many times. I hope they are listening. Here are some key decisions that we all face in life and some mental models that can help guide your thinking around them: Mental models: Mental models: Charlie Munger lived to the age of 99 and died in 2023. He, with Warren Buffet built the Berkshire Hathaway company to a valuation of $982 Billion and is the 8th most valuable company in the world after starting in 1965. He published a book titled “Poor Charlie’s Almanac” that was a distillation of all the information he had gathered over his lifetime that was instrumental in building a trillion dollar business. In it he revealed one of his secrets about how he did that. He distilled that information into wisdom using over 90 mental models, some he revealed in that book and others are still to be unearthed. In looking at his life, his mental models and his success it would suggest a strong correlation between age and experience producing wisdom. But he is not alone and there are many famous people that have developed wisdom and mental models from their life experiences to find success. Many top entrepreneurs and famous individuals utilize mental models as key tools for decision-making, problem-solving, and life optimization. Here are a few prominent figures who are known for applying mental models and the specific frameworks they employ in business and life: Sheryl Sandberg is an influential business executive, philanthropist, and as of 2023, her net worth is estimated to be around $1.6 billion, primarily derived from her stock holdings and compensation from her time at Meta, as well as her investments in other ventures. She is best known for her role as the Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Facebook (now Meta), where she helped grow the platform into one of the largest social media companies in the world. Sandberg is also the author of the bestselling book Lean In, which advocates for women’s empowerment and leadership in the workplace, and founded the Lean In Foundation to support gender equality initiatives.

The Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation is due this morning; U.S. stock futures are steady after Thursday's jump and the S&P 500's record close; Costco Wholesale (COST) shares are slipping in premarket trading after disappointing quarterly revenue numbers; almost 1.2 million electricity customers are without power in Florida as Helene slams the state as a Category 4 hurricane; and Intel (INTC) reportedly rebuffs a bid by Arm Holdings (ARM) for its product division. Here's what investors need to know today. Market watchers will be focused on the Fed's preferred inflation measure to gauge the future path of interest rates, after last week's half-percentage-point cut signaled the central bank's view that price pressures are easing. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index is expected to have risen 2.3% year-over-year in August, down from 2.5% in July, according to a survey of economists by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal, but the "core" number is expected to have risen to 2.7% from 2.6%. U.S. stock futures are little changed after major indexes surged Thursday, with the S&P 500 closing at a record high after a strong earnings report from Micron (MU) sent chip stocks sharply higher and shares of companies with exposure to the Chinese economy jumped on reports of additional government stimulus. The Nasdaq finished higher for a fourth straight session yesterday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched closer to another record high of its own. Costco Wholesale (COST) shares are slipping 1% in premarket trading after the warehouse retailer's quarterly revenue missed analysts' expectations as growth slowed. The company's fiscal fourth-quarter sales growth was just 1% year-over-year, offsetting earnings that topped forecasts. Investors will be watching how higher membership fees could affect the company’s results going forward. Hurricane Helene landed in Florida as a Category 4 storm Thursday night with wind speeds of around 140 miles per hour, with about 1.2 million customers losing power in the state, according to PowerOutage.us. Helene weakened to a tropical storm as it moved farther inland over Georgia, but a "life-threatening storm surge, winds, and heavy rains continue," the National Hurricane Center said. Troubled chipmaker Intel (INTC) has rejected a bid by chip designer Arm Holdings (ARM) for its product division, Bloomberg reported late Thursday. Earlier this week, the news outlet reported that Apollo Global Management had offered to invest as much as $5 billion in Intel, days after The Wall Street Journal said that Qualcomm (QCOM) had made a "takeover approach" for it. Intel shares, which are little changed in premarket trading, are down more than 50% this year. American depositary receipts (ADRs) of Arm are edging lower.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / SEPTEMBER 27 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO ofRelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR.

Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / SEPTEMBER 27 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO ofRelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas.

Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers.

Title: The Hollywood Cuts Keep Comin’ As Disney Does Another Worker Cleanse

(Photo by AaronP/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images) As if Hollywood needed any more reminders why the mantra “Stay Alive Until 2025” is going to be difficult for many industry workers, Disney embarked this week on another 300 layoffs, on top of thousands of other reductions there and across the industry. This set of layoffs in the Burbank, Calif.-based Disney largely hit corporate workers in divisions such as legal, human resources, finance and communications, Deadline reported. All told, CEO Bob Iger has targeted 8,000 jobs for elimination. Some 4,000 of those cuts landed in April of last year, but more keep coming. In May, Disney’s Pixar laid off 175 workers amid a sustained box-office slump for the animation unit’s films. Even the subsequent record-setting performance of Inside Out 2 this summer wasn’t enough to fend off the Mouse House reaper. The Disney reductions, part of at least $7.5 billion in spending cuts that CEO Bob Iger instituted beginning late last year, haven’t spared sports either, even though that sector has been the most watched and lucrative remaining corner of broadcast and cable. This week, for instance, Disney’s ESPN division continued to lay off on-air talent, this time with NBA reporter and podcast star Zach Lowe. His departure follows recent exits by Robert Griffin III and Sam Ponder, who both, like Lowe, made more than $1 million a year. Five behind-the-camera executives, including Head of Content Operations Stephanie Druley, also have departed as part of a reorganization that Burke Magnus, ESPN’s President, Programming and Original Content, told staff in a recent memo will make the company “more strategic, collaborative and nimble” while resulting in “new positions or promotions for people who are expanding their responsibilities or taking on new challenges.” Basically, the survivors will get to do more with less. The cuts come amid the unexpected retirement of NBA scoop-meister Adrian Wojnarowski, who earlier this month walked away from an estimated $20 million remaining in his ESPN contract to become general manager of the men’s basketball team at his alma mater, tiny St. Bonaventure’s University in upstate New York. Disney is, of course, far from the only Hollywood media giant getting buffeted by the industry’s many changes. Paramount Global is headed toward a sale to a group led by Skydance CEO David Ellison and his father, Oracle founder Larry Ellison. That deal likely won’t close until well into 2025. Nonetheless, Paramount’s three-headed Office of the CEO is proceeding with 15% cuts across its operations, which are far smaller (and less profitable) than Disney’s. The latest cuts wiped out entire offices, such as the communications unit for Paramount+, the company’s main streaming service. All gone, Deadline reported Friday. Similarly, the streaming service’s eight-person content strategy team was wiped out, perhaps further indication that the strategy for Paramount+ is to stop operating on a stand-alone basis after the merger finally closes. Given the debt crunch Paramount and controlling shareholder Shari Redstone were facing, deep cuts were inevitable, especially given the many overlapping operations with Skydance in film, TV and animation production. But it’s all of a piece with larger layoff waves washing over the industry. Debt-saddled Warner Bros. Discovery has undergone seemingly endless cuts, layoffs and closures since it was created 2.5 years ago from a merger between Discovery and WarnerMedia (and still more cuts during AT&T’s spotty previous stewardship). Even Comcast may be vulnerable, especially as the price of NBCUniversal’s new $2.5-billion-per-year NBA rights deal starts to bite next year, even though its parts include the eponymous cable provider, a burgeoning wireless carrier, and theme parks. It’s useful to view the imminent (and entirely self-driven) retirement of beloved Today Show Hoda Kotb this week, with her $20-million-a-year contract, as just one example of what’ll be happening with NBC News salaries for on-air personalities as contracts come up for negotiation. More big names are likely to move on, or eat a pay cut or minimal pay hike in the new era. Disney told the New York Times in a statement that it is looking to manage resources and costs “more effectively” to “fuel the state-of-the-art creativity and innovation that consumers value and expect from Disney.” Hollywood’s biggest media company is hardly alone in that search. The streaming wars proved ruinously expensive — even for relative winners such as Disney+ and Hulu, which Disney now fully controls. Losses just from subscription streaming-video operations have topped $11 billion across the industry, according to SEC filings by the various contenders. That total doesn’t include any losses at Apple TV+ and Amazon Prime Video, their programming and operating costs subsumed within (and unreported by) the vast mass of their far more lucrative main businesses, though even they are reportedly tightening program spending and operational costs. The mediacos are feeling Wall Street pressure to turn streaming services into profitable operations, a process made more complicated by the accelerating swoon in customers watching the companies’ legacy cable and broadcast operations. Cord-cutting has nearly halved the cable subscription footprint to a little more than 50 million U.S. households. All the streaming operations, even those owned by Netflix and tech giants Apple and Amazon, have been cutting or re-prioritizing their spending on entertainment properties. Even industry leader Netflix is spending differently, even as it continues to generate billions in cash flow. The company has spent around $17 billion a year on programming the past few years, executives have repeatedly said in earnings calls. Now it’s reportedly reconsidering the cost-plus approach to its talent deals, going back to a modified version of a flat fee with an actual back-end for successful projects (only). But now Netflix is spending more on live events, like The Greatest Roast of All Time: Tom Brady, which proved to be one of the company’s most-watched shows of 2024’s first half, according to Netflix’s recent release of viewership statistics. Netflix also recently announced a deal to carry two NFL games this Christmas Day. That’ll likely be huge for Netflix viewership, but also means the reported $150 million paid for the two games’ rights won’t be spent on, say, five run-of-the-mill rom-coms or a couple of mid-level action comedies. For that matter, Netflix has also been profitably licensing more and more old shows from its erstwhile competitors, who after a few years of streaming wars freezeouts, once again are welcoming the found money of a Netflix deal for a library show such as Suits. While that’s good money for the owners and creators of those older shows, that’s also money that won’t be spent making new shows, either at Netflix or at the production studios. All of that has also translated to deep problems at Los Angeles production, post-production, visual-effects and other corners of the industry that regularly do projects with the studios.

Dell Technologies has announced a significant shift in its work policy for global sales team employees. According to an internal memo obtained by sources, starting September 30, staff members who can work from company offices will be required to do so five days a week, as per a report by Bloomberg. The tech giant's decision aims to foster a more collaborative environment and enhance skill development among its sales force. The memo emphasised the importance of in-person work, stating, “Working remotely should be the exception rather than the routine,” as quoted by Bloomberg. Field representatives are expected to divide their time between customer and partner interactions and office presence, totalling five days a week. This marks an increase from the previous three-day in-office requirement, per the report. However, the company has made provisions for certain employees, noting, “Remote sales team members who can't go into a Dell office should continue to work remotely,” Bloomberg reported. Dell has promised to provide additional information regarding remote workers shortly. In August, Dell announced a significant restructuring of its sales division, including layoffs, as part of its efforts to streamline operations and prioritise artificial intelligence. According to an internal memo sent to staff on August 6, the company said it plans to consolidate its sales teams and establish a new unit focused on AI, Business Insider reported. While Dell has not disclosed the exact number of employees affected, estimates suggest that around 12,500 workers, representing roughly 10% of the company's total workforce, may be impacted, according to a report from Newsbyte. Dell's move comes amid a broader trend of tech companies reevaluating their remote work policies established during the COVID-19 pandemic. While many firms have embraced hybrid models, some are pushing for a more substantial office presence. In a similar vein, e-commerce giant Amazon recently announced plans to require employees to work from company offices five days a week starting next year, a stricter policy compared to their previous three-day mandate. Dell has recently faced challenges in its core personal computer business, which has not rebounded as strongly as expected following a prolonged downturn. The tech giant's latest financial report, released on August 30, revealed a decline in revenue for its fiscal second quarter. The company posted $12.4 billion in revenue, representing a 4% decrease compared to the same period in the previous year and falling slightly short of market projections. The report highlighted a stark contrast between Dell's PC business segments. While sales of business-oriented computers remained relatively stable, the consumer PC division experienced a significant downturn, with revenue plummeting by 22 per cent year-on-year. In response to these financial headwinds, Dell signalled its intention to implement strategic cost-cutting measures in a regulatory filing submitted on September 11. “We remain committed to disciplined cost management in coordination with our ongoing business transformation initiatives and will continue to take certain measures to reduce costs."

In a recent transaction, Gregory K. Peters, the Co-CEO of Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), sold 4,392 shares of the company's common stock, netting over $3.1 million. The sale occurred on September 25, with the shares being sold at a price of $725 each. This sale was part of a prearranged trading plan under Rule 10b5-1, which allows company insiders to set up a trading plan for selling stocks they own. On the same day, Peters also acquired the same number of shares, 4,392, at a price of $155.35 per share, totaling approximately $682,297. This transaction was related to stock options exercised under the company's stock option plan. Following the sale, Peters still owns a substantial number of Netflix shares, with 13,090 shares remaining in his possession. These transactions indicate a significant trading activity by a top executive within the company, which can often be of interest to investors and market watchers. Netflix, a leading streaming entertainment service, has seen its stock price fluctuate in recent times, and transactions of this nature often draw attention to the company's stock performance and insider confidence. Peters' position as Co-CEO makes his trading activities particularly noteworthy to those following the company's financial developments. Investors and analysts often look to insider buying and selling as a signal of leadership's belief in the company's future prospects. However, it's important to note that there can be many reasons for insiders to sell shares, and such transactions don't necessarily indicate a lack of confidence in the company. The transactions have been publicly filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, providing transparency and allowing the investing public to stay informed about significant insider trades at Netflix. In other recent news, Netflix has announced the date for its Q3 2024 earnings release, scheduled for October 17, 2024. The entertainment services leader has also been making significant strides in its advertising business, with JPMorgan predicting that Netflix's ad revenue could account for more than 10% of total revenue by 2027. Additionally, TD Cowen has reiterated a Buy rating for Netflix, indicating faith in the company's advertising growth trajectory. On another front, the proposed merger between Disney and Reliance's Indian media assets faces regulatory hurdles due to concerns about monopolizing cricket broadcast rights. The companies may need to sell some of their cricket broadcast rights or commit to advertisement price caps for cricket matches to address these antitrust concerns. Evercore ISI has shown confidence in Netflix's potential, raising its stock target and maintaining an Outperform rating. This comes in the wake of Netflix's surge in upfront advertising commitments, largely due to the addition of NFL games on Christmas Day. These are the recent developments highlighting the growth and challenges faced by these companies in their respective markets. As investors digest the recent insider trading activity by Netflix Co-CEO Gregory K. Peters, it's worth considering the broader financial context provided by InvestingPro. Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) currently boasts a market capitalization of $309.67 billion, underscoring its substantial presence in the entertainment industry. The company's P/E ratio stands at 43.56, reflecting a valuation that is high relative to near-term earnings growth, a point that is also highlighted by one of the InvestingPro Tips. This may suggest that investors are expecting continued growth and are willing to pay a premium for the company's earnings potential. Another InvestingPro Tip indicates that Netflix operates with a moderate level of debt, which can be a reassuring sign for investors concerned about the company's financial leverage. Moreover, the company's strong return over the last year, with a price total return of 88.41%, demonstrates its robust performance in the market. Additionally, with a high gross profit margin of 43.84% over the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, Netflix shows its ability to efficiently translate sales into profits.
