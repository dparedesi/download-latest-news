Title: The Federal Supremacists Write a Ticket Good for One Ride in Williams v. Reed

Mostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent Josh Blackman | 2.22.2025 9:07 PM Last week, I taught the Supreme Court's anti-commandeering cases in Constitutional Law. The precedent can be stated simply. New York v. United States held that Congress cannot compel state legislatures to enact legislation. Printz v. United States held that Congress cannot compel state executive branch officials to enforce federal law. And NFIB v. Sebelius held that Congress cannot compel people to engage in economic activity. However, Congress can compel state judges to enforce federal law. Article VI, Clause 2 maintains that "the Judges in every State shall be bound" by the supreme law of the land. In Printz, Justice Scalia acknowledged that since the framing, state judges have enforced federal law. A student asked if Congress could commandeer state courts, as well as state judges. The answer to this question is complex. In my view, the answer should be no. I developed this thesis in a 2016 article in the Illinois Law Review, titled State Judicial Sovereignty. In short, if a state legislature creates a court of true general jurisdiction, then a state judge can hear any federal cause of action. But if a state legislature divests a state court of jurisdiction over some federal cause of action, the action cannot be heard. Congress cannot commandeer the state legislature to vest their courts with jurisdiction, and the Supremacy Clause does not empower the courts to establish that jurisdiction. Remember, state court jurisdiction comes from the state legislature, and not the Constitution. Regrettably, the Supreme Court rejected my approach in Haywood v. Drown (2009). In this case, which most people have never heard of, New York divested its courts of jurisdiction to hear damage claims against correction officials. As a result, those courts would have lacked jurisdiction to hear Section 1983 suits against prison guards. Justice Stevens's majority opinion held that this jurisdictional statute was actually an attempt to immunize prison officials under Section 1983. Haywood was 5-4. Justice Thomas wrote the dissent, which was only joined in part by Chief Justice Roberts, and Justice Scalia and Alito. The quartet agreed that New York should prevail under longstanding precedent. But only Justice Thomas was willing to go a step further and say those precedents were wrong. In short, even if state judges are bound to enforce federal law, state legislatures have complete and total control over the jurisdiction of the state courts. If a plaintiff does not like those rules, he can bring a Section 1983 suit in federal court. It has long bothered me that Justice Scalia did not join all of Justice Thomas's dissent in Haywood, but such is life. (Update: I previously wrote the case was 8-1, which it sort of was for the issue I was talking about, but it is better to call it 5-4.) Fast-forward to the present. On Friday, the Supreme Court decided Williams v. Reed. On the holding, the Court split 5-4. Justice Kavanuagh's majority opinion held that state courts must allow a Section 1983 claim to proceed where a state exhaustion requirement "in effect immunizes state officials" from liability. In my view, this case goes beyond Haywood. The Court expands federal court oversight of state court jurisdiction. I see this decision as vindicating the supremacy of federal courts. You may recall that Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Kagan, and Justice Kavanaugh dissented in Mallory v. Norfolk Southern. I see that position as parallel to Williams. Of course, Justices Sotomayor and Jackson joined the majority, though I suppose the context was different enough. Yet I'm not sure that the Chief was fully on board with the Haywood expansion. Justice Kavanaugh explains how limited this opinion was. He stresses the Court reverses on a "narrow ground" and "emphasize[s]" the opinion is "narrow." Kavanaugh writes that his decision "resolves this dispute but is careful not to go beyond this Court's existing precedents." You know a five-member majority is fragile when this sort of language is added. Chief Justice Roberts assigned this opinion to Justice Kavanaugh. I suspect the Chief then conditioned his joining on this sort of limiting language. The federal supremacists issued a ticket good for one ride. Justice Thomas wrote the Williams dissent, which had two parts. Part I was joined only by Thomas. And Part II was joined by Thomas, as well as Justices Alito, Gorsuch, and Barrett. Part II argues that the majority misconstrued, and indeed expanded Haywood. I find that analysis quite compelling. I also think that the issue was waived, and that Justice Kavanaugh botched the facial/as-applied analysis. (I have to imagine this part was very important for Justice Barrett's join, especially in light of NetChoice.) But Justice Thomas was alone in Part I, regrettably. Thomas repeats his call that Haywood was wrongly decided based on "first principles." (Chief Justice Rehnquist used this phrase in Lopez.) This case is straightforward under first principles. Our federal system gives States "plenary authority to decide whether their local courts will have subject-matter jurisdiction over federal causes of action." Haywood v. Drown, 556 U. S. 729, 743 (2009) (THOMAS, J., dissenting). The Constitution allows States to hear federal claims in their courts, but it does "not impose a duty on state courts to do so." Id., at 747. Thus, "[o]nce a State exercises its sovereign prerogative to deprive its courts of subject-matter jurisdiction over a federal cause of action, it is the end of the matter as far as the Constitution is concerned." Id., at 749. . . . Our precedents also err in establishing the requirement at issue here—that state jurisdictional rules be "neutral," even in the absence of a directly conflicting federal law. See infra, at 5. The Supremacy Clause does not of its own force"constrai[n] the States' authority to define the subject-matter jurisdiction of their own courts." Haywood, 556 U. S., at 750 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). Thomas also explains that plaintiffs are free to bring suit in federal court. This case is much ado about little. Justice Thomas also wrote a glorious footnote that takes a potshot at Charles Reich. I suspect Justice Alito regrets not joining this footnote about his former constitutional law professor. (Alito has many times told the story about how Reich abandoned his class in the middle of the semester to go to San Francisco.) * Petitioners' suit implicates other precedents that may not withstand scrutiny. I doubt that petitioners have a true due process interest in "mere Government benefits and entitlements." Axon Enterprise, Inc. v. FTC, 598 U. S. 175, 201, n. 3 (2023) (THOMAS, J., concurring). Tellingly,the Court's original expansion of the Due Process Clause into this context came without meaningful legal analysis. The Court simply highlighted the social importance of "entitlements," which had come to make up "[m]uch of the existing wealth in this country," and which only the poor had been theretofore unable to effectively enforce. See Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U. S. 254, 262, and n. 8 (1970) (citing C. Reich, Individual Rights and Social Welfare: The Emerging Legal Issues, 74 Yale L. J. 1245, 1255(1965); C. Reich, The New Property, 73 Yale L. J. 733 (1964)). As Justice Black recognized at the time, it "strains credulity" as a textual matter "to say that the government's promise of charity to an individual is property" protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. 397 U. S., at 275 (dissenting opinion). Amen. Thomas also casts doubt on whether Section 1983 even creates a cause of action. Here, Thomas cites an important new article by Tyler Lindley. Moreover, further examination may be required as to whether §1983 can provide petitioners a cause of action in any event. Cf. T. Lindley, Anachronistic Readings of Section 1983, 75 Ala. L. Rev. 897, 900–901 (2024) (contending that, as originally understood, §1983 did notprovide a freestanding cause of action). This statement is consistent with Thomas's opinion in DeVillier v. Texas, and his dissent in Wilson v. Hawaii. These cases recognize that the Constitution does not create positive causes of action for relief. Conservatives routinely call on Justice Thomas to retire. Would any replacement continue to make such important and principled contributions to the law? Does anyone else have the right combination of courage and curiosity? I am doubtful.

Title: NVIDIA To Surge 20% With Earnings?

CHINA - 2025/02/13: In this photo illustration, an Nvidia logo is displayed on the screen of a ... [+] smartphone. (Photo Illustration by Sheldon Cooper/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) See more on Trefis.com Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is scheduled to announce its earnings on Feb. 26, 2025, after the market closes. The semiconductor leader currently holds a market capitalization of $3.3 trillion. Over the past 12 months, Nvidia reported revenue of $113 billion, with operating profits of $71 billion and a net income of $63 billion. The stock’s reaction post-earnings will largely depend on how the results and future outlook align with investor expectations. Analyzing historical performance can be beneficial for event-driven traders: either by understanding past trends to position themselves before the earnings release or by examining the correlation between immediate and medium-term returns post-earnings to make informed trades the day after the announcement. Specifically, past data suggests the maximum positive one-day movement post earnings, was a little over 20%. Full analysis below. Over the past five years, there have been 20 earnings reports, with 11 positive and 9 negative one-day returns, indicating positive 1D returns approximately 55% of the time. This percentage increases to 58% when considering data from the last three years. The median of the 11 positive returns is 4.9%, while the median of the 9 negative returns is -5.9%. Additional data for observed returns 5-days (5D) and 30-days (30D) post-earnings are summarized in the table below. NVDA returns 1 day, 5 days, and 30-days post earnings A potentially less risky strategy (though its effectiveness depends on the strength of the correlation) involves understanding the relationship between short-term and medium-term returns post-earnings. Identifying pairs with the highest correlation can guide trading decisions. For instance, if 1D and 5D returns exhibit the highest correlation, a trader might consider a "long" position for the next five days if the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Below is correlation data based on five-year and three-year (more recent) histories. Note that "1D_5D" refers to the correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns. NVDA correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns At times, the performance of peer companies can influence a stock’s post-earnings reaction, with market adjustments potentially beginning before the earnings announcement. The table below presents historical data comparing Nvidia post-earnings performance with that of peers who reported earnings just before Nvidia. For a fair comparison, peer stock returns also represent post-earnings 1D returns. Peer stocks post-earnings one day (1D) return Not too happy about the volatile nature of NVDA stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Learn more about Trefis RV strategy, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, and Russell 2000), delivering strong returns for investors. Alternatively, if you’re seeking upside potential with less volatility than an individual stock like Nvidia, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500, achieving over 91% returns since inception.

Title: The Next Big Energy Boom: How the Green Scam Collapse Is Driving a Historic Bull Market

Editor Economy International Man, Nick Giambruno “It was the single most important financial event of my career.” My friend and resource investing legend Rick Rule once shared this with me, reflecting on his experience in the uranium market during the last bull cycle—where extreme supply and demand imbalances triggered massive booms and busts. Rick was referring to Paladin Energy, a uranium stock that skyrocketed during uranium’s last bull market from less than one cent ($0.007) Australian dollar (AUD) per share at its bottom in April 2003 to AUD $9.57 at its peak in April 2007. It was a peak gain of over 130,000%—a greater than 1,000-fold increase. In other words, a $1,000 investment could have exploded into more than $1 million—had someone picked the bottom and top perfectly. Of course, that is not realistic, but as we can see in the chart below, even being within a year of the absolute bottom and top would have been enough to generate some phenomenal returns. Other uranium stocks also multiplied their share prices during the last bull market. However, Paladin was a rare and unique example. It was the best-performing company in the industry during the previous cycle. However, as stunning as Paladin’s performance was, it’s important to remember that past performance does not indicate future results—for any investment. I suspect it won’t be long before Western governments turn to nuclear energy in a big way. There are indications they are already doing that. In short, the Green Scam delusion is an enormous market distortion—a blessing in disguise. Distortions in the market allow shrewd speculators to get positioned for big potential profits as they collide with reality. It’s making uranium’s already attractive supply/demand situation even more appealing. Uranium mining stocks stand to be a primary beneficiary of this trend. In short, it is difficult for producers to ramp up production while uranium demand is rising. It often takes years for them to catch up. As a result, price is the only way for the market to resolve itself. That’s why the uranium price can have extraordinary spikes. However, the uranium market often doesn’t just settle into equilibrium during these periods. The uranium price often overshoots where it needs to go to balance the market, creating an enormous bull market. It’s a cycle that has played out three times before, and I think it will occur again soon. Looking at the Big Picture for uranium, I see a precarious supply situation, a long lead time to develop new mines (roughly ten years), dwindling inventories, and an unstable geopolitical situation in which countries are scrambling to secure their energy supplies. Yet, at the same time, there is growing (inflexible) demand for new nuclear power plants. With supply shrinking and demand rising, I think the stage is set for uranium prices to overshoot to the upside, just as we saw in the previous three bull market cycles with similar dynamics. The energy markets aren’t the only place where massive disruptions are unfolding. A dangerous combination of sky-high debt, relentless money printing, and deep cultural and political shifts is creating unprecedented economic instability. We are entering an era of volatility unlike anything we’ve seen in modern history—and those who fail to prepare could see their wealth and freedom evaporate.

Title: Exclusive — Nate Morris: America Has to Fight Back Against the Climate Change, 'ESG Mafia'

Kentucky businessman and potential Senate Republican candidate Nate Morris on Breitbart News Saturday said that America has to fight back against the environment, social, and governance (ESG) “mafia,” noting how large Wall Street firms push leftist policies on corporations. Morris spoke to Breitbart News Saturday host Matthew Boyle as he considers a potential run for Senate to replace the retiring Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY). The Kentucky businessman, who founded a waste management company, said that the pressure he received to back ESG policies was like nothing else, noting that the waste management business often has mafia connections, citing the hit television show the Sopranos. “I’ve never seen extortion like what I saw with the ESG mafia and the thugs that try to push corporate America into doing things that satisfy a political agenda,” Morris said on Breitbart News Saturday. ESG was one of the major vectors by which Wall Street firms, namely asset managers such as BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street, could push publicly listed companies to back leftist policies such as anti-climate change policies, diversity quotas, among others. Companies, facing a backlash, stopped employing these controversial policies. Morris then said he invested in Strive, a firm backed by Vivek Ramaswamy, that seeks to push anti-ESG policies, and challenge BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street. “We got to fight the ESG mafia that has been coming against our corporate leaders as an extension of politics to satisfy the leftist agenda,” he remarked. Morris said that the country needs to expose “ESG for the scam it is.” Breitbart News Saturday airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Eastern.

Title: MERCK INVESTOR ALERT: Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP Announces that Merck & Co., Inc. Investors with Substantial Losses Have Opportunity to Lead Class Action Lawsuit - MRK

February 22, 2025 17:15 ET | Source: Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP SAN DIEGO, Feb. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP announces that purchasers or acquirers of Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK) securities between February 3, 2022 and February 3, 2025, all dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), have until April 14, 2025 to seek appointment as lead plaintiff of the Merck class action lawsuit. Captioned Cronin v. Merck & Co., Inc., No. 25-cv-01208 (D.N.J.), the Merck class action lawsuit charges Merck as well as certain of Merck’s top executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the Merck class action lawsuit, please provide your information here: https://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-merck-co-inc-class-action-lawsuit-mrk.html You can also contact attorneys J.C. Sanchez or Jennifer N. Caringal of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at info@rgrdlaw.com. CASE ALLEGATIONS: Merck operates as a healthcare company worldwide. The Merck class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Merck’s projected revenue outlook and anticipated growth of Gardasil while also minimizing risk from competition and drug approval development, such as China’s approval to shift Gardasil to a 2-dose regimen; (ii) in truth, Merck’s optimistic reports of growth, claims of successful consumer activation and education in China, overall ability to drive demand, and efforts to downplay the impact of competition on Gardasil fell short of the reality; and (iii) Merck’s ability to push Gardasil in China had materially diminished. The Merck class action lawsuit further alleges that on July 30, 2024, Merck revealed that in the second quarter of 2024 “there was a significant step down in shipments from our distributor and commercialization partner, Zhifei, into the points of vaccination, compared with prior quarters, resulting in above normal inventory levels at Zhifei.” On this news, the price of Merck stock fell nearly 10%, according to the complaint. Then, on February 4, 2025, the Merck class action lawsuit alleges that Merck published its fourth quarter fiscal year 2024 results, disclosing that “GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 Sales Declined 3% to $8.6 Billion; Excluding the Impact of Foreign Exchange, Sales Declined 2%” “primarily due to lower demand in China, partially offset by higher demand in most international regions, particularly in Japan.” On this news, the price of Merck stock fell more than 9%, according to the complaint. THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired Merck securities during the Class Period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the Merck class action lawsuit.

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon just sold a massive amount of his company’s stock. New SEC filings show Dimon sold a total of 866,361 shares at a price of $269.83 on Thursday, worth a whopping $233.77 million. According to the SEC Form 4 filing, the shares sold are attributed to various entities including his family, GRATs, LLCs, and his spouse. As Dimon executed the sale on February 20th, shares of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) sank from record highs at around $278 down to $266. In February of last year, Dimon initiated his first-ever sale of the company’s stock since becoming CEO in 2005. He then executed another sale in April, completing a combined $182 million in sales in 2024. Although Dimon has not made public comments on the sales, a company filing said they’re part of a predetermined plan for “financial diversification and tax-planning purposes” and that Dimon “continues to believe the company’s prospects are very strong and his stake in the company will remain very significant.” Shares of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) have surged 44% in the last year amid a broad spike in bank stocks, driven by a resilient economy and record-breaking earnings.

Title: Software engineering job openings hit 5-year low amid industry shift
URL: https://www.techspot.com/news/106878-software-engineering-job-openings-plummet-35-five-year.html
Time Published: 2025-02-22T15:50:00Z
Full Content:
Cutting corners: The software engineering job market has experienced a significant downturn, with job openings hitting a five-year low, according to an analysis of data from Indeed by Practical Engineer. The statistics reveal a stark 35 percent decrease in software developer job listings compared to five years ago, marking a dramatic shift in the industry's employment landscape. This decline is particularly noteworthy when compared to other sectors. While the overall job market has seen a 10 percent increase in listings since February 2020, software development positions have plummeted. This contrasts sharply with growth in areas such as construction (25 percent), accounting (24 percent), and electrical engineering (20 percent). The software development sector has also experienced very volatile fluctuations in recent years. Job listings more than doubled during the pandemic-era boom of 2021 and 2022, outpacing all other industries. However, this surge was followed by an equally dramatic fall, with current vacancy numbers 3.5 times lower than their mid-2022 peak. Trend in software development job postings in various countries - Indeed.com data as compiled by Fred / Practical Engineer Several factors contribute to this decline. The end of zero-percent interest rates has had a significant impact on the tech industry, affecting hiring practices, venture capital funding, and the survival of tech startups. However, this alone doesn't explain the hiring slowdown and layoffs at highly profitable Big Tech companies like Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Google, according to author Gergely Orosz. He posits that many companies may still be adjusting after over-recruiting in 2021-2022, leading to a more cautious approach to hiring. Additionally, the rise of generative AI and LLMs may be influencing the job market. These technologies have shown particular promise in coding – 75 percent of engineers reported the use of AI coding tools in a recent survey. Some speculate that companies might be adopting a "wait and see" approach, assessing the potential productivity gains from these tools before expanding their engineering teams. Salesforce's recent decision to keep its software engineering headcount flat while reporting a 30 percent productivity gain from AI tools exemplifies this trend. However, this also raises questions about product development and market fit, as the company simultaneously plans to hire additional salespeople. The emergence of highly efficient small teams at companies like Linear and Bluesky challenges traditional notions of engineering team size. These companies have achieved significant user bases and product adoption with remarkably small engineering teams, suggesting a potential shift toward leaner, more efficient development processes. All job postings on Indeed vs software development job postings - Indeed.com data as compiled by Fred / Practical Engineer Orosz also points out that Indeed's data may not provide a complete picture of the job market. The platform may be losing popularity for posting software engineering jobs, particularly among startups and some Big Tech companies. For instance, Microsoft lists more software-related jobs on its own site than are reflected in Indeed's data. So, while the Indeed data should be considered directionally correct, indicating a genuine decrease in developer job listings, it may not fully represent hiring trends in startups or accurately track Big Tech hiring. Still, it is clear that the software engineering job market is undergoing significant changes, influenced by economic factors, technological advancements, and evolving company strategies.

It’s halftime at Twickenham and Scotland lead England 10-7. Thank you for your company today. Ireland win in Cardiff and all roads lead to a meeting with France at the Aviva Stadium on Saturday week. Man of the match Jamison Gibson-Park 🗣 "They're an unbelievable team, a proud nation, they showed that today."🗣 "It would be a dangerous thing to do to come over here with preconceived ideas."Player of the Match Jamison Gibson-Park after Ireland's battling win in Cardiff. #WALvIRE | #GuinnessM6N pic.twitter.com/Lgv9nrNqt5 MATCH REPORT: Gerry Thornley has his say. “The home side were, as expected, much improved; beyond recognition in truth. As was always liable to be the case, Matt Sherratt had injected enthusiasm, energy and no little cohesion in his first game in charge. Their set pieces were strong and with a much more balanced 9-10-12-13 combination their attack had variety, shape and width. Ireland’s initially confident and smooth start unravelled in large part through ill-discipline and especially scrum penalties. This was compounded by Garry Ringrose incurring a red card following a bunker review for his 35th-minute high hit on Ben Thomas, and Ireland were relieved and indebted to this being a 20-minute red card, not least as Bundee Aki was an ideal replacement.” You can read the full match report here Scotland lead England 10-7 at Twickenham after 24 minutes. James Lowe produced another brilliant performance. He’s what he had to say about a tough afternoon in Cardiff. One of Ireland's key men yet again this afternoon.Great to chat to James Lowe live from Cardiff.#WALvIRE | #GuinnessM6N pic.twitter.com/EM4moAonb0 PLAYER RATINGS: Johnny Watterson gives James Lowe, Jamison Gibson-Park and Jack Conan 8/10. You can read them here A fitting tribute Not sure Finlay Bealham, gets enough credit! Again If you like what you see, please like share and follow, cause I've f#%k all other reasons to do them! 🙏❤️#SixNations #WalvIre @IrishRugby #FinlayBealham #Rugby pic.twitter.com/4dyhpxFZf1 Easterby: “We’re pleased with the result. There’s lots of things we could have done better. I’m pleased with how we got ourselves out of a hole.” ⌚️ Sam Prendergast slotted the three points for Ireland against Wales to steer his side to a win and a Triple Crown in Cardiff 🙌#Breitling #DefiningMoment @Breitling pic.twitter.com/MvYnOUZPWh Watching the Andrew Porter incident again. No wrap from replacement tighthead prop Thomas his arm in tucked and even though it is chest to shoulder, it is not a legitimate attempt to tackle. Therefore should have been a yellow card. Johnny Watterson’s player ratings are going through the subbing machine and will be available here presently. Simon Easterby, calm and measured in victory. Acknowledged some of the shortcomings, gave credit to Wales, which they deserved and pointed to the fact that his tea showed character to see out a match that got sticky. 𝐓𝐫𝐢𝐩𝐥𝐞 𝐂𝐫𝐨𝐰𝐧 𝐖𝐢𝐧𝐧𝐞𝐫𝐬 🤩#GuinnessM6N @IrishRugby pic.twitter.com/SRbft74lqH Garry Ringrose yellow card that was upgraded to red Garry Ringrose's tackle upgraded to a 20-minute red card. #WALvIRE Ireland will be back to 15 men 10 minutes into the second half. pic.twitter.com/1hPGQcL0wP 🤩 Watch for the rugby, stay for the finish from Tom Rogers 😍#GuinnessW6N @WelshRugbyUnion pic.twitter.com/UVZrZPxfJG The Power of Jack Conan 😮‍💨💪#GuinnessM6N @IrishRugby pic.twitter.com/aIUIWgCk6d IT’s only fair that we show the two that Wales scored. 😎 Captain Jac takes Wales into the lead 💪#GuinnessM6N @WelshRugbyUnion pic.twitter.com/df7CgDSWjG Let’s have a look at Ireland’s tries. A stunning cross-field kick to James Lowe! Jamie Osborne is there to collect the ball and score!! #GuinnessW6N pic.twitter.com/5Eq7cq0Lz8 Johnny Watterson’s player ratings, lot of red pen you’d suspect, Gerry Thornley’s match report and all the reaction coming here. That’s a 14th Triple Crown for Ireland. MATCH SNYOPSIS: Ireland led 7-0, trailed 13-10 at half-time and 18-10 early in the second half, before Gibson-Park, Lowe and Osborne combined for the latter’s try and then Prendergast’s boot saw them home. Ringrose had a yellow card upgraded to a red card. Ireland win a Triple Crown. Performance was well below par, individually and collectively. To Ireland the spoils, including a Triple Crown but to Wales the plaudits in performance terms. Coming off a 14-match losing streak, that’s now gone to 15, and given very little hope but the home side was so courageous in defeat, playing some cracking attacking rugby to boot. Ireland will be relieved rather than happy. Finlay Bealham, Ryan Baird and Bundee Aki made a huge difference on their arrival. Full-time: Wales 18 Ireland 27 80 mins: Prendergast takes on long range penalty that drops short after Beirne won a ruck penalty. Wales with one last effort in chasing a bonus point. 77 mins: PENALTY, Prendergast. Great counter-ruck from Ireland led by van der Flier supported by Gus McCarthy and Jack Boyle leads to a penalty. Henshaw and Baird with key tackles in the build-up. Prendergast is unerring. Gibson-Park announced as man of the match. No argument. Brilliant again. Conor Murray on at scrumhalf Wales 18 Ireland 27 75 mins: Gus McCarthy on for captain, Sheehan. Brilliant again from Osborne in tidying up. Wales 18 Ireland 24 72 mins: Brilliant response from Wales and Ellis Mee is deemed to have scored a try by referee Ridley. His on-field decision is try. Tempest the TMO is rocking and rolling the angle, I think his hand is in touch. 47 angles later. Knock-on. Hits short and it’s a knock-on. That’s unfortunate for Wales. Another superb passage of play in attack. Ireland are very, very lucky. Good work from Hansen, who’s now been replaced by Jack Crowley and Osborne. Boyle and Bealham win a scrum penalty. Crowley is on at fullback, Osborne moves to the wing. Wales 18 Ireland 24 Jack Boyle becomes the 12th St Michael’s College old boy to be capped at senior level by Ireland; 11 have been in the last decade. Michael’s capped players, year of debut and number of caps. 1984 - Derek McGrath (5) 2014 - Noel Reid (1) 2016 - Dan Leavy (11) *Luke McGrath (19) 2017 - Rory O’Loughlin (1) *James Ryan (70) 2018 - *Ross Byrne (22) 2020 - *Ronan Kelleher (39) *Max Deegan (2) 2021 - *Ryan Baird (25) *Harry Byrne (4) 2025 - *Jack Boyle (1) * - still active 69 mins: PENALTY, Prendergast. A blood splattered Bundee Aki wins a penalty at a ruck, clamped on after Sheehan’s tackle. Prendergast is going to take it on. It’s two metres inside the Welsh half. The outhalf strikes it superbly. Gibson-Park with a brilliant relieving kick from the re-start. Jack Boyle is on for his debut. Wales 18 Ireland 24 68 mins: Porter is hit in the head by Thomas, referee thinks it’s chest. Ian Tempest agrees. NO further sanction. NO foul play. Wales 18 Ireland 21 64 mins: PENALTY Prendergast. Wonderful catch and kick from Lowe. Ryan back on for McCarthy. Gibson-Park with a wonderful sniping break. Hansen denied a try, held up brilliantly by Murray and Morgan. Ireland were on penalty advantage. Hansen might have given Sheehan a scoring pass in hindsight. The Irish hooker and captain asks Prendergast to kick the penalty and the young outhalf bisects the posts. Wales 18 Ireland 21 62 mins: It’s another brilliant counter-attack from Wales who are playing without fear. Width to their attack, first instinct is to offload. Joe Roberts is on for try scorer Tom Rogers. Free-kick Ireland ats scrum, the first after Welsh loosehead Nicky Smith has gone off. Wales 18 Ireland 18 58 mins: Osborne has done superbly in the air for the most part. It’s been a superb post interval response from Easterby’s side. The one caveat is the discipline. 11 penalties now, the latest for a neck roll. Wales 18 Ireland 18 55 mins: TRY OSBORNE. That’s a great reaction from Ireland. On penalty advantage Ireland pack Sheehan, O’Mahony X2, Baird carry and Gibson-Park with a cross-kick with the boot is tapped back brilliantly by Lowe into the waiting arms of Osborne. Prendergast misses the conversion. It’s all tied up. Wales 18 Ireland 18 53 mins: Ireland have conceded nine penalties to date. Fantastic piece of skill from Prendergast, brilliant spiral for a 50/22 after great play from Osborne. Ireland deep inside the Welsh 22. Wales 18 Ireland 13 52 mins: Henry Thomas on for WillGriff John for Wales. McCarthy with a superb play. Ireland scrum. Anscombe off for a HIA. Jarrod Evans is on. No referee changes his mind. Penalty Wales. Wales 18 Ireland 13 50 mins: McCarthy is back on for Ryan having passed his HIA. Wales with some lovely running angles and offloading but Henshaw comes up with a brilliant turnover. Great line kick from Prendergast and Ireland are back up to 15 players, as Aki replaces Ringrose. Wales 18 Ireland 13 47 mins: PENALTY Prendergast. Ireland win a scrum penalty inside the Welsh 22, more direct around the fringes, where there is space. Baird involved several times. Finlay Bealham on for Clarkson. Wales 18 Ireland 13 42 mins: ROGERS TRY. Ireland are panicky. Osborne kicks away possession, Sheehan gives away possession and it all ends in a try for TOM ROGERS. Flamboyant finish. Ireland again the architect of their downfall. Anscombe misses the conversion. Conan off with an injury. Ryan Baird, who didn’t expect to play today, is on. Wales 18 Ireland 10 Ireland will have to survive another 10-minutes a man down until Ringrose’s 20-minute red card is played out and they can bring on Bundee Aki. Referee Ridley confirms the red card ruling as the second half gets under way. “High degree of danger and no mitigation.” James Ryan is on for McCarthy (HIA) Okay, how to unpack that. Ireland conceded four scrum penalties, two against Porter, two against Clarkson. Apart from the opening 15-minutes, they have been very disjointed, dogged by basic mistakes, handling hasn’t been good and some of the decision making has been flawed too. They will rue that missed opportunity when Osborne’s pass to Ringrose went to turf as a try beckoned. That would have out them 17-3 up. Wales though deserve hue credit for the manner in which they have hung around and to be honest played the better attacking rugby. They’ve troubled Ireland particularly out wide. Ireland will need to be a lot more precise and composed in possession. They’ll need to sort out the scrum, be better disciplined and connected in attack and defence. The high point of the Irish half from an Irish perspective The Power of Jack Conan 😮‍💨💪#GuinnessM6N @IrishRugby pic.twitter.com/aIUIWgCk6d RED CARD: Ireland’s Garry Ringrose’s yellow card has been upgraded to a 20-minute red card. Head on head contact on Ben Thomas. The correct decision. Needed to be lower. Half-time: Wales 13 Ireland 10 40(+2) mins: TRY Morgan. Wales on penalty advantage from the lineout after Ireland come in from the side at the maul; van der Flier pinged. Clarkson saved a try with a great tackle. Anscombe kicks the penalty to the corner. Rowlands takes, backs join maul. Wales pound the Irish line, stopped by millimetres until captain, Morgan forces his way over. Anscombe converts. Wales have deserved that. Wales 13 Ireland 10 36 mins: Prendergast hits an upright with a long-range penalty. Superbly struck but the outhalf then knocks on a high ball. Ireland are at sixes and sevens defensively, looking a little ragged on both sides of the ball and there are simply too many missed straight up tackles. Ireland concede a fourth scrum penalty. Leads to a schemozzle. Seven penalties Ireland have conceded, four at scrum time. Wales 6 Ireland 10 31 mins: Ireland are guilty of ball watching at a ruck. Van der Flier protects the ball, but no one goes in to move it on in the absence of Gibson-Park and Ireland penalised for holding on. Osborne with a superb tackle at Wales go on the attack again. They are inside the Irish 22. Ireland are penalised, Ringrose not rolling away. The television match official Ian Tempest advises the referee Christophe Ridley to look at a Ringrose tackle previously. Ringrose receives a yellow card and it will be reviewed by FPRO, Matteo Liperini (Italy). 34 mins: Anscombe kicks the penalty. Wales 6 Ireland 10 30 mins: Should have been a try for Ireland, great work by McCarthy and Peter O’Mahony in the build-up, the visitors sweep wide, but Osborne throws a poor pass. Ringrose was in for a walk in try, if the pass had gone to hand. A long pass was required but Osborne slapping the turf tells you he felt he should have done better. Smith is back in the front row. Scrum is completed. Wales 3 Ireland 10 27 mins: Good work from Ireland, good strike, Conan gets off the base of the scrum superbly and Lowe completes the clearance with his left foot. Wales though are back on the attack and they’re playing some lovely rugby. Wales 3 Ireland 10 24 mins: A poor enough re-start from Prendergast, too far and Tomos Williams with a superb clearance into the Irish half. Ireland kick away possession, Wales get it to the edge. Sheehan rescues his team by covering a kick through but Osborne doesn’t get much on the clearance. Brilliant work from Wales down the touchline but Williams knocks on what would have been a try scoring pass from Jac Morgan. That’s a huge let off for Ireland. Wales 3 Ireland 10 22 mins: Brilliant take from Beirne at the re-start, Sheehan knocked on though and Ireland are caught offside. Anscombe kicks the easy penalty. Wales 3 Ireland 10 19 mins: PENALTY, Prendergast. Gareth Thomas (Ospreys) on for Nicky Smith at loosehead prop. We’re about to have another scrum. Wales 3-0 up on penalties. What will the change do? Ireland win a scrum penalty. Thomas, the new boy penalised. Prendergast points at the posts and thumps it over. Wales 0 Ireland 10 15 mins: Lovely fluency from Ireland in attack, going from one touchline to the other. Move ends when Lowe goes through a gap but loses the ball in contact seven metres from the Welsh line. Wales win a third scrum penalty. Clarkson called again, this time by Gianluca Gnecchi, the other assistant referee. Worrying for Ireland. All three officials have called a scrum penalty against Ireland. Wales 0 Ireland 7 11 mins: Ireland are penalised at the second scrum, this time Thomas Clarkson for dropping his bind. Josh van der Flier reclaims an overthrow at a lineout. Hansen kicks through but Blair Murray rescues Wales and the home side clears. Good work from Lowe and Ringrose. Prendergast kicks the ball away. Wales 0 Ireland 7 8 mins: Good clearance from Jamison Gibson-Park from the re-start, Tom Rogers beats Jamie Osborne to Gareth Anscombe’s up and under. Wales get some continuity. The home side penalised, Elliot Dee for a tip tackle on a ruck clear-out. Tadhg Beirne inverted. Ireland clear but Henshaw knocks on from the long throw over the back. Wales 0 Ireland 7 6 mins: TRY Jack Conan. Superb from Conan, great power and a one-handed fend to stretch and reach over the Welsh line. Prendergast kicks the conversion. Wales 0 Ireland 7 5 mins: Good direct running from Ireland, Taulupe Faletau penalised two metres from his line. The visitors take it off the tail. Joe McCarthy great carry, James Lowe too. Wales 0 Ireland 0 4 mins: A bit of aerial tennis ends in a Welsh knock-on and the first scrum of the match. Collapses. Re-set. Andrew Porter penalised. Call came in from assistant referee Nika Amashukeli. Nothing in it. Ball had gone. Should have been play on. Jack Conan wins turnover. Mack Hansen counter-ruck. Garry Ringrose great grubber for a 50/22. Wales 0 Ireland 0 Ireland kickoff through Sam Prendergast. Roof closed, wonderful atmosphere, passionate rendition of the anthems. Let’s go.

Time for the anthems. Tommy Bowe knows a thing or two about Irish and Welsh rugby. What is the secret to Ireland's rugby success? 🤔@TommyBowe has his say 🗣️ #BBCRugby #SixNations pic.twitter.com/C0YdCVQPrL Right a little under half an hour to go to kickoff. Johnny Watterson will have green and red markers as he does the Player Ratings post match, Gerry Thornley will have his match report and I’ll keep you up to date with all the post match reaction. Stay here and all that will be coming your way on the blog. We will link everything to this blog. Statistics, the last refuge of the scoundrel. And I’d know. One that caught the eye was that Ireland had just 47% possession in their first two games – the second lowest after Italy (44%) – but they have enjoyed more territory (56%) than any other side and made more entries into the opposition 22 (22) than anyone else. Other reasons to be cheerful from an Irish perspective. Wales have conceded the most (26) and been awarded the fewest (14) penalties of any side in the Six Nations. We'll wear our new alternate white kit in Cardiff on Saturday to help supporters impacted by colour blindness! ⚪️#TeamOfUs pic.twitter.com/h1D22FiGck The reason that Ireland will wear their changed strip today. In a significant move to support spectators and viewers with colour vision deficiency (CVD), Ireland will wear their new alternate white kit against Wales. This decision, driven by new World Rugby regulations, aims to prevent kit clashes that can be problematic for those affected by CVD. Colour vision deficiency, commonly known as colour blindness, affects approximately one in 12 men and one in 200 women. The traditional red jerseys of Wales and the green jerseys of Ireland create a challenging visual scenario for those with CVD, making it difficult to distinguish between the two teams on the pitch.

Referee: Christophe Ridley (England) Assistant Referees: Nika Amashukeli (Georgia), Gianluca Gnecchi (Italy) TMO: Ian Tempest (England) FPRO: Matteo Liperini (Italy) BREAKING NEWS: Cian Prendergast has had to withdraw from the Ireland bench because of illness and his place goes to Ryan Baird. That’s very unfortunate for the Connacht captain but Ireland are fortunate to have such an accomplished stand-in. A word from the coaches. Simon Easterby: “Playing Wales in Cardiff is one of the great tests and we know the challenge that awaits us. “With a new coaching set-up in place, Wales will be re-energised and determined to impress in front of a vocal home support. “There will also be a huge Irish travelling support which, when added to the closed roof and the great respect and rivalry between the two nations, will add to an electric atmosphere.” He added: “We have made a few changes to the squad this week, some of which were enforced, and we’re confident that the 23 we have selected are primed and ready to go. “Dan’s (Sheehan) selection as captain is recognition of his high standing within the squad, both on and off the pitch. I have no doubt that he will relish the opportunity to lead Ireland for the first time. “Equally, I would also like to congratulate Jack Boyle on his inclusion in the matchday squad for the first time. Jack has impressed for his province Leinster, and in the national training camps over the last number of months, and he’s a young forward with a bright future.” Wales interim head coach Matt Sherratt: “We’re looking forward to the challenge of facing Ireland. We have spoken this week about being brave, but not reckless and making sure everyone knows their roles. “We also know that keeping our discipline will be huge. Everyone is excited for our first home game of the Six Nations. “The atmosphere Wales fans create at the Principality Stadium is incredible, and playing at home is something the players really look forward to.” Love the sentiment behind this image.

C'mon @IrishRugby - you got this!#TeamOfUs #ShouldertoShoulder pic.twitter.com/RKZR9pBOMK For those of us who have been around a while (!) I remember the Triple Crowns of 1982 and 1985 - our 5th and 6th ever in history. Glory days ! Today we’ll be going for our 8th this century after 04, 06, 07, 09, 18, 22 & 23. @IrishRugby has come a long way …. Welsh Twitter is certainly going all-in on the victory of the Wales Under-20 side as a positive harbinger for this afternoon’s game at the Principality Stadium. I am half expecting to see them point to the fact that the Irish 20s and the senior side were/are in the changed white, and I use that description loosely, strip. Maybe it’s an omen. A little under an hour and a half to go to kickoff in Cardiff. Just enough time to grab a bite and a drink of choice and read Gerry Thornley’s preview Former Wales great Jonathan Davies things that the Welsh 20s can inspire their senior brethern. Great win for Wales U20s just the boost Welsh rugby needed. 👍💪👏👏👏 Time to rip the plaster off the Ireland Under-20s performance in the 20-12 defeat to Wales at Rodney Parade last night. Once again they dominated territory and possession but the same old failings came back to haunt them in the opposition 22, leaving behind oodles of points. To their credit Wales defended with courage and grit, making over 228 tackles to their opponents 67 but the visitors made that job easier with an attack that lacked shape and cohesion and a multitude of handling errors. Nathan Johns was in Newport and here’s his thoughts on Ireland’s shortcomings. The best of both worlds for one Welsh fan. About to make the long long drove to Monmouth services for a @GreggsOfficial And while I’m in the area i thought i might catch Wales playing Ireland in the #GuinnessM6N Say hi if you’re about! pic.twitter.com/S1EIYYQqlp Go well Ireland 🙌#SUAF ☘️ | @SixNationsRugby | #WALvIRE pic.twitter.com/TGkgHmnghd The bookmakers have Ireland as 25-point favourites on the handicap for today’s game and offer Wales at 14/1 against on a straight bet, which is long, long, long odds in a two-horse race to mix sporting metaphors. However, the Irish side would do well to remember that the tournament has had some famous upsets in the past, starting on the opening weekend on the first ever Six Nations in 2000. Scotland, the defending Fix Nations champions, travelled to the Stadio Flaminio in Rome to face an Italian side playing their first ever game in the Six Nations and lost 34-20. Italy’s, Argentine born outhalf, Diego Dominguez kicked 29-points. Wales beat raging hot favourites England 31-30 at Wembley in 1999 to deny them a Grand Slam. A late try by Scott Gibbs gave Wales the win and Scotland the title on points’ difference. In 2019 Ireland had just toppled world champions New Zealand in an unbeaten series of matches in November and sat on a run of 12 home wins on the bounce and 18 victories from their past 19 games. England, the visitors, hadn’t scored a try in Ireland in eight years, so it was no wonder that Joe Schmidt’s men down as heavy favourites on the day. England, under Eddie Jones, cruised home 32-20 for only their second win in Dublin since 2003. Italy enjoyed two huge upset wins in Rome, the first in 2011 when the squeezed-out France 22-21 with Mirco Bergamasco the hero, while two years later it was Ireland that suffered a similar fate losing 22-15 in the last game of Declan Kidney’s tenure as head coach. When Scotland beat England 11-6 at Twickenham in 2021, they were 9/2 underdogs with their hosts 1/6 to win that match. England were the reigning champions and it was a first win for the Scots in 38 years at the London venue. Good news and bad news today. Bad news is I’ll miss the rugby because we’re racing 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 Good news is… I’ll miss the rugby because we’re racing 🤣 Come on boys 💪🙏🏉 #WALvIRE pic.twitter.com/Gpy9NIL9am Hello and welcome to the Irish Times blog for today’s Six Nations match at the Principality stadium. John O’Sullivan here and I’ll be taking you through the afternoon, before, during and after the game. We have some exclusive content too, not just what’s been on the website or in the newspaper. Will Wales get the big game bounce under new management with Cardiff coach Matt Sherratt taking over in an interim capacity following Warren Gatland’s departure, a decision based on mutual agreement between the New Zealander and the Welsh Rugby Union? The home supporters will be hoping that’s a fervent, ‘yes.’ Ireland are also under an interim coach, albeit in happier circumstances, in Simon Easterby, who is caretaking while Andy Farrell devotes himself to the British & Irish Lions head coach’s role. Not sure, when, if ever you would have had two countries facing one another in a Six Nations clash under interim head coaches. That’s not the only similarity. Wales and Ireland share a common identity prior to today’s match as the only two sides capable of winning the Triple Crown in this season’s Six Nations Championship. Ireland have safely negotiated two thirds of that remit with victories over England and Scotland, while for Wales this is the first leg of the treble with games against England and Scotland to come. Ireland take on Wales this afternoon as they look to keep their perfect start to this year’s Six Nations campaign going and claim the Triple Crown, although eyes are firmly set on the bigger prize with a third championship in a row and a grand slam within their sights. Simon Easterby has made seven changes to his side for the game with Dan Sheehan set to captain his country for the first time. Ireland come into the game as heavy favourites after the poor start Wales have had to the tournament and the departure of Warren Gatland.

Title: Here's what to know about Germany's election this Sunday
URL: https://www.npr.org/2025/02/22/g-s1-50098/germany-election-chancellor-parliament-afd

Rob Schmitz People walk past a truck with an election campaign poster featuring Friedrich Merz, leader of conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), in Oberhausen, Germany, on Feb. 21. VOLKER HARTMANN/AFP via Getty Images hide caption BERLIN — An economic slump, an immigration crisis and the lifting of a security blanket provided for decades by its most powerful ally are on the minds of German voters as they head to the polls for Sunday's national parliamentary election. The general election of the Bundestag, Germany's lower house of parliament, was not supposed to come until September of this year. But on Nov. 6, just a day after American voters elected Donald Trump to a second term in office, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz fired his finance minister after months of squabbling over how to revive Germany's struggling economy, leading to the collapse of Scholz's three-party coalition government and the call for a snap election. The latest polling data shows Scholz's Social Democrats in third place among voters (16%), behind the far-right Alternative for Germany or AfD Party (20%) and the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) alongside its Bavarian sister CSU party (29%). The CDU will likely emerge as the largest vote-getter and thus be in the position of forming a coalition government with one or two other parties. Since all of Germany's mainstream parties have vowed not to govern with the AfD, which is under domestic surveillance for the threat it poses to Germany's democracy, the CDU's candidate for chancellor, Friedrich Merz, may have a difficult time forming a coalition government. "I'm just worried that after the election that it will take maybe two months for a coalition government to form," says Jana Puglierin, director of the Berlin office at the European Council on Foreign Relations. "Once the coalition is in place, they need to draft a budget. And if we are very lucky, all of this will be done before the parliamentary summer break." The expected drawn-out German political timetable worries observers because of the next government's urgency to deal with multiple crises that face Europe's largest economy. These include an economic recession, a national debate over migration, and, perhaps most importantly, how to navigate a new global security order now that the Trump administration appears to be working with Russia to bring an end to Moscow's war in Ukraine without inviting Europe or Ukraine to the negotiating table. Whichever parties form the next coalition government in Berlin, Merz remains Scholz's likely successor. He is a 69-year-old conservative who hails from a family of lawyers. In addition to serving as a CDU member of parliament, Merz has also worked as a corporate lawyer and as a member of the supervisory board for the German branch of Blackrock, the largest asset management company in the world. Merz's longtime colleague Norbert Röttgen, who also serves as a CDU member of Germany's parliament, says Merz is a politician of conviction. Röttgen has known Merz for more than 30 years. The two entered parliament together and have worked side by side through successive governments. He says Merz has strong beliefs: "Societally conservative, traditional values and a strong, free-market conviction that liberal markets serve the people," says Röttgen. "And he is a fundamental pro-European trans-Atlanticist." Röttgen says Merz's convictions will prove useful as Germany is faced with difficult decisions after the United States has signaled changes in how it sees its European allies. The outgoing administration has not helped build a cohesive way forward for Europe on Ukraine, Puglierin says. "I think Merz, by disposition, would be more open to also support Ukraine more decisively," says Puglierin. "But he has to work in a framework. He will be constrained by his coalition partner and also by the German population." After coalition talks and tackling a budget that the Scholz administration left on the table, it might take months before Merz has the opportunity to put his mark on Germany, Puglierien says. Hints of how he will lead, though, have trickled out in recent weeks, as Merz got into trouble with his own party when he agreed to work with the AfD late last month to pass a motion that would have toughened up Germany's immigration policy. The motion failed after significant backlash against Merz for agreeing to work with a party seen by mainstream political parties as anti-democratic. Voter Ute Wolters, a 64-year-old architect from Lower Saxony, worries about Merz's potential leadership. "He claims to be up to the job, and we know he's a good businessman, but I worry he will go back on his promise to never enter into a coalition government with the AfD," she says, referring to repeated vows Merz has made throughout the campaign. Another voter, Ulrich Hinz, a 74-year-old retired businessman from Frankfurt, says he thinks Merz's pro-European outlook could help at such a trying time for Germany. "We need a chancellor and a government that is more European and one that can get along better with the French, Italians and the Poles," he says. "That's the only way we are going to be able to keep up with China, Russia, and the United States." Esme Nicholson contributed to this story from Berlin. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor

Title: What Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang thinks about DeepSeek
URL: https://qz.com/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-thinks-deepseek-ai-q4-earnings-1851765905
Time Published: 2025-02-21T21:37:00Z
Full Content:
Nvidia (NVDA-3.69%) chief executive Jensen Huang doesn’t have hard feelings for Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek. After the Hangzhou-based AI startup spooked investors in January, Nvidia’s stock plunged 17%, wiping out nearly $600 billion in value — a record loss for a U.S. company — amid a global selloff of tech stocks. In December, DeepSeek said it used a cluster of just under 2,050 of Nvidia’s reduced-capability H800 chips to train its DeepSeek-V3 model — much less than the tens of thousands of more advanced Nvidia chips U.S. firms are using to train similarly-sized models. The AI startup’s models, which it demonstrated to be on par with those from OpenAI and Meta (META-1.66%), prompted questions over the tens of billions of dollars its U.S. rivals are spending on cutting-edge chips and AI infrastructure. During an interview with DataDirect Networks chief executive Alex Bouzari, Huang said he thinks DeepSeek’s reasoning models, R1, which it released in January ahead of the stock rout, will lead to more demand for computing power, because reasoning is “fairly compute intensive.” “I think the market responded to R1 as in ‘Oh my gosh, AI is finished. It dropped out of the sky, we don’t need to do any computing anymore,’” Huang said. “It’s exactly the opposite.” Huang also noted that R1 is “the world’s first reasoning model that’s open-source,” meaning developers and consumers can freely use it. “It is so incredibly exciting, the energy around the world as a result of R1 becoming open-sourced. Incredible,” Huang said. Earlier this month, JPMorgan U.S. Equity Research (JPM-1.01%) analysts said in a report that DeepSeek is likely to have a positive impact on Nvidia. DeepSeek’s demonstration of cost-efficiency and AI innovation will lead to “strong demand” for higher-performance graphics processing units, or GPUs, the analysts said. Therefore, Nvidia’s leadership in advanced AI chips “should enable them to unlock new use-cases.” Nvidia is expected to report fiscal fourth quarter earnings next week.

Title: Travel Startups Raise $580 Million Over Two Weeks

Subscribe today to keep up with the latest travel industry news. Select a question above or ask something else In the past two weeks, six travel startups have collectively raised $580 million, showcasing ongoing investor interest in travel technology advancements. Companies like Archer Aviation are leading the charge with significant funding aimed at developing flying taxis, with plans for an air taxi network in Los Angeles. Meanwhile, Klook and RoomPriceGenie are leveraging AI and automation to enhance travel experiences and hotel pricing, underscoring a shift towards modernizing traditional travel sectors. Tech companies promising to automate old industries are still getting big investment deals in 2025. Klook, which is modernizing the historically low-tech sector of ticketed experiences, just landed its second large fundraise in the past 18 months. And RoomPriceGenie, despite having several notable competitors, raised $75 million to help hotels automate pricing — an area that’s seen a lot of demand as hotels have been looking to modernize and generate more revenue since the pandemic. While startups developing flying taxis and renewable jet fuel are not producing much revenue yet, they’re raking in large amounts of money with the promise of big business in the future. Six travel startups raised nearly $580 million over the past two weeks. Archer Aviation, which is developing a flying taxi for commercial flights and defense clients, has raised $301.8 million. Investors included funds and accounts managed by BlackRock. The company has now raised over $2 billion, including its most recent deal of $430 million in December. The company said the latest fundraise brings its total liquidity to around $1 billion. California-based Archer is developing an electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft called Midnight. It is designed to hold a pilot with four passengers and luggage for urban trips of 20-50 miles at speeds of up to 150 miles per hour. It is powered by six independent battery packs, each supporting a pair of electric engines, the company said. Archer said it now has manufacturing contracts worth over $6 billion. That includes a recent purchasing agreement for up to 100 aircrafts from Soracle — owned by Japan Airlines and Sumitomo Corporation — which plans to operate a flying taxi service in various cities in Japan. The company recently unveiled plans for an air taxi network in Los Angeles ahead of some major sporting events: the World Cup in 2026, the Super Bowl in 2027, and the Summer Olympics in 2028. The network includes vertiports (eVTOL airports) at Los Angeles International Airport, University of Southern California, Orange County, Santa Monica, Hollywood Burbank, Long Beach, and the Van Nuys neighborhood. The company is also planning to establish a vertiport near the SoFi Stadium, home of the Los Angeles football teams Rams and Chargers. The plan is to begin LA network operations in 2026. This is in addition to plans for a network at California airports where Southwest Airlines operates, along with five vertiports in the Bay Area. The funding will go toward the continued development of the company’s aircraft. Klook, an online travel agency for tours and attractions, has raised $100 million The company said that the fundraise brings its valuation to over $1 billion for the first time. Vitruvian Partners led the round. The company last raised $210 million in equity and debt in 2023. Hong Kong-based Klook says it offers hundreds of thousands of ticketed experiences, such as walking tours, in 2,700 destinations globally. The company has also been expanding to offer hotels, trains, and car rentals. The new funding will go toward AI initiatives, such as for enhancing merchant operations, through an expanded partnership with Google Cloud. (See Skift’s story.) RoomPriceGenie, which provides AI-powered pricing tech for hotels, has raised $75 million. The funding comes from Five Elms Capital. Switzerland-based RoomPriceGenie provides a revenue management system for independent hotels and groups. The tech is meant to automate updating room rates based on changing market conditions. Competitors include Duetto, which was acquired by a private equity firm last year. The company says it has more than 3,000 hotel clients in 65 countries. The company also said it appointed Chas Scarantino as CEO. The co-founder and previous CEO, Ari Andricopoulos, is now the chief strategy officer. The funding will go toward expanding internally. Twelve, a renewable jet fuel production startup, has raised $83 million. Investors included DCVC, Amazon (The Climate Pledge Fund), Mitsui & Co., Development Bank of Japan, Japan Hydrogen Fund, Greycroft (Coca-Cola Sustainability Fund), 2551 Capital, SMBC, TPG, Pulse Fund, and others. The company most recently raised a series C round of $200 million in September. The new funding is a mix between an extension of the series C round plus financing to build a production facility. California-based Twelve says its tech generates jet fuel by converting a mix of carbon dioxide from either tanks or the atmosphere, along with water and renewable energy. Airline customers so far include Alaska Airlines and International Airlines Group (IAG), the parent company of British Airways. Superlogic, which helps users apply loyalty points to ticketed experiences, has raised $13.7 million in its series A funding. Superlogic, a trailblazer in experiential rewards technology, today announced a first closing of $13.7 million in its Series A funding round. Led by Powerledger led the round, with support from including Sangha Capital, 10SQ, Nima Capital, Actai Unicorn Fund, Hyla Liquid Venture Fund, Liquid 2 Ventures, Amex Ventures, Galaxy Interactive, Mirabaud Lifestyle Impact and Innovation, Recharge Capital, Dispersion Capital, Sanctor Capital, and more. Miami-based Superlogic provides an AI-powered platform that loyalty programs can use to connect users with experiences tailored to their interests. Spark e-Fuels, which is developing tech to make renewable jet fuel, has raised $2.4 million (€2.3 million) in pre-seed funding. Nucleus Capital led the round, with support from Zero Carbon Capital, IBB Ventures, Chemovator, Voyagers.io, 1.5° Ventures, and a group of angel investors. Spark is focused on building its first e-fuel pilot plant and expanding its team to accelerate technology development and commercialization. The Berlin-based startup is developing tech that converts renewable resources like carbon dioxide, into jet fuel. The funding will go toward building its first pilot production plant and hiring.

Title: Coinbase CEO’s Hot Take: Bitcoin Is Basically A ‘Meme Coin’
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/coinbase-ceos-hot-take-bitcoin-is-basically-a-meme-coin/
Time Published: 2025-02-21T21:00:16Z
Full Content:
Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, has recently made an audacious statement regarding Bitcoin that has caused quite a stir in the crypto industry. He recently proposed that Bitcoin could be regarded as “somewhat of a meme coin,” which sparked a debate among enthusiasts, analysts, and investors. Like meme currencies, Armstrong pointed out that the value of Bitcoin is essentially derived from popular or collective belief. He explained that unlike conventional assets, Bitcoin lacks inherent value connected with actual objects or direct use. Instead, its value is swayed by societal trust and the shared perception of its significance. He also likened Bitcoin to the US dollar, noting that although the dollar’s value has persisted mostly due to mass acceptance and faith in its purchasing power, and it is not connected to the gold standard. This comparison highlights Bitcoin’s status as a store of value rather than a commodity with inherent worth. Armstrong did not intend to undermine Bitcoin’s credibility; however, his statements underscored the expanding influence of meme coins. Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are two cryptocurrencies that have amassed substantial followings despite possessing minimal fundamental utility. On memecoins… Memecoins have generated a lot of buzz recently, and I’ve gotten some questions on how I think about them. I am personally not a memecoin trader (beyond a few test trades), but they’ve become hugely popular. Arguably, they’ve been with us since the beginning –… — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) February 19, 2025 For example, Dogecoin, which originated as a joke, experienced a price increase of over 15,000% in 2021 as a result of social media publicity and endorsements from prominent figures such as Elon Musk. Shiba Inu reached an all-time market cap of around $40 billion. This trend is a reflection of how sentiment and viral appeal can push asset valuation up, much like what Armstrong suggests applies to Bitcoin. Armstrong agreed that, in spite of the comparison, Bitcoin is still the most well-known cryptocurrency. The crypto continues to dominate institutional adoption, regulatory discussions, and long-term investment strategies. Meanwhile, the legitimacy of Bitcoin has been strengthened even more by the trust big financial firms like BlackRock and Fidelity have in the crypto asset. Its limited supply of 21 million coins and decentralized nature also sets it apart from the typical meme coin phenomenon. Armstrong’s statement has fueled discussions about how cryptocurrencies derive their value. Some critics argue that equating Bitcoin to a meme coin undermines its role as “digital gold,” while others believe it accurately describes the evolving nature of financial assets in the internet era.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Target is facing another big DEI lawsuit

Time Published: 2025-02-21T19:44:00Z
Full Content:
Target (TGT-2.71%) was hit with another lawsuit on Thursday, this time by the state of Florida, which accused the retail giant of hiding the risks tied to its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts. The state claims these initiatives sparked a customer backlash that erased billions of dollars from Target’s market value. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Fort Myers, Florida, was brought by the State Board of Administration of Florida, an agency responsible for managing public pension funds, which hold Target stock. Florida alleges that Target misled investors and alienated its core customer base by making false and misleading statements in its financial reports about its DEI and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) mandates. The lawsuit also targets Target CEO Brian Cornell, accusing him of downplaying the scope of customer boycotts following the company’s Pride Month campaign in May 2023. The state claims these boycotts contributed to a prolonged decline in Target’s share price. Target did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The lawsuit is being represented by Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier and America First Legal, a group led by President Donald Trump’s advisor, Stephen Miller. “Corporations that push radical leftist ideology at the expense of financial returns jeopardize the retirement security of Florida’s first responders and teachers,” Uthmeier said in a statement. “My office will stridently pursue corporate reform so that companies get back to the business of doing business — not offensive political theatre.” This is America First Legal’s second lawsuit against Target. Earlier this month, the City of Riviera Beach Police Pension Fund in Florida filed a similar lawsuit. The legal actions come as Target, along with other major corporations such as Walmart (WMT-2.44%), McDonald’s (MCD+0.64%), and Meta (META-1.66%), have recently scaled back their DEI initiatives.

Title: Jensen Huang Donates a Lifeline to San Francisco’s Last Nonprofit Arts College

Time Published: 2025-02-21T19:37:16Z

David Howse, president of the California College of the Arts (CCA), delivered grim news last summer to his faculty and students: given rapidly declining enrollment, the college’s future was in serious peril. Less than a year later, the nonprofit arts college has received a lifeline thanks to the philanthropy of Nvidia (NVDA) founder and CEO Jensen Huang. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. The Jen-Hsun (Jensen Huang’s Chinese name) and Lori Huang Foundation, founded by Huang and his wife nearly two decades ago, is donating a staggering $22.5 million to the San Francisco-based school—the largest gift in its history. The donation matches additional funds raised from other individuals and entities connected to either the college or local arts and tech communities, giving the CCA a total of nearly $45 million to address its financial struggles. Huang’s foundation “saw an opportunity both to support CCA in this time of need and also to challenge others to rise to the moment,” said Howse in a statement. Like other nonprofit arts colleges across the U.S., CCA has faced mounting challenges in recent years amid a dramatic drop-off in enrollment exacerbated by demographic factors and the Covid-19 pandemic. In August, the school announced a series of cost-cutting measures, such as layoffs, as it faced a $20 million deficit. Besides addressing its deficit, CCA said its new funds will be earmarked for program launches and future fundraising opportunities. The school was founded more than a century ago and focuses primarily on art, architecture, design and writing; offering 22 undergraduate and 10 graduate programs. Huang is currently the world’s 11th richest person with an estimated net worth of $121.8 billion—an achievement enabled largely by Nvidia’s dominance in today’s A.I. boom. The chipmaker’s graphics processing units (GPUs) have become a rare commodity amongst tech developers scrambling to power their A.I. products, with companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META) and Google (GOOGL) pouring billions of dollars into Nvidia’s sought-after hardware. While the bulk of the Huang Foundation’s donations have been funneled into donor-advised funds, a type of philanthropic savings account utilized by the wealthy, the nonprofit has also supported a number of educational institutions over the years. In 2023, for example, it gave $10 million to Oregon State University (OSU), which both Huang and his wife Lori attended. The couple previously pledged $50 million to their alma mater in 2022 to build a supercomputing complex. And in 2008, they gave $30 million to help establish an engineering center at Stanford, where Huang received a degree in electrical engineering back in 1992. The billionaire’s donations have additionally benefited the Oneida Baptist Institute, a Kentucky boarding school he attended that received $2 million from Huang in 2019. While CCA isn’t one of the Nvidia founder’s alma maters, the art school’s alumni are well-connected across Silicon Valley. Graduates are frequently pursued by the likes of Google and Apple (AAPL), according to the school. Huang’s foundation “recognizes the essential intersection of technology, art and design in driving innovation,” said Eric Jensen, chief operating officer of the Jen-Hsun and Lori Huang Foundation, in a statement. “Our investment in CCA reflects our commitment to supporting institutions that cultivate the creative leaders of tomorrow.” Huang isn’t the only tech billionaire injecting capital into arts education across Silicon Valley. Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, led a nonprofit’s acquisition of the San Francisco Art Institute last year. The school, which will now house an artist residency program, went bankrupt in 2023—making CCA San Francisco’s last standing nonprofit arts college.

Title: The Ozempic shortage is over

The shortage of Novo Nordisk’s (NVO+5.33%) blockbuster diabetes and weight-loss drugs is officially over, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA updated its drug shortage database on Friday, marking the shortage of semaglutide — the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy — as resolved. The news puts pressure on companies that have been able to sell off-brand, also known as compounded versions, of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs due to widespread shortages. GLP-1 drugs, which mimic hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite, have become highly sought after for their weight loss effects. Soaring sales for these treatments have transformed Novo Nordisk and its rival Eli Lilly (LLY+0.44%), the maker of competing drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound, into the most valuable pharma companies in the world. However, Skyrocketing demand and the drugs’ high list price has made it difficult for some patients to fill their prescriptions. Semaglutide had been listed on the FDA shortage list since March 2022. “We are pleased the FDA has declared that supply of the only real, FDA-approved semaglutide medicines is resolved, affirming that Novo Nordisk is meeting or exceeding current and projected nationwide demand,” said Dave Moore, executive vice president of U.S. operations at Novo Nordisk, in a statement. “No one should have to compromise their health due to misinformation and reach for fake or illegitimate knockoff drugs that pose significant safety risks to patients.” Novo Nordisk stock jumped over 4% on Friday. The millennial-focused telehealth platform Hims & Hers (HIMS-24.45%), which began offering a compounded version of semaglutide last May, saw its stock drop by over 22% during Friday’s trading session. Compounding refers to the customization of an approved drug by a pharmacy or physician to meet the specific needs of an individual patient. Typically, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits compounding drugs that are just copies of commercially available medications. But drugs that are in shortage are not considered by the FDA to be commercially available. The limited supply of highly coveted and expensive brand name weight-loss drugs has spurred several digital healthcare companies to take advantage of that provision. “Now that the FDA has determined the drug shortage for semaglutide has been resolved, we will continue to offer access to personalized treatments as allowed by law to meet patient needs,” Hims & Hers CEO Andrew Dudum said in a statement. “We’re also closely monitoring potential future shortages, as Novo Nordisk stated two weeks ago that it would continue to have ‘capacity limitations’ and ‘expected continued periodic supply constraints and related drug shortage notifications.’” In July, the company added Kåre Schultz, a longtime Novo Nordisk executive, to its board of directors. At the time, Schultz told Bloomberg that the company has a “long future” in selling compounded semaglutide. When asked if pharmacies will still be able to make compounded semaglutide after the shortages end, Schulz said he wasn’t worried because there would still be cases where patients need individualized prescriptions. The FDA said on Friday that state-licensed pharmacies and physicians, known as 503A compounders, must stop making and distributing semaglutide products by April 22. Outsourcing facilities, known as 503B’s, have until May 22 to do the same. However, the FDA’s decision will likely face challenges from compounders, who have already sued the agency over its decision to declare a shortage of another weight-loss drug as resolved. The FDA originally declared the shortage of tirzepatide — the active ingredient in Eli Lilly’s Zepbound — over in October. However, an industry group, the Outsourcing Facilities Association (OFA), filed a lawsuit in Texas against the agency just days later, challenging its decision to remove the drug from its shortage list and demanding that the move be reversed. In its lawsuit, the group called the FDA’s decision “reckless and arbitrary,” and argued that it would “deprive patients of a vital treatment for type 2 diabetes and obesity.” The FDA said, in a court filing, that pharmacists could temporarily resume making compounded tirzepatide as it reconsiders its decision In a December letter, the agency stated that its review found Eli Lilly has sufficient supply to meet and exceed both current and future demand for the drugs. As a result, it set deadlines for compounding pharmacies — Feb. 18 for 503As and Mar. 19 for 503B’s — to stop selling off-brand versions of tirzepatide.

Title: The best trade in the market might be following everything Elon Musk touches
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/best-trade-biggest-returns-might-musk-trade-not-trump-2025-2
Time Published: 2025-02-21T14:18:29Z
Full Content:
Happy Friday! Ever wondered what goes on at those massive real-estate conferences for people looking to grow (or start) their real-estate empire? Business Insider's Kathleen Elkins spent a day at one, and the biggest takeaway had nothing to do with the actual housing market. In today's big story, forget the Trump trade. The biggest returns might be on the Musk trade. Markets: PE would like to be a big part of your 401(k), but it might need some help from President Trump. Tech: As talk of data center regulation ramps up, Big Tech is turning to the lobbyists. Business: IRS probationary employees are next on the chopping block. But first, Musk is having a moment. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. One of the best investing strategies these days? Trust in Musk. In the lead-up to the election, investors piled into assets they thought would benefit from Donald Trump's return to the White House in what was known as the Trump trade. But it's Musk-affiliated assets that have really shined since Donald Trump's November victory, writes Business Insider's Matthew Fox. From Tesla to X to dogecoin, if Musk is close to it, it's likely been up big since November. (That's also benefited the man himself. His net worth is reportedly up about $135 billion since the election.) You could argue the Musk trade is just the ultimate Trump trade. (Now we're really getting meta.) After all, one of the main reasons everything Musk touches is skyrocketing is thanks to his proximity to Trump. But even among executives who have tried to ingratiate themselves with Trump, Musk stands apart. Take Meta, where Mark Zuckerberg has overhauled the tech giant in what appears to be a bid to align it with the new administration. The company is up more than 20% since Trump's victory, good for second-best among the all-important Magnificent 7. The top spot? Musk's Tesla, which is up more than 40% during the same time period. Banking on your relationship with a political figure known for unpredictability comes with risks. While the Trump relationship has suited Musk well thus far, the president's opinion of people, even those in his administration, can change quickly. There have been signs of small cracks in the Trump-Musk foundation. Musk essentially killing a government funding bill last December led some Democrats to question whether he was the GOP's real leader. That chatter elicited a forceful pushback from a Trump spokeswoman. A few weeks later Musk clashed with Trump's base over the future of H-1B visas. (Trump eventually sided with Musk.) More recently, Trump said Musk opening a Tesla plant in India, another target of his expansive tariff plans and a key future market for Tesla, would be "unfair" to the US. Musk's businesses will also eventually need to address big questions about their future. Tesla, for example, is seeing increased competition from Chinese EVs looking to expand beyond their home country. And for all the wins X has notched recently, some experts have pointed to its relationship with Musk's buzzy AI startup, xAI, as what's reigniting investors' interest in the platform. In the meantime, Musk's companies might be happy to point out their owner's powerful relationship when it benefits them. BI's Peter Kafka wrote about a Wall Street Journal report that Linda Yaccarino, the CEO of X, and her lieutenants have been pressing one of the world's biggest ad agencies to get its clients to spend more money on X by using an implied threat of government interference. 1. Your 401(k) could look a lot different if private equity gets its wish. In June 2020, President Trump opened the door for alternative assets in 401(k) investing. Five years later, virtually no one has taken up the opportunity. The reason: litigation risk. BI spoke with multiple industry insiders and experts to understand what these private-equity firms want — and what it could mean for the average investor's retirement plans. 2. Big-box retail stocks take a tumble. Despite Walmart's earnings beat on Wednesday, the retail giant's full-year outlook disappointed. The guidance had a ripple effect, triggering concerns about a consumer spending slowdown as other retailers — like Target, Costco, and Kroger — saw shares slip on Thursday. 3. Investors got the DeepSeek stock sell-off wrong. That's according to Jensen Huang, CEO of chipmaker Nvidia, which was hit by the dramatic market response to DeepSeek's release of a new model built with less advanced chips. Speaking at a virtual event that aired Thursday, Huang said investors misinterpreted DeepSeek's advancements. He said that the AI industry still needs computing power for post-training methods. 1. Meta approves bonuses of up to 200% of company executives' salaries. The company said the bonus plan provides "variable cash incentives" designed to "motivate its executive officers to focus on company priorities and to reward them for company results and achievements," per a SEC filing. 2. A glimpse inside Elon Musk's new Atlanta data center. xAI is joining forces with X to operate a large data center, its second facility after Musk's Memphis project. BI reviewed an agreement with a local economic development agency and found the center will house about 12,000 Nvidia chips. Earlier agreements indicate the center will hold equipment totaling $700 million. It shows how Musk is pooling resources between his AI startup and X to benefit both companies. 3. Big Tech's latest lobbying push. A PAC tied to The Data Center Coalition — which counts Amazon, Google, and Microsoft as members — contributed $165,500 to Virginia lawmakers. The contributions mark the group's first political donations and came in the months leading up to the state's annual legislative session. The donations might have paid off, as a slate of bipartisan data center regulation failed to get approval. 1. The IRS has begun firing probationary workers. It's the latest agency to be hit with layoffs. The firings also come amid tax-filing season and could specifically hit jobs responsible for enforcement and tax evasion. 2. 007 enters a new era. Amazon MGM Studios announced it is taking creative control over the James Bond franchise as longtime producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli step back from decision-making. With the franchise in new hands, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos asked the question we're all dying to know: "Who'd you pick as the next Bond?" 3. Charlie Javice is she-who-shall-not-be-named at Quinn Emanuel. In an email viewed by BI, Javice's legal team told lawyers at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan not to discuss the startup founder's criminal fraud trial around the office — lest Javice overhears them. Javice is on trial in Manhattan for fraud, alongside executive Olivier Amar, after selling her college financial aid startup Frank to JPMorgan.

Marlow/Saslove & Warwick at Douglas Elliman Real Estate) That Aspen is Colorado’s ritziest housing market has long been a given and last year was no exception — Pitkin County claimed nine out of the 10 most expensive home sales in the state. But a sale that broke the $100 million threshold for the first time in state history helped the town dominate the charts nationally.The second quarter of 2024 was especially notable, with half of the 10 most expensive home sales recorded in the country happening in Aspen, according to real estate brokerage Redfin. For the year, Colorado claimed three of the top 10 sales where a public record was available.“When I moved to Aspen 30 years ago, we were a town of millionaires, not billionaires. Now we are a town of billionaires,” said Brenda Wild, an owner broker with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices in Aspen.Casino mogul Steve Wynn, founder of The Bellagio in Las Vegas, and online stock trading pioneer Thomas Petterfy, teamed up to purchase 419 Willoughby Way in Aspen for $108 million on April 15. The home, the largest on the top 10 list at a commanding 22,405 square feet, is on a street that has earned the title of Colorado’s billionaire row.The property at 720 Willoughby Way in Aspen, Colorado, sold for $60 million in 2024. (Provided by Mandy Welgos)In the neighborhood was the state’s fourth most expensive sale last year at $60 million — 720 Willoughby Way. Four years earlier that same home had sold for $27 million, a common acceleration in value among the top-priced sellers.The desire to get away and claim more space during the pandemic contributed to a run-up in prices in several resort areas. Pitkin County added to the frenzy when it limited the size of new homes to 9,250 square feet, helping make the mega-mansions built in prior decades collectibles for the rich and famous.Wild said the uber-wealthy view Aspen real estate as an asset class where they can park their money and earn a steady return. The location offers a getaway where they can isolate and disappear off the grid if they want or rub shoulders with other shakers and movers on the slopes or at different festivals.“Aspen has the full package and people are coming from all over the world, all the time,” she said. Measured on a per-square-foot basis, the most expensive home on the list was 850 Roaring Fork Road. It went for $7,901 a square foot, which compares to $4,820 a square foot for 419 Willoughby.Outside of Aspen, only Vail managed to sneak a home onto the state’s top 10 list. That was the $40 million sale of 107 Rockledge Road, a 12,447-square-foot property that looks down on Vail Village and has direct access to the slopes.“It was the highest sales price for a single-family home that we have ever had,” said Liz Leeds, who specializes in luxury home sales in both Aspen and Vail. “Vail commands high prices, but not at the same level as what Aspen is doing.” Vail falls more in the price range of corporate executives and high-paid professionals who can’t afford Aspen, Leeds said. It is also popular with wealthy buyers from Mexico and South America.The property at 107 Rockledge Road in Vail, Colorado, sold for $40 million in 2024.

Title: Shake Shack's CEO said the cost of eggs will likely drive up demand for beef and chicken

Shake Shack's CEO, Rob Lynch, says food chains will likely introduce more chicken and beef menu items as the price of eggs soars. On the company's fourth-quarter earnings call on Thursday, Lynch discussed the impact of tariffs and imports on the burger chain's business. Lynch said the company sources the majority of its ingredients domestically and won't have major exposure to tariffs. Thanks to its menu, it is largely insulated from the skyrocketing price of eggs as well. "I mean we don't have a breakfast business, a big breakfast business. So we don't have the exposure to eggs," Lynch said. "But other restaurant companies that have exposure to eggs may be moving away from eggs in the time being, which means they are going to offer more beef products or chicken products to complement, to substitute for that high-cost item," he said. Shake Shack is known for its beef, chicken, and mushroom burgers, as well as its fries and frozen custard shakes. While eggs don't play heavily into its menu, fast food giants from Chick-fil-A and Taco Bell to McDonald's and Burger King rely on eggs for some of their popular breakfast menu items. Lynch's comments come as egg prices in the US soar. Prices increased by 15.2% from December to January, the largest monthly spike in 10 years. In January, the average price of a dozen large Grade A eggs in the country hit an all-time high of $4.95. The surge was caused due to supply chain issues stemming from a H5N1 bird flu outbreak in the US. The flu has forced farmers to cull infected birds, leading to egg shortages. Chains like Costco have seen egg cartons fly off their shelves minutes after store openings. Grocery stores like Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, and Costco have imposed limits on the number of cartons each customer can purchase. Earlier this month, Waffle House started adding a 50-cent surcharge to each egg it sells. Shake Shack, which started as a hot dog kiosk in New York City's Madison Square Park in 2004, has over 570 locations worldwide, including more than 370 outlets in the US. The chain posted a total quarterly revenue of $329 million, up 14.8% from the same quarter in 2023. This included $317 million of company-operated sales and about $12 million from licensing revenue. The company's stock was up 11% at market close on Thursday. It's up more than 27% in the past year. Representatives for Shake Shack did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Title: Cameo is giving workers a $10,000 raise to return to the office. Its CEO says they're paying more because they're asking for more.

Time Published: 2025-02-21T09:00:01Z
Full Content:
The celebrity video messaging company Cameo this week rolled out $10,000 raises for employees returning to work in-office four days a week at its Chicago headquarters. CEO Steven Galanis told Business Insider the raises and other perks announced this week — such as catered lunch, paid parking, and a free gym membership — have immediately boosted productivity and recruitment efforts. Chicago-based workers all attended the first four required days in office without absences, they completed more sales outreach together in just a few days than they had in the previous six months, and the move has helped them recruit new employees, he said. "It's been pretty amazing to watch the reception that we've seen from applicants," Galanis said. "People are coming out of the woodwork that want to work for us now, and ex-employees want to come back, which is awesome." Cameo, which has gone through three rounds of highly publicized and contentious layoffs since the COVID-19 pandemic, now employs 50 people, with about half living in the Chicago area, Galanis said. Those who don't live within commuting distance of Chicago aren't eligible for the raise unless they move there, and will not be required to report to the office, he said. If Cameo sets up satellite locations in other cities in the future, Galanis said the option for an in-office work raise would apply to them, as well. Galanis said he believes the company thrives on in-office brainstorming and participation, but he wanted to try to lure his workers back into the company headquarters organically. "We really wanted this to be a FOMO-inducing perk versus a punishment," Galanis said."I believe if we're requiring you to come in four days a week, we are literally asking more out of you than if you didn't have to. So, to me, if we're asking more out of you, it totally makes sense that we should pay you more." The $10,000 raise stands in contrast to other companies' RTO mandates, though Galanis said he has a preference for in-office collaboration shared by many top executives. JPMorgan Chase's CEO, Jamie Dimon, last week made headlines for a viral, expletive-laden rant against working from home. In it, he said he didn't care how many of the banking giant's employees signed a petition against its five-day return-to-office mandate that takes effect next month. "Don't waste time on it," Dimon said. "I don't care how many people sign that f—ing petition." Other major companies, such as Starbucks, have threatened employees with termination if they refuse to comply with RTO orders, Bloomberg first reported in October. Still, some major return-to-office rollouts have been bumpy. As Business Insider previously reported, Amazon delayed its RTO initiative for some employees because it didn't have enough workspace for returning employees. Galanis said he understands the vitriol over working from home espoused by some executives — "what Jamie said is something that myself and many other CEOs have felt before or talked about behind closed doors," he said — and he gets the need for some extra large companies to be more strict in their approach to returning to the office. That just wasn't for him, he said. "I can't judge what's the right thing for another company's culture," Galanis said. "But I know the way our company is, and I know how much we cherish our employees and so this, for us, was the right approach." Jump to

February 20, 2025 20:30 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Feb. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important March 25, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1.” Defendants’ statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants’ statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk’s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: Travel Back in Time to 2009… and Buy Tech

By Adam Sharp PostedFebruary 20, 2025 In the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) in 2009, I was obsessed with the risk of a “double-dip” recession. The outlook was bleak. The banks all seemed to be failing, stocks had crashed, housing was belly-up, and the Fed was printing money like mad. So instead of gobbling up cheap tech shares, I was primarily focused on hoarding my (meager) stash of precious metals and preparing for an armageddon which never came. The gold and silver investments worked out fine, and I’m extremely bullish on gold and silver going forward. But let’s be honest. I would have been better off if I had diversified and bought fast-growing U.S. tech companies at huge discounts. For example, in January of 2009 Amazon (AMZN) shares traded as low as $2.38 (split-adjusted). Today it trades at $222, nearly 100x higher. That opportunity has passed. But what if there was a similar setup to the Nasdaq in 2009 available today? I think I’ve found it. But be forewarned, some of you are going to hate it. I’ve been reluctant to write about it for a while now, but simply can’t hold it in any longer. It’s… Chinese tech. Over the past few years, China’s massive real estate bubble has popped. Our own Jim Rickards nailed this event, writing in July of 2021 that China was a Fragile Giant. China also confronts an insolvent banking system and a real estate bubble. Up to half of China’s investment is a complete waste. It does produce jobs and utilize inputs like cement, steel, copper and glass. But the finished product, whether a city, train station or sports arena, is often a white elephant that will remain unused. The Chinese landscape is littered with “ghost cities” that have resulted from China’s wasted investment and flawed development model. It was an incredible call by Jim. In the years following that article, the KraneShares China Internet ETF (KWEB) crashed 80% from its all-time high. KWEB is China’s equivalent to the Nasdaq 100. So this was China’s version of America’s 2008 bubble crash, on steroids. Fast forward to today, however, and I believe the bottom is finally in for Chinese tech firms. KWEB still trades about 66% below its all-time high. Here’s a 5 year KWEB chart: As you can see, China’s tech sector is still far below all-time highs. If this is the beginning of a new bull market, it’s still quite early. Importantly, today DeepSeek has changed the narrative around Chinese technology. Whether we like it or not, they’re making major progress in areas such as AI, nuclear, fusion, electric vehicles, phones, satellites, semiconductors, and even planes. There are certainly problems in China, such as overcapacity and ruthless competition eroding profit margins. And needless to say, the communist government structure isn’t ideal for tech firms. Nevertheless, China’s tech sector is cheap, hated, and in an uptrend. That is typically a recipe for gains. This morning Alibaba (BABA) beat earnings and jumped more than 10% in early trading. As I write this it’s still up around 7% at midday. Alibaba is the “Amazon of China”. It’s the country’s largest online retailer, and the largest cloud computing provider (just like Amazon). You could also call the company the “Paypal of China”, due to its 33% stake in Ant Group, which owns the all-encompassing Alipay payment app (think Paypal meets Visa). Alibaba is also one of the top 3 AI companies in China, and its leading AI model, Qwen Max 2.5, is competitive with ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Google’s top models. Alibaba has soared 80% over the past year. But it has huge amounts of room to run to get back to all-time highs. Here’s a 5-year chart of BABA: So… why did Alibaba shares crash, anyways? The first factor was the real estate bubble popping, which we covered above. But there’s more to the story. Back in 2021 and 2022, Alibaba was dominating in China a little too much. President Xi and the CCP didn’t like that. Alibaba’s subsidiary Ant Group was making big moves in the financial space, threatening to cut in on state-owned banks and other financial businesses. So the Chinese government laid the smack down on Alibaba, issuing huge fines and cancelling the IPO of Ant Group (Alipay). This is a real risk of investing in China. The government has too much power over business matters. But I think that risk has mostly passed. Today Alibaba and its founder Jack Ma have paid their fines, and their dues. A meeting with President Xi this week sealed the deal. Jack Ma and BABA are suddenly back in polite society. President Xi and the government have signaled support for the private sector, and are stimulating the economy with QE and cheap loans (as we did in 2009). To be clear, I don’t think Alibaba will deliver 100x returns from here. It’s already too large for those types of gains. But I think it still has a very nice run ahead of it. The Ant Group (Alipay) IPO could happen in the near future, which would be a major catalyst for the stock. In full transparency, over the past 7 months I’ve been buying Alibaba (BABA), Xiaomi (XIACY), and BYD (BYDDY). These are some of China’s hottest tech firms. I also recently added a China small-cap ETF (ECNS) and PGJ (China internet ETF). I plan to hold these positions for at least five years, if not longer. This week President Trump posted the following message on his Truth Social platform. Source: Truth Social Some of you may be surprised by President Trump’s friendly tone here. I am not. We need to make a trade deal with China, and soon, as we discussed last month. It’s in both countries’ interests. If a trade deal with China does go through, that should throw gas on the fire beneath Chinese tech stocks. Uncertainty around trade wars and tariffs has been a major factor holding back the sector. Overall I strongly believe the global trade wars are just beginning, but we may see some progress soon on the China front. To conclude, I believe the setup in Chinese tech today is quite similar to the Nasdaq in 2009. I may be wrong, but am willing to take that chance given the potential upside. It’s not very often we get a chance to buy fast-growing tech at a 66% discount. I’m not going to miss the opportunity this time, even if it means investing in a communist country. If some of you can’t stomach that, however, I completely understand. It’s not the hand I would’ve chosen, but it is the one we’ve been dealt. I believe China’s tech sector is in for a lucrative bull market ahead. Phew, it feels good to have that off my chest. Disclosure: Of the companies and funds mentioned in this article, the author owns Alibaba, Xiaomi, BYD, PGJ, and ECNS.

Title: Satya Nadella Unveils Microsoft’s Quantum Breakthrough: a New State of Matter

For a field that many have long considered decades away, quantum computing sure is getting a lot of buzz in Silicon Valley. Yesterday (Feb. 19), Microsoft (MSFT) unveiled a quantum chip known as Majorana 1, created with an entirely new state of matter that’s beyond solid, liquid and gas. “Most of us grew up learning there are three main types of matter that matter: solid, liquid, and gas. Today, that changed,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a post on X yesterday. “We believe this breakthrough will allow us to create a truly meaningful quantum computer not in decades, as some have predicted, but in years.” Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. While traditional computing currently relies on bits, quantum computing utilizes qubits—a unit of information that can operate in multiple states simultaneously, instead of being either on or off. To build qubits, most quantum companies use superconducting units. But for decades, Microsoft has taken a notably unique approach. Majorana 1 contains eight qubits created with a new state of matter the company calls a “topological state,” a feat achieved by combining both semiconductors and superconductors. These topological qubits are “faster, more reliable and smaller,” providing a clearer path to eventually fitting a million qubits on a single chip, according to Nadella. Researchers have spent decades studying the feasibility of a so-called quantum computer, which could tackle calculations beyond the wildest capabilities of today’s supercomputers. Quantum computing is still a way off from becoming commercially viable, but recent research progress has heated up the tech industry’s race to develop quantum computers—a milestone that could have major implications for everything from the health care industry to supply chains and climate change. A one-million-qubit quantum computer is largely considered the threshold for delivering real-world results, Microsoft said. Due to their ability to draw from quantum mechanics, such machines could solve problems across chemistry and materials science that are impossible with current computing capabilities. Potential results could include discovering why materials crack, a breakthrough that could lead to self-healing materials; or creating a way to break down all types of plastic. “Most of all, quantum computing could allow engineers, scientists, companies and others to simply design things right the first time,” Microsoft said. Microsoft isn’t the only Big Tech company attempting to crack the quantum computing. Decades of research from companies like IBM, Intel and Google (GOOGL) has seemingly begun to pay off. Most recently, Google sent shockwaves through Silicon Valley when it unveiled a new quantum chip called Willow. In less than five minutes, the computer was able to perform a standard benchmark computation that would take today’s supercomputers 10 septillion years—a number that surpasses the age of the universe—to complete. But not everyone is convinced that true breakthroughs are just around the corner. Tech leaders like Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang have raised red flags about the technology’s timeline. In January, Huang sent quantum stocks tumbling after declaring that “very useful quantum computers are still a few decades away.” Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg echoed these concerns a few days later while speaking on Joe Rogan’s podcast. “My understanding is that’s still quite a ways off from being a very useful paradigm,” Zuckerberg said. Nadella is more optimistic. Microsoft’s new advancements mean the company could be the first to achieve milestones like a one-million-qubit chip and thousands of error-corrected qubits, said the CEO during an episode of the Dwarkesh Podcast yesterday. “And then it’s game on. You suddenly have the ability to build a real utility-scale quantum computer,” he said. While it’s under Nadella’s leadership that Microsoft is finally edging closer to reaping the rewards of such research, its quantum computing strategy started back in the 2000s—long before Nadella joined the company. “It’s unbelievable,” Nadella said of the effort, which has taken place under previous chief executives like Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer. “I’m the third CEO of Microsoft who’s been excited about quantum.” Despite the long waits they generate, such projects are key to the success of Microsoft’s research division, according to Nadella. “We’ve got to go at it each year knowing that most of these bets are not going to pay off in any finite frame,” he said. “Maybe the sixth CEO of Microsoft will benefit from it.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott (R-SC) vowed this month that a stablecoin bill, dubbed the GENIUS Act, will be passed by both chambers of Congress and signed into law within the first 100 days of President Donald Trump’s administration. As the bill gains momentum, some experts say the industry may be at a crossroads. While the measure would for the first time provide a pathway to legality for stablecoin giants like Tether and Circle, it would also likely unleash massive competition. A federal framework would embolden countless companies to dive into the $233 billion stablecoin market, according to Niklas Kunkel, the founder of blockchain oracle builder Chronicle Labs. At the least, many firms will consider what strategic advantages stablecoins have, he told Decrypt. “As soon as this legislation passes, there are going to be 10,000 companies looking at this,” Kunkel said. “I would expand that beyond just payment companies and asset issuers. [...] You can include tech companies: the Amazons, Ubers, Metas and Googles of the world." Among interested firms, Kunkel bet 1,000 of them would debut a stablecoin within the following year that stablecoin legislation is passed. In lieu of adopting an existing stablecoin like Circle’s USDC, however, Kunkel said firms will be incentivized to release their own equivalent. “They would love their users to use their own branded stablecoin because they can make the yield on the underlying reserves,” he explained. “They may even be white-labeled.” As an example of a white-labeled stablecoin, Kunkel pointed to Paxos. The company once issued a Binance-branded stablecoin called BUSD, while playing a central role in PayPal’s stablecoin foray as the issuer of PayPal USD (PYUSD). As digital assets are pegged to the price of a fiat currency, such as the U.S. dollar, stablecoins are often backed by reserves of cash and U.S. Treasuries that generate yield. In Coinbase’s fourth quarter, the company disclosed $224 million in revenue from assets backing USDC. A report published by S&P Global Ratings on Wednesday found that the GENIUS Act would increase the adoption of stablecoins in the U.S. The lack of regulation in the U.S. is “one of the main impediments” to broader adoption, the analysts wrote. In November, Paxos CEO Charles Cascarilla wrote in a letter addressed to Trump and former Vice President Kamala Harris—then the Democratic presidential candidate—that America’s opportunity to cement financial dominance through stablecoins had been stifled so far by “countless examples of regulatory overreach.” Though firms like BlackRock have issued tokenized money market funds that resemble stablecoins, S&P analysts wrote that a lack of regulation and supervision has prevented their broader adoption in fields like everyday payments. Chronicle Labs is developing a network for oracles, which allow blockchains to connect with external, real-word data sources. Before starting the Switzerland-based firm, Kunkel worked for five years at MakerDAO, the popular lending protocol behind the stablecoin DAI. (MakerDAO has since rebranded to Sky and replaced DAI with USDS.) Kunkel was part of the founding team at MakerDAO when the organization launched in 2017. And at this point, building something that resembles a bank and operates solely on stablecoin rails is possible, he said. The regulatory backdrop just needs to catch up. “As soon as you get the government involved, everything slows down to a crawl,” he said. “The rate at which that iceberg thaws is going to determine how far into the future that we have to look before we realize this.” When PayPal introduced its stablecoin in 2023, the firm faced criticism from Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), a top Democrat on the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee. She said that “federal oversight and enforcement of its stablecoin operations is essential,” expressing deep concern that the payments giant had moved before a framework was passed. Ultimately, stablecoin legislation may further intertwine the U.S. financial system with crypto’s sprawling decentralized finance, or DeFi, landscape, according to S&P analysis. “In our view, the role of stablecoins will continue to evolve and could eventually lead to more integration between traditional finance and decentralized finance,” they wrote.

Title: Tech’s Revolving Door of Layoffs Shatters Worker Trust
URL: https://www.webpronews.com/techs-revolving-door-of-layoffs-shatters-worker-trust/
Time Published: 2025-02-20T18:15:38Z
Full Content:
Once a beacon of stability and lavish perks, the tech industry is now a minefield of layoffs, leaving workers disillusioned and employers scrambling to retain talent. In the past week, Meta Platforms Inc., Workday Inc., and OpenText Corp. joined a parade of firms cutting thousands of jobs—over 6,500 since February 13—adding to a 2025 toll exceeding 10,800. Repeated downsizings, often paired with soaring profits, have “severed trust” between tech workers and their bosses, as employees question the loyalty once taken for granted in Silicon Valley. The latest salvo began February 10, when Meta axed 3,600 jobs—5% of its workforce—targeting “low performers,” according to CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s memo, reported by Bloomberg. Workday followed on February 12, slashing 1,750 roles to fund AI initiatives, while OpenText cut 1,200 on February 13 to trim costs. Alphabet Inc.’s Google offered voluntary exits in its Platforms & Devices unit, and Microsoft Corp., Salesforce Inc., and Amazon.com Inc. pruned staff across divisions, from underperformers to sustainability teams. Salesforce’s over-1,000 cuts came even as it hires for AI roles, per company statements. This isn’t a one-off. Meta’s latest purge follows a December 2024 cut of 5%, part of a 24,000-job reduction since 2022. Amazon aims to shed 14,000 managerial roles by spring, and Intel Corp.’s 15,000 layoffs last year remain a stark benchmark. On X, @JimJeffery11 dubbed it “private-sector ruthlessness,” a sentiment echoing through posts as workers lament the shift from tech’s cushy past. The erosion stems from a toxic mix of broken promises and cold pragmatism. Tech workers, lured by free meals and stock options, once saw their employers as partners in a grand mission. Now, they’re expendable. “I don’t trust employers anymore,” Eliot Lee, a 52-year-old project manager laid off multiple times, told The Washington Post last week. His story resonates: despite glowing reviews, workers at Meta and elsewhere find themselves blindsided, venting on X about “sudden betrayals.” Profits only deepen the rift. Meta’s stock rose 3% post-layoffs, and Microsoft boasts a $3 trillion valuation, yet cuts persist. X user @CPA_jjones on February 19 framed it as “remixing staff for efficiency,” not necessity—a view bolstered by a World Economic Forum survey predicting 41% of firms will shrink workforces due to AI within five years. Companies tout AI and cost-cutting, but employees see greed. “They’re thriving, yet we’re disposable,” tweeted @gamefrenza on February 15. Transparency—or its absence—fuels the fire. Google’s voluntary exits and Meta’s performance purges lack the decorum of past “restructurings,” as @gkcs_ noted on X. Workers feel like cogs in a machine, a far cry from the “family” rhetoric of the 2010s. The fallout is palpable. A Washington Post report on February 10 cited studies showing repeated layoffs erode morale, stifle innovation, and push survivors to disengage. Meta staffers, some axed despite high ratings, flooded social media with disbelief, per posts tracked this week. “Trust is gone,” one anonymous employee wrote on X, echoing a broader sentiment: 60% of laid-off techies distrust future employers, per a 2023 Tech.co survey still relevant today. The job market offers little solace. While IT and finance hiring ticks up, per @CPA_jjones, competition is fierce—over 1,000 applicants vie for single roles, Lee noted. Daelynn Moyer, 55, laid off from Indeed last year, has applied to 140 jobs without success, contemplating a farming pivot, per the Post. Visa holders like Chicago-based engineer Mittal face deportation if unhired within 60 days, adding urgency to the chaos, per CNBC. Companies aren’t immune. Distrust breeds turnover—remaining staff quietly quit or jump ship, as Patrick McAdams of recruiting firm Andiamo told the Post. Innovation suffers when fear replaces boldness, a risk for an industry banking on AI breakthroughs. On X, @NewstalkZB speculated Meta’s cuts “make way for AI,” but at what cost? Firms like SAP SE and PayPal Holdings Inc., launching AI-driven platforms this week, may outpace rivals slow to adapt, yet talent wars loom if workers balk at instability. Tech’s cultural shift compounds the problem. Gone are the Lizzo concerts Google once hosted, per a 2022 WSJ piece; now, desk-sharing and austerity rule. “Efficiency over ethics,” @gamefrenza quipped in Spanish and English, capturing a global view of tech’s new ethos. The bleeding may continue—45% of U.S. managers foresee AI-driven cuts this year, per a recent business study. Yet glimmers of resilience emerge. Pulsant’s UK data-center expansion and Bharti Airtel’s subsea cable, announced this week, signal infrastructure bets. Hiring persists in AI niches, and startups like Monomi Park are scooping up Big Tech castoffs, per a 2022 WIRED note still relevant. For workers, upskilling is survival. Amber Adamson, laid off from Covetrus, is honing coding skills, per a 2023 Washington Post story echoing today’s reality. Employers must rebuild trust—transparency, not platitudes, is key. As Samaraweera, ex-Jellysmack, told NBC last year, “Tech doesn’t seem safe anymore.” In 2025, that’s the industry’s stark truth—and its urgent challenge.

Title: Tech Giants Slash Jobs as AI and Efficiency Take Priority

Time Published: 2025-02-20T17:39:43Z

Major technology companies are shedding thousands of jobs in a fresh wave of layoffs, signaling a strategic pivot toward artificial intelligence and leaner operations amid economic headwinds. In the past week alone, Meta Platforms Inc., Workday Inc., OpenText Corp., and others have announced cuts affecting over 6,500 workers, part of a broader 2025 trend that has already seen more than 10,800 tech jobs vanish. Behind the numbers: a race to integrate AI, appease investors, and sharpen performance in an industry once defined by rapid growth. Meta kicked off the latest round, notifying some 3,600 employees—5% of its workforce—on Feb. 10 that their roles would end. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg called it a move to “raise the bar” on performance, targeting low performers in a blunt internal memo. The cuts, reported by Bloomberg, follow a December reduction of equal size, bringing Meta’s total layoffs since 2022 past 24,000. Workday, a leader in human-resources software, followed on Feb. 12, axing 1,750 jobs, or 8.5% of its staff. CEO Carl Eschenbach tied the decision to a push into AI, aiming to redirect funds from legacy roles to high-growth bets. OpenText, meanwhile, disclosed plans on Feb. 13 to eliminate 1,200 positions, citing cost efficiencies as investor pressure mounts. Elsewhere, Alphabet Inc.’s Google unit rolled out a voluntary exit program for its Platforms & Devices team, offering U.S. employees severance to depart, a shift from traditional layoffs. Microsoft Corp., Salesforce Inc., and Amazon.com Inc. also trimmed staff this month—Microsoft targeting underperformers, Salesforce cutting over 1,000 while hiring for AI roles, and Amazon paring its communications and sustainability units as part of a broader plan to shed 14,000 managerial jobs by spring. The drivers are clear: AI is reshaping tech’s labor landscape. Companies are slashing headcounts to fund automation and machine-learning initiatives, with Workday and Salesforce explicitly linking cuts to AI investment. A World Economic Forum survey projects 41% of firms will shrink workforces due to AI within five years—a future arriving early in 2025. Economic realities bolster the case. Despite a strong U.S. jobs report showing 353,000 new positions in January, tech firms face demands for profitability. OpenText aims to save millions annually, while Amazon’s cuts align with a goal to trim billions in costs. Performance, too, is under scrutiny: Meta and Microsoft are culling weaker contributors, signaling a meritocratic turn. Strategic realignment rounds out the picture. Google’s voluntary exits and Salesforce’s dual cut-and-hire approach reflect a shift toward AI and cloud priorities. Nokia Corp.’s leadership handover this week to Justin Hotard, an infrastructure-focused executive, hints at similar moves ahead. The cuts are rattling tech’s workforce. Employees at Meta voiced shock on social media, with some high performers caught in the crosshairs, eroding trust after years of layoffs. A Washington Post analysis warns of stifled innovation as morale dips—a risk for an industry reliant on creativity. The job market is splitting: AI-savvy workers find opportunities, while others face obsolescence. Hiring persists in IT and finance, but the Economic Report of the President estimates 10% of U.S. jobs are vulnerable to AI disruption. Competitively, leaner firms may gain an edge—SAP SE and PayPal Holdings Inc., for instance, are channeling savings into AI and digital-commerce platforms. Culturally, tech’s ethos is shifting. Gone are the cushy perks of the 2010s; in their place, a pragmatic focus on efficiency. Posts on X this week called it a loss of “decorum,” with Meta’s candid rhetoric and Google’s exit offers underscoring the change. More layoffs loom. According to a recent business survey, some 45% of U.S. managers expect AI and economic pressures to drive cuts this year. Still, stabilizing venture funding adds urgency for startups and giants alike to streamline. Yet growth persists—data-center expansions by Pulsant and connectivity projects like Bharti Airtel’s subsea cable signal a robust future for those who adopt. For workers, the message is stark: Upskill or risk irrelevance. For companies, balancing cuts with innovation is the tightrope to watch. Tech’s workforce reckoning is here—and 2025 is its proving ground.

Title: Nvidia's new AI tool can teach sign language

Nvidia (NVDA-3.69%) is launching an artificial intelligence-powered platform for learners of American Sign Language — the third-most prevalently used language in the U.S. Together with the American Society for Deaf Children and creative agency Hello Monday, Nvidia developed an interactive web platform called Signs to support ASL learning. The platform will also provide a dataset validated by fluent ASL users and interpreters that developers can use to build more accessible AI applications. Signs features a library of ASL signs for learners to improve their vocabulary, as well as a 3D avatar teacher. Learners can get real-time feedback on their signing via an AI tool that analyzes webcam footage. The platform initially has 100 signs, and is focused on hand movements and finger positions. Users can also learn the meanings of different facial expressions and head movements. Nvidia said it wants to grow the signs library to 400,000 video clips for 1,000 signed words. Signs users can contribute to the video dataset, which is open-source. The company added that it plans to make the dataset available to the public for building accessible AI agents, video conferencing features, and other AI tools. “Most deaf children are born to hearing parents. Giving family members accessible tools like Signs to start learning ASL early enables them to open an effective communication channel with children as young as six to eight months old,” Cheri Dowling, executive director of the American Society for Deaf Children, said in a statement. “And knowing that professional ASL teachers have validated all the vocabulary on the platform, users can be confident in what they’re learning.” The company is currently working with the Rochester Institute of Technology’s Center for Accessibility and Inclusion Research to improve the platform, and is looking to include regional and slang terms in the Signs library. The dataset will be released sometime this year, Nvidia said, and the ASL learning service is live now. Meanwhile, Nvidia is preparing for its annual GPU Technology Conference in March, where attendees can also use Signs. The company is set to report its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings next week.

Title: The Gist: AI, a talking dog for the 21st Century.

Time Published: 2025-02-20T16:21:57Z

Séamas O'Reilly on the year's biggest con, AI. This is a Christmas Cracker Gist. An invited essay by Séamas O'Reilly Joseph "Yellow Kid" Weil is something of a legend.The self-proclaimed “master swindler” was the paragon of the early twentieth century con man. In his time, he posed as the immaculately tailored owner of a talking dog, a medicine show huckster, an oil-field prospector and an infinite number of prestigious businessmen reluctantly cajoled into sharing a surefire stock tip - for a price. He plied his trade on street corners, boardrooms, race-tracks and betting shops, separating his marks from their money via means so ingenious many of them have lived on a century later. If you’ve seen the ruse which serves as the centre point of 1973 crime caper The Sting, you’ll know one of his greatest hits; the fake bookie’s shop, staffed with dozens of stooges, all working in concert to con one rich mark out of his money. He’s said to have scammed Benito Mussolini out of $2 million and, in 1899, was widely reported to have sold a perfectly unremarkable chicken to an oil baron for the measly price of a thumb sized piece of pure gold. That last wheeze was, in fact, so widely reported that it lives on in the foodstuff which was subsequently named in his honour; the chicken nugget. In Weil’s marvellous memoir, Con Man, there is scarcely a paragraph that doesn’t induce lip-smacking glee at his audacity, or the bottomless reserve of credulity he encounters from sober, serious people who, surely you think, should know better. His true genius, conveyed in great detail, was in diagnosing the psychology of the mark, which is to say the psychology of the human soul. In the business of offering “something for nothing”, the person you’re conning is almost always your co-conspirator. "Each of my victims” he writes, “had larceny in his heart.". I return to Weil’s scams, and his judgments of human nature, often. I see them each time, say, a billionaire runs for the American presidency on a platform of helping the downtrodden by cutting taxes for his wealthy friends, or a cohort of British elites succeed in selling ‘sovereignty and independence’ for the measly price of a place within the world’s largest trading bloc. Increasingly, however, I see it most prominently in the vaunted halls of tech, and nowhere more regularly than in the field of AI. To be clear at the outset, there are obviously elements of AI which show promise. The elimination of many rote and tedious tasks in our daily labours should be greeted as a boon, and AI’s work in highly specialised and technical tasks could prove more exciting still. Early developments in linguistics and pattern recognition already suggest that AI could, and hopefully will, lead to terrific advances in everything from ancient translation to early diagnosis of disease. In such use-cases, however, there is very little guff about this technology’s sentience, nor mention of that dreaded unicorn “artificial general intelligence”. They are simply ingenious and exciting tools which have solid and encouraging applications but do not, crucially, gesture toward an omniscience that does not exist, and which be undesirable if it did. As an ordinary internet user, I despise almost every in-road into my life that AI has made in the past few years, from incompetent chat services to bafflingly inchoate Google search functions, and the deadening churn of bots on every social media platform left alive. There are dozens of terrible AI versions of my own book being freely sold on Amazon, one of which I even bought in a futile attempt to scry its contents for some form of meaning. As someone in the creative field, I am sympathetic to the most common critique of AI within that sphere – namely, that its ‘artistic’ output amounts to lazy, error-riddled garbage which is morally and stylistically repulsive, while plagiarising and undercutting actual human artists – but this only nibbles at the edges of how I feel about the topic. Because my main problem with AI is not that that it creates ugly, immoral, boring slop (which it does). Nor even that it disenfranchises artists and impoverishes workers, (though it does that too). No, my main problem with AI is that its current pitch to the public is suffused with so much unsubstantiated bullshit, that I cannot banish from my thoughts the sight of a well-dressed man peddling a miraculous talking dog. The claims made by AI evangelists are so broad and plentiful that compiling a pleasingly long paragraph of purported use-cases is as simple as Googling “AI + [noun]”. Having now done just that, I am happy to report that AI will apparently make you rich, find you a date, make you a better lover, a better parent, a better writer, a better worker, a better boss, a better person, a better soldier, will fight all wars, end all wars, hobble terrorists, empower terrorists, make you immortal, end crime, cause crime, solve the housing crisis, revolutionise architecture, cure cancer, and make you a perfect creamy fettuccine with pineapple and cashew sauce. Some of the above links are more nuanced in their prescriptions, but all advance the same basic claim: AI has world-changing implications for just about every concept or phenomenon you can name, and several you can’t. The problem is, AI is not only unfit to do many of those tasks better (or even more cheaply) than humans, but if it was, in several cases, I’d set fire to every server farm I could find and urge you to do the same. Let’s take Large Language Models as an example, since they’re the most well-known piece of broadly usable AI tech on the market. Much of their notoriety stems from the fact that its hallucinations are so infamous as to be cliché. We all, I’m sure, have our favourites, like meal planners that recommend putting glue on pizza and eating three rocks a day; mushroom foraging bots which suggest users cook and prepare entirely fatal fungi; or supermarket apps that cheerfully prescribe recipes for “aromatic water” AKA chlorine gas. It should be observed that such examples are not merely failures because they advocate things that kill their users (although this is not ideal) but because they take the place of existing repositories of information which had little-to-no use case for replacement. In so doing, they’ve also managed to muddy the waters of online information gathering to the point that that even if we scrubbed every trace of those hallucinations from the internet – a likely impossible task - the resulting lack of trust could never quite be purged. Imagine, if you will, the release of a car which was not only dangerous and unusable in and of itself, but which made people think twice before ever entering any car again, by any manufacturer, so long as they lived. How certain were you, five years ago, that an odd ingredient in an online recipe was merely an idiosyncratic choice by a quirky, or incompetent, chef, rather than a fatal addition by a robot? How certain are you now? Some quibble and say that these are just teething problems, the inevitable – even amusing – first steps of a technology finding its feet. But that next step, itself, seems illusory. The scaling of AI to something more workable will require geometrically more investment and computing power than the squillions it has already swallowed up on its path to being the current shit product that nobody trusts. Even enthusiastic reporting on the success of OpenAI, the makers of ChatGPT, can’t avoid mentioning that the company is on track to lose $5 billion this year. Up to now, their financing has been driven by massive cash injections from the same cheery ranks of hedge funds, soft banks, and petrostates which have propped up every loss-making company you can name for the last decade, from Uber to WeWork to FTX. As recently as July, we saw signs that the market might not be quite as enthusiastic about doing so anymore. It may not be a bubble, but it certainly looks reasonably bubble-shaped, leading tech writer Ed Zitron to convincingly argue we should be referring to the sector as “Subprime AI”. Cory Doctorow goes further in arguing our only task going forward should be working out what kind of bubble it is, the kind that leaves something behind, or the kind that does not. The cost, both financially and in terms of energy resources, of making good on the promises of Artificial General Intelligence are so vast as to approach Death Star numbers, before we even contend with logistical problems of training AI in the first place. The pool of real-world information on which AI has yet to be trained is not merely dwindling but is, itself, now so polluted by AI-generated content that this task is rendered more difficult still. Chlorine gas air defusers and superglue pizzas are all well and good when they’re merely poisoning amateur cooks, but they have also poisoned the very well from which AI must now train itself, and separating out the hallucinations from real information grows more difficult with every line of robot doggerel these same companies ceaselessly barf into the digital ether. All of which is to elide the real harms of this technology we currently see in the world around us. In his recent, and spectacular, takedown of current AI orthodoxy, The Phony Comforts Of Useful Idiots, Edward Ongweso Jr lists some harrowing examples, such as the incompetent crime detection software currently putting American criminal justice in the hands of the machine, the discriminatory welfare algorithm which wrongly accused 26,000 Dutch families of fraud, and the ongoing use of AI to enable the ‘mass assassination factory’ of Gaza. In all such cases, AI’s “errors” are both devastating, and hard to even label as errors at all, so much as a bleakly useful abrogation of responsibility for the bad actors intent on protecting the dystopian interests of those in power. It is not the thought of eight fingered portraits or garbled auto-generated novels which prompt me to indulge in cheery reveries of burning server farms to the ground. It is the spectre of yet more dehumanised populations, preyed upon by dehumanised systems of state violence. I hate AI because it does not work at most of the things its promoters claim it does, and many of the things it does do are explicitly evil. Its missteps not only kill but dissolve the fragile fabric of trust in information we have left. The jargon of AI boosterism, like NFTs and cryptocurrency before them, has seized the imaginations of punters and investors who believe they’re being led to a world of ease and profit that will change the world and make them filthy rich in the process. It’s the last true “something for nothing” we have left, delivered via mechanisms so abstruse to the lay person that its powers can be described with the folkloric hyperbole of a magic chicken. As a teen, I first encountered Arthur C. Clarke’s famous maxim, “any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic”, and marvelled at its concision. I was too slow, however, to realise the transitive property hidden within his neat equation: if all technology is just magic we don’t yet understand, then any old bollocks can be marketed as technology, so long as it’s conveyed to us via a mage class of tech wizards with a passion for turtlenecks, eugenics, and the removal of vowels from proper nouns. It’s a boom time for our new medicine men. Joseph Weil has nothing on them. The Government has a new policy to increase housing, which is to keep doing their failed policy, but even harder. This is the Gist. Wednesday's Dáil chaos reveals the limits of Executive power. This is the Gist. The election campaign ended with the public's vote but only now do we have a Government. This is the final Campaign Gist. The last of the holiday pieces before normal service is resumed is a short story I wrote when I was 20. This is the New Year's Gist.

Title: Uber: Growth At A Reasonable Price With Ackman Backing
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/gurufocus/2025/02/20/uber-growth-at-a-reasonable-price-with-ackman-backing/
Time Published: 2025-02-20T15:44:11Z

By Blue Chip Portfolios Shares of Uber Technologies, Inc (UBER, Financial) have proved a disappointing investment over the past year. Uber shares have delivered a total return of roughly 4% while the S&P 500 has delivered a total return of roughly 22% over the same time period. While the company has delivered solid results including impressive revenue growth and significant margin improvement, investors have become skeptical of the long-term prospects of the company due to the threat of autonomous vehicles. However, I believe the company is poised to benefit from autonomous vehicles over the long-run. Investing guru Bill Ackman appears to agree with this view and recently initiated a $2.3 billion position in the stock. Uber shares currently trade at an above-market forward price to earnings ratio of 30x based on consensus full year 2025 earnings per share estimates. However, I believe the stock is undervalued given its strong growth prospects. Uber is a technology company which operates platforms that connect consumers with providers of services. The company's largest business is its mobility business which accounts for roughly 52% of revenue. Uber's other key business is its delivery business which accounts for roughly 33% of revenue. Uber's freight business, which has struggled to generate profitability, accounts for the remaining share of revenue. The company has operations in roughly 70 countries globally and derives roughly 50% of its revenue from the U.S. While Uber has been around since 2009 the company historically struggled to generate profitability. That has changed over the past year as Uber reported net income of nearly $10 billion compared to net income of just under $2 billion of net income for 2023. It is important to note is the $10 billion figure includes a $6.4 billion benefit related to a one-time tax revaluation. Even after backing out the $6.4 billion benefit, Uber's profit growth remains impressive. Uber Operating Revenue by Business Segment Over the past five years, Uber has grown its revenues at a roughly 28% compound annual growth rate. Growth has been strong in both the company's mobility and delivery segments. I expect this trend to continue going forward as the company is set to expand by increasing market penetration outside of the U.S. and in smaller cities within the U.S. Uber Revenue and Net Income Chart In addition to increasing market penetration in both its mobility and delivery business, I believe that Uber is also poised to see significant benefits from the adoption of autonomous vehicles. Currently, Uber has an operating partnership with Waymo in Phoenix and has announced plans to expand this partnership to Austin and Atlanta in 2025. One thing to note is that Waymo has been operating on its own, without a partnership with Uber, in Los Angeles and San Francisco. The fact that Waymo has decided to partner with Uber in new markets after operating previously without Uber in certain markets suggests that the benefits of being an option on the Uber platform exceed the costs related to sharing a portion of profits from each ride with Uber. For Uber, Waymo represents a significant growth opportunity as it will lead to additional supply of vehicles. Currently, limited supply of new drivers has proved a growth headwind for the company. In addition to providing additional supply, autonomous vehicles are likely to result in a lower cost to serve as autonomous vehicles do not require a human driver. Another reason why I believe autonomous vehicles operators are likely to partner with Uber is the fact that there are likely to be multiple different autonomous vehicles options in the future. Elon Musk has said that Tesla plans to launch its own autonomous vehicles later in 2025. Amazon backed Zoox also plans to launch autonomous vehicles in the near future. Thus, it appears likely that multiple autonomous vehicles will be available in the next few years. The existence of multiple autonomous vehicle options on the market favors Uber because the company is uniquely positioned to be an aggregation platform where consumers can quickly and easily evaluate different options including traditional vehicle options with a driver. Uber is a highly valuable partner for autonomous vehicle providers as the scale of Uber's customer base results in more efficiency for autonomous vehicle operations that would be the case if they were operating on their own with a smaller customer base. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi commented on benefits that autonomous vehicle operates experience from being available through Uber during the Q4 earnings call: Uber also recently announced a partnership with Nvidia to share data from its platform to help accelerate autonomous mobility. Currently, consensus estimates call for Uber to report revenue growth of 15%, 15%, and 14% for full years 2025- 2027. Consensus estimates for full year 2025 earnings per share call for a decline of 46% as full year 2024 earnings per share included a one-time positive impact of $6.4 billion due to a tax revaluation. Consensus earnings per share estimates for full years 2026-2028 call for the company to deliver earnings per share growth of 36%, 24%, and 19% respectively. Bill Ackman recently announced that his Pershing Square Capital Management has acquired a stake of more than $2.3 billion in Uber. Ackman noted that he believes that Uber is a high- quality business that can currently be purchased at a massive discount to intrinsic value. Additionally, Ackman noted that he believes autonomous vehicles represent a major positive catalyst for the company rather than a disruptive force. While I believe investors should always do their own work and come to their own conclusion, Ackman's backing is a clear positive. This is especially true given the fact that Ackman has a strong history of finding attractive growth at a reasonable price investments. Some of Ackman's notable successful growth investments include Chipotle Mexican Grill and Hilton Worldwide. Moreover, at more than $2.3 billion Ackman's Uber bet is now his largest position which suggests he has a high degree of conviction in the investment. Uber currently trades at 30x consensus full year 2025 earnings per share and 22x consensus full year 2026 earnings per share. While this valuation represents a moderate premium to the S&P 500, Uber has much strong near-term growth prospects than the broader market. Uber's closest publicly traded peers are Lyft and DoorDash which trade at 13x and 42x consensus full year 2025 earnings per share. Lyft trades at a significant discount due to its relatively small size and focus on the mobility business which is viewed as less attractive than the delivery business. Uber generates roughly 32% of its revenue from its delivery business with the bulk of the remainder coming from its mobility segment. Based on a blended peer multiple assuming a 32% weight on DoorDash's valuation and 68% on Lyft, Uber's peer valuation would be roughly 22x consensus full year 2025 earnings. While Uber's current valuation of 30x represents a premium to its blended peer valuation, I believe this premium is well deserved given the fact that Uber has larger scale than these rivals. Moreover, I also believe that in the long-run Uber will benefit from additional cross selling and economies of scale given its large presence in both the mobility and delivery markets. For example, Uber's R&D spend can be leveraged to benefit both its mobility and deliver businesses. Uber's valuation also appears attractive vs other companies poised to benefit from the autonomous vehicle trend such as Tesla which trades at 124x consensus full year 2025 consensus earnings per share. The biggest risk to the Uber bull case is that autonomous vehicle providers decide to circumvent Uber and go direct to consumer with large scale offerings. While I view this as highly unlikely given recent developments with Waymo and the fact that Uber has a massive customer base, it is not impossible. Such a development would be more likely to occur in the event that only one autonomous vehicle wins out in the end. Comparably, if there are autonomous vehicles offered by multiple players then Uber should be well position to be the platform of choice for consumers as it easily allows users to compare options. Another risk to the Uber bull case would be if Lyft were to be acquired by a stronger player. For example, Amazon or DoorDash would appear to be a suitable buyer for Lyft and could create a platform with greater scale than is currently the case. Such a combination could result in more competition for Uber and thus lead to margin pressures in the future. Uber shares have not kept pace with the broader market rally over the past year. The company has a strong history of delivering consistent revenue growth and has recently started delivering very strong earnings growth. The company is well positioned to benefit from secular growth trends going forward and has the potential to be a major beneficiary of autonomous vehicles. The stock trades at a reasonable valuation relative to the broader market and peers. Moreover, the company has the backing of investing guru Bill Ackman, I believe the stock represents a compelling growth at a reasonable price investment opportunity.

Title: New UK-Based Climate Group Emerges as Banks Retreat
URL: https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2025/02/20/812605.htm
Time Published: 2025-02-20T15:41:21Z

It was a dank, drizzly February evening when about 120 people gathered in the brightly lit art gallery of London’s Guildhall, surrounded by gold-framed paintings ranging from Pre-Raphaelites to realists. At the event, Alok Sharma, a former member of the UK parliament who served as president-designate of the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference in 2021, announced the launch of the Transition Finance Council. The goal of the London-based group, which includes banking executives, is to rally the City of London, companies and policymakers to scale funding for decarbonization efforts at home and abroad. The intention is “to ensure that London is positioned as a preeminent financial hub for transition financing” and to “deliver at scale the finance to transition the global economy” to cleaner energy sources, Sharma said in his speech. As Sharma pointed out, it was five years ago almost to the day that a similar event took place in the same building. The UK government, together with the Bank of England, had rallied six times as many people for the launch of what was called the private finance agenda for COP26. That gathering was a more boisterous affair. The room was “packed to the rafters,” Sharma recalled. Mark Carney, then BOE governor, took the stage to interview legendary biologist and broadcaster David Attenborough. Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, dialed in. It was “the point at which talk of sustainable finance and climate action moved from being a [corporate social responsibility] issue to being a C-suite issue,” Sharma said. A year later, Carney introduced the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, an industry initiative uniting firms with more than $70 trillion of assets to accelerate the transition to net zero. Much, of course, has changed since then. Starting in December, all of the largest US and Canadian banks began fleeing the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, itself once part of the broader GFANZ framework. And last week, Australia’s Macquarie Group Ltd. said it too was retreating from the coalition. The defections occurred as financial institutions seek to avoid right-wing attacks on sustainability and renewable energy, a US Republican-led war on behalf of the oil industry that’s only intensified with Donald Trump’s return to the White House. The insurance sector’s climate alliance also has been discontinued, while a similar group in the fund-management industry is on pause as it seeks to ensure that it remains “fit for purpose.” There’s “a lot of turmoil,” said Nina Seega, director of the Centre for Sustainable Finance at the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership. “Rhetoric is shifting and climate denial is becoming much more mainstream, so you then see a shift in the way different financial institutions are dealing with that.” Some are under more pressure than others, she said, but “none are immune.” Last week, a few minutes before Sharma took the microphone to announce the Transition Finance Council’s formation, one chief sustainability officer (CSO) of a large UK-based investment manager was asking attendees who they thought would be the next company to retreat from net zero. The query wasn’t surprising. CSOs face a more difficult landscape these days, what with big firms like JPMorgan Chase & Co. and BlackRock Inc. quitting climate-finance groups. On Wednesday, HSBC announced it’s pushed back its deadline to meet a number of key climate targets by two decades. As more companies back away, there are serious questions about the financial industry’s long-term commitment—and capacity—to help slow increasingly catastrophic global warming. Forced to battle headwinds both inside and outside their firms, many CSOs are concerned they may no longer have the full support of their companies and leadership teams. “Finance is being politicized, if not weaponized,” said Clemens Calice, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker who set up his own investment and advisory firm, Cygnum Capital. “Companies are under increasing pressure to align with a side or an agenda.” For CSOs, all of this amounts to a “very challenging operating environment,” said James Alexander, chief executive of the UK Sustainable Investment and Finance Association. Politics and policy have “become much more fractured,” making judgment calls “much harder to make.” At the same time, he said, “if you’re managing money, your responsibility is to consider risks, and sustainability is undeniably one of those risks.” Britain stands out as a rare example of a country that’s advancing on climate action. Seven of the world’s 10 largest economies missed a recent deadline to file updated emissions-saving plans with the United Nations. The UK was the only one to outline a strategy for the next decade that’s anywhere close to consistent with the Paris Agreement target to keep warming below 1.5C. “I’m very pleased to say” that the UK “has a government which recognizes that there is no trade-off between economic growth and the drive to decarbonize the economy,” Sharma said. The country is “uniquely positioned to lead.” (GFANZ is co-chaired by Michael R. Bloomberg, the founder of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP, and Mary Schapiro, the former head of the Securities and Exchange Commission.) North Carolina-based Duke Energy Corp., one of the biggest US power providers, removed a mention of climate targets in its latest earnings release as the company builds more natural gas plants and even reconsiders its plans for coal, the dirtiest of all fossil fuels. Duke said in its third-quarter earnings release last year that it was “executing an ambitious clean energy transition” and noted its goals to emit net-zero methane by 2030 and net-zero carbon by 2050. But the company’s fourth-quarter release on Thursday, while stating it was “executing an ambitious energy transition,” omitted the word “clean” and left out emissions goals. Though Duke says its strategy hasn’t changed, the move comes as Trump, who previously called climate change a “hoax” though has occasionally modulated that claim since, is nevertheless trying to increase production of fossil fuels while simultaneously seeking to zero-out net-zero policies. Duke said late last year it would consider shifting its plans for coal plants if the US president follows through on his promises to terminate rules governing power-plant pollution.

Editor Crypto CoinDesk, Helene Braun The state’s investment board’s stake is worth more than $340 million at IBIT’s current price of $56.10. Wisconsin’s investment board saw fit to significantly add to its bitcoin (BTC) bet in the last three months of the year. The State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) disclosed ownership of just over 6 million shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as of the Dec. 31, per a 13F filing on Friday, up from roughly 2.9 million shares three months prior. The position is valued at $340 million at IBIT’s current price of $56.10 and would be worth about $588 million at bitcoin’s current price near $98,000. The fund in 2024 became the first of its kind to report a bitcoin ETF purchase, initially buying 94,562 shares of IBIT and some shares of Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which it later sold. The State of Michigan Retirement System later also reported owning shares of bitcoin ETFs, the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) and two of Grayscale’s bitcoin products. SWIB, established in 1951, oversees more than $156 billion in assets including funds from the Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS) and the State Investment Fund (SIF). The board manages investments on behalf of state employees and other trust funds. Today marks the deadline for institutional investors managing at least $100 million in assets to report quarterly holdings to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The market is closely monitoring these filings to gauge whether large traditional finance firms have been adding bitcoin ETFs to their portfolios since their launch last year. UPDATE (Feb. 14, 18:49 UTC): Updates current valuation of State of Wisconsin’s stake in IBIT.

Title: Here Is What Wall Street Analysts Are Forecasting About NVIDIA’s GB200, B200, And NVL Rack Server Shipments Ahead Of The Earnings Next Week

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Wall Street analysts remain split on the extent to which NVIDIA's slower production ramp-up of the GB200 GPU would end up affecting its upcoming earnings and the outlook for the year ahead. While Baird analyst Tristan Gerra is dismissive of all "lingering concerns around [the] GB200 mix for the year," his counterpart at HSBC is much more cautious, lowering his forecast for NVL rack server shipments for the year from 35,000 units to 30,000 units. To wit, Baird analyst has leveraged his supply chain meetings to note that GB200 shipments are now finally gaining momentum after a "late and slow start." In what is a critical tidbit, Gerra notes that apart from "architectural novelties" that took time to optimize, the GB200 GPUs were also initially constrained by the available data center infrastructure (electricity/space). The analyst goes on to note: "Investors should not assume that these initial delays will lead customers to skip to the next-generation products. We expect GB200 to represent the majority of NVIDIA's GB mix in 2H25 and into 2026. GB300 crossover is expected not until 2H26." Meanwhile, as mentioned above, HSBC analyst Frank Lee is much more cautious on NVIDIA, going so far as to take the rare step of lowering his stock price target for the GPU manufacturer from $185 to $175, while maintaining an overall 'Buy' rating. Lee believes GB200's "supply chain issues" could remain an "overhang going into H1FY26." Bear in mind that NVIDIA's fiscal year concludes in January, hence its mismatch with the December-ending calendar year. Coming back, Lee has now lowered his "FY26e NVL rack server assumption from 35k to 30k [units]," while noting that NVIDIA will be able to "offset the slower GB200 ramp with upside in B200 GPU shipments in H1 FY26e," enabling the company to still "book Blackwell revenues of cUSD5bn and cUSD10bn in 4QFY25 and 1QFY26, respectively, leading to total revenue of USD40bn/42.2bn in 4QFY25/1QFY26 vs consensus of USD38.2bn/USD42bn." As for the upcoming earnings, Lee expects NVIDIA to show $40 billion in total sales for Q4'25 against a company-guided figure of $37.5 billion and Wall Street's consensus estimate of $38.2 billion. The HSBC analyst concludes his note with the following projection: "We also expect 1QFY26/2QFY26 sales of USD42.2bn/USD55.4bn vs consensus of USD42bn/USD46.2bn, implying H1 FY26 is unlikely to disappoint the market despite ongoing supply side issues." Elsewhere, KeyBanc analyst John Vinh concedes that "manufacturing constraints are limiting shipments of GB200 NVL server racks," but predicts that "this will be more than offset by the following: 1) given the lower initial manufacturing yields of GB200 NVL, we believe customers have been able to push out orders of GB200 and backfill with HGX-based B200 servers with x86 head nodes; 2) DeepSeek, as well as limited supply of Huawei’s Ascend AI ASIC, has created a surge in demand for H20 GPUs from China CSPs; 3) we believe NVDA’s customers, esp CSPs, are financing its inventory at EMS providers, so effectively sell-in shipments from NVDA to EMS are recognized as revenues." Finally, we bring you Oppenheimer's investment note on NVIDIA, where analyst Rick Schafer projects that the demand for H200 GPUs remains stronger than expected and will constitute ~30 percent of the company's sales mix this year. On the GB300 GPU, Schafer notes: "We believe GB300 (expected late CY25) likely a single rack (NVL72) configuration, suggesting DC cooling kinks being ironed out." The Oppenheimer analyst goes on to note that "DeepSeek [is] a positive for NVDA as CSPs rapidly integrate innovations into Western models." Schafer also thinks that the CapEx of hyperscalers will be up 40 percent this year to over $300 billion vs. the $220 billion figure for 2024. And, in what aligns with our previous post on the topic, Schafer thinks AI ASICs will coexist with GPUs: "CSP custom AI ASIC projects coexist with GPUs, in our view—ASICs primarily used for internal workloads while GPUs used for broader, dynamic, higher performance AI applications. NVDA remains best positioned in AI, benefiting from full-stack AI hardware/software." Do you think NVIDIA will be able to provide another triple beat (revenue, EPS, guidance) when it reports its earnings next week? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section below.

Title: Bird flu: They Are Re-Running The COVID Script

DON'T GET LEFT OUT: HUNTER MUST BE STOPPED! by Rhoda Wilson | Feb 20, 2025 | Coincidence, Conspiracy Fact and Theory, Headline News, Health | 2 comments This article was originally published by Rhoda Wilson at The Exposé. Bird flu is a rerun of COVID-19. This is not a conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The pandemic planners have a playbook; they used it for COVID-19 and now they are using it for bird flu, with one difference. With COVID-19, they targeted us directly. With bird flu, they are targeting us indirectly through our food supply. It is currently being claimed that bird flu is widespread in wild birds worldwide and is causing outbreaks in poultry, dairy cows and cats, and has resulted in several human cases in the US, including a recent case in Wyoming. By coincidence, yesterday, the US Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) gave conditional approval for an updated bird flu vaccine for poultry. An outbreak of bird flu at a farm in New Zealand in December resulted in the culling of almost 160,000 hens. But, warned New Zealand’s Biosecurity Minister yesterday, a different strain of the flu was circulating globally and would likely arrive in New Zealand. At the end of January, GAVI “Vaccines Work” was delighted to announce that restrictions had been put in place in the UK to curb the spread of bird flu. Almost 1.8 million farmed and captive birds have been culled in the past three months due to avian flu outbreaks across the UK. Reuters reported yesterday that there has been an outbreak of bird flu in Canada. And so, it goes on. Countries’ pandemic-vaccine industries are moving in lockstep, just as they did with COVID-19. In the following, Clayton Baker explains more about their pandemic playbook, which they used for COVID-19 and are now using for bird flu. “Learn it, and you can understand how to put an end to it,” he writes. Although he refers to the pandemic industry in the USA, similar can be applied worldwide. Bird Flu Is a Rerun of the Covid Playbook By Clayton J. Baker as published by Brownstone Institute Bird flu can be very confusing. This is true because, as is so often the case with our government, those who claim to be trying to solve the problem – our so-called “public health” and “pandemic preparedness” “experts” – are actually the ones who created the problem. What is worse, they are actively seeking to perpetuate it. In this brief article, my goal is to explain what is happening with H5N1 Bird flu in the clearest, most fundamental terms. I hope to make it so clear that all our elected officials can understand what is going on and therefore can take action to stop it. The key to understanding the current bird flu panic is this: Bird flu is a complete rerun of the covid script. There is just one twist: Last time, with covid, the pandemic-planning bioterrorists directly blackmailed us by taking away our civil rights, to coerce us to accept their unsafe and ineffective vaccines. This time, with Bird flu, the pandemic planning bioterrorists are indirectly blackmailing us by targeting our food, to coerce us to accept more of their unsafe and ineffective vaccines into our food supply and those who supply it. Here is their playbook. Learn it, and you can understand how to put an end to it. Let’s review. What happened during covid? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” genetically manipulated a bat coronavirus to be both transmissible and virulent in humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In late 2019, the laboratory-manipulated coronavirus bioweapon, SARS-CoV-2, was leaked from a laboratory. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines were rushed into production, “public health” authorities took advantage of the laboratory leak by denying its occurrence while simultaneously coercing governments to impose lockdowns and other civil rights violations on the human population. 5. To perpetuate the lockdowns, “public health” authorities performed indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the population, knowing full well this would generate countless false positives. 6. The authorities used this excessive testing, along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the lockdowns and the civil rights abuses. 7. The lockdowns and civil rights abuses were used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines into their own bodies in exchange for a return to normal life. What is happening now with H5N1 bird flu? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” have genetically manipulated the H5N1 avian influenza virus to cross classes of animals and even become more transmissible to humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In early 2022, a lab-manipulated bird flu bioweapon leaked from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, Georgia. Multiple Bird flu leaks have also occurred from other laboratories. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed into production, “public health” authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence while simultaneously coercing our government to impose mass slaughter of farm animals, creating food shortages for the human population. 5. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, “public health” authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. 6. Authorities are using this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. 7. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not a conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The “pandemic planners” are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Here’s how: 1. End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately. This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatises farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2. End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyses decision-makers and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul.TheCDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing Health and Human Services (“HHS”) agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the covid era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s biography shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Georgia, should be shut down and thoroughly investigated. 6. The Kawaoka Bird flu laboratory at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well. 7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. People such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (“OPPR”).Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 million bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled. 10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognise what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

A new subsea data cable... Since Trump is intent on issuing as many executive orders as he can, why hasn’t he ordered USDA to stop testing chickens for the (figmentary) bird flu? Not only is that rogue agency culling entire flocks for just one “asymptomatic” positive PCR test, they’re using it as an excuse to cull the flocks of commercial farms within 5-7 miles of the PCR positive flock. Trump’s failure to stop the psychopaths from executing the Covid script against our nation’s poultry farmers is the reason for the eggflation. Now the script has extended to PCR testing cattle, which means higher beef prices are no doubt ahead. SB, its a chess game. My theory is that Trump is letting this kind of stuff (which terrifies the ignorant, the same ones that oppose his efforts) so much of his opposition (press?) is occupied with this stuff and have even more trouble keeping up with and criticizing Trump’s waste and fraud cleansing efforts. I’ve thought on this a while and wondered the same. I think Trump is allowing this to confuse and terrify his enemies. So many are worried about the bird flu and their attention is split away from TDS activities. You must be logged in to post a comment.

Title: Big Tech is on a cost-cutting spree to fund big AI bets

Time Published: 2025-02-20T12:06:42Z
Full Content:
Good morning! A fully remote job where you're left alone and get paid up to $30 an hour. Interested? Training AI might be the gig for you. In today's big story, BI obtained a leaked recording of an Amazon all-hands showing how the tech giant plans to cut costs so it can make big bets. What's on deck Markets: Investors are getting cocky about the stock market, and that could be a red flag. Tech: Why Microsoft's quantum 'breakthrough' is so important. Business: This EV maker was once more valuable than Ford. Now it's bankrupt. But first, we're robbing Peter to pay Paul. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Big Tech is on a cost-cutting spree to fuel its endless appetite for big AI bets. Amazon is the latest tech giant trying to find the sweet spot between saving money and not shying away from making big bets. The company's retail CEO, Doug Herrington, told employees to keep reducing costs so it can fund "big investments in big new businesses," according to a recording of last month's internal all-hands meeting that Business Insider's Eugene Kim obtained. In an ideal world, companies' big bets can save them money in the long run. Amazon's investments in AI and warehouses have helped it lower the costs of fulfilling customers' orders. Amazon Robotics' chief technologist, Tye Brady, spoke to Eugene about the progress made there. Finding the balance between savings and innovation is key. Herrington told employees every team should simultaneously look to reduce costs and develop new ideas. Gail Carpenter, Amazon's retail CFO, also described how cost-cutting is part of a wider formula, not a one-way street. "As a reminder, this work isn't just about cost reduction — it enables us to invest in a better customer experience," she said in the meeting. Companies' big bets can take a while to pay off, though. AI projects aren't cheap, from hardware and data center needs to the talent to get it up and running. And while expectations are high for AI's impact, those benefits haven't fully materialized. In the meantime, tech companies can't afford to take their foot off the gas, lest they risk falling behind competitors. And if the big bets aren't helping companies save money yet, they'll need to look elsewhere. Amazon has laid off at least 27,000 people since late 2022 and shrunk less profitable businesses like its fashion and fitness program. Meta, which hasn't backed down from its massive tech budget, has also taken steps to cut spending while remaining aggressive on the AI front. The company recently cut thousands of underperformers, taking a page from Amazon's playbook, while simultaneously ramping up hiring machine-learning engineers. The government is employing fewer people and they're traveling less. United Airlines could lose millions of dollars. 1. Are we too confident in the stock market? Good news: Americans are actually feeling hopeful about the market. Bad news: We need a healthy dose of skepticism to watch out for risks. The confidence investors are feeling about stocks could quickly turn to arrogance, leaving them exposed. 2. Breaking up with Bumble. The dating app's stock plummeted on Wednesday following its latest earnings report, which forecasted lower-than-expected sales. Since its 2021 IPO, Bumble has lost over 90% of its market value. Shifting habits and app fatigue are problems for dating platforms, perhaps lowering how much users are willing to pay for Bumble's service. 3. Palantir's stock slumps. Shares of the software company, which is a major US defense contractor, tanked 10% after reports that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered budget cuts. The slump ended a four-day winning streak for Palantir, whose stock had, until Wednesday, surged 65% this year. 1. Hey, Siri. Tell me about the new $599 iPhone with AI. Apple announced its budget-friendly iPhone 16e, available to preorder on Friday. The phone is complete with Apple Intelligence and an Action button for shortcuts. After a rocky period for iPhone sales, a cheaper version is Apple's chance to attract new customers with its new AI features. 2. There are no guarantees in the world of startups, but these companies are good bets. Silicon Valley's past few years have been filled with cost-cutting and layoffs, but AI has brought excitement back to the industry. BI compiled 43 startups — focused on everything from women's health to security — worth betting your career on. 3. Microsoft's quantum "breakthrough." Microsoft on Wednesday unveiled Majorana 1, a quantum chip the company says is powered by a new state of matter. "Most of us grew up learning there are three main types of matter that matter: solid, liquid, and gas. Today, that changed," CEO Satya Nadella said. The development is "just as revolutionary as the silicon transistor," a quantum expert told BI. 1. Monopolies and murder. The manifesto found on Luigi Mangione before he was accused and charged in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson doesn't focus too much on the quality of healthcare in the US. Instead, the note largely discusses the size of its parent company, UnitedHealth Group. In other words, Mangione seemed to be angry about monopolization — and it points to a very real trend: American business is bigger than ever. 2. Big Tech's data centers have a pollution problem. The solution could be to bury it. AI data centers are still largely powered by fossil fuels despite promises of leveraging renewable or low-carbon energy sources. Big Tech is now exploring carbon capture, which essentially means burying carbon emissions underground. It's not a new technique, but it's both costly and complex. 3. Another EV startup runs out of charge. Electric-truck startup Nikola filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday. The truck maker rode a wave of enthusiasm when it went public in 2020 and was once worth more than Ford. However, the startup was later engulfed in a high-profile fraud scandal and ultimately failed to commercialize its tech. It's the latest once-promising EV startup to collapse. Elon Musk is hunting for Social Security fraud. It's not very common. Walmart reports Q4 earnings The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

Title: Vanguard Pauses Corporate Meetings Over New ESG Guidance

Top mutual fund manager Vanguard has paused meetings with portfolio companies while it reviews the impact of new guidance on investor activism from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, according to people familiar with the matter. In a recent notice, the SEC, whose acting chair was appointed by President Donald Trump, revised its “beneficial ownership reporting” interpretations in ways that could put new burdens on firms like Vanguard that now rely on the SEC’s Schedule 13G form to report major holdings. Going forward, the SEC said managers may need to use the more complex Schedule 13D, which would increase their costs, if they pressure management on matters like climate questions or whether a company has a staggered board or poison pill takeover defenses. Vanguard put the pause in place because it is “trying to process and understand the new guidelines so they can remain a 13G filer and not a 13D filer,” said one of the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. Ending the meetings could reduce the power of shareholder activists focused on environmental, social or governance questions, corporate attorneys say, the apparent goal of the SEC’s current leadership. But it could also diminish the input that executives receive from top investors on more traditional corporate questions like executive pay. A Vanguard representative did not respond to questions on Tuesday. Rival asset manager BlackRock had also paused meetings with some of its portfolio companies. A company representative did not immediately comment on the status of these meetings on Tuesday.

Buzzing Stocks Today, Stocks that will see action today: February 20, 2025 - Patanjali Foods, Kothari Industrial Corp, Mahindra grroup, Religare Enterprises, BSE, Torrent Power, Bharat Forge, Cox & Kings, JBM Auto, Waaree Energies · Strong growth expected in sum assured and rider attachments to protect value of new business margins · Proposed increase in FDI limits is expected to enhance capital flow, supporting the sector’s growth Ratings agency ICRA expects growth in sum assured in the retail segment for insurers to continue to outpace the growth in retail new business premium (NBP). Private insurers saw a surge in retail sum assured by 41% YoY in 9M FY2025 (30% in FY2024), higher than the retail NBP growth of 17% (7% in FY2024). Given the shift in product mix from high value of new business (VNB) margin non-participating (non-par) products to low VNB margin unit-linked investment plan (ULIP) products, the pressure on the VNB margins is likely to continue, resulting in increased sum assured and rider attachments in a bid to offset the negative impact of the product shift. As the capital requirements for life insurers are also a function of the sum assured in force, with higher growth in sum assured, the capital intensity for incremental growth is expected to remain high, resulting in elevated incremental capital requirements for the sector. The recently proposed increase in the foreign direct investment (FDI) limits to 100% could boost the inflow of capital to the sector and reduce the protection gap in India. While historically, the growth in life insurance premiums has been driven by investment considerations, with increased consumer awareness, the industry has seen an uptick in demand for the coverage of mortality risks. While the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) continues to dominate the market with a substantial share in retail and group NBP, however, private insurers lead in terms of sum assured. With a market share of 84% in terms of retail sum assured and 80% in terms of group sum assured in 9M FY2025, private players have a relatively higher share when compared to their market share of 63% and 28% in terms of retail NBP and group NBP, respectively. Neha Parikh, Vice President & Sector Head – Financial Sector Ratings, ICRA said: “Mortality protection demands significant upfront capital, risk management and reinsurance tie-ups, resulting in concentration of the sum assured market. Within the retail and group sum assured, capital requirement is even higher in the retail segment, given that the risk is underwritten for a much longer tenor. Some large private insurers benefit from their long operating history, resulting in backbook surplus[1], hence, partly supporting their ability to underwrite a higher sum assured”. With higher growth in sum assured compared to the NBP segment, the market share in sum assured outstanding at the end of December 2024 is much higher at 65% (45% in FY2018) in the retail segment for the top five private insurers. Given the capital requirements, the market for sum assured is likely to remain skewed towards the insurers who have high backbook surplus or can bring in a larger pool of capital. To augment their capital base, the large private insurers have raised sub-debt of Rs. 29.5 billion (additional sub-debt of Rs. 23.0 billion expected by Mar-2025) and equity of Rs. 19.1 billion in YTDFY2025 compared to the overall sub-debt of Rs. 43.7 billion raised in the previous four years. “The high capital intensity of the life insurance sector necessitates substantial investments to sustain growth. The increase in FDI limits will provide the much-needed capital boost to the sector, enabling insurers to expand their mortality coverage and increasing penetration,” Parikh added. The shift towards ULIPs from the non-participating segment from FY2024 onwards has been driven by the changes in the taxation regime for high ticket non-par policies, buoyancy in equity capital markets and decline in yields on Government securities, thereby lowering the returns on non-par policies. Apart from the need to protect the VNB margins, the growth in sum assured over the years has also been supported by the increase in ticket sizes with the retail sum assured per policy for private insurers rising to Rs. 2.4 million in FY2024 from Rs. 1.3 million in FY2018. For LIC, however, the retail sum assured per policy has remained stable (Rs. 0.3 million) and is much lower compared to the private insurers. Group sum assured also saw significant growth with the growth in credit life, driven by robust credit expansion in the retail segment (CAGR of 18% in FY2021-FY2024), especially unsecured loans (CAGR of 21%), where the penetration of credit life remains higher.

Title: Microsoft says it’s found the missing piece in quantum’s puzzle
URL: https://qz.com/microsoft-quantum-computing-chip-majorana-1-topological-1851765486
Time Published: 2025-02-19T21:58:00Z

Microsoft (MSFT-1.72%) is changing what you learned about the states of matter in elementary school with a creation that it said will advance “the path to useful quantum computing.” As part of what it calls the “year to become Quantum-Ready,” the company unveiled its first quantum computing chip, Majorana 1, built with “topological superconductors” or “topoconductors” — a “breakthrough” material that enabled the company to create a new state of matter called “topological superconductivity.” Quantum computers typically use quantum bits — or qubits — which are usually electrons, photons, or another subatomic particle. Connected together, qubits have far more processing power than binary 0s and 1s that classical computers use. Unlike classical binary bits, qubits can be 0 and 1 at the same time in a state called superposition. The more qubits that are used, however, the more errors usually occur in a computation. Microsoft claims its solution to reducing those errors lies in the topoconductors. Unlike familiar solids, liquids, and gases, this new state of matter occurs when electrons pair up and flow with zero resistance while being protected by special mathematical properties that make them extremely stable. The new state of matter, which Microsoft has worked on for almost two decades, makes it possible for quantum systems to scale to one million qubits on a single, hand-sized chip, the company said, adding that it has demonstrated the world’s first topological qubit and already placed eight on Majorana 1. At one million qubits, a quantum computer could perform far more difficult calculations than traditional computers with higher accuracy. “[Q]uantum computing at this scale could lead to innovations like self-healing materials that repair cracks in bridges, sustainable agriculture, and safer chemical discovery,” Chetan Nayak, corporate vice president of quantum hardware at Microsoft, said in a statement. “What today requires billions of dollars in exhaustive experimental searches and wet-lab experiments could be found, instead, through calculation on a quantum computer.” Because these specially protected qubits are smaller, faster, and more reliable than traditional qubits, Microsoft said it could build a working prototype of an error-free quantum computer in just years rather than decades. The company calls this a “fault-tolerant prototype” or FTP. “Imagine a chip that can fit in the palm of your hand yet is capable of solving problems that even all the computers on Earth today combined could not,” Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella wrote on X. “This is our focus: When productivity rises, economies grow faster, benefiting every sector and every corner of the globe.” Despite the excitement, Microsoft customers won’t be able to use the Majorana 1 chip through its Azure public cloud, CNBC (CMCSA-0.08%) reported, as Microsoft continues its research with national laboratories and universities. Quantum computing stocks climbed off of the announcement, with D-Wave Quantum (QBTS-1.29%) shares jumping more than 8%, Quantum Computing (QUBT-6.49%) rising 7.8%, and Rigetti Computing (RGTI-6.64%) shares up almost 5%. Earlier this year, quantum stocks plunged after both Nvidia (NVDA-3.69%) chief executive Jensen Huang and Meta (META-1.66%) chief executive Mark Zuckerberg cast doubts about the technology’s near-term potential. During the chipmaker’s financial analyst day at the Consumer Electronics Show in January, Huang said useful quantum computers are likely decades away. “If you said 15 years for very useful quantum computers, that would probably be on the early side,” Huang said. “If you said 30, it’s probably on the late side. But if you picked 20, I think a whole bunch of us would believe it.” However, Nvidia announced that it will host its first Quantum Day at its GPU Technology Conference in March. Nvidia will also unveil quantum computing “advances shortening the timeline to useful applications,” the company said.

Title: Asus Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16GB GDDR7

Full Content:
Now that Nvidia’s top-end GeForce RTX 50 series graphics cards have landed, ready to take on serious 4K gaming, it's high time for a deeper-value option for the 1440p crowd. Nvidia built its GeForce RTX 5070 Ti from the same 4nm GB203 GPU as the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 and pairs it with similar features, like 16GB of GDDR7 memory, but fewer silicon resources. At $749 for base-model cards, the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti looks to be a better value than the $999 RTX 5080: It’s roughly 11% slower at best and 21% slower at worst, but for 25% less cash at MSRP. The actual street prices of these RTX 50-series cards versus their list prices are the big question mark, though; whether you'll be able to get one easily at $749 remains to be seen. (Cards go on sale Feb. 20.) We tested the RTX 5070 Ti in a three-fan Asus Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, a $749-MSRP card that represents the GPU at a decent baseline with room for overclocking. In our tests, it's behind the RTX 5080, but overclocking, if you're intrepid, could make up some of the difference in performance. For that, we give the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti our Editors' Choice award for high-end graphics cards; the RTX 5080 retains the award for "elite level" cards. To create the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, Nvidia uses an old yet common strategy known as "binning," which sees chipmakers repurposing slightly under-spec silicon in lower-grade, lower-priced products. Nvidia didn’t do this much initially with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 40-series "Ada Lovelace" GPUs, which was surprising for various reasons. That changed with the launch of the RTX 40-series Super graphics cards, and with the RTX 50-series Blackwell parts, you can now see this strategy deployed from the beginning. Essentially, this works as follows. Nvidia starts by creating large graphics chips, like the GB203, which powers the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080, in that case with 10,752 CUDA cores, 336 texture mapping units (TMUs), 112 raster operation processors (ROPs), and 84 ray-tracing (RT) cores. TSMC provides the graphics die on its 4N 4nm fabrication process, and it is relatively large, covering an area of 378mm2 and containing 45.6 billion transistors. Creating computer chips is not a perfect process, though. Inevitably, minor defects creep in, rendering some of the hardware resources on a fabricated chip unusable. Simply tossing these chips out would be wasteful, but stockpiling them is also costly, making it surprising that Nvidia didn’t bin the RTX 40 series from the start. Binning deactivates the circuitry that isn’t functioning correctly, creating a lesser product with fewer total resources available that the chipmaker can charge less for at retail. For instance, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is also based on the GB203 GPU die, but with just 8,960 CUDA cores, 280 TMUs, 96 ROPs, and 70 RT cores active. The GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is also clocked a fair bit slower than the RTX 5080 in terms of its turbo clock, reducing performance. The memory side of the chip remains mostly unchanged, though, which is promising; that frequently gets reduced when creating cut-down cards like this. The RTX 5070 Ti and the RTX 5080 both have 16GB of GDDR7 memory connecting to the GPU over a 256-bit wide bus. The RTX 5070 Ti has slower 28Gbps GDDR7, versus the RTX 5080's 30Gbps GDDR7, reducing bandwidth. The 20% reduction in core count separates the RTX 5070 Ti from the RTX 5080. However, the roughly 6% reduction in turbo clocks and the 7% reduction in memory bandwidth also play a key role in separating the two. These disparities in hardware match up well with the $250 price difference, but real-world performance could set the RTX 5070 Ti closer or further from the RTX 5080. We'll see below. This design also allows Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5070 Ti to have considerable overclocking potential. The GB203 works at higher clock speeds in the RTX 5080, suggesting that the RTX 5070 Ti could also run faster when pushed. The RTX 5070 Ti's reduced clocks are likely in place to distance it from the RTX 5080, rather than due to any limitation of the chip itself. Asus' Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, sent for review, features a large triple-fan thermal solution, predominantly black with some white stripes. The card has a metal backplate with a cutout showing the aluminum fins of the heatsink and several metal heat pipes that help with the cooling process. This cutout also allows air to pass through so that one of the three fans on the front of the card can blow air straight through the heatsink and the card. The card extends out to fill 2.5 slots on the rear I/O panel, with three DisplayPort ports and a single HDMI port. It also requires a 12VHPWR power connection to operate, but Asus includes an adapter that converts three eight-pin PCIe power connectors to one 12VHPWR connection to work with conventional power supplies. (Nvidia suggests a minimum 750-watt power supply to run the RTX 5070 Ti.) The graphics card testbed that we used to test the Asus Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16GB GDDR7 is built around a Gigabyte X870E Aorus Master motherboard with an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X processor paired with a Cooler Master 360mm Cooler Master water cooler. Two Crucial M.2 PCIe 2TB SSDs and two 16GB sticks of DDR5 RAM clocked at 6,000MHz and set in a dual-channel configuration sort out the storage and memory. Finally, a 1,500-watt Corsair power supply powers the entire system, which is housed in an Asus ProArt chassis. The primary competition for the RTX 5070 Ti comes from the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 and the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX. Though both cards are pricier, they are also older cards that are now going to have a hard time justifying their $999 price tags. Both are close to the RTX 5070 Ti in terms of performance, too. (The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super and the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT, at their list prices, are more competitively priced than the RTX 5070 Ti at $749.) The 3DMark results we gathered from the RTX 5070 Ti suggest it will slightly outperform or perform on par with the RTX 4080. Based on the 3DMark scores, it also has the potential to surpass all of the AMD graphics cards, though the Radeon RX 7900 XTX pulled ahead in a few of the 3DMark tests. The RTX 5070 Ti and the RTX 4080 performed similarly in the Unigine Superposition test, which also suggests they might perform similarly in games. We'll see in a moment how that shakes out. Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is quite capable of crunching on content creation tasks. It was essentially tied with the RTX 4070 Ti Super and the RTX 4080 in our Adobe Premiere Pro test. At the same time, it placed a notable step ahead of the AMD cards that we tested. The RTX 4080 also outperformed the RTX 5070 Ti in the GPU-centric trial that we ran in Blender, and it did so by a more meaningful margin specifically in the Monster model (one of the three renders that the test performs). The two cards were more evenly matched in Junkshop and Classroom. Nevertheless, you might be better off sticking with an RTX 4080, if you have one, if you intend to use your graphics card more for content creation work than gaming. Improving AI performance has been a core goal for Nvidia with each new generation of graphics cards, but the extent of the upgrade varies heavily depending on the task at hand. (Testing AI performance in any holistic sense is difficult, particularly as on-card AI muscle addresses a wide range of tasks--training versus inferencing, for one thing. It is impossible with current tools to test a very broad set of AI local-processing scenarios in an all-encompassing way.) This test presses the GPU on a series of text-creation inferencing tasks via four popular AI large language models (LLMs) and produces an overall score in each case. (Here, Procyon uses versions of Mistral, Microsoft's PHI, and two flavors of Meta AI's Llama.) It also reports how many tokens (or discrete units of text, in the context of text generation) the hardware can produce per second with each model. It also measures the time it takes to produce the first token, as getting as much work done as fast as possible is basically AI’s mission statement. Generally speaking, the RTX 5070 Ti topped the RTX 4070 Ti Super and the RTX 4080... The RTX 5070 Ti outpaced the 4080 by varying amounts depending on the test, with the most considerable performance advantage when using the Mistral 7B model. It is faster when using other models, but to a lesser degree. With that, Nvidia has achieved measurable generational gains in AI performance, which will become more relevant as the technology becomes more applicable to everyday users. Black Myth Wukong's benchmark utility supports Nvidia DLSS 3 and AMD FSR 3, with frame generation supported for both. It also supports Intel XeSS, making it ideal for testing these screen-optimization technologies against each other. (As a refresher: frame generation uses AI to insert predictive frames between traditionally rendered ones.) This is a highly demanding title that pushes even the fastest graphics cards to their limit, making frame generation and resolution scaling all but necessary for smooth frame rates. The RTX 5070 Ti couldn't quite keep up with the RTX 5080 in this benchmark test, but it landed in a dead heat with the RTX 4080. Activating DLSS frame generation enabled the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti to slightly outperform the RTX 4080, but enabling FSR's own frame generation also helped the Radeon RX 7900 XTX outperform the RTX 5070 Ti at 1080p and 1440p. The next set of in-game benchmarks more accurately reflects the performance of the graphics cards we test without AI-driven assistance. The results of the synthetic tests suggested that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti should perform about on par with the RTX 4080. In most cases, this is also what the in-game benchmarks showed, but at times, the RTX 5070 Ti lagged behind the older RTX 4080. Still, 1080p and 1440p frame rates were very respectable across the board, even with the killer Cyberpunk bench. The tests in which the RTX 5070 Ti and the RTX 4080 performed pretty close to each other were Cyberpunk 2077, F1 2024, Far Cry 6, Call of Duty Modern Warfare III, and Returnal. We saw several near-ties between those two graphics cards in these games, but whenever we didn't see a tie in one of these games, the RTX 4080 tended to be on top. In Cyberpunk 2077, for example, the RTX 4080 was 5% faster than the RTX 5070 Ti at 1080p, but the two cards tied at 1440p and 4K. The test scores from F1 2024 showed the same relative results, with the RTX 4080 again slightly ahead at 1080p but tied at other resolutions. The only game that showed the RTX 5070 Ti clearly behind the RTX 4080 without ties was Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora; the RTX 4080 was about 5% faster on average across all three resolutions. Taking a brief look at the RTX 5070 Ti’s performance relative to the RTX 4070 Ti Super or the Radeon RX 7900 XTX, we see both cards are clearly behind the RTX 5070 Ti. At least in AMD's case, this is because Radeon RX 7000-series cards simply have less capable ray-tracing hardware than the Nvidia competition, which holds them back in these tests that support ray tracing. (The RTX 4070 Ti Super also has fewer RT cores.) From a value perspective, this might be Nvidia's most attractive offering in its GeForce RTX 50-series family of graphics cards to date. Nvidia’s RTX 5080 is no doubt faster than the RTX 5070 Ti, but the degree to which the RTX 5080 beats the RTX 5070 Ti is interesting. We’ll spare you a blow-by-blow of percentage differences between these two cards in each game and at each resolution, but overall, the test results showed the RTX 5080 with an 11%-to-21% advantage over the RTX 5070 Ti. That excludes Far Cry 6, which showed signs of a bottleneck by either the processor or the game engine, putting the two cards even closer together. The RTX 5070 Ti costs 25% less, so it's a compelling value. Turning to games that don’t support ray tracing, AMD's Radeon RX 7900 XTX could more competently compete with Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5070 Ti. The RX 7900 XTX didn't pull ahead here except in the Total War: Three Kingdoms at 1440p, but it could at least tie with the RTX 5070 Ti in most tests. One interesting thing these games that lack ray-tracing support show us is actually related to ray-tracing performance. In ray-traced games, the RTX 5070 Ti tended to tie with or lag behind the RTX 4080. This is due to the former's smaller count of RT cores, comparatively speaking, despite architectural improvements with Blackwell. In games that don’t support ray-tracing, the RTX 5070 Ti held a clear advantage at all resolutions. This reflects Nvidia's claimed architectural improvements to its Blackwell CUDA cores, TMUs, and ROPs over the RTX 40-series Lovelace parts. This explains why the RTX 5070 Ti pulled ahead in these pure rasterization-based game tests. At the same time, however, it also shows the ray-tracing hardware of the RTX 5070 Ti isn’t quite as capable as that found on the RTX 4080, which is why the RTX 4080 was able to pull ahead in those games that do support ray-tracing. Though the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti stole a win here from the RTX 4080, consider it a hollow victory. Total War: Three Kingdoms and Shadow of the Tomb Raider are both 2018 games, which we continue to use because they are some of the last games to feature in-game benchmarks that don’t support ray tracing. Ray tracing is now nearly universal for major AAA titles, so you likely will only enjoy this advantage on the RTX 5070 Ti in older games. We measure the power consumption of our graphics card testbed as a whole using a Kill-A-Watt wall meter. This gives us insight into the power draw of each card tested, as the card is the only part that changes between tests. All of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 50-series cards to date have been more power-hungry than their direct predecessors, and the same is true for the RTX 5070 Ti. It doesn’t use that much more than the RTX 4070 Ti Super, only about 5% more at most, according to the test results we gathered. The Asus Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16GB GDDR7 model we tested also seemed to stay reasonably cool during our tests. It did run a bit warmer than the RTX 4070 Ti Super we tested and a bit warmer than the RTX 4080, but running a bit hotter is also a trend with the RTX 50 series. However, the Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16GB GDDR7 was cooler than the RTX 5080 Founders Edition during gaming, and its temperatures were well within the typical safe range for graphics cards. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is a competent high-end graphics card dunked into a soon-to-be highly competitive market segment. From a value perspective, this might be Nvidia's most attractive offering in its GeForce RTX 50-series family of graphics cards so far, thus earning it our Editors' Choice award. It doesn’t cost $2,000 like the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090, and it costs 25% less at MSRP than the RTX 5080 with an 11%-to-21% drop in speeds, adding up to a better overall value. Better yet, if you're willing to push the card, overclocking could compensate for some of what you lose in performance relative to the RTX 5080. What might be more challenging to overcome for the RTX 5070 Ti is the older Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 Super. We didn’t retest the RTX 4080 Super for this review, but look at the RTX 4080 as a proxy: The RTX 4080 Super is generally about 5% faster than the RTX 4080 and priced at $999 MSRP. That price point for that card isn’t tenable anymore, with the RTX 5080 also at $999, so price drops could set the RTX 4080 Super price closer to that of the RTX 5070 Ti, if you can find one. That would make the RTX 4080 Super the better option, as it also has slightly better performance, but that all depends on what the price will fall to--if, indeed, it even does. That’s difficult to tell for now, as the RTX 4080 Super is sold out or priced above MSRP everywhere we can find it online. The RTX 5070 Ti clearly has the upper hand against AMD’s competing RX 7000-series graphics cards. The Radeon RX 7900 XTX initially launched at $999 and has since been reduced to $899, making it more expensive than the RTX 5070 Ti, which outperforms it. As the market stands, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is an excellent option for anyone looking to avoid paying out for an RTX 5080 but still get high-end 1400p and decent 4K gaming performance. The lack of in-stock competition also makes it a dominant choice in the market at publish time, but just be sure to evaluate against what is in stock when shopping. (The RTX 5070 Ti may well see its own in-stock challenges, like the first two RTX 50 GPUs have.) For the right price, an RTX 4080 Super could be more appealing. Also know that AMD has new cards coming soon, on an announced Q1 2025 timeline, and they could well be right in the RTX 5070 Ti's wheelhouse. Stay tuned, and if you can't find the card readily on sale in the weeks after launch, be patient; more options from AMD and Nvidia alike are coming soon. For as long as I can remember, I've had love of all things tech, spurred on, in part, by a love of gaming.

Now that Nvidia’s top-end GeForce RTX 50 series graphics cards have landed, ready to take on serious 4K gaming, it's high time for a deeper-value option for the 1440p crowd. Nvidia built its GeForce RTX 5070 Ti from the same 4nm GB203 GPU as the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 and pairs it with similar features, like 16GB of GDDR7 memory, but fewer silicon resources. At $749 for base-model cards, the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti looks to be a better value than the $999 RTX 5080: It’s roughly 11% slower at best and 21% slower at worst, but for 25% less cash at MSRP. The actual street prices of these RTX 50-series cards versus their list prices are the big question mark, though; whether you'll be able to get one easily at $749 remains to be seen. (Cards go on sale Feb. 20.) We tested the RTX 5070 Ti in a three-fan Asus Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, a $749-MSRP card that represents the GPU at a decent baseline with room for overclocking. In our tests, it's behind the RTX 5080, but overclocking, if you're intrepid, could make up some of the difference in performance. For that, we give the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti our Editors' Choice award for high-end graphics cards; the RTX 5080 retains the award for "elite level" cards. To create the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, Nvidia uses an old yet common strategy known as "binning," which sees chipmakers repurposing slightly under-spec silicon in lower-grade, lower-priced products. Nvidia didn’t do this much initially with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 40-series "Ada Lovelace" GPUs, which was surprising for various reasons. That changed with the launch of the RTX 40-series Super graphics cards, and with the RTX 50-series Blackwell parts, you can now see this strategy deployed from the beginning. Essentially, this works as follows. Nvidia starts by creating large graphics chips, like the GB203, which powers the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080, in that case with 10,752 CUDA cores, 336 texture mapping units (TMUs), 112 raster operation processors (ROPs), and 84 ray-tracing (RT) cores. TSMC provides the graphics die on its 4N 4nm fabrication process, and it is relatively large, covering an area of 378mm2 and containing 45.6 billion transistors. Creating computer chips is not a perfect process, though. Inevitably, minor defects creep in, rendering some of the hardware resources on a fabricated chip unusable. Simply tossing these chips out would be wasteful, but stockpiling them is also costly, making it surprising that Nvidia didn’t bin the RTX 40 series from the start. Binning deactivates the circuitry that isn’t functioning correctly, creating a lesser product with fewer total resources available that the chipmaker can charge less for at retail. For instance, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is also based on the GB203 GPU die, but with just 8,960 CUDA cores, 280 TMUs, 96 ROPs, and 70 RT cores active. The GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is also clocked a fair bit slower than the RTX 5080 in terms of its turbo clock, reducing performance. The memory side of the chip remains mostly unchanged, though, which is promising; that frequently gets reduced when creating cut-down cards like this. The RTX 5070 Ti and the RTX 5080 both have 16GB of GDDR7 memory connecting to the GPU over a 256-bit wide bus. The RTX 5070 Ti has slower 28Gbps GDDR7, versus the RTX 5080's 30Gbps GDDR7, reducing bandwidth. The 20% reduction in core count separates the RTX 5070 Ti from the RTX 5080. However, the roughly 6% reduction in turbo clocks and the 7% reduction in memory bandwidth also play a key role in separating the two. These disparities in hardware match up well with the $250 price difference, but real-world performance could set the RTX 5070 Ti closer or further from the RTX 5080. We'll see below. This design also allows Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5070 Ti to have considerable overclocking potential. The GB203 works at higher clock speeds in the RTX 5080, suggesting that the RTX 5070 Ti could also run faster when pushed. The RTX 5070 Ti's reduced clocks are likely in place to distance it from the RTX 5080, rather than due to any limitation of the chip itself. Asus' Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, sent for review, features a large triple-fan thermal solution, predominantly black with some white stripes. The card has a metal backplate with a cutout showing the aluminum fins of the heatsink and several metal heat pipes that help with the cooling process. This cutout also allows air to pass through so that one of the three fans on the front of the card can blow air straight through the heatsink and the card. The card extends out to fill 2.5 slots on the rear I/O panel, with three DisplayPort ports and a single HDMI port. It also requires a 12VHPWR power connection to operate, but Asus includes an adapter that converts three eight-pin PCIe power connectors to one 12VHPWR connection to work with conventional power supplies. (Nvidia suggests a minimum 750-watt power supply to run the RTX 5070 Ti.) The graphics card testbed that we used to test the Asus Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16GB GDDR7 is built around a Gigabyte X870E Aorus Master motherboard with an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X processor paired with a Cooler Master 360mm Cooler Master water cooler. Two Crucial M.2 PCIe 2TB SSDs and two 16GB sticks of DDR5 RAM clocked at 6,000MHz and set in a dual-channel configuration sort out the storage and memory. Finally, a 1,500-watt Corsair power supply powers the entire system, which is housed in an Asus ProArt chassis. The primary competition for the RTX 5070 Ti comes from the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 and the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX. Though both cards are pricier, they are also older cards that are now going to have a hard time justifying their $999 price tags. Both are close to the RTX 5070 Ti in terms of performance, too. (The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super and the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT, at their list prices, are more competitively priced than the RTX 5070 Ti at $749.) The 3DMark results we gathered from the RTX 5070 Ti suggest it will slightly outperform or perform on par with the RTX 4080. Based on the 3DMark scores, it also has the potential to surpass all of the AMD graphics cards, though the Radeon RX 7900 XTX pulled ahead in a few of the 3DMark tests. The RTX 5070 Ti and the RTX 4080 performed similarly in the Unigine Superposition test, which also suggests they might perform similarly in games. We'll see in a moment how that shakes out. Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is quite capable of crunching on content creation tasks. It was essentially tied with the RTX 4070 Ti Super and the RTX 4080 in our Adobe Premiere Pro test. At the same time, it placed a notable step ahead of the AMD cards that we tested. The RTX 4080 also outperformed the RTX 5070 Ti in the GPU-centric trial that we ran in Blender, and it did so by a more meaningful margin specifically in the Monster model (one of the three renders that the test performs). The two cards were more evenly matched in Junkshop and Classroom. Nevertheless, you might be better off sticking with an RTX 4080, if you have one, if you intend to use your graphics card more for content creation work than gaming. Improving AI performance has been a core goal for Nvidia with each new generation of graphics cards, but the extent of the upgrade varies heavily depending on the task at hand. (Testing AI performance in any holistic sense is difficult, particularly as on-card AI muscle addresses a wide range of tasks--training versus inferencing, for one thing. It is impossible with current tools to test a very broad set of AI local-processing scenarios in an all-encompassing way.) This test presses the GPU on a series of text-creation inferencing tasks via four popular AI large language models (LLMs) and produces an overall score in each case. (Here, Procyon uses versions of Mistral, Microsoft's PHI, and two flavors of Meta AI's Llama.) It also reports how many tokens (or discrete units of text, in the context of text generation) the hardware can produce per second with each model. It also measures the time it takes to produce the first token, as getting as much work done as fast as possible is basically AI’s mission statement. Generally speaking, the RTX 5070 Ti topped the RTX 4070 Ti Super and the RTX 4080... The RTX 5070 Ti outpaced the 4080 by varying amounts depending on the test, with the most considerable performance advantage when using the Mistral 7B model. It is faster when using other models, but to a lesser degree. With that, Nvidia has achieved measurable generational gains in AI performance, which will become more relevant as the technology becomes more applicable to everyday users. Black Myth Wukong's benchmark utility supports Nvidia DLSS 3 and AMD FSR 3, with frame generation supported for both. It also supports Intel XeSS, making it ideal for testing these screen-optimization technologies against each other. (As a refresher: frame generation uses AI to insert predictive frames between traditionally rendered ones.) This is a highly demanding title that pushes even the fastest graphics cards to their limit, making frame generation and resolution scaling all but necessary for smooth frame rates. The RTX 5070 Ti couldn't quite keep up with the RTX 5080 in this benchmark test, but it landed in a dead heat with the RTX 4080. Activating DLSS frame generation enabled the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti to slightly outperform the RTX 4080, but enabling FSR's own frame generation also helped the Radeon RX 7900 XTX outperform the RTX 5070 Ti at 1080p and 1440p. The next set of in-game benchmarks more accurately reflects the performance of the graphics cards we test without AI-driven assistance. The results of the synthetic tests suggested that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti should perform about on par with the RTX 4080. In most cases, this is also what the in-game benchmarks showed, but at times, the RTX 5070 Ti lagged behind the older RTX 4080. Still, 1080p and 1440p frame rates were very respectable across the board, even with the killer Cyberpunk bench. The tests in which the RTX 5070 Ti and the RTX 4080 performed pretty close to each other were Cyberpunk 2077, F1 2024, Far Cry 6, Call of Duty Modern Warfare III, and Returnal. We saw several near-ties between those two graphics cards in these games, but whenever we didn't see a tie in one of these games, the RTX 4080 tended to be on top. In Cyberpunk 2077, for example, the RTX 4080 was 5% faster than the RTX 5070 Ti at 1080p, but the two cards tied at 1440p and 4K. The test scores from F1 2024 showed the same relative results, with the RTX 4080 again slightly ahead at 1080p but tied at other resolutions. The only game that showed the RTX 5070 Ti clearly behind the RTX 4080 without ties was Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora; the RTX 4080 was about 5% faster on average across all three resolutions. Taking a brief look at the RTX 5070 Ti’s performance relative to the RTX 4070 Ti Super or the Radeon RX 7900 XTX, we see both cards are clearly behind the RTX 5070 Ti. At least in AMD's case, this is because Radeon RX 7000-series cards simply have less capable ray-tracing hardware than the Nvidia competition, which holds them back in these tests that support ray tracing. (The RTX 4070 Ti Super also has fewer RT cores.) From a value perspective, this might be Nvidia's most attractive offering in its GeForce RTX 50-series family of graphics cards to date. Nvidia’s RTX 5080 is no doubt faster than the RTX 5070 Ti, but the degree to which the RTX 5080 beats the RTX 5070 Ti is interesting. We’ll spare you a blow-by-blow of percentage differences between these two cards in each game and at each resolution, but overall, the test results showed the RTX 5080 with an 11%-to-21% advantage over the RTX 5070 Ti. That excludes Far Cry 6, which showed signs of a bottleneck by either the processor or the game engine, putting the two cards even closer together. The RTX 5070 Ti costs 25% less, so it's a compelling value. Turning to games that don’t support ray tracing, AMD's Radeon RX 7900 XTX could more competently compete with Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5070 Ti.

One interesting thing these games that lack ray-tracing support show us is actually related to ray-tracing performance.

Title: Ireland under-20 coach Neil Doak makes two changes for Wales clash
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/02/19/ireland-under-20-coach-neil-doak-makes-two-changes-for-wales-clash/
Time Published: 2025-02-19T16:30:00Z
Full Content:
Ireland head coach Neil Doak has made two changes and a positional switch to the starting team that beat Scotland for Friday night’s Under-20 Six Nations Championship clash with Wales at Rodney Parade (7.45). Cork Constitution’s Eoghan Smyth returns to the side having started in the defeat against England before being sprung from the bench against Scotland. His robust defence and straight running were missed in Edinburgh. Smyth resumes his midfield partnership with one of Ireland’s outstanding players to date, Connor Fahy, who switches back to outside centre. Gene O’Leary Kareem reverts to the replacements. The other change is in the frontrow where Ballynahinch tighthead Tom McAllister gets a chance in the run-on team, swapping places with Blackrock’s Alex McMullan, another standout player, who is on the bench. The other alterations to the replacements see UCD hooker Mikey Yarr, who played last year, return after recovering from injury. Highfield’s Conor Kennelly comes in for a try scorer the last day, Shannon’s Oisín Minogue, while Tom Wood, a son of former Lions and Ireland hooker Keith, is included in the matchday 23 for the first time. Several Ireland players have received a vote of confidence from the coaching team despite lapses in individual, and indeed the collective, performances to date and will need to repay that faith with greater clarity, precision and execution on both sides of the ball. Ireland assistant coach Andrew Browne, who won a Grand Slam at this age-grade as a player in 2007, admitted that the group had spoken about being sharper mentally and physically. “In the England game we had a lot of possession, a lot of 22 entries, [that] we just didn’t convert. We were inaccurate, which was really disappointing. “In the Scotland game we started really well and then tailed off a little bit. Then into the second half, they started the stronger and that’s something we have reviewed, how we came out in that second half because they got that momentum at the end of the first half. We did manage to redress it a little bit, but how can we be more consistent? “We talk about being relentless, we talk about being ruthless and how can we actually live [up] to those words a little bit more. That’s something we have addressed over the last couple of weeks. So, hopefully we can see a bit more of it come Friday night.” On the changes to the team, Browne explained that they wanted to have a look at a few players in a slightly different capacity, including Wood. “Tom’s a really good player. I know he’s under-19, but he was in various camps. We get to see Tom now in a competitive game, a competitive environment; it just builds that strength and depth which you’re always looking for.” Fullback Todd Lawlor is due to play an AIL match in the next couple of weeks having recovered from shoulder surgery, but it is unlikely that wing Derry Moloney, prop Niall Smyth, secondrow Alan Spicer and backrow Luke Murphy will be fit in time to play a part in the tournament, while Alex Usanov won’t. Wales beat Italy 20-18 at the Stade Comunale di Monigo last time out having lost to France in their opening game of the tournament.

Title: Trump’s SEC Leader Shifts Power From Investors to Boardrooms

New policies from the top U.S. securities regulator hand corporate boards more power over investors in ways that could curtail investor-initiated reform efforts on everything from climate policy to director contests, experts say. Since last month when U.S. President Donald Trump named Mark Uyeda acting chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the agency has made it easier for boards to block shareholder resolutions, put stricter filing requirements on passive funds, and limit investors’ communication abilities. The changes give directors more scope to nix efforts to have companies limit emissions or report workforce diversity details, while traditional activists running their own director slates could also find it harder to challenge boards, attorneys say. “It’s a relatively dramatic reallocation of power away from large shareholders back to corporate management, not just to make corporate policy but to protect themselves against activists,” said Tulane University business law professor Ann Lipton. Uyeda and other Republican officials – including Paul Atkins, Trump’s pick to run the SEC – have made clear their skepticism of environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment considerations. “Shareholder meetings were not intended under state corporate laws to be political battlegrounds or debating societies,” Uyeda said in a 2023 speech. An SEC spokesperson declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. Atkins did not respond to questions sent via his current firm. FEWER BALLOT ITEMS The SEC’s changes are in line with other Trump administration efforts such as dismantling diversity programs and withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement. ESG resolutions drew significant support in 2021 and 2022, but less so since. In a February 11 legal bulletin the SEC made it easier for companies to skip votes on the resolutions such as by claiming the proposals “micromanage” their businesses. That change could make it harder for ESG-minded activists even to start talks with corporate executives. “If it’s harder to get your resolution through at the SEC, it will be harder to do that kind of work,” said Rick Alexander, CEO of the Shareholder Commons, which tracks and writes resolutions. On Feb. 11, the SEC also revised “beneficial ownership reporting” interpretations to broaden the requirements on firms like asset managers BlackRock and Vanguard, which often rely on the SEC’s Schedule 13G form to report major holdings. Going forward, the agency tightened when managers can use the form rather than the more complex Schedule 13D, which would increase their costs. A new SEC test is if a company “exerts pressure on management” such as tying director votes to whether a company has a staggered board or poison pill takeover defenses. Proxy voting policies of both BlackRock and Vanguard suggest those circumstances could lead to critical votes. BlackRock and Vanguard declined to comment. BlackRock temporarily paused meetings with some portfolio companies as of Tuesday with an eye on the new rules. Jessica Strine, CEO of shareholder advisory firm Jasper Street Partners, said the SEC’s new interpretation could have a potential downside for companies as well if they cannot know what their top investors think. “It’s not a complete gift to management teams if it means they no longer have engagement opportunities with their top shareholders,” she said. “That means they don’t get to make their case” before votes are cast at annual meetings on matters like executive compensation. Caroline Crenshaw, currently the lone Democratic member of the SEC via e-mail said the change could chill the big funds’ outreach. “The interpretation muddies the waters for institutional investors, with the unstated goal of dissuading them from engaging with corporations. At bottom, this policy is bad for capital formation,” Crenshaw said. COMMUNICATION BREAKDOWN A third change involves new guidance on when investors can use the SEC’s electronic records system to distribute so-called “exempt solicitations,” or communications with other shareholders. Once meant as a tool to reveal closed-door discussions among bigger institutional holders, smaller investors started filing their own exempt solicitations as a cheap way to make their arguments on issues like whether to oppose a certain director or support a shareholder resolution. In a January 27 update the SEC narrowed their permissible use. The documents are “not intended to be the means through which a person disseminates written soliciting material to security holders,” the SEC said, but rather only to notify the public of written materials sent to security holders through other means. For Tom Quaadman, Senior Vice President for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a top business lobbying group, the SEC’s changes were welcome. “You’re seeing a rebalancing of SEC policies and rules that are designed to take out special interest activism and bring things back to a focus on investor return,” he said.

If you've seen value in our reporting, please contribute what you can, so we can continue to produce accurate and meaningful journalism. For everyone who needs it. HOUSE PRICES CLIMBED last year at almost double the growth rate seen in 2023, leaving prices 16.8% higher than at the peak of the Celtic Tiger property boom in 2007. According to new figures from the Central Statistics Office (CSO), residential property prices increased by 8.7% in the 12 months to December last year, up from 4.4% the previous year. House prices in Dublin rose by 8.3% in December, with prices outside of the capital up by 9%. The median, or mid-point, price of a house purchased in the year to December was €355,000, compared to €327,500 in December 2023. In the year to December, house prices in Dublin rose by 8.7% while apartment prices increased by 6.9%. The highest house price growth in Dublin was in Fingal at 10%, with South Dublin seeing a rise of 6.9%. Outside Dublin, house prices were up by 9.3% and apartment prices increased by 5.8%. The region outside of Dublin that saw the largest growth in house prices was the Border (Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Monaghan, and Sligo) at 14.2%. At the other end of the scale, the Mid-East (Kildare, Louth, Meath, and Wicklow) saw a 5.9% growth in price. The figures show that 5,177 property purchases by households at market prices were filed with Revenue last December, an increase of 2.3% when compared with the 5,063 purchases in December 2023. Advertisement The lowest median price for a house was €182,250 in Longford, while the highest median price was €660,000 in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. The most expensive Eircode area over the 12 months to December was A94 ‘Blackrock’ with a median price of €730,000, while H23 ‘Clones’ had the least expensive price of €131,000. Looking at the full year, the median price paid by households for a house was €355,000, compared with €259,000 in 2019, and €155,000 in 2013. A total of 48,775 dwelling purchases by households at market prices were filed with Revenue in 2024. This represents a 2.9% decrease compared with 50,234 purchases in 2023. The annual national index for 2024 reached a value of 183.4, which is 12.7% higher than it was for 2007 when it reached a peak of 162.7. Overall, prices of new dwellings have risen by 130.2% from their trough in the middle of 2013. Prices of existing dwellings are now 161.6% higher than at their trough in 2012. Commenting on today’s figures, senior mortgage advisor with NFP Ireland Gerry Griffin said affordability is an increasing challenge, particularly for first-time buyers. “While the pace of price increases has slowed slightly, demand remains strong, and supply is still struggling to keep up,”Griffin said. He said that if the European Central Bank proceeds with an expected interest rate cut in March, mortgage rates could fall, boosting borrowing power. “While this would benefit buyers, it could also drive further price inflation by increasing competition for available homes,” he said.

Even with lower interest rates, repayments will still be substantial given the high price levels. “For policymakers, the focus must remain on delivering more housing at a faster pace to balance the market and prevent additional pressure on prices.” Rachel McGovern, deputy chief executive at Brokers Ireland, said prices rose last year “at levels beyond what most industry commentators expected. “These levels are not sustainable except for those on high salaries and those wealthy enough to not be dependent upon mortgage finance,” she said. “There are appalling consequences for our society if policymakers don’t turn around housing in the near future and ensure that those on average incomes can achieve the ambition of owning a home. “We would call on the Government to be brave and decisive and not let another year pass before it acts on the recommendations of the Housing Commission in particular,” she said. Earlier this week, Cabinet approved €450 million in funding that is set to provide 3,000 cost rental, affordable and social homes over three years. However, Sinn Féin’s Eoin Ó Broin said the government is allocating less capital funding for social and affordable housing in 2025 that it spent in 2024.

Franklin Templeton, a major global asset manager, said Wednesday it has launched its tokenized U.S. Treasury fund in Luxembourg, expanding access to European institutional investors. The launch of the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund marks the first Luxembourg-domiciled fund investing in U.S. government securities that's fully tokenized, the asset manager claimed in a press release. This means shares in the fund are recorded and transferred on the blockchain rather than through traditional processes, using Franklin Templeton's proprietary blockchain-based transfer agency platform for handling transactions to offer enhanced efficiency, transparency and security. The fund is available on the Stellar network (XLM) for institutional investors in Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, following regulatory approval in October by Luxembourg regulators. The U.S.-registered version of the fund has attracted over $580 million of assets since its 2021 debut and is limited to U.S.-based investors only, per rwa.xyz data. Tokenized U.S. Treasuries have been at the forefront of red-hot real-world asset tokenization efforts, growing into a $4 billion asset class this year. Franklin Templeton was the first among traditional financial institutions to release such a product, and its the third largest tokenized treasury fund by assets under management behind Hashnote's USYC and BUIDL, issued by BlackRock and Securitize.

Title: Vanguard, BlackRock, And Citadel Now Hold 7.8 Million Additional Shares In Trump Media And Technology Group (DJT), With The Company Reporting Actual Billings Of Just ~$200,000 For 2024

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. When some of the biggest asset managers in the world start gobbling up shares of a company that barely makes any money, one is compelled to pause for a bit and wonder: "what do they know that I don't?" Look no further than Trump Media and Technology Group (NASDAQ: DJT) as an emblematic example of this phenomenon. For the benefit of those who might not be aware, Trump Media and Technology Group is the parent entity of the Truth Social platform, the Truth Plus content streaming service, and the soon-to-be-launched asset management and ETF service under the Truth.Fi banner. Despite its growing product portfolio, the company has yet to show any material earnings. For the year that ended on the 31st of December, Trump Media and Technology Group reported just $3.6 million in sales. What's more, when you remove the amortization of deferred revenue from this figure, actual billings for the year amount to just ~$200,000 (unearned revenue on the balance sheet declined from $4.41 million to 1.01 million by the end of 2024, implying unearned revenue recognition of $3.4 million vs. reported sales of $3.6 million). Nonetheless, Trump Media and Technology Group does have one thing going for it: its gigantic post-SPAC-merger cash balance. And, the company is now beginning to deploy its copious cash coffers to bolster its earnings. As we previously reported, Trump Media's board has now approved the diversion of up to $250 million from its current reserve of around $700 million in cash and cash equivalents towards setting up customized Separately Managed Accounts (SMAs) and ETFs, including one dedicated to Bitcoin, under the Truth.Fi banner and in partnership with Charles Schwab and Yorkville advisors. Coming back, the requisite Form 13-F filings for the previous quarter - which are now available for public scrutiny - contained a shocker: Vanguard, BlackRock, and Citadel increased their stake in Trump Media and Technology Group by a combined 7.8 million shares, and this is before the launch of the company's asset management service under the Truth.Fi banner. Of course, it is quite likely that these asset managers were simply betting on President Trump's star power to drive further gains. After all, DJT is not a stock that trades on fundamentals. Meanwhile, in another unusual development, Trump Media and Technology Group has now sued a Brazilian supreme court judge in Miami for illegally censoring right-wing voices on social media. The judge in question is currently overseeing a number of investigations into the affairs of the former Brazilian president and a staunch Trump ally, Jair Bolsonaro.

Title: Scalable Capital to open access to private equity

With a new segment on its digital investment platform, Scalable Capital is setting new standards for investors: Soon, suitable investors in Germany will get access to alternative investments such as private equity. 0 19 February 2025 Be the first to comment This content is provided by an external author without editing by Finextra. It expresses the views and opinions of the author. Through the Scalable Broker, they will be able to invest in companies that are not listed on stock exchanges for the first time. Until now, benefiting from this additional return and diversification potential has been primarily reserved for professional investors. At the start of the new offer, Scalable Capital is the first digital investment platform to offer access to the BlackRock Private Equity Fund. The fund is managed by BlackRock, one of the world's leading private markets investors trusted to manage 450 billion US dollars in alternative assets.(1) After a minimum one-off investment from 10,000 euros, the fund is also available in a savings plan. There are no front-end loads for the fund. This is a further step in the endeavour to open up the entire investment spectrum to long-term oriented investors for their financial future."As alternative investments such as private equity are becoming increasingly relevant for participation in economic growth, we now make them accessible to our investors," says Julius Weller, Vice President Broker at Scalable Capital. "With the expansion of our investment platform to include this segment, clients gain access to the high return potential of private companies. We also achieve the favourable terms and simple handling for private equity that Scalable Capital is known for."An attractive, strongly growing investment market outside of the stock exchangesGlobally, the vast majority (88%) of companies with a turnover of more than 100 million US dollars is privately held - hence not listed.(2) Making these companies investable creates a huge new investment universe that could continue to grow in the coming years, as the share of listed companies has been continuously declining for two decades. In Europe, the number of listed companies has fallen by almost 23% since 2009, while the number of private companies has risen by over 17%.(3) Germany showcases a distinct extreme in relation to this development. Here, over 98% of companies with more than 100 million euro turnover are privately owned.(4) These include numerous ‘hidden champions’ that are global market leaders in their field and represent the strength and innovative power of mid-market enterprises. Companies worldwide instead of going public prefer to remain private completely or significantly longer than before and are increasingly financing themselves via private equity. One reason for this shift is the growing need for long-term financing that private equity can offer, to adapt to advancements like artificial intelligence; additionally, accessing this capital has become more attainable. Private equity also offers more flexibility in the development of business models and strategies, contrary to what was often assumed in the past. As a result, a large part of economic value creation is shifting to the private markets. Their invested volume almost quadrupled globally between 2013 and 2023 to USD 15 trillion and is expected to rise further to USD 29 trillion by 2030.(5) Accordingly, the demand for private equity is increasing, as the asset class offers suitable investors additional investment opportunities to diversify their portfolio with high return potential. For investors who have a long investment horizon, not needing to access their money in the short term and with the corresponding risk capacity, private equity has achieved 14.9% annual growth in US dollars over the past 20 years - outperforming the popular MSCI World Index.(6) In the context of asset allocation, analyses from the BlackRock Investment Institute indicate that a mix of private market investments can be sensible at up to 20% of a portfolio. Such an allocation to a traditional portfolio with 60% stocks and 40% bonds shows a better risk-return profile in historical comparison: the expected return increases from 5.5% to 7.2% over a ten-year period, while the risk disproportionately rises from 11.3% to 12.7%.(7) This return potential is now made available to Scalable Capital clients with the respective risk capacity. Long-standing expertise in modern fund structureThe BlackRock Private Equity Fund focuses on co-investments in which majority stakes in private companies around the world are acquired together with an established network of leading private equity managers (so-called buyouts). In order to make such long-term investments in the real economy accessible to suitable investors, the European Commission created a regulation called the European long-term investment funds (ELTIF) in 2015 and recently simplified it further. Contrary to many previous private equity funds, which were mostly closed, this fund is structured as an open-end fund. This means that investors are more flexible in terms of the time of their investment and can redeem invested capital more regularly as with closed-end funds after the second anniversary of the fund’s launch date. Returns and dividends are reinvested by the fund which may result in higher compound interest and higher returns in the long term. BlackRock has more than two decades of experience in investing in the private equity asset class on behalf of its clients. The co-investment approach enables lower costs relative to similar funds and broad diversification across sectors, investment periods and regions. Fund assets can be invested quickly thanks to broad market access. Co-investments also offer the advantage that several investors thoroughly check and analyse which companies to invest in.Christian Bimueller, Head of Digital Distribution Continental Europe at BlackRock: “We’re very excited to introduce our new Private Equity solution onto Scalable Capital’s investment platform, allowing wealth investors in Germany digital access to BlackRock’s private markets capabilities for the first time. With private companies increasingly driving economic growth, we are offering a unique opportunity for long-term investors to unlock potential returns blending with traditional public markets. By breaking down barriers to investing in private assets, we are enabling wealth investors to diversify their portfolios and access institutional-quality private market investments in a digital format.”Simple investment in private equity through seamless integration into the Scalable BrokerAlternative investments will be seamlessly integrated into the Scalable Broker. The access happens conveniently via the app, where manual and postal steps are no longer required. Investors in alternative investments can also expect automatic offsetting of capital gains against loss pots and exemption orders as natural as for all other securities. Scalable Capital has added numerous functions to its platform specifically for the new asset class: the fully digitalised suitability check, a two-week revocation option for purchase orders and a comprehensive range of information to make an informed assessment of the long-term investment on offer.New asset class first in the Scalable BrokerInterested parties in Germany can from now on sign up to a waiting list to receive regular updates until the planned start in April. They will also receive information on private markets investments and be the first to find out when the BlackRock Private Equity Fund will be available in the Scalable Broker.Shares can be redeemed for the first time two years after the fund's launch. After that, a sale is possible in general once a quarter. Due to the long-term nature of the investments, the total of redemptions are limited to 5% of the fund volume. There are no front-end loads nor redemption fees. The management fee for the actively managed fund is 1.95% p.a. If the fund exceeds its minimum return, the fund manager also receives a performance-related profit share.

In a meeting with the country’s top bankers, the Chancellor set out a plan to speed up settlement of securities trades which will make the UK’s capital markets more competitive to drive economic growth through the Plan for Change and put more money into people’s pockets. 0 19 February 2025 Be the first to comment This content is provided by an external author without editing by Finextra. It expresses the views and opinions of the author. The top brass from JP Morgan, Blackrock, Abrdn, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Citi, Fidelity, and Schroders were welcomed into No11 Downing Street for breakfast this morning, as part of ongoing engagement with industry to hone the Financial Services Growth and Competitiveness Strategy - one of the eight key growth sectors identified in the Modern Industrial Strategy.Rachel Reeves spoke about the importance of going further and faster to drive growth and revealed that the Government had accepted all recommendations made by the Accelerated Settlement Technical Group - confirming that the UK will move to a ‘T+1’ standard for settling securities trades from 11 October 2027.The change means that a typical securities trade, such as buying and selling shares, would be settled the day after it is agreed - instead of the current two-day standard. Faster settlement will support economic growth by putting the UK at the forefront of modernised, highly efficient and automated capital markets, bringing the UK into line with key international markets such as the US and reducing costs for investors by limiting risks when making trades.Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves said: I am determined to go further and faster to drive growth and put more money into people’s pockets through our Plan for Change. Speeding up the settlement of trades makes our financial markets more efficient and internationally competitive.Chief Executive Officer of the Financial Conduct Authority, Nikhil Rathi said: We highlighted how the move to T+1 will make our markets more efficient and support growth in our recent letter to the Prime Minister. We will support industry as they move to T+1 and expect firms to engage and plan early.Governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey said: Shortening the UK securities settlement cycle to T+1 will bring important financial stability benefits from reduced counterparty credit risk in financial markets. It is important that firms and settlement infrastructures have robust plans for an orderly transition in October 2027. As part of this effort, the Bank looks forward to continuing dialogue with regulators in other markets which are pursuing similar changes.The government has accepted all the recommendations made by the Accelerated Settlement Technical Group, which has created a detailed implementation plan to ensure a smooth transition to T+1, and confirmed that it will bring forward legislation to implement the change, including setting the date to move to the new standard. Terms of Reference have been published for the next phase of the project, which will continue to be led by the industry taskforce with Andrew Douglas as chair and HMT, the FCA and the Bank as observers. Industry chairs from the EU and Switzerland have also been invited to observe the UK industry taskforce to encourage alignment across Europe.The taskforce will oversee and manage implementation of the recommendations up until T+1 is successfully implemented, and for a short period afterwards to evaluate the short-term impacts.The government, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England support the industry recommendation to move to T+1 settlement in UK markets by 11 October 2027 and call on the industry to engage with the recommendations and start their planning as soon as possible.Notes to editors Stakeholder commentary:Tiina Lee, Chief Executive Officer of Citi UK said: We welcome the move to a T+1 settlement cycle in UK markets and appreciate the hard work in achieving the alignment of timelines with the EU. Based on Citi’s experience with global investors, coordinated market reforms are critical to the growth and competitiveness of the UK. We look forward to working with other industry participants to ensure a smooth transition in October 2027.Conor Hillery, Deputy CEO & Head of Investment Banking in EMEA, JP Morgan, said: We welcome the Chancellor’s continued dialogue with UK financial services on its role in facilitating growth, which requires the right policy and regulatory framework. This move to a modern T+1 settlement cycle will contribute to keeping London as a competitive financial centre, so we support the government’s efforts to make it happen.Clare Woodman, Head of EMEA and CEO of Morgan Stanley said: We welcome the UK Government’s commitment to move to a T+1 settlement cycle in October 2027. The shift to a shorter settlement cycle will generate market efficiencies supporting the competitiveness of UK markets.Additional notes: The Accelerated Settlement Taskforce recommended that the UK should move to T+1 by the end of 2027. The Technical Group was set up to recommend a detailed implementation plan, including determining the detailed technical and operational changes needed to move to T+1 as well as recommending a precise implementation date. The group’s recommendations are set out in The Accelerated Settlement Taskforce Technical Group report, published on 6 February. The government’s response to the report and Terms of Reference for the next stage of the project can be found on the Accelerated Settlement (T+1) GOV.UK page To support firms during the transition, the FCA has launched a webpage dedicated to the UK’s move to T+1 settlement, where firms can access further information, key messages and links to relevant materials. The Bank will support the relevant financial market infrastructures (FMIs) it supervises during the transition to T+1. It will discuss with relevant FMIs their preparedness for T+1 settlement and will encourage them to take appropriate implementation action. The businesses in attendance at the meeting in No11 were: JP Morgan; Blackrock; Abrdn; Morgan Stanley; Goldman Sachs; City; Fidelity; Schroders. Pictures will be uploaded to HM Treasury’s Flickr.

Title: Rocket Lab chalks up 60th Electron launch, initiates new BlackSky deployment
URL: https://www.spacewar.com/reports/Rocket_Lab_achieves_milestone_with_60th_Electron_launch_initiates_new_BlackSky_missions_999.html
Time Published: 2025-02-19T10:07:50Z
Full Content:
The mission, named 'Fasten Your Space Belts,' lifted off from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in Mahia, New Zealand, at 12:17 NZDT on February 19 (23:15 UTC on February 18). The payload, BlackSky's first Gen-3 satellite, was successfully placed into a 470km orbit, strengthening the company's growing low Earth orbit network. The Gen-3 satellite was released using Rocket Lab's Motorized Lightband, a separation system that the company has provided for all previous BlackSky launches aboard Electron. Coming just ten days after the preceding Electron mission from Launch Complex 1, 'Fasten Your Space Belts' underscores Rocket Lab's increasing launch cadence. This achievement cements Electron's position as one of the most frequently launched rockets worldwide. With this latest flight, Rocket Lab has now conducted nine dedicated Electron launches for BlackSky since 2019, making it the primary launch provider for the company's constellation. Sir Peter Beck, Rocket Lab's founder and CEO, emphasized Electron's reliability: "Electron has proven once again why it is the trusted and dependable rocket of choice for constellation builders like BlackSky: control over when they launch on a rocket that delivers meticulous orbital insertion within their constellation. It's a service that really showcases Electron's strength as a market leader in launch, and one we're looking forward to providing again and again for our next launches for BlackSky." BlackSky CEO Brian O'Toole highlighted the mission's significance: "The successful launch of our first Gen-3 satellite represents a major step forward in delivering transformative, next-generation space-based intelligence capabilities to our customers. We look forward to commissioning this new satellite and delivering very high-resolution imagery and AI-enabled analytics at industry-leading speeds." This mission is part of an active launch schedule for Rocket Lab in 2025. Upcoming plans include additional dedicated Electron launches to expand BlackSky's constellation, launches from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 2 in Virginia, and the highly anticipated first flight of Neutron, the company's new medium-lift reusable rocket.

Title: New Crypto to 10X as Saylor’s Strategy Plans to Add $42B to Its $BTC Stash
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/new-crypto-to-10x-as-strategy-plans-to-add-42b-btc/
Time Published: 2025-02-19T10:04:10Z
Full Content:
Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) is now one step closer to adding another $42B worth of Bitcoin ($BTC) to its balance sheet by 2027. Most importantly, all of the raised funds will go toward $BTC purchases. Strategy’s $BTC bet is paying off, as evident from its stock performance, so more institutional investors may add crypto to their portfolios soon–and not just $BTC. We share the best new crypto to benefit from the upcoming bull run. Strategy currently holds $45.88B worth of $BTC. On February 10, the company bought 7.6K $BTC for $742.4M at roughly $97K per coin. This brought Strategy’s BTC Yield, a KPI that measures the change in $BTC-to-diluted-share ratio over time, to 4.1%, up 1.2% from January 27. In an official statement, Strategy explained its new convertible notes will not accrue interest, so their principal amount is fixed. Investors, too, retain the option to recall their notes at face value from March 1, 2028, or if the company undergoes a fundamental corporate transformation. MSTR price barely reacted to the news–in fact, it dipped 1.1% since yesterday. However, MSTR’s yearly growth of 373% proves Saylor’s strategy is working. Growing institutional demand for $BTC is the main factor that drives a broader crypto rally this year. However, not all established altcoins and new crypto on presale will feel the effects equally. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is one of the best meme coins that could explode when $BTC hits a new all-time high (ATH). When $BTC reaches the $150K and $200K price targets, BTC Bull Token will reward its community with $BTC airdrops. All you need to get free $BTC is to hold $BTCBULL in the Best Wallet app. Another massive airdrop, this time, of $BTCBULL tokens, will happen when $BTC hits $250K. The presale raised $2.3M in just a week, showing strong momentum. One $BTCCBULL now costs $0.00237, but the price is growing fast as more investors join the movement. Solana is now the fastest-growing blockchain ecosystem–the cumulative market cap of its tokens surged 9X in 2024. Unfortunately, the network struggles to handle the influx of new apps and users. This leads to congestion and, sometimes, failed transactions. Solaxy ($SOLX) introduces a Layer-2 solution that speeds up processing, lowers fees, and prevents network outages by offloading part of transactions from Solana mainnet to its side chain. It relies on the tried and tested Ethereum’s rollup architecture and thus is reliable for high-throughput applications like AI agent tokens and DeFi protocols. Solaxy’s native token, $SOLX, now costs $0.00164 on presale. Early adopters invested $22.2M into the project so far, and the next price uptick will happen when the project crosses the $22.8M milestone. After the $SOLX token launches on exchanges, it could reach $0.032. The much-anticipated deployment of Solaxy’s Layer-2 chain should support this momentum and help $SOLX hit $0.2 by the end of 2026. It might be time for Dogecoin ($SOGE) to retire, as another dog now dominates the meme coin sector–Broccoli. Broccoli is the dog of Binance’s founder Changpeng Zhao, also known as CZ. Zhao received the dog as a gift from his Dubai-based friend and has since bonded strongly with the Belgian Malinois pup. CZ didn’t launch any tokens himself but promised he’d support top Broccoli-themed tokens on BNB Chain with extra liquidity. This triggered an influx of Broccoli coins to the market. FirstBroccoli ($BROCCOLI) is the original and best-performing Broccoli token. It hit the ground running the next day after CZ posted about his dog on X and already reached a $70M market cap. This morning, $BROCCOLI hit a new ATH of $0.0881 but has since corrected to $0.07, which might present an appealing entry opportunity for those who believe the token will see more upside. Strategy’s $42B $BTC expansion plan shows strong confidence in the $BTC-first, $BTC-only approach that made MSTR one of the best-performing US stocks. But for real investors, smaller-cap new crypto like $BTCBULL and $SOLX could offer greater returns due to their lower entry points. However, remember that the crypto market is volatile, and no gains are guaranteed, even with $BTC. Always DYOR and diversify your portfolio to offset potential losses.

Title: I lined up outside Costco to buy eggs right when it opened. They were gone in 8 minutes.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/costco-eggs-bird-flu-shortages-2025-2
Time Published: 2025-02-19T09:46:01Z
Full Content:
Egg supply issues in the US amid a bird flu outbreak have pushed prices to record highs and made it difficult for stores to keep cartons stocked on shelves. In a survey conducted by Numerator, a market research firm, over half of shoppers said they'd seen shortages of eggs or found them out-of-stock at stores, including BJ's, Costco, Target, Trader Joe's, and Publix. I visited a Costco store in New York City to see firsthand how consumers navigate egg supply issues and price hikes. Here's a play-by-play of how I managed to get one of the last cartons in the store. Manhattan's only Costco store is located at East River Plaza, a shopping complex in East Harlem. I often have to circle the parking lot and wait for a spot when I make my usual Costco runs on Sunday afternoons, but I had no trouble finding a place to park that early. Some people I spoke with said they hadn't arrived early to buy eggs but instead preferred to shop when the store was less crowded. They also said morning grocery trips worked best with their busy schedules. When asked why they were at the store so early, two people said they'd had trouble finding eggs at other stores and had come to Costco in search of an affordable supply. "People don't want to overpay for eggs," one shopper, who declined to give his name, told Business Insider. "That's why I stock up on them." "It's a shame. It's a shame how much eggs cost," another shopper who asked not to be identified said. I noticed scanning membership cards beforehand allowed for better traffic flow once the doors opened. Crowds gathered outside the store by the parking lot and in the indoor vestibule leading to the warehouse entrance. I estimated that there were around 30 to 40 people between them. It took some maneuvering for all the people and carts to fit through the doors, but overall, I found the process orderly and efficient. Some people stopped at the entrance to scan their cards again, but employees waved them through and said that wasn't necessary if they'd been processed outside. I've shopped at Costco stores in the Midwest and Iceland. The busiest location is Costco in New York City. I'd never seen the aisles look so spacious. I figured it was best to head straight there just in case the eggs went quickly. I was surprised to find that there weren't any sets of five dozen cage-free eggs for sale, only smaller cartons with two dozen eggs. A Costco employee told me that egg deliveries have been inconsistent and that the store's stock varies daily. Since the Manhattan location hadn't received any eggs that morning, the cartons in stock were likely leftover from closing the day before, the employee said. My neighbors and I occasionally pick up items from Costco for each other. They bought me some cheese on their latest shopping trip, so I owed them a favor. I stayed in the refrigerated section to see how long it would take for the eggs to sell out. I watched several shoppers, who had also arrived early, walk into the refrigerated section. They seemed to express disappointment after seeing the eggs were sold out. I saw one person with six packages of eggs in their cart, but for the most part, shoppers took one or two cartons each when I was in the store. Some Costco locations have limited customers to three egg cartons per person, but policies appear to vary by store. Costco representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The average price of a dozen large eggs in US cities was $4.95 as of January, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Costco's price during my visit was 70 cents lower than the national average. In my experience, Manhattan's Costco usually has a small line of people waiting outside before it opens, but this shopping trip felt different. The strategic planning required to buy a carton of eggs reminded me of the frantic rush of securing Taylor Swift's Eras Tour tickets. In this economy, eggs no longer feel like a basic grocery staple. They're a hot luxury item that flies off the shelves, available to the most devoted fans. Jump to

The government, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England support the industry recommendation to move to T+1 settlement in UK markets by 11 October 2027 and call on industry to engage with the recommendations and start their planning as soon as possible. In a meeting with the country’s top bankers, the Chancellor set out a plan to speed up settlement of securities trades which will make the UK’s capital markets more competitive to drive economic growth through the Plan for Change and put more money into people’s pockets. The top brass from JP Morgan, Blackrock, Abrdn, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Citi, Fidelity, and Schroders were welcomed into No11 Downing Street for breakfast this morning, as part of ongoing engagement with industry to hone the Financial Services Growth and Competitiveness Strategy – one of the eight key growth sectors identified in the Modern Industrial Strategy. Rachel Reeves spoke about the importance of going further and faster to drive growth and revealed that the Government had accepted all recommendations made by the Accelerated Settlement Technical Group – confirming that the UK will move to a ‘T+1’ standard for settling securities trades from 11 October 2027. The change means that a typical securities trade, such as buying and selling shares, would be settled the day after it is agreed – instead of the current two-day standard. Faster settlement will support economic growth by putting the UK at the forefront of modernised, highly efficient and automated capital markets, bringing the UK into line with key international markets such as the US and reducing costs for investors by limiting risks when making trades. Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves said: I am determined to go further and faster to drive growth and put more money into people’s pockets through our Plan for Change. Speeding up the settlement of trades makes our financial markets more efficient and internationally competitive. Chief Executive Officer of the Financial Conduct Authority, Nikhil Rathi said: We highlighted how the move to T+1 will make our markets more efficient and support growth in our recent letter to the Prime Minister. We will support industry as they move to T+1 and expect firms to engage and plan early. Governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey said: Shortening the UK securities settlement cycle to T+1 will bring important financial stability benefits from reduced counterparty credit risk in financial markets. It is important that firms and settlement infrastructures have robust plans for an orderly transition in October 2027. As part of this effort, the Bank looks forward to continuing dialogue with regulators in other markets which are pursuing similar changes. The government has accepted all the recommendations made by the Accelerated Settlement Technical Group, which has created a detailed implementation plan to ensure a smooth transition to T+1, and confirmed that it will bring forward legislation to implement the change, including setting the date to move to the new standard. Terms of Reference have been published for the next phase of the project, which will continue to be led by the industry taskforce with Andrew Douglas as chair and HMT, the FCA and the Bank as observers. Industry chairs from the EU and Switzerland have also been invited to observe the UK industry taskforce to encourage alignment across Europe. The taskforce will oversee and manage implementation of the recommendations up until T+1 is successfully implemented, and for a short period afterwards to evaluate the short-term impacts. The government, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England support the industry recommendation to move to T+1 settlement in UK markets by 11 October 2027 and call on the industry to engage with the recommendations and start their planning as soon as possible. Stakeholder commentary: Tiina Lee, Chief Executive Officer of Citi UK said: We welcome the move to a T+1 settlement cycle in UK markets and appreciate the hard work in achieving the alignment of timelines with the EU. Based on Citi’s experience with global investors, coordinated market reforms are critical to the growth and competitiveness of the UK. We look forward to working with other industry participants to ensure a smooth transition in October 2027. Conor Hillery, Deputy CEO & Head of Investment Banking in EMEA, JP Morgan, said: We welcome the Chancellor’s continued dialogue with UK financial services on its role in facilitating growth, which requires the right policy and regulatory framework. This move to a modern T+1 settlement cycle will contribute to keeping London as a competitive financial centre, so we support the government’s efforts to make it happen. Clare Woodman, Head of EMEA and CEO of Morgan Stanley International said: We welcome the UK Government’s commitment to move to a T+1 settlement cycle in October 2027. The shift to a shorter settlement cycle will generate market efficiencies supporting the competitiveness of UK markets. Additional notes: The Accelerated Settlement Taskforce recommended that the UK should move to T+1 by the end of 2027. The Technical Group was set up to recommend a detailed implementation plan, including determining the detailed technical and operational changes needed to move to T+1 as well as recommending a precise implementation date. The group’s recommendations are set out in The Accelerated Settlement Taskforce Technical Group report, published on 6 February. The government’s response to the report and Terms of Reference for the next stage of the project can be found on the Accelerated Settlement (T+1) GOV.UK page To support firms during the transition, the FCA has launched a webpage dedicated to the UK’s move to T+1 settlement, where firms can access further information, key messages and links to relevant materials. The Bank will support the relevant financial market infrastructures (FMIs) it supervises during the transition to T+1. It will discuss with relevant FMIs their preparedness for T+1 settlement and will encourage them to take appropriate implementation action. The businesses in attendance at the meeting in No11 were: JP Morgan; Blackrock; Abrdn; Morgan Stanley; Goldman Sachs; Citi; Fidelity; Schroders. Pictures will be uploaded to HM Treasury’s Flickr.

Title: Germany Goes To The Polls On The 23rd February

BERLIN, GERMANY - FEBRUARY 03: Friedrich Merz, chancellor candidate and leader of the Christian ... [+] Democrats (CDU), speaks to delegates at a CDU party congress on February 03, 2025 in Berlin, Germany. The congress is taking place following Merz's recent controversial move in the Bundestag, in which he sought to push through legislation on immigration and security, knowing it depended on support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). Germany faces snap parliamentary elections on February 23. (Photo by Maja Hitij/Getty Images) We are now a few days away from the German general election (February 23), which is becoming even more significant in the context of the Munich Peace Conference where pronouncements from America officials that the U.S. is pushing Europe to take a greater role in its defense (and in that of Ukraine), and in particular the courting of the far-right AfD by both Elon Musk and Vice President JD Vance, have proven highly controversial. As we write the center-right CDU has close to 30% in polls, the AfD has 21%, the SDP 15% and the Greens are on 13%. My sense is that the next Chancellor will be Friedrich Merz, the leader of the CDU (allied to the CSU in the south of Germany), and he will lead a coalition, most likely made up of the Social Democrats – where Olaf Scholz might be deposed as leader (by Boris Pistorius) if that party does not perform well. It is possible, given their hawkish stance on Russia that the Green party might also be part of the coalition. At the same time, it is not clear whether the FDP — currently a coalition partner, will garner enough votes to take part in parliament, and the same is true to the far-left, nationalist Sahra Wagenknecht party. The context to the election is important. Germany’s economy has been moribund – weighed down by the shock of the war in Ukraine, a muddled energy policy, the constraints that planning laws put on urban development and a growing debate on immigration, amidst several terror attacks. The economy, immigration and to a lesser extent military spending are the main issues in the campaign. In particular, Merz — a corporate lawyer and former chairman of BlackRock in Germany — has recently upped the ante on immigration, and a week ago proposed a new policy on border control in parliament. The fact that the far-right AfD voted with this proposal caused consternation because the mainstream political parties in Germany have a “firewall” on any form of cooperation with the AfD. In a subsequent public speech Merz stood his ground and re-affirmed his tougher stance on immigration, in a sign that he is prepared to take much bolder policy decisions than Olaf Scholz (who is seen to have had an indecisive chancellorship). The attention that American politicians and Musk have paid to the AfD is not only a sign of poor judgement on their part, but a development that will significantly damage relations between the U.S. and Germany. The AfD have little to no chance of serving in government. Assuming that Merz is elected he has several policy challenges. The first is to reform Germany’s energy policy, potentially by introducing more nuclear and fusion driven power, the second is to pare back planning regulations, and the third will be to find pragmatic ways around Germany’s debt bake in order to permit greater military spending (combat readiness is an very serious issue for Germany’s military). From an economic and investment point of view the question we are focused on is whether the coronation of Merz as chancellor will catalyze a change in sentiment in the German economy, and a recovery in the economy. The DAX index is already powering ahead this year and is one of the best performing equity markets. Once the election is over, the focus will be on the urgency and speed with which a coalition can be formed (compromised will need to be found on issues like tax reform, immigration and foreign policy), and the extent to which Germany starts to play a leadership role on the EU stage.

Title: While client climate commitments waver, some media agencies are doubling down

Check out the other features included with Digiday+ to help you stay ahead When ad agencies first began signing up to the B Corp movement, execs hoped the climate-friendly status would appeal to new clients and draw industry recruits (as well as further environmental causes). Agency leaders still cling to that hope, but they do so in a changed political environment. Last week, Stagwell media agency Assembly certified its European and Asia-Pacific businesses as B Corps. Its U.S., African and Indian businesses are also going through the certification process. At the same time, global full-service agency Dept re-certified its B Corp status — expanding its climate and social commitments beyond its European base and across its global network. Less attention has been given to the companies pulling back from sustainability promises than to those retreating from diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) commitments in recent weeks and months. Amazon, Meta, Publicis Groupe and McDonald’s are among the companies that have reset their DE&I policies, for example. But following the inauguration of President Donald “drill, baby drill” Trump in January, climate commitments could well be the next frontline between right wing politicians and the advertising world. That month, the six largest banks in the U.S., including JPMorgan Chase, Citibank and Wells Fargo — as well as asset management firm BlackRock — announced their withdrawal from a collective agreement first signed at Cop26, which pledged to support net zero-aligned investments. The announcement came just a week before the Palisades Fire began tearing through much of Los Angeles County. “There’s quite a lot of negative discourse at the moment surrounding sustainability and companies pulling targets and their commitments,” said Gaby Sethi, head of global impact at Assembly. In addition to its B Corp certification, ​​Wayne Blodwell, Assembly’s recently appointed global svp of programmatic, has been tasked with making the agency’s media trading practices more environmentally sustainable, according to Sethi. “We are using this as a moment to double down on what we’re doing and why we’re doing it, and making sure that our people know that we’re not going to be swayed,” she said. It’s a marked change from the business atmosphere of just a few years ago, when companies forged ahead on climate promises and the industry’s biggest players made public pledges to reduce advertising’s direct impact on the environment. Since 2022 GroupM, for example, has worked to reduce its carbon emissions per media impressions by half, by the end of the decade. It’s unclear how far along the media network is in that goal, but in its most recent update on its progress (in WPP’s 2024 annual report), GroupM owner WPP reported it had reduced its CO2 emissions 18% year-on-year. A spokesperson for the network told Digiday that its commitments are “key” to competitive reviews, but especially for ones covering EMEA. It’s less of a concern for U.S. clients. B Corp status is a difficult label to acquire for many businesses — Sethi said the process took over two years for Assembly — and requires that companies alter the legal “articles of incorporation” documents to include commitments to the planet and society, as well as to shareholders. Where it matters to clients, though, is during the initial stages of a competitive pitch. In October, for example, Chocolate brand Tony’s Chocolonely, for example, partially credited its decision to work with agency Total Mediaplus to its B Corp status. Similarly, Sethi credited two client wins to the agency certifying as a B Corp, though she declined to name the new accounts. “Having the B Corp status has been really important,” she told Digiday. For the most part, however, climate and sustainability commitments remain common ”hygiene factors” for brands reviewing prospective partners — not “deciding factors” — according to MediaSense’s chief strategy officer, Ryan Kangisser. “You want to know that you’re doing business with companies that are focused on the right things,” he said. “I don’t think we’ve won any pitches on being B Corp in itself,” said Dept CEO Dimi Albers, who added that the badge gave agencies a calling card that expressed their values to clients. It hadn’t tipped Dept over the edge in a pitch, but he said: “Informally, I think it’s a massive difference maker.” Even if B Corp status or other environmental commitments aren’t deciding factors for clients, they do help agencies recruit staff. Albers said Dept’s B Corp status had helped it hire new talent since it first qualified, while Sethi told Digiday: “We’ve started to see it come [up] in the conversations we’re having with candidates.” Ultimately, a claim to have access to the best talent can also become a selling point for an agency’s new business team. “For clients, that’s music to their ears,” said Kangisser. Agencies act downstream of their clients, though. Before Citi Bank and JP Morgan Chase cut their ties to the Net Zero Banking Alliance, several brands had already decided their commitments to climate-friendly business had become obstacles. In 2024, Nike laid off sustainability staffers during its summer restructuring; Crocs set its net zero target back another 10 years to 2040; and Coca-Cola and Nestlé missed virgin plastic-reduction targets. That July four Havas agencies — the holding company was the first of the big agencies to embrace B Corp as a vehicle for environmental and social progress — were stripped of their accreditation by B Lab, the company that manages the scheme, after it decided Havas Media Network’s appointment to Shell’s global media account was ”a breach of the B Corp community’s core values.” And the Global Media Sustainability Framework (GMSF), initially unveiled by the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM) and Ad Net Zero at Cannes Lions — was then left without its central patron after GARM folded under the pressure of an Elon Musk lawsuit. After years of mounting climate commitments from advertisers, Dept global impact lead Pooja Dingidal said companies must now factor in a political “backlash” to their thinking about risk. Meanwhile, those that would like to jettison eco-friendly policies to aid the bottom line have the political cover to do so. It would be unsurprising if, now that some advertisers are taking their foot off the gas, agencies consider following in their wake. While Assembly and Dept are sticking to their promises — others may decide that if clients aren’t impressed, the work of B Corp accreditation or net zero targets aren’t worth it. Whether that holds for the rest of the year is anyone’s guess, but Amazon’s impact on ad pricing is already undeniable. Shifting search habits have put a dent in Google’s market dominance. It’s not the only company affected, though.

February 18, 2025 20:09 ET | Source: Robbins LLP Robbins LLP SAN DIEGO, Feb. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Robbins LLP reminds stockholders that a class action was filed on behalf of all investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK) securities between February 3, 2022 and February 3, 2025. Merck is a global healthcare company. For more information, submit a form, email attorney Aaron Dumas, Jr., or give us a call at (800) 350-6003. The Allegations: Robbins LLP is Investigating Allegations that Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK) Misled Investors Regarding the Projected Revenue Outlook and Growth of Gardasil According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Merck’s projected revenue outlook and anticipated growth of Gardasil while also minimizing risk from competition and drug approval developments, such as China’s approval to shift Gardasil to a 2-dose regimen. In truth, Merck’s optimistic reports of growth, claims of successful consumer activation and education in China, overall ability to drive demand, and efforts to downplay the impact of competition on Gardasil fell short of the reality. The complaint alleges that on February 4, 2025, Merck announced it would no longer achieve the long-forecasted $11 billion in sales of Gardasil by 2030, as it would cease shipments of Gardasil to China “through at least midyear” to facilitate a “rapid reduction of inventory.” On this news, Merck's stock price fell more than 9%, from $99.79 per share on February 3, 2025, to $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025. What Now: You may be eligible to participate in the class action against Merck & Co., Inc. Shareholders who want to serve as lead plaintiff for the class must do so by April 14, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. You do not have to participate in the case to be eligible for a recovery. If you choose to take no action, you can remain an absent class member. For more information, click here. All representation is on a contingency fee basis. Shareholders pay no fees or expenses.
