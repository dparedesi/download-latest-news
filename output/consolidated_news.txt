Title: Bitcoin Holds Strong Near All-Time High – Market Not Overheated Yet, Data Shows

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitcoin is holding firm above the $115,000 level after several days of trading below it, signaling renewed strength in the market. The bullish tone is building as Ethereum posts massive gains and altcoins begin to show strong moves over the past few days. For some analysts, this could be the start of the long-awaited altseason; for others, it’s simply the rest of the market catching up to Bitcoin’s earlier rally. Top analyst Axel Adler noted that Bitcoin’s price is now trading close to its all-time high, with the BTC Z-Score (Price, 30/365) sitting around +1.5σ above its one-year norm. This reading is well below the +2.5σ level typically associated with overheating, suggesting that while momentum is strong, it is not yet at extreme levels. The current environment offers a favorable backdrop for potential upside, with room for the market to expand further before reaching overheated conditions. With altcoins gaining traction and Ethereum’s rally adding fuel to the market’s optimism, the coming days could determine whether this is a sustainable breakout or just another phase of consolidation before the next major move. According to Adler, Bitcoin’s current market setup is showing a positive backdrop but with some important caveats. Adler points out that the Adjusted Price Divergence (APD) remains negative near −1.5 after rebounding from local lows around −2. This metric suggests that Bitcoin’s price is still outpacing on-chain activity, although the gap between the two is narrowing. In other words, while price momentum is firm, the network’s transactional activity and usage haven’t yet fully caught up. This discrepancy creates an interesting dynamic for the market. Adler explains that the bias still favors price, meaning momentum is being driven more by investor positioning and sentiment than by on-chain fundamentals. For the rally to gain more structural support, a healthier setup would see APD move toward zero. This could happen in one of two ways: either network activity increases significantly while price moves sideways or posts modest gains, or Bitcoin’s price cools off to better align with current usage levels. Importantly, Adler warns against interpreting APD moving toward zero as a direct buy or sell signal. Instead, it represents a sign of normalization — a point where market price and underlying network fundamentals are better aligned. For now, Bitcoin’s technical and macro backdrop remains bullish, but sustained long-term growth will likely require the network to catch up with price action. Bitcoin is consolidating above the $115,724 support level after a brief dip below it earlier this month. The daily chart shows price stabilizing just above the 50-day simple moving average (SMA), currently near $113,324, which has acted as a strong dynamic support throughout the recent uptrend. The short-term structure remains bullish, with BTC trading inside a range between $115,724 support and the $122,077 resistance level. Volume has tapered off slightly since the early August rebound, suggesting the market is in a wait-and-see mode before a potential breakout. A decisive close above $118,000 could invite another test of the $122,077 resistance, a key level that has capped upside attempts multiple times. If broken, this could open the door toward new all-time highs. On the downside, losing $115,724 would shift focus to the 100-day SMA at $108,983 as the next major support. Until then, the higher-lows pattern suggests buyers are defending the mid-$115K zone aggressively.

Tim Leunig US stock market outperformance reliesÂ on the âMagnificent 7â: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google, Android), Meta, Nvidia andÂ Tesla. Over the last decade, these stocks typically returned at least 500%. Without them, stock market rises would have been less than 2% aÂ year, afterÂ inflation. Pretty much everyone has an Apple or an Android phone. A new firm would struggle to break into that duopoly. Nokia, Blackberry: they came and went. Apple and Alphabet would have to really mess up to be in trouble. Walmart will do its best to cut Amazon down to size, but economies of scale in online retail and delivery are real.

But Tesla is vulnerable. Not because some people hate Musk for supporting Trump; or because others hate him for attacking Trump. But because lots of good, rival electric cars mean Tesla has no market power. In 2013, Autocar magazine described theÂ Tesla Model S as âa triumphâ, its 300-mile range about three times that of any other electric car available. Add in the supercharger network â then exclusively restricted to Tesla â and Teslas were the only EV that worked like a normal car. That gave the firm market power. Today, by contrast, while a Â£40,000 Tesla Model 3 can travel 320 miles, a 380-mile Kia EV3 costs a couple of thousands less. Teslaâs 430-mile longer-range Model 3 costs Â£45,000, but just Â£600 extra gets you a 480-mile Mercedes-Benz CLA. Tesla has a competitive offer, but it is not unique, and that hits pricing and margins. Outside of the US, Tesla produces only two, relatively similar, cars. It has no rival to this yearâs Car of the Year, the Â£23,000 electric Renault 5. As a contrast, Hyundai offers five EVs, ranging from the tiny Inster to the massive Ioniq 9. Whatever type of EV you want, Hyundai can help. Competitive pressure means Teslaâs net income was lower in 2024 than in any post-pandemic year.

The US requires car firms to lower their average CO2 emissions, while Europe requires them to sell a minimum proportion of EVs. Companies that fail can buy credits from firms, such as Tesla, that do better. Unfortunately for Tesla, President Trump has abolished this requirement in the US, destroying that revenue stream. In Europe, the EU has weakened the standard a little, reducing the value of credits. In any case, there are no credits to sell if you donât sell cars, and Teslaâs European sales have halved in the past year. Tesla is a bet on Elon Musk. That is why he can successfully demand an additional $30bn with the threat that he will otherwise walk away. That $30bn is a straightforward reduction in returns to shareholders. Shares in a company where the CEO can take so much of the upside, even in bad times, should not trade at high valuations. Capitalism can be cruel and merciless to companies that invent. All too often the second- and third-placed companies overtake the original innovator. Henry Fordâs production line cut the price of the Model T from $825 to $260 between 1908 and 1925, an 80% real-terms fall. Despite his genius, General Motors sold more cars than Ford by 1927. They copied Fordâs production line, and offered buyers a âcar for every purse and purposeâ. The parallels between then and now are uncanny: an autocratic, rather odd, genius inventor (Ford, Musk) achieved something amazing, and yet the dull-as-ditchwater corporate follower (GM, Hyundai) wins out. Perhaps Hyundai bosses have been reading business history books, and realise Tesla is as vulnerable now as Ford was then. The future for Tesla is probably muchÂ like that of Ford after the 1920s â just another erratically profitable car firm, with a share price to match.

Title: TCS layoffs mark end of one IT era, and the start of another

Time Published: 2025-08-10T02:35:08Z
Full Content:
“The future is already here; it’s just not evenly distributed,” goes the famous quote. Well, neither are job losses — or so the 12,000 laid-off employees of TCS might be ruefully thinking as they packed their personal effects, while simultaneously reading about the $100m salaries that Mark Zuckerberg was dangling to lure AI researchers to his company. There has been a spate of layoffs in tech companies, with Microsoft firing 15,000 employees, Intel 5,000, and Meta and Amazon joining the party. Much of the losses were ascribed to AI, which is driving workforce efficiencies and empowering one human to do the job of many. Till now, most of the layoffs were happening in far-off places like the US and Europe, but the TCS announcement that it was letting go 2% of the workforce brought this phenomenon closer home. Companies like TCS have traditionally been seen as a safe harbour, the closest to a ‘govt job’ in terms of stability and tenure. It had remained so through the dotcom bust, the financial crisis and others. But now, with the advent of AI, the myth seems to be busted. While TCS is the most prominent example, it is not alone. Big consulting firms are ‘streamlining’ their workforce, other big IT services firms are making disturbing noises, and job portals are teeming with tech workers’ resumes. TCS has gone to great lengths to not pin the blame on AI. But the subtext of terms like “a skill mismatch” and “future-ready” is hard to ignore. In many ways, this has been a long time coming. The IT services model of cost-arbitrage, deploying vast armies of coders and consultants at lower cost, has been in its twilight era for a while. AI just accelerated the trend, disrupting the existing linear model where more projects meant hiring more people. Now, a human analyst and a few AI agents working together can potentially do what ten analysts once did. In its place, a new kind of IT services firm is emerging — leaner, AI-native, and outcome-focused. These firms will not hire a thousand freshers to handle client reports or debug software, but deploy a small team of AI-literate experts and a suite of autonomous agents to do the job faster, cheaper, and often better. We are seeing early glimpses already, with new services startups using agents like Cursor or Devin, legal firms operating with Harvey, and research teams powered by Perplexity and NotebookLM. The societal impact of this transition in India will be immense. The whole education model of training young people in STEM skills to then place them in some IT company ensuring a stable career with a decent salary is under threat. However, this tectonic shift presents as great an opportunity as the magnitude of the threat. This is especially true for younger, entry-level employees, since “breaking first is the bottom rung of the career ladder” as Aneesh Raman, the chief economic opportunity officer at LinkedIn, wrote. However, with every crisis, including this one, comes great opportunity. These are five things I believe young people should do in this inevitable age of AI: Leapfrog with AI: The definition of literacy now includes the ability to work fluently and naturally with AI tools and agents. If you know how to, you can take AI’s help to do jobs the seniors traditionally did and jump straight to the second or third rung of the job ladder. In a recent post, for example, a tech founder offered a programmer with 2-5 years of experience a Rs 1 crore salary — qualifications and experience were not important, just the use of AI to code. Study humanities with STEM: Prompting is about knowledge, creativity, critical thinking, literature and grammar — core humanities skills. As answers become a commodity with AI, questions or ‘prompts’ will become the differentiator. Don’t just join a company, build one: There has been no better time to create a company with AI tools, agents, and ‘vibe coding’ available to everyone. It is the age of one-person unicorns — one human and a thousand AI agents building billion-dollar startups. Build a career portfolio: Don’t do just one thing. Be a product designer who also writes; a digital marketer who teaches music; a coder who also runs a pet shop. With AI, one company, many employees will give way to one employee with many companies. Build your personal brand: Do not depend on where you work for your identity; leverage AI to build your own through the talents you have or learn. You will never be out of paying work. As Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella put it: “AI is not here to replace humans. It is here to remove the barriers that prevent humans from doing their best work.” This crisis gives us the opportunity to do precisely that. (Jaspreet Bindra is the founder of AI&Beyond.

Title: BlackRock Confirms No Current XRP Or Solana Spot ETF Filings

BlackRock has confirmed that the company is not currently pursuing spot ETFs for Ripple’s XRP or Solana, despite market rumors. While the XRP and SOL communities may be disappointed by the lack of immediate action, the acknowledgment from BlackRock validates their relevance in the broader crypto market. In a recent update from The Block, BlackRock has clarified that the company currently has no plans to file for spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tied to Ripple’s XRP or SOL. This aligns with BlackRock’s cautious approach, as reflected in earlier comments from executives like CEO Larry Fink and CIO Samara Cohen. Both have emphasized their focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs for now. According to MartyParty, the world’s largest asset manager noted that they are actively exploring assets like SOL and XRP for potential future offerings rather than spot ETFs. However, the industry speculation, fueled by analysts like Nate Geraci, suggests that BlackRock could consider filing for SOL and XRP Ripple spot ETFs by an October 2025 deadline. This potential move is believed to be driven by mounting competitive pressures in the crypto ETF space and recent regulatory developments. These include the SEC’s approval of in-kind creation and redemption mechanisms, which enhance the efficiency of ETF operations. Furthermore, no official filings have been made yet, and any decision to proceed would likely depend on regulatory clarity. While the ongoing speculation that BlackRock could consider filing for SOL and XRP, an analyst known as Web3BPP has also revealed that Ripple has officially closed its nearly five-year legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Web3BPP stated that the court has confirmed that XRP sales on secondary markets are not securities transactions. According to the expert, this news has sent the altcoin’s price up by 11% reaching $3.33, capping off a remarkable 31% monthly gain and an impressive nearly 500% increase over the past year. Analysts are now setting their sights on $8 short-term price target for XRP, while some long-term forecasts envision prices soaring as high as $1,000 by 2030, due to their belief that BlackRock could consider filing for a spot XRP ETF by October. A move expected to bring in billions of dollars in fresh institutional capital. The expert also drew attention to Ethereum, which has gained 7% this week, reaching $3,908, driven largely by whale buying and expanding adoption by corporate treasuries. This surge reflects growing confidence in ETH as both a store of value and a strategic asset for businesses. Market experts are bullish on ETH’s future, with many projecting a price target of $5,000 by the end of the year. This rally is expected to be supported by interest in ETH-based ETFs and upcoming network upgrades designed to enhance performance and security. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: BlackRock To File For XRP ETF After Ripple-SEC Settlement? Market Expert Answers

Ripple Labs and the US SEC have finally closed the book on their high-profile lawsuit after almost five years of legal back-and-forth. According to a joint filing with the Second Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday, both sides agreed to drop their appeals, making Judge Analisa Torres’s 2023 ruling final. The resolution has already been factored into XRP’s price surge above $3 again. It has also led to an interesting speculation from market expert Nate Geraci, who suggested that BlackRock may now look to file for an iShares XRP ETF. The end of the case immediately prompted discussion about whether BlackRock, Wall Street’s biggest asset manager, will launch a Spot XRP ETF. Geraci, president of The ETF Store, shared on X that he believes BlackRock may have been waiting for this moment before filing for an iShares XRP ETF. “Makes zero sense for them to ignore crypto assets beyond btc & eth,” he wrote. According to him, limiting exposure to just Bitcoin and Ethereum would be like saying they’re the only assets that will ever matter. That stance is very questionable given the altcoin’s price performance since last year. Given BlackRock’s success with its Spot Bitcoin and Spot Ethereum ETFs, the XRP ETF is the logical next step, as the third-largest cryptocurrency. If BlackRock were to launch an XRP ETF, it could be a game-changer for the token’s price performance. At the time of writing, BlackRock holds the largest share of assets in both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the US. The firm’s Spot Bitcoin ETF, iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), has dominated inflows since launch and is currently holding $86.53 billion in net assets. Furthermore, its iShares Ethereum Trust has quickly become the leader among Ethereum ETFs with $12.35 billion in net assets. Polymarket now puts the odds of an XRP ETF approval at 76%, although it reached as high as 88.7% on August 8. However, Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas is leaning on the cautious side. In response to Nate Geraci’s post, Balchunas disagreed and noted that the firm is likely satisfied with its existing crypto offerings. He doesn’t expect one to be filed this year, but the longer-term outlook is harder to call. It appears BlackRock is in no rush to expand its ETF lineup for now. A BlackRock spokesperson told The Block on Friday that the company currently has no plans for a spot XRP ETF, or one for Solana. However, that doesn’t mean the door is closed forever. XRP’s price jumped more than 11% on the news of the settlement. Its price went from $3.04 and jumped to $3.36 in just a few hours after news of the settlement broke out. At the time of writing, the altcoin is trading at $3.32. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: 120 Million Square Feet: Store Closings In The United States Are On Pace To Set A New Record High In 2025

by Michael Snyder | Aug 9, 2025 | Economics | 1 comment This article was originally published by Michael Snyder at The Economic Collapse Blog. If everything is going to be just fine, why are thousands of stores closing all over the country? So far this year, the total amount of retail space that has been permanently closed has surpassed 120 million square feet. We have never seen anything like this before. Store closings spiked during the early days of the pandemic, but in 2025, stores are being permanently shuttered at an even faster pace. In fact, during the first six months of this year, 5,822 store closures were recorded… Store closures across the U.S. continue to rise, and remain on track to far significantly surpass both new openings and the figures seen in 2024. According to a new report from research and advisory firm Coresight Research, cited by CoStar News, 5,822 store closures were recorded as of June 27, compared to 3,496 closures announced during the same period of 2024. If stores continue to close at this rate, we will break the old record that was established during the pandemic by a wide margin. We are also being told that the total amount of retail space that has been permanently shuttered in 2025 has reached a staggering 120 million square feet… In June, store closings by Plano, Texas-based home goods seller At Home and Philadelphia-based pharmacy chain Rite Aid, which have both filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, “pushed the total amount of retail space to close in the U.S. this year to over 120 million square feet,” Coresight said. The real estate churn is happening “as cyclical impacts confront structural shifts,” according to one executive at the research firm. Wow. You may have noticed that there are an increasing number of abandoned buildings in your particular area. Sadly, this is just the beginning. Consumers are under more financial stress than we have ever seen, and that has resulted in a substantial decline in store traffic… Many of the retail store closures are a result of declining store traffic as more consumers respond to inflation by reducing spending. There also are more consumers turning to online shopping especially for apparel, accessories and household items. The winner is not merely Amazon but increased competition from Temu and Shein marketplaces and social commerce outlets like TikTok. Needless to say, more stores are being closed down with each passing day. After filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, Claire’s announced that it will be closing 18 more stores… Claire’s, a mall-based teen accessories retailer, has identified several locations across the country it plans to close after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Claire’s U.S., which operates Claire’s and Icing stores, made the filing in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware on Wednesday. It’s the second time since 2018 the company has filed for bankruptcy. While the company says the majority of its retail stores will remain open while it “continues to explore all strategic alternatives,” Claire’s said it identified 18 stores ahead of the Aug. 6 bankruptcy filing it would close, filings show. And home goods retailer At Home just announced that it will be closing 6 more stores… The home goods retailer At Home is closing an additional six stores across the country, bringing its total closure tally to more than two dozen as it grapples with high debt and dwindling sales. The furniture and home decor retailer based in Coppell, Texas, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on June 16, pointing to “broader economic and retail-specific market pressures,” in court documents. The bankruptcy filing and store closures follow several other “big box” retailers that have also significantly downsized their brick-and-mortar footprints this year, including Big Lots, Joann Fabrics, Kohl’s, JCPenney, Macy’s, and Party City. The retailer intially announced 26 store closures in June, before paring that down to 24 when it decided to keep open two stores in New Jersey and Wisconsin. The company added another six stores to the list, according to a statement by retail firm Hilco Consumer-Retail on Aug. 1, bringing the current number of stores it will shutter in the coming months to 30. We see more stories like this every single day. So what is going to happen if our economic momentum continues to take us very rapidly in the wrong direction? Earlier today, we learned that the percentage of student loans entering serious delinquency is absolutely exploding… The total amount of outstanding student loan debt was $1.64 trillion in the second quarter of 2025 after rising by $7 billion in the quarter. Additionally, the share of student loan debt entering serious delinquency, considered 90 days or more late, jumped to 12.9% at the end of June, up from 8% in March and above pre-pandemic trends that were around 9-10% from 2012 into early 2020, when the moratorium initially took effect. The American people are drowning in debt, and I expect delinquency rates of all types to continue to rise in the months ahead. We are going to see more layoffs too, and the fact that continuing claims for unemployment benefits just hit their highest level since 2021 is not a good sign at all… Recurring applications for unemployment benefits surged to the highest since November 2021, adding to recent signs that the labor market is weakening. Continuing claims, a proxy for the number of people receiving benefits, rose by 38,000 to 1.97 million in the week ended July 26, according to Labor Department data released Thursday. On top of everything else, U.S. manufacturing activity is now in contraction territory… From March to July, U.S. manufacturing activity contracted, according to the Institute for Supply Management’s monthly survey. The Manufacturing PMI last registered at 48, below the 50 score that differentiates growth and decline. The effective average tariff rate on all imported goods now stands at around roughly 18% versus 2.3% last year, the highest levels since the 1930s. We are in so much trouble. After evaluating all of the latest economic numbers that have come in, Mark Zandi has come to the conclusion that the “economy is on the precipice of recession”… Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, on Monday wrote a post on X that the “economy is on the precipice of recession” – citing the weaker-than-expected jobs report released Friday and the inflation data from the previous day that showed consumer prices rose as indicating the economy’s precarious position. “Consumer spending has flatlined, construction and manufacturing are contracting, and employment is set to fall. And with inflation on the rise, it is tough for the Fed to come to the rescue,” he wrote. It is hard to argue with him. Of course what is eventually coming is going to be so much worse than just a “recession”. As conditions deteriorate, will store closings slow down or will they speed up? The answer to that question is obvious. If there are stores in your local area that you really enjoy, I would visit them now while you still can, because they might not be there next year.

Title: Cloud Quarterly: Azure AI pop, AWS supply pinch and Google execution

UPDATED 11:25 EDT / AUGUST 09 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Artificial intelligence is currently running on a one-lane CapEx highway that is capacity-constrained. Hyperscaler cloud providers are the largest contributor to the momentum and as such, investors keep score with cloud growth rates. But this past quarter you had to read the footnotes and the fine print to go beyond the massive investments fueling the wave. Microsoft Corp. put up eye-popping Azure growth again, but a big part of that acceleration is Azure serving AI inference — notably OpenAI’s ChatGPT — now neatly included in the revised definition of what’s included in Azure. This is great for headlines but not conducive to apples-to-apples comparisons over time. Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services Inc. delivered the largest revenue for cloud infrastructure and sent a clear message that demand exceeds supply — meaning growth is capped by power and components, not pipeline. That creates a weird optics penalty — AWS showing growth in the high teens on a $120 billion-plus run rate and it’s deemed “concerning.” But it also telegraphs future upside as capacity goes online and depreciation cycles progress. The somewhat stealth story is Google LLC. Google Cloud posted a strong quarterly print with solid top-line growth and steadily improving operating margin — and GCP (the infrastructure-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service portion of the business) is growing materially faster than cloud overall – our estimate is nearly 40%. Google’s backlog is building at more than $250 million and $1 billion-plus deals continue to close thanks to Google’s underlying tech, a strong data foundation and its AI prowess. As the mix shifts toward AI-heavy, infrastructure-centric workloads, it becomes a tailwind for Google, which continues to lag the scale of AWS and Azure. The common thread is a capital expenditure arms race that faces real constraints. All three players said that power, sites, servers and lead times will dictate who wins AI inference and who can monetize it. Microsoft is capacity-constrained, AWS says it will take “several quarters” to rebalance, and Google raised its CapEx guide. As such, we believe strongly that this is not a one-quarter story; it’s a multiyear power grab that will determine margin structures and cash flow for the next cycle. All told, the the big three cloud players are on a pace to spend about $240 billion this calendar year on CapEx with, AI revenue coming in at about 10% of that figure. We clearly have a big hurdle before that massive investment pays back. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on our latest take of the cloud infrastructure market with a fresh look at growth rates in context, market share projections for the year, and the puts and takes for each of the big three from their earnings prints. We’ll also share some spending data from Enterprise Technology Research and a look at the road ahead. The big three U.S. hyperscalers just put up roughly $60 bilion of IaaS/PaaS revenue, and all-in IaaS/PaaS grew about 27% year-over-year. Importantly, that’s a one-point acceleration sequentially — all while demand is still outrunning supply. Margins continue to be divergent. AWS came in around 33% operating margin, down from 39% last quarter as depreciation and its seasonal stock based comp step-up hit — all with continued capacity constraints. Google Cloud, while far less profitable continues to show material improvement. Operating margin increased to roughly 21%, up from ~18% last quarter and 11% a year ago — showing, steady execution. Microsoft is a bit more opaque on its cloud operating margin as Azure drags margins down, but the company gave us some solid hints and a first-time Azure revenue disclosure. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $46.7 billion, up 27%, with gross margin 68%, down 2 points aI infrastructure scales and the mix shifts toward lower margin Azure. But for the first time, Microsoft put a number on Azure at $75 billion for the fiscal year — but remember, recent definition changes and the AI inference boost muddy apples-to-apples comparisons and contain a clever communications strategy by Microsoft. CapEx is the real story, however. The trio — plus Meta Platforms Inc. — shelled out about $87 billion in the June quarter. By our math, ~75% of Amazon’s CapEx is for AWS, underscoring the supply buildup. The bottom line is Azure’s AI pop is real (but fattened by ChatGPT inference), AWS is constrained but investing through it, and Google is quietly widening margins while it scales. Let’s take a look at the key performance indicators and do a quick scan of the metrics that matter: Microsoft: Microsoft Cloud came in at $46.7 billion for the quarter (+27% y/y) and Intelligent Cloud $29.9 billion (+26%) with Azure and other cloud +39% y/y (CC); Microsoft didn’t disclose its quarterly Azure performance but we’ve mapped our models to the $75 billion figure and estimate Azure IaaS/PaaS at ~$22.2 billion; with Azure AI services at ~$3 billion. Management guided that demand exceeds supply into 1H FY26 (2H CY 25), with its Q1 FY CapEx guided to $30 billion-plus. AWS: AWS revenue was $30.9 billion (+17.5% y/y; $124B ARR) with 32.9% operating margin pressured by seasonal SBC and higher depreciation; we peg AI services at around $2B for AWS. Backlog hit $195 bilion and CapEx stayed heavy ($24 biion of Amazon’s $31.4 billion in Q2 went to AWS by our estimates). Supply constraints continue but are expected to improve over several quarters. Google Cloud: Google Cloud posted $13.6 billion (+32% y/y) and 20.7% operating margin; we estimate GCP (IaaS/PaaS) at ~$7.2B, growing “much faster” than Google Cloud overall, with GCP AI services around ~$0.6B. Capex was $22.4B in Q2 and the 2025 outlook was raised to ~$85 billion (higher again in 2026) with backlog at $106 billion and capacity tight into 2026. Now lets look at the plusses and minuses for each player. Pluses: Azure is still ripping — ~39% growth with management guiding to ~37% cc next quarter even while capacity-constrained. We think it will be even higher – perhaps as high as 40% with GPT-5. A $368 billion RPO (+37% y/y) says the the company has a long runway, and foundry/agent adoption combined with surging token throughput says Microsoft has found a true AI platform flywheel. But it appears heavily tied to OpenAI, which is broadening it ecosystem horizontally with new open source models. Software efficiencies are kicking in with (“~90% more tokens per graphics processing unit” year on year) – without this, the gross-margin drag from scaling AI infrastructure would be much worse. The other welcome positive is the $75 billion Azure disclosure. Minuses: Microsoft still won’t disclose an Azure operating margin and is cagey around cloud operating margin. Overall Microsoft Cloud gross margin fell ~2 points year-over-year, pressured by Azure’s AI mix. Supply remains tight through 1H FY26, implying some demand is being pushed, and a significant piece of Azure’s momentum appears tied to ChatGPT inference and to reporting definitional changes, which confuse the growth rate relative to historical reporting. Pluses: Still the revenue leader and despite the drop in operating margin from the high 30s to ~32.9%, AWS remains profitable for what is essentially a company that sells access to hardware resources. Demand exceeds supply; backlog sits at ~$195 billion (+25% y/y) and the AI stack runs deep and wide — from Trainium2 to Bedrock plus AgentCore/Kiro announced at NYC Summit and a vast ecosystem that gives AWS customers choice and the company full-stack leverage. Minuses: Headline growth of ~17.5% trails Azure/GCP and invites lazy comparisons. Let’s face it – AWS is getting outmarketed right now by Microsoft when it comes to cloud momentum. Heavy CapEx means elevated depreciation and, with capacity expected to rebalance over “several quarters,” near-term upside may be capped. Pluses: Google Cloud is hitting a nice combo of scale and improving profitability — ~32% growth with ~20.7% operating margin — and GCP (IaaS/PaaS + AI) is growing much faster than overall cloud (tCR est. ~39%). Backlog momentum is real at ~$106 billion, with $250 million-plus deals doubling and $1 billion-plus wins in 1H25 matching all of 2024. Minuses: Capacity remains tight into 2026, which could pace revenue recognition, and Alphabet flagged an acceleration in depreciation as CapEx grows — both potential margin headwinds. Disclosure on pure IaaS/PaaS remains less granular, so we’re relying on qualitative signals and survey data for GCP’s exact mix shift. Let’s zoom out and take a look at the annual revenue and market share forecasts: Cloud infrastructure is now a quarter-trillion-dollar market. In 2025, the Big 3+ Alibaba will clear about $259 billion in IaaS/PaaS revenue, up roughly 26% year over year. AWS remains the revenue leader at ~$126.6 billion, but its growth cadence — ~18% — is well below Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform, both running high-30s. Azure is the big story: ~$87.7 billion in 2025E IaaS/PaaS, with growth juiced by AI inference volumes and Microsoft’s shifts in what it counts as ‘Azure.’ GCP is a solid No. 3 at ~$28.3 billion, growing about as fast as Azure from a smaller base. Share shifts continue. AWS drops about 4 points of IaaS/PaaS share since 2024 to ~48.6%. Microsoft picks up ~4 points to ~35.3%, while Google holds steady around ~10%. Put differently: Azure + GCP are growing at a combined ~38% versus AWS at ~18% — that gap continues to attract negative attention to AWS. Underneath the revenue lines is an unprecedented CapEx cycle. The big three are on pace to pour roughly $240 billion a year into data centers, power and servers to feed AI demand. Yet 2025 AI services revenue is only on the order of ~$25 billion from these three, which means heavy front-loading — that is, lots of spend now for monetization that (hopefully) scales later. The bottom line is AWS still throws off the most dollars, but Microsoft’s definition-plus-AI strategy is gaining share fast, and Google is quietly compounding with evidence of improved profitability and a long runway. Let’s look at the nuances of interpreting the growth rates and the games vendors play with numbers. The Azure revenue trajectory has been quite remarkable as shown in the chart above. Entering COVID, we estimate that Microsoft Azure was generating roughly $4 billion per quarter. Today, our estimates indicate that Azure is running at more than $21 billion per quarter growing in the high 30% range. Note the revenue flattening in 2024 roughly coincides with the removal of the Enterprise Mobility, Security and Power BI per-user pricing revenue within Azure definitions. It replaced those low growth businesses with smaller but faster growing AI. As such you see the Azure curve steeply rises into 2025 as Azure AI services kick in. The timing was right and Microsoft disclosed that Azure has surpassed $75 billion. [See our detailed analysis of the Azure financial disclosures and the definitional changes] Microsoft’s FY 2025 ends in CY Q2 2025 and the $75 billion figure corresponds to the CY periods comprising Q3 2024 through Q2 2025. In our view, Microsoft cleverly timed its reclassification of Azure revenue and the $75 billion disclosure to underscore its substantial revenue base and its significantly higher growth rate relative to AWS. But this is the “growth optics” slide – the games people play. The bottom half of the above chart tries to put everyone on the same field. AWS did ~$30.9 billion IaaS/PaaS in the quarter, up 17.5%. Mapping to the $75 billion figure, we have Microsoft at ~$22.2 billion, +39%. If you normalize for the ChatGPT uplift and Microsoft’s definitional tweaks, our range for ‘core Azure’ is ~$18.5 billion to $19.0 billion growing in the mid-30s; or, by its previous definitions, 20%. At that size, AWS historically also grew in the mid-30s, so the meme that “AWS is lagging” is mostly rate-of-change noise. Google Cloud Platform is ~$7.2 billion, growing ~38% to 39%. Strong, but when AWS was at ~$7 billion, it was growing at ~45%, so this isn’t unprecedented hypergrowth. Net-net: The market is ripping, but a lot of Azure’s pop is AI inference optics. George Gilbert points out that Microsoft doesn’t want to highlight the fact that it has a ChatGPT tiger by the tail. Probably 50% of OpenAI’s revenue goes to COGs – that is, Azure fees. The point is, strip that out and the growth curves of AWS and Azure converge when normalizing for size of business over time. Nonetheless – AWS remains the dollar leader, Azure is gaining share with these AI/OpenAI tailwinds, and GCP is executing cleanly off a smaller base. Let’s look at some of the spending data from ETR on the big three cloud players. ETR’s Shared-Net Score data shows spending momentum still favoring Azure. Remember this is account-based not revenue-based. In Jul 2025, Azure posts a 60.2% Shared Net Score on 986 accounts, well ahead of AWS at 45.3% (N=784) and GCP at 36.2% (N=437) out of 1,777 total shared responses. The 40% dotted line indicates highly elevated spending velocity, so despite AWS’s lower score it’s still elevated. Over the last 18 months Azure has held a persistent 60%+ Net Score, consistent with AI-driven expansions and Microsoft’s bundle leverage. AWS softened in late 2023, then recovered into the mid-40s — steady but still capacity-limited. GCP’s momentum cooled through 2024 into mid-2025, now mid-30s, possibly reflecting bigger, longer deal cycles rather than broad-based expansions. The net is: In overlapping accounts, account-share momentum = Azure > AWS > GCP. Here’s a similar slide but it shows the penetration into the data set. Surprisingly, all three are showing deceleration in the pervasiveness metric. This doesn’t fly in the face of the rapid and accelerating cloud growth rates, however what it speaks to is spending is shifting to other categories, namely AI; and possibly some pause in AI experimentation on the cloud and some thought of moving toward on-premises – or balancing in that direction. Again, this data doesn’t represent spending levels, rather it represents account penetration. Microsoft is ubiquitous and speaks to why Azure’s penetration is so high. AWS continues to broaden its footprint with shared-account penetration GCP is still the third player and quite a distance from the leaders. Let’s close with a look at things to watch going forward. Here’s the bottom line heading into H2 and the 2026 window on the bull and bear cases: We’re tracking three swing factors that will decide the leaderboard — agent adoption, power and silicon. If pilots flip to production and enterprise agents get embedded across Microsoft M365, Google Workspace and custom apps, we may get a second-wave of cloud migration and real productivity gains. For AWS, which lacks a ubiquitous collaboration software platform it must rely primarily on its builders. Offerings around Q Developer are critical for developers to create software and apps on the AWS platform. But if customers don’t see broad-based return on investment and they suffer from proof-of-concept fatigue, things could slow. Of course, we’re always watching the macro spending picture as well, which right now is cautious outside AI. We’re also looking at the pace of CapEx buildouts and permitting – if regulations keep dragging and “short on power” becomes the norm, growth gets slowed by lack of kilowatts, not underlying demand. For silicon designers, like these three – if price/performance keeps improving not only with Nvidia Blackwell GPUs, but in-house silicon such as AWS’ Trainium and Google’s TPUs, and better inference economics, hyperscalers can keep pricing power and this will pull adjacent services. If GPUs remain constrained or customers are concerned about CUDA lock-in and high training costs, that could be a headwind and the bear case is migrations slow and customers may pull back a bit. Sovereign cloud is a monetization tailwind. Microsoft has the strongest hybrid story of the big three with its legacy on-premises Azure stack footprint and there’s evidence that its non-cloud business remains strong. Google is probably even more incentivized to partner for on-prem deployments, while AWS doubles down on VPC-native sovereignty and has Outposts in its back pocket. Policy is the wild card; a pro-innovation framework with licensing/data-use clarity supports spending, while broad antitrust/tariff shocks or an AI-ROI vacuum will cause buyers to tap the brakes. Our base case is that pilots begin converting, power eases gradually, custom silicon improves inference unit economics, and sovereignty continues to be in demand. But the big concern is enterprises continue to struggle with good data. Bad data will constrict AI payback and agentic adoption. That all said, CapEx continues to be the mainspring of AI enthusiasm and the Azure playbook is popping. AWS is not standing still and Google’s quiet execution is showing improved mix and margin, which is encouraging. Watch these signs: agent adoption, weekly active users and token volumes. In addition pay attention to CapEx versus AI revenue realization, the share of inference on non-GPU silicon, sovereign-cloud RFP velocity and any shift in liability rules. If the players hit on these, the cloud up-cycle runs right through 2026. This is our expectation. This is our base case. What’s yours? Please get in touch and let us know.

August 09, 2025 10:20 ET | Source: Pomerantz LLP Pomerantz LLP NEW YORK, Aug. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: IRBT) and certain officers. The class action, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and docketed under 25-cv-05563, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities other than Defendants that purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), seeking to recover damages caused by Defendants’ violations of the federal securities laws and to pursue remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, against the Company and certain of its top officials. If you are an investor who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities during the Class Period, you have until September 5, 2025, to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. To discuss this action, contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980 (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. [Click here for information about joining the class action] iRobot designs, builds, and sells robots and home innovation products in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Japan, and internationally. The Company’s portfolio of home robots and smart home devices features proprietary technologies for the connected home and advanced concepts in cleaning, mapping and navigation. iRobot is primarily known for its robot vacuum cleaner (“RVC”) products sold under the “Roomba” brand name. While iRobot’s Roomba was the first commercially successful RVC, iRobot’s business has steadily declined over the past decade, apart from a brief sales bump during the COVID-19 pandemic. Competitors from China undercut the luxury-priced Roomba, while other consumer electronics firms like Samsung and SharkNinja introduced their own RVCs. By 2016, iRobot’s market share had dropped to 64% in 2016, and then to only 46% by 2020. Investors believed that iRobot was saved when, in August 2022, iRobot entered into a merger agreement with Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon”) pursuant to which Amazon would acquire iRobot for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $1.7 billion (the “Amazon Acquisition”). In a joint press release announcing the Amazon Acquisition, iRobot’s then Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) Colin Angle was quoted as stating, in relevant part, “Amazon shares our passion for building thoughtful innovations that empower people to do more at home, and I cannot think of a better place for our team to continue our mission. I’m hugely excited to be a part of Amazon and to see what we can build together for customers in the years ahead.” However, in January 2024, Amazon and iRobot announced that they had mutually agreed to terminate the Amazon Acquisition, citing regulatory concerns. Specifically, the companies stated that there was “no path to regulatory approval in the European Union” and reports circulated that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission was in the process of drafting a lawsuit that would seek to stop the deal. Concurrent with this announcement, iRobot also reported that Colin Angle would step down from his role as CEO, and that the Company would be cutting approximately 350 employees, representing 31% of iRobot’s workforce. Notwithstanding the termination of the Amazon Acquisition and the subsequent job cuts, the Company has consistently maintained that it is “confident in [its] ability to build on [its] legacy of innovation as a standalone company and to navigate this period successfully.” Moreover, in the wake of the Amazon Acquisition’s termination, iRobot touted that it would be implementing an operational restructuring plan (the “Restructuring Plan”)—which the Company has sometimes referred to as “iRobot Elevate”—“designed to position the Company for stabilization in the current environment, while focusing on profitability and advancing key growth initiatives to extend its market share in the mid-tier and premium segments.” The Restructuring Plan, according to the Company, would “enable [it] to chart a new strategic path for sustainable value creation.” The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that “there can be no assurance that [iRobot’s] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies.” Accordingly, “[g]iven these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company’s financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements.” In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot’s announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating “due to [a] bleak outlook,” stating that “iRobot’s business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses,” “Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes,” “iRobot’s future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender,” and that the Company’s “survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely.” That same day, in an article entitled “Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today,” The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that “iRobot’s costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability.” On this news, iRobot’s stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. After the end of the Class Period, in May 2025, iRobot experienced a short squeeze—i.e., a rapid increase in the price of a stock owing primarily to an excess of short selling of a stock rather than underlying fundamentals—after it was announced that U.S. tariffs on European Union imports would be delayed until July 2025. However, notwithstanding the increase in the Company’s stock price, market analysts noted that iRobot’s underlying fundamentals remained highly concerning. For example, on May 29, 2025, Seeking Alpha stated that iRobot’s “[t]echnical indicators have turned bullish short-term, but the company’s cash burn and deteriorating financials outweigh these positives” and “Q1 [2025] results revealed falling revenue, worsening losses, shrinking cash reserves, and declining gross margins, signaling severe operational stress.” Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.

Title: This 8.5% Dividend Loves A Market Panic

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Volatility is back! And we contrarians know what to do: Get ready to buy. And we don’t have to try to time the depths of the next selloff, either, because the three 7%+ paying, “volatility-loving” dividends we’re going to talk about are perfect for this market. They’re all closed-end funds (CEFs) that see their cash streams grow when markets get skittish. Their secret? They sell covered-call options on their portfolios. This is a smart, low-risk way they can generate extra income—and send it our way as 7%+ dividends. That’s because these funds charge investors a “premium” for the “option” to buy their holdings at a fixed time and date in the future. They keep that cash no matter what happens with the trade itself. And their dividends (and our income) directly benefit. If you’ve been reading my column for a while, you’ll recognize these three covered-call CEFs: the 8.5%-paying Nuveen Dow 30 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (DIAX), the 7.6%-yielding Nuveen S&P 500 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (SPXX) and the 8.5%-paying Nuveen NASDAQ 100 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (QQQX). We highlighted all three in my July 24, 2025, Contrarian Outlook article, and our opportunity is still on the table here—with DIAX in particular. I also bring these funds up now because, despite the media’s howling, the current market is simply following an age-old course. It goes like this: As stocks rise, a major news story sparks worries that their gains can’t last. Stocks then sell off on rising investor fear, until the “smart money” comes in to buy the dip. Then the rest of the crowd takes notice and stocks begin to recover. Usually, this cycle happens over a short period—a few weeks, maybe a month or two. A good example is the sharp selloff, and speedy recovery, after President Trump announced large tariffs in April. However, a negative mood can hang on and prolong a selloff. That’s what happened in 2022, when worries of an economic crisis emerged after 2021’s huge run. But that turned out to be wrong, and the economy didn’t start contracting that year, or in 2023, or even in 2024. As a result, stocks recovered, but it took a long time as pundit after pundit wrongly insisted a recession was on its way. Okay, so why am I giving a history lesson here? Because we may very well be on the precipice of a new selloff, with volatility rising again. The trigger was that disappointing jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics last Friday, which included large downward revisions to the previous two months’ readings. It’s worth noting, however, that the economy is still adding jobs, and, if we look at the last five years of data, we’re still far from the calamities of the pandemic. In other words, we’re in the fearmongering stage of the cycle, with the media running story after story about the so-called “big drop” in the labor market. A quick look at the CNN Fear and Greed index, as of this writing, shows us that the extreme-greed mood of the last couple months has flipped to neutral, where it was in March and again at the end of April, after the huge crash earlier that month. However, it’s worth noting that stocks are up both from the end of April and from March. So, if sentiment is cooling, we may see stocks sell off in the short term, then recover strongly a bit later. That’s the scenario I find most likely at this time. One interesting thing about the current market is that, while volatility has jumped a little, it’s nowhere near the spikes associated with big, steep selloffs. This tells us that a near-term selloff isn’t guaranteed, and one will likely only emerge if the current level of the VIX—the market’s so-called “fear gauge”—rises. As you can see above, the VIX recently spiked from an unusually low level, meaning the market is waking up from weeks of complacency. Obviously, in such a market, you can’t just sell everything: If things stay flattish, you might be able to buy back in, but you’ll miss out on dividends. And if stocks see a short-term decline, who’s to say how low it will go and how long it will last? This doesn’t feel like a 2022-style drop, partly because Americans are less fearful than they were shortly after the pandemic. So a short-term market dip is the likeliest outcome, with a flat market a close second. In such a market, the best move is to monetize rising volatility. That’s where our (still-) available opportunity on those three covered-call CEFs comes in. We’re interested in these three because their call options essentially turn rising fear into cash. Plus there’s a big difference in their discounts to net asset value (NAV, or the value of their underlying portfolios) we can take advantage of. Note that DIAX (in blue above) trades at a near-11% discount to NAV as of this writing, even though its 8.5% yield matches that of QQQX, which has a much narrower 7.5% discount. And SPXX, with its smaller 7.6% yield, trades at just a 1.9% discount! This is odd, since CEF investors love high yields and tend to price up higher-yielding funds. And as of now, SPXX pays the least and has the smallest discount. That’s the one part of this that makes sense, and the reason is fairly straightforward: The S&P 500 is the best-known index, so many investors blindly pile into SPXX for that reason. But consider the fact that DIAX has a higher yield (8.5%, you’ll recall), a bigger discount (nearly 11%, as shown in the chart above) and holds solid blue chips like 3M (MMM), American Express (AXP), Boeing (BA), Coca-Cola (KO) and Procter & Gamble (PG). This means it’s likelier to see higher volatility in the short term (especially since its portfolio only includes 30 stocks—those in the Dow). But that’s a plus, as these option strategies do best in volatile markets. That should raise demand for DIAX, causing its near-11% discount to shrink. And that’s why, right now, DIAX is a compelling hedge for short-term volatility. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Qidi Plus 4

The Qidi Plus 4’s chamber heating and high-temperature direct drive system set this $799 printer apart from the rest of its midrange competitors. Positioned between Creality’s affordability and Bambu’s innovation, Qidi emphasizes material versatility, consistent print quality, and enclosure-driven performance. While some 3D printing enthusiasts are happy to stop with ASA or ABS filaments—popular units like the Bambu Lab A1 check most of the boxes for most people—others have projects that require higher-quality and more-durable materials like nylon and polycarbonate. For these and several other use cases, the Plus 4 represents an exceptional value and a solid upgrade from the more beginner-friendly A1. It wins an Editors' Choice award as the best filament-based 3D printer for hobbyists. Qidi entered the consumer 3D printing market in 2014, focusing on enclosed, user-friendly FDM printers at a time when most competitors—including Creality—were emphasizing open-frame, DIY-style machines. While Creality gained popularity with its budget-friendly, modifiable Ender series, Qidi built its reputation on plug-and-play reliability and sturdy enclosures, making early models like the Qidi Tech I and X-Pro popular in educational and office environments. As the industry shifted toward speed, automation, and high-temperature capabilities—especially following Bambu Lab’s 2022 launch of the X1 Carbon—Qidi responded with machines like the X-Plus, X-Max, and ultimately the Plus 4. For a while, I watched this evolution from afar, sticking with my finicky LulzBot TAZ 5 for the better part of a decade. (Oh, the fun of leveling a square bed that has only three leveling screws...but I digress.) The mechanical engineer in me knew it was time for a new printer, and not an entry-level unit like the Bambu Lab A1 Mini (as venerated and reliable as it is). I wanted something with more ability than that; a class above it. I decided to see if the Plus 4 could fit the bill, and I purchased the unit I'm reviewing here, rather than receiving a loaner from Qidi. The Plus 4 weighs 60 pounds, which is definitely not in the featherweight class. Its footprint is no slouch either, coming in at 19.8 by 19.2 by 21.7 inches (HWD) compared with the Prusa Core One's 21.8 by 16.3 by 17.5 inches. (The increased size is partly thanks to the steel-frame enclosure.) While I had no problem finding room for the machine—I've got a dedicated maker space in my house—users with limited space will find it bulky to move or fit. Qidi compensates for this by building grab handles into the top of the unit, but it can be daunting for a single person to move. I needed my son to help me get it up the stairs. With a 12-by-12-by-11-inch build area, the Plus 4 supports large prints and multi-part assemblies, ideal for prototyping, making cosplay props, or short-run manufacturing. Dimensionally, the Plus 4 slightly outpaces its closest rivals, the Bambu Lab P1 and X1 Carbon, whose build volumes are 10 cubic inches. The Plus 4 comes with an active chamber heater, which warms the interior to around 150 degrees F in about 8 minutes when it's running at 400 watts. (Early firmware versions let the chamber heater pull up to 800 watts, which exceeded the safety ratings of the included solid-state relay [SSR], creating a potential fire risk. While Qidi issued a firmware cap to 400 watts, many users still choose to replace the SSR or install thermal fuses out of caution.) The heater promotes stable conditions for high-temperature materials like ABS, polycarbonate, and nylon. By circulating heated air throughout the chamber as opposed to passively retaining heat from the extruder or bed in the chamber, parts are surrounded by a uniform temperature, helping to prevent warping and lifting off of the PEI build plate. (Confused by some of this terminology? Check out our guide to 3D printing to learn the basics.) The Plus 4 also comes standard with a high-temperature direct-drive extruder with a 0.4mm hardened steel nozzle, enabling the use of advanced filaments like polycarbonate, nylon, and carbon-fiber blends, as well as common lower-temperature PLA and TPU. The 80-watt nozzle has a 700-degree-F ceiling with a ceramic heat break to prevent heat creep. The maximum temperature limit means no burnt or malformed nozzle tips, even after printing with filament like polycarbonate. Qidi uses a 6mm-thick aluminum substrate for the heater bed, a sturdier build than the typical 3mm beds found on entry-level printers. This thickness promotes consistent, even heat across the entire surface. (Notably, the surface is capable of 250 degrees F, well above the requirements of most engineering-grade filaments.) The combination of the thick aluminum heater and effective chamber insulation helps heat soak and the filament maintain stable temperatures, which is crucial for consistent first layers. The first thing you’re going to notice when you get the unit is its weight and size. This is one of the most important moments with a new product—how it feels when you take it out of the box. As I touched on above, the unit has thick, sturdy grab handles that are recessed into the frame of the printer. When you pull the machine out and put it on the stand or a nearby table, you know right away it is a heavy, sturdy unit. It feels like it belongs in a factory. I thought, “Someone is thinking about the little things.” I connected the filament spool holder, which goes in the rear left corner of the machine. This location makes sense to me, as I could get to it easily and see from a distance how much filament was left on the roll at any given time. Where placed, the printer felt like a piece of modern furniture. It looks sleek and futuristic, and from a few feet away, you can’t tell that the side panels aren’t aluminum. (You have to touch them to know for sure.) The machine also gets impressively bright via the internal LED; the powerful light makes it easy for my older eyes to work with the unit. I live with a spouse, who is very concerned about the fumes printers can produce and always quizzes me on my remediation plans. As such, I was happy to see that the chamber fans for the Plus 4 come standard with an active carbon filter pouch. It was just another smart touch that signaled attention to the user experience, and built my confidence in the machine. I was also very impressed with the guidance of the heated bed assembly. The four 10mm precision-hardened steel rods and two synchronized drive motors told me that Qidi had put a lot of thought into holding the print plane square. At the back of the build chamber, a horizontal stabilizer bar connects the tops of the two vertical Z-axis lead screw assemblies. This acts as a rigid crossbeam between the vertical linear rods and screws that raise and lower the bed across the rear of the printer for additional stability. The printer walked me through the calibrations on the display, including a bed calibration after the input shaping. The colorful 5-inch touch-screen display has an 800-by-400-pixel resolution, but it is laggy and unresponsive for a machine of this caliber. It can take several seconds for the preview images of the files you're loading to fully appear. This is one of the biggest disconnects in the experience, where you feel like the Plus 4 is cutting costs and not fighting in its weight class. The build plate level variance of my unit was about 0.21mm, which is definitely acceptable out of the box. Using four screws under the bed, you can fine-tune the bed height at the corners, but after printing my first-layer test print (shown below), I decided to use what I had and not adjust anything before getting started. One frustrating aspect of the Plus 4 is that it requires you to re-run mesh bed leveling every time you flip or swap the magnetic build plate. Since the Z-offset and mesh compensation are tied to the plate's exact thickness and position, even a slight change can throw off your first layer. Forgetting to recalibrate often results in poor adhesion or failed prints—an extra step that interrupts an otherwise streamlined workflow. Qidi could help address this via a firmware update, by sending the build plate to the bottom limits of the stepper motor each time. I had one small tear line in the 0.2mm quality setting print using Prusa Galaxy PLA filament, though the rest of the first layer printed perfectly. The Plus 4 comes standard with things other companies charge extra for, don’t offer, or rely on their community to design for them. For one thing, the model has a stout wiper and nozzle-cleaning assembly that feels industrial and intentional. Listening to it load and clean the nozzle, I had no doubts that when it was probing for prints that the surface of the nozzle was clean. The Prusa Core One lacks this, instead requiring you to print your own or do the cleaning by hand. Customer support is also above average. Qidi has an official Wiki page, which felt very reassuring to me; no need to wonder where to go should a problem arise. I would later use the email support, and got an answer the same day from Qidi. That's an impressive response. When I loaded the unit with filament and turned it loose, I was immediately struck with the speed and the lack of vibration of the unit, compared with my 10-year-old LulzBot TAZ 5. Minutes later, I was staring at an Owl staring back at me. The machine also made fast work of the frog test file on the USB key that comes with the unit. Speaking of which, the Plus 4 allows you to connect and load your prints via USB key, Ethernet, or wirelessly through Wi-Fi, which is what I chose to use for all my testing. The Wi-Fi option was helpful for me, as I could monitor the status of my print from afar with a feed from the included camera, which will also record a time-lapse video of each print. I experienced no plate adhesion issues with the small toe footprint of baby Kermit...more reassurance. With the Plus 4, parts always come loose from the flexible metal plate easily with minimal flexing to coax the parts away. Next, I printed a set of PETG water cups to impress my wife, and noticed the distinct lack of VFAs, the virtual fine artifacts that are the bane of 3D printing hobbyists. The 0.35-inch-wide 1.5GT timing belts and high-impact fiberglass pulleys—paired with an effective VFA resonance compensation algorithm—kept a tight grip on that extruder at high speeds, with less room for the belt to slip on the pulleys as it moved. Other printers from Bambu, Creality, and Prusa use 2GT belts and have more noticeable VFAs. The end result: near-perfect surface finishes on the cup. I ran the next print using Prusa Galaxy Black PLA in high-speed mode to print a vase. No VFAs here, either. The lines were barely visible at the 0.2mm high-speed quality tier. It all looked so slick that my wife thought I had bought the vase from a local plant store until I told her it came out of the printer. As mentioned above, early batches of the Plus 4, including my unit, were shipped with an underpowered SSR board for the chamber heater that was prone to overheating. The board's choke coil was undersized, leading to burnt components, melted insulation, and in rare cases, fire hazards. Qidi acknowledged the issue and began shipping upgraded SSR boards with improved thermal capacity and thicker components, offering replacements to affected users. While the new board resolved the overheating problem for most, some users have opted to install higher-quality aftermarket SSRs—such as those from Omron or Fotek—for additional safety. The incident highlighted a serious early oversight in power handling, especially for a machine marketed with industrial-grade features. I opted to contact Qidi, which immediately shipped me the new, tested SSR board shown above. The company also offered very clear instructions on the Wiki page about how to remove the board and swap in the new one. I was very satisfied with how quickly I was able to reach out, make contact, and receive my replacement part. I wanted this fixed before I used what I had bought the machine for: the active heat fan (shown below). Would it be able to get the chamber heated quickly, and maintain a homogenous block of stable air surrounding the parts I wanted to print? My very first print was an ABS Benchy. It was at this moment that I understood the Plus 4 is an ABS-eating monster. What PLA was for other machines, ABS was for the Qidi. I showed it to a friend, who thought it was PLA at first and couldn’t believe the quality of it. Print time was close to 15 minutes for each of my three attempts, which is about normal for a machine in this price range. The Plus 4 is capable of speeds up to 600mm per second, though that maximum requires resonance tuning and other optimizations. To avoid print degradation, the printer is best used at 200-to-300mm per second. Next, I wanted to test detail and retraction at speed to see if the Plus 4 could keep up with the quality of machines like the Prusa Core One. I loaded a hexagonal organizer cube and, with the ABS still in the machine and with the chamber heater set to 55 degrees C (131 degrees F), I printed out the box for comparison. This was an undried spool of filament, with some visible stringing but impressive quality for detail at that level. There were no elephant feet or lifting from the PEI build plate. The bottom was flat and stacked perfectly with the other box. With the ABS still in the machine, I ran the next print at the 0.2mm-layer height, with the bed chamber set to the same temperature. This is the Kickstarter/Autodesk “torture test.” We’re looking for dimensional accuracy, and watching filament-flow control, fine features, bridging, and overhangs. All the towers printed (I broke one moving it from the machine to the photo table) with mild stringing that went away with a pass of the heat gun. All of the tolerance dowels immediately fell from the holes when I removed the part from the plate, from the 0.5mm down to the 0.1mm clearance tests. The surface finish was perfect and appeared to have come from a much more expensive machine. The Plus 4 showed its strength with the bridging test section, having no issues cooling the overhangs over larger and larger spans, with the cooling fan doing well beyond the minimum and passing this test with flying colors. The overhangs hung in there up to the 80-degree mark, where they printed with noticeable layer line pronouncements. Again, using ABS filament and getting acceptable overhangs in a heated chamber, with no cooling issues, surprised me. I then used the digital caliper to measure the calibration disc at the base of the block: 25.75mm on the 25.00 datum. It was 24.75mm all around the disc, with a near-perfect concentric circle that had no egg shape. This is a better result than the Creality K1 achieved with this challenging print when we tested it. The second-to-last calibration revealed the same repeatable concentricity, with squares measuring equally across the entire matrix of cubes. This geometrical panel test showed fine detail maintenance up until the smallest “Test” text outcroppings, where the “s” and “t” had difficulty printing. I compared these results with those of notable printers like the Prusa MK4 and found them to be in line with the accuracy and precision of these old-school legacy printers, which impressed me even more. (The MK4 has been replaced by the MK4S since we tested it.) Finally, I performed a popular tolerance test with a go/no-go gauge from Cults3D.com, this time in Prusa Galaxy Black PLA with 0.2mm layer lines and the glass lid removed. The circle fit into every hole, including the 0.00mm hole. The square gauge stopped at the 0.05mm gauge hole. Finished with my testing and benchmark prints, I set out to use the unit for some real-world projects with engineering-grade materials. With the Polymaker black ABS still in the machine, I made a hard case I downloaded from Printables.com for a portable ham radio measurement device. Taking advantage of the heated chamber, I wanted to see if the planar case surfaces would lift up from the build plate. To my surprise, everything printed perfectly, with the case easily mating and closing perfectly square. Next up, a print-in-place pair of ABS vice grips, also with Polymaker black ABS. I chose a 50% infill for strength with a 200mm-per-second max speed and 55-degree-C chamber temperature. The grips and sliding parts easily broke open, and after a firm twist on the adjustment slide, I could use it to clamp small parts on my desk.Encouraged, I moved on to ABS carbon fiber, downloading a 0.177 air rifle suppressor from Printables.com. I target practice in my backyard, and the supersonic rounds always "cracked" when I fired, like a gunshot. The threads printed perfectly, and I saw no artifacts on the sides of the barrel. After firing several dozen rounds through the suppressor, it had no noticeable breaks or degradations in the surface from the heat or pressure from firing. With the ABS carbon fiber still loaded, I set about making a larger set of prints to really spread out in the large build chamber. First, a wall-mounted holder for my Starlink power supply and router. I’ve been using the Starlink Gen 3 router, but I never liked the way it sat on my shelving, and wanted a more permanent place on my wall to mount the pair of components. The Plus 4 went through this print like butter. I’d seen this file printed by a Creality K1 with noticeable warping on the corners, and I was curious how it would lay on the Plus4 build plate. The holder did have some noticeable artifacts on the surface, which I noted were exactly where the infill lines were terminating. But when I showed the parts to my wife, she asked me if I had ordered them from Amazon or Starlink directly. She couldn’t believe that I had made them at home. I then turned the printing speed down to 60mm per second and started aiming higher on the difficulty chart. I loaded a spool of PolyMide PA6-CF. PA6 is significantly harder to print than its PA12 counterpart due to how PA6 absorbs much more water. (Up to 10% by weight if left exposed, compared with 2% for PA12.) If the Plus 4 was going to struggle with this grade of material, it would happen now. PA6 will also shrink and warp more than PA12, which is more dimensionally stable and easier to keep stuck to the build plate. It was the perfect challenge for this unit. I put on a layer of PA Magigoo to help prevent any layer-adhesion issues, set the bed temperature to 50 degrees C and the build chamber to 55 degrees with the cooling fan off, and set out to print a display holder for my Xbox controller, which had no real home on my desk. The designer-style base came out fantastic. It had no surface issues whatsoever—no warping at the edges or lifting, despite the wide first layers that, notoriously, shrink in open-air units like the Prusa MK4. Not wanting to stop, I looked around my office for other expensive homeless devices, and decided that I would make a mount for my Meta Quest 2 headset with the same settings as the Xbox holder at the 0.2mm layer line height. The chamber was still hot, like a warm oven accepting the second batch of cookies. My first layer was a little wonky. I could have slightly raised the gap of the Z-offset during the first layer, something I later learned how to do, and appreciated the ability to change. Once the second layer covered the fibers from the first layer, though, the issues evaporated from my mind. Weeks later, I had a real-world application unexpectedly arise. We have chickens in the backyard, and the night before leaving for a vacation, my wife informed me that it was going to drop well below freezing temperatures while we were gone. The watering system I had in place was my summer/fall system, and the water would freeze if I didn't modify it. I had the necessary components to fix it: a pump, a reservoir, and a heater that came on below 38 degrees F, but after a trip to Lowe's, I found that the ABS adapters I needed to connect the pump to the pipe where the bird-feeder nozzles would go were out of stock. I sat down with my copy of Fusion 360 to design the part that would attach the hose to the 2-inch PVC pipe that chickens would be drinking from, and loaded it into the Qidi Studio Slicer. I stopped the first print 20% in, to validate that the threads were accurate and would fit, which they easily did. The full-size final print, at 100% infill with ABS set for 0.2mm, worked brilliantly. By 11:30 p.m., I had the cold water system in place and could go on our trip with peace of mind I wouldn’t have had without the quick change enabled by the engineering-grade-material abilities of the Plus 4. I also tested the Plus 4's ability to print with pure polycarbonate, arguably one of the most difficult materials to print. I started simple with parts like the ham radio wire spool handle shown below. I used a 300-degree-C nozzle temperature, with a 100-degree heated bed and a 65-degree heated chamber for a perfect first-time print, with the Magigoo PA bed glue wiped on first. (I was sure to dry the roll completely first in my Sunlu filament dryer box.) I’ve also tested carbon-fiber nylon, with the exact same results. This time, I designed a dry-erase marker holder for my whiteboard, completely overdoing it with the filament choice, but wanting to see if the parts would warp, and what the surfaces would look like after the print completed. Once I had a database of the good settings for these different filaments, I started to lean on the Plus 4 for more everyday items and challenges. For example, I downloaded a replacement chicken feeder port that has saved me about 20 pounds of waste feed falling out of the container from the stock feed port: The new feeder port falls deeper into the crumbles, and the chickens were unable to scrape it out of boredom into the dirt around the feeder. That one print alone has saved me hundreds of dollars in feed, and the parts are in the sun all day, every day. Having access to these durable filaments lets me protect expensive gear as well. I made a set of rails for my portable ham radio that protect the nearly $1,200 radio and its sensitive knobs from bumps and bruises while in the field. The Plus 4 made easy work of the files, giving me way more peace of mind than ASA or even ABS would have given me with printers incapable of using these more durable materials. When that project finished, I of course had to print this ABS glass fiber holder for my Ryobi pressure washer wands and nozzles, just because I could.

Title: Qidi Plus 4

Full Content:
The Qidi Plus 4’s chamber heating and high-temperature direct drive system set this $799 printer apart from the rest of its midrange competitors. Positioned between Creality’s affordability and Bambu’s innovation, Qidi emphasizes material versatility, consistent print quality, and enclosure-driven performance. While some 3D printing enthusiasts are happy to stop with ASA or ABS filaments—popular units like the Bambu Lab A1 check most of the boxes for most people—others have projects that require higher-quality and more-durable materials like nylon and polycarbonate. For these and several other use cases, the Plus 4 represents an exceptional value and a solid upgrade from the more beginner-friendly A1. It wins an Editors' Choice award as the best filament-based 3D printer for hobbyists. Qidi entered the consumer 3D printing market in 2014, focusing on enclosed, user-friendly FDM printers at a time when most competitors—including Creality—were emphasizing open-frame, DIY-style machines. While Creality gained popularity with its budget-friendly, modifiable Ender series, Qidi built its reputation on plug-and-play reliability and sturdy enclosures, making early models like the Qidi Tech I and X-Pro popular in educational and office environments. As the industry shifted toward speed, automation, and high-temperature capabilities—especially following Bambu Lab’s 2022 launch of the X1 Carbon—Qidi responded with machines like the X-Plus, X-Max, and ultimately the Plus 4. For a while, I watched this evolution from afar, sticking with my finicky LulzBot TAZ 5 for the better part of a decade. (Oh, the fun of leveling a square bed that has only three leveling screws...but I digress.) The mechanical engineer in me knew it was time for a new printer, and not an entry-level unit like the Bambu Lab A1 Mini (as venerated and reliable as it is). I wanted something with more ability than that; a class above it. I decided to see if the Plus 4 could fit the bill, and I purchased the unit I'm reviewing here, rather than receiving a loaner from Qidi. The Plus 4 weighs 60 pounds, which is definitely not in the featherweight class. Its footprint is no slouch either, coming in at 19.8 by 19.2 by 21.7 inches (HWD) compared with the Prusa Core One's 21.8 by 16.3 by 17.5 inches. (The increased size is partly thanks to the steel-frame enclosure.) While I had no problem finding room for the machine—I've got a dedicated maker space in my house—users with limited space will find it bulky to move or fit. Qidi compensates for this by building grab handles into the top of the unit, but it can be daunting for a single person to move. I needed my son to help me get it up the stairs. With a 12-by-12-by-11-inch build area, the Plus 4 supports large prints and multi-part assemblies, ideal for prototyping, making cosplay props, or short-run manufacturing. Dimensionally, the Plus 4 slightly outpaces its closest rivals, the Bambu Lab P1 and X1 Carbon, whose build volumes are 10 cubic inches. The Plus 4 comes with an active chamber heater, which warms the interior to around 150 degrees F in about 8 minutes when it's running at 400 watts. (Early firmware versions let the chamber heater pull up to 800 watts, which exceeded the safety ratings of the included solid-state relay [SSR], creating a potential fire risk. While Qidi issued a firmware cap to 400 watts, many users still choose to replace the SSR or install thermal fuses out of caution.) The heater promotes stable conditions for high-temperature materials like ABS, polycarbonate, and nylon. By circulating heated air throughout the chamber as opposed to passively retaining heat from the extruder or bed in the chamber, parts are surrounded by a uniform temperature, helping to prevent warping and lifting off of the PEI build plate. (Confused by some of this terminology? Check out our guide to 3D printing to learn the basics.) The Plus 4 also comes standard with a high-temperature direct-drive extruder with a 0.4mm hardened steel nozzle, enabling the use of advanced filaments like polycarbonate, nylon, and carbon-fiber blends, as well as common lower-temperature PLA and TPU. The 80-watt nozzle has a 700-degree-F ceiling with a ceramic heat break to prevent heat creep. The maximum temperature limit means no burnt or malformed nozzle tips, even after printing with filament like polycarbonate. Qidi uses a 6mm-thick aluminum substrate for the heater bed, a sturdier build than the typical 3mm beds found on entry-level printers. This thickness promotes consistent, even heat across the entire surface. (Notably, the surface is capable of 250 degrees F, well above the requirements of most engineering-grade filaments.) The combination of the thick aluminum heater and effective chamber insulation helps heat soak and the filament maintain stable temperatures, which is crucial for consistent first layers. The first thing you’re going to notice when you get the unit is its weight and size. This is one of the most important moments with a new product—how it feels when you take it out of the box. As I touched on above, the unit has thick, sturdy grab handles that are recessed into the frame of the printer. When you pull the machine out and put it on the stand or a nearby table, you know right away it is a heavy, sturdy unit. It feels like it belongs in a factory. I thought, “Someone is thinking about the little things.” I connected the filament spool holder, which goes in the rear left corner of the machine. This location makes sense to me, as I could get to it easily and see from a distance how much filament was left on the roll at any given time. Where placed, the printer felt like a piece of modern furniture. It looks sleek and futuristic, and from a few feet away, you can’t tell that the side panels aren’t aluminum. (You have to touch them to know for sure.) The machine also gets impressively bright via the internal LED; the powerful light makes it easy for my older eyes to work with the unit. I live with a spouse, who is very concerned about the fumes printers can produce and always quizzes me on my remediation plans. As such, I was happy to see that the chamber fans for the Plus 4 come standard with an active carbon filter pouch. It was just another smart touch that signaled attention to the user experience, and built my confidence in the machine. I was also very impressed with the guidance of the heated bed assembly. The four 10mm precision-hardened steel rods and two synchronized drive motors told me that Qidi had put a lot of thought into holding the print plane square. At the back of the build chamber, a horizontal stabilizer bar connects the tops of the two vertical Z-axis lead screw assemblies. This acts as a rigid crossbeam between the vertical linear rods and screws that raise and lower the bed across the rear of the printer for additional stability. The printer walked me through the calibrations on the display, including a bed calibration after the input shaping. The colorful 5-inch touch-screen display has an 800-by-400-pixel resolution, but it is laggy and unresponsive for a machine of this caliber. It can take several seconds for the preview images of the files you're loading to fully appear. This is one of the biggest disconnects in the experience, where you feel like the Plus 4 is cutting costs and not fighting in its weight class. The build plate level variance of my unit was about 0.21mm, which is definitely acceptable out of the box. Using four screws under the bed, you can fine-tune the bed height at the corners, but after printing my first-layer test print (shown below), I decided to use what I had and not adjust anything before getting started. One frustrating aspect of the Plus 4 is that it requires you to re-run mesh bed leveling every time you flip or swap the magnetic build plate. Since the Z-offset and mesh compensation are tied to the plate's exact thickness and position, even a slight change can throw off your first layer. Forgetting to recalibrate often results in poor adhesion or failed prints—an extra step that interrupts an otherwise streamlined workflow. Qidi could help address this via a firmware update, by sending the build plate to the bottom limits of the stepper motor each time. I had one small tear line in the 0.2mm quality setting print using Prusa Galaxy PLA filament, though the rest of the first layer printed perfectly. The Plus 4 comes standard with things other companies charge extra for, don’t offer, or rely on their community to design for them. For one thing, the model has a stout wiper and nozzle-cleaning assembly that feels industrial and intentional. Listening to it load and clean the nozzle, I had no doubts that when it was probing for prints that the surface of the nozzle was clean. The Prusa Core One lacks this, instead requiring you to print your own or do the cleaning by hand. Customer support is also above average. Qidi has an official Wiki page, which felt very reassuring to me; no need to wonder where to go should a problem arise. I would later use the email support, and got an answer the same day from Qidi. That's an impressive response. When I loaded the unit with filament and turned it loose, I was immediately struck with the speed and the lack of vibration of the unit, compared with my 10-year-old LulzBot TAZ 5. Minutes later, I was staring at an Owl staring back at me. The machine also made fast work of the frog test file on the USB key that comes with the unit. Speaking of which, the Plus 4 allows you to connect and load your prints via USB key, Ethernet, or wirelessly through Wi-Fi, which is what I chose to use for all my testing. The Wi-Fi option was helpful for me, as I could monitor the status of my print from afar with a feed from the included camera, which will also record a time-lapse video of each print. I experienced no plate adhesion issues with the small toe footprint of baby Kermit...more reassurance. With the Plus 4, parts always come loose from the flexible metal plate easily with minimal flexing to coax the parts away. Next, I printed a set of PETG water cups to impress my wife, and noticed the distinct lack of VFAs, the virtual fine artifacts that are the bane of 3D printing hobbyists. The 0.35-inch-wide 1.5GT timing belts and high-impact fiberglass pulleys—paired with an effective VFA resonance compensation algorithm—kept a tight grip on that extruder at high speeds, with less room for the belt to slip on the pulleys as it moved. Other printers from Bambu, Creality, and Prusa use 2GT belts and have more noticeable VFAs. The end result: near-perfect surface finishes on the cup. I ran the next print using Prusa Galaxy Black PLA in high-speed mode to print a vase. No VFAs here, either. The lines were barely visible at the 0.2mm high-speed quality tier. It all looked so slick that my wife thought I had bought the vase from a local plant store until I told her it came out of the printer. As mentioned above, early batches of the Plus 4, including my unit, were shipped with an underpowered SSR board for the chamber heater that was prone to overheating. The board's choke coil was undersized, leading to burnt components, melted insulation, and in rare cases, fire hazards. Qidi acknowledged the issue and began shipping upgraded SSR boards with improved thermal capacity and thicker components, offering replacements to affected users. While the new board resolved the overheating problem for most, some users have opted to install higher-quality aftermarket SSRs—such as those from Omron or Fotek—for additional safety. The incident highlighted a serious early oversight in power handling, especially for a machine marketed with industrial-grade features. I opted to contact Qidi, which immediately shipped me the new, tested SSR board shown above. The company also offered very clear instructions on the Wiki page about how to remove the board and swap in the new one. I was very satisfied with how quickly I was able to reach out, make contact, and receive my replacement part. I wanted this fixed before I used what I had bought the machine for: the active heat fan (shown below). Would it be able to get the chamber heated quickly, and maintain a homogenous block of stable air surrounding the parts I wanted to print? My very first print was an ABS Benchy. It was at this moment that I understood the Plus 4 is an ABS-eating monster. What PLA was for other machines, ABS was for the Qidi. I showed it to a friend, who thought it was PLA at first and couldn’t believe the quality of it. Print time was close to 15 minutes for each of my three attempts, which is about normal for a machine in this price range. The Plus 4 is capable of speeds up to 600mm per second, though that maximum requires resonance tuning and other optimizations. To avoid print degradation, the printer is best used at 200-to-300mm per second. Next, I wanted to test detail and retraction at speed to see if the Plus 4 could keep up with the quality of machines like the Prusa Core One. I loaded a hexagonal organizer cube and, with the ABS still in the machine and with the chamber heater set to 55 degrees C (131 degrees F), I printed out the box for comparison. This was an undried spool of filament, with some visible stringing but impressive quality for detail at that level. There were no elephant feet or lifting from the PEI build plate. The bottom was flat and stacked perfectly with the other box. With the ABS still in the machine, I ran the next print at the 0.2mm-layer height, with the bed chamber set to the same temperature. This is the Kickstarter/Autodesk “torture test.” We’re looking for dimensional accuracy, and watching filament-flow control, fine features, bridging, and overhangs. All the towers printed (I broke one moving it from the machine to the photo table) with mild stringing that went away with a pass of the heat gun. All of the tolerance dowels immediately fell from the holes when I removed the part from the plate, from the 0.5mm down to the 0.1mm clearance tests. The surface finish was perfect and appeared to have come from a much more expensive machine. The Plus 4 showed its strength with the bridging test section, having no issues cooling the overhangs over larger and larger spans, with the cooling fan doing well beyond the minimum and passing this test with flying colors. The overhangs hung in there up to the 80-degree mark, where they printed with noticeable layer line pronouncements. Again, using ABS filament and getting acceptable overhangs in a heated chamber, with no cooling issues, surprised me. I then used the digital caliper to measure the calibration disc at the base of the block: 25.75mm on the 25.00 datum. It was 24.75mm all around the disc, with a near-perfect concentric circle that had no egg shape. This is a better result than the Creality K1 achieved with this challenging print when we tested it. The second-to-last calibration revealed the same repeatable concentricity, with squares measuring equally across the entire matrix of cubes. This geometrical panel test showed fine detail maintenance up until the smallest “Test” text outcroppings, where the “s” and “t” had difficulty printing. I compared these results with those of notable printers like the Prusa MK4 and found them to be in line with the accuracy and precision of these old-school legacy printers, which impressed me even more. (The MK4 has been replaced by the MK4S since we tested it.) Finally, I performed a popular tolerance test with a go/no-go gauge from Cults3D.com, this time in Prusa Galaxy Black PLA with 0.2mm layer lines and the glass lid removed. The circle fit into every hole, including the 0.00mm hole. The square gauge stopped at the 0.05mm gauge hole. Finished with my testing and benchmark prints, I set out to use the unit for some real-world projects with engineering-grade materials. With the Polymaker black ABS still in the machine, I made a hard case I downloaded from Printables.com for a portable ham radio measurement device.

Title: The Race to Launch Tokenized Stocks Is On. Here's What That Means for U.S. Investors

Tokens that are designed to be digital twins of stocks have subtle differences that make them less identical and more fraternal to the securities they're supposed to replicate. Tokenization was theoretical when BlackRock chief Larry Fink publicly discussed it in early 2024, but has landed in the real world via popular trading platforms including Robinhood (HOOD), Kraken and Coinbase Global (COIN). While they haven't cleared regulatory hurdles for U.S. investors' yet, rollouts of stock tokens in Europe started in June, ratcheting up the competition between trading venues that offer, or plan to offer, them to their customers. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, who unveiled the crypto exchange's tokenization ambitions in late July, quantified the business case for it: Just 3% in equities trading market share would double the current crypto market. "We've always said we're updating the system and building the bridge to bring equities on to crypto rails is the next phase of our strategy," he said. Anything can be made into tokens, from mortgage contracts representing real estate to shares in special purpose vehicles (SPVs) that reference the price of the underlying assets—whether they are publicly traded stocks or stakes in private companies, the latter of which made headlines when Robinhood unveiled OpenAI and SpaceX stock tokens. Robinhood chief Vlad Tenev, during the company's recent earnings call, said that the true opportunity in tokenization is in inaccessible assets like private market assets, according to a transcript provided by AlphaSense. He also said there was a "very positive" reception to stock tokens. "It's clear customers want this," he said. "They not only want it in Europe but they want it in the U.S. as well." OpenAI, the ChatGPT maker, has publicly said that it was not associated with the OpenAI stock tokens launched by Robinhood. The private-asset "stock tokens" weren't technically equity, but derivative contracts. Kraken, the U.S.'s oldest crypto exchange, has taken a different tack to tokenization. It partnered with a company called Backed to roll out xStocks. They trade on Solana and BNB Chain, but will likely show up on other blockchains as the so-called xStocks Alliance, a network of exchanges and decentralized finance protocols, grows. Kraken's consumer business chief Mark Greenberg, in an interview with Investopedia, said that the exchange's stock tokens aren't derivatives, but "actually backed by real stocks." As Greenberg explained it: Its partner Backed runs an SPV in New Jersey that holds stocks, and for each stock an investor buys, they mint a corresponding token, which they destroy when the underlying stock is sold, and the cash value given to the user. They are not technically equity but debt instruments that grant their holders the right to the cash value of the underlying shares, but not the shares themselves. Kraken hopes to eventually enable XStocks holders to redeem the underlying assets rather than their cash value, Greenberg said. Coinbase may come up with a whole different model, but the crypto exchange has not yet set a timeline. That said, U.S. securities regulators appear to be more receptive to them than they were in the past.

Title: Trump Just Dropped A $12.2 Trillion Crypto Price Bombshell—Sending Bitcoin, Ethereum And XRP Sharply Higher

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin has seen its price rocket higher this year, topping an explosive 2024 that saw Wall Street charge into crypto—though some are predicting the bitcoin price bull run could be just getting started. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has doubled since this time last year, with the crypto market looking “eerily similar” to the situation last summer that catapulted bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies including ethereum and XRP higher. Now, as JPMorgan suddenly flips on what could be a bitcoin price game-changer, U.S. president Donald Trump has signed an executive order that will make it easier for bitcoin, crypto and other alternative assets like private equity and real estate to be included in 401(k) retirement accounts—which hold a combined $12.2 trillion. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run "Alternative assets, such as private equity, real estate, and digital assets, offer competitive returns and diversification benefits," a White House fact sheet read. Trump signing the long-rumored order has boosted the bitcoin price, pushing it toward $120,000 per bitcoin for the first time since last month, while ethereum has surged 21% this week, breaking back above $4,000 per ether for the first time since December last year. XRP, one of the best performing major cryptocurrencies over the last year with a near 500% gain, has climbed 12% this week, helping the combined crypto market top $4 trillion. “This could mark a major milestone in bringing digital assets into the mainstream financial infrastructure, opening the door to long-term adoption by everyday Americans,” Antony Agoshkov, cofounder of Marvel Capital, said in emailed comments. The order gives the Department of Labor 180 days to review rules with any changes not expected to be seen immediately in bitcoin and crypto markets. “The Trump executive order opening the door to the inclusion of crypto and private assets in 401(k) retirement plans opens the way to greater choice and gives investors more options," Katalin Tischhauser, head of research at Sygnum Bank, said via email. “It is another bullish driver for the crypto market as the relatively small market capitalisation means fund flows can have a significant impact on price." In May, the Department of Labor scrapped guidance from 2022 that urged "extreme care" before any investment companies added crypto to retirement account options. “The announcement has fueled optimism around future institutional inflows, especially given the size of the U.S. defined contribution market, which totals around $10 trillion," Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Group, said in emailed comments. "A more favorable regulatory tone is taking shape in Washington. The Trump executive order follows a series of signals from lawmakers aimed at establishing clearer guardrails around digital asset classification and access.” While there is currently no prohibition on retirement plan operators adding these types of investments, the order is expected to result in a more diverse range of options for people. “This order isn’t about the government saying 'crypto belongs in 401(k)s.’ It’s about the government getting out of the way and letting people make their own decisions,” Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise, said in an emailed note. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free newsletter for the crypto-curious The latest bullish signal out of the Trump White House—following Trump dismantling Biden-era crypto restrictions on Wall Street, Trump ordering the creation of a bitcoin strategic reserve and crypto stockpile that’s expected to include ethereum and XRP among others, and the passage of the Genius Act stablecoin bill—are helping to “shift sentiment” among traders, but have yet to translate into meaningful price moves. “Trump’s latest moves—from expanding 401(k) access to crypto, to pushing gold into the spotlight—could shift sentiment, but so far the response has been muted,” 10x Research founder Markus Thielen said in an emailed note. “Ethereum, meanwhile, is flashing record address activity and surging prices, yet much of the move appears narrative-driven rather than grounded in fundamentals. Both assets are now pressing against key technical boundaries where momentum could either accelerate or stall sharply." Bitcoin and crypto market watchers remain bullish for the rest of 2025, however, some are warning the bitcoin price and crypto market could crash next year. “My view is that once we complete the bull cycle at circa $140,000-$145,000, we will see a corrective bear market in 2026, but I am not looking for a deep correct, but likely a move to $90,000 to $100,000,” John Glover, chief investment officer of Ledn, said in emailed comments, adding: “I know this goes against the popular view that we are going to hit the extreme prognosticator’s views of $250,000, $500,000, or even $1 million in 2025 or 2026." Meanwhile, Trump also signed a separate executive order targeting the “debanking” of people and businesses on political grounds, which will “ensure that Federal regulators do not promote policies and practices that allow financial institutions to deny or restrict services based on political beliefs, religious beliefs or lawful business activities, ensuring fair access to banking for all Americans.” The "digital assets industry has also been the target of unfair debanking initiatives," according to a White House fact sheet, with Caitlin Long, the chief executive of crypto-focused Custodia Bank, cheering the addition of the Small Business Administration as an overseer of the federal banking regulators.

Title: Ethereum price forecast: ETH rockets past $4K, this ETH token is being dubbed future of payments

For those familiar with the crypto-space, it’s clear that Ethereum (ETH) holds the record as the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. Better still, it made headlines late 2021 when it reached the ATH of $4,000, making a FOMO to set in as no one, including institutional and retail markets, wanted to be left out. Today, the ETH trades around the $4,000 mark, and many big bag holders are watching keenly as they anticipate the next move regarding Ethereum price projections. They are asking: Where is the next target for ETH? Would such moves affect other Ethereum-based tokens positively or even outperform ETH in the months to come? For instance, one token is attracting increasing attention: Remittix (RTX), an ERC-20 asset designed to address the issue of global money transfers. As Ethereum strengthens its base with spot ETF inflows, gas fee optimizations, and renewed DeFi/NFT activity, some traders believe RTX could emerge as the real breakout payment token in the Ethereum ecosystem. It’s a lot of information, but we will flesh it out together shortly. Several major tailwinds have fueled Ethereum’s climb above $4,000: What’s more, different Ethereum price projections are showing that ETH could hit a new ATH if it manages to break through the old ATH and move towards $5,500–$6,000 by Q1 2026, especially should the macro fundamentals agree. However, while ETH remains a huge part of crypto whales’ portfolios, they are also exploring and positioning themselves in other Ethereum-based tokens that could feel the impact of the big ETH bullish move that’s to come. One notable one is Remittix. Remittix (RTX) is an Ethereum-based token explicitly developed for one use case: cross-border money transfers. The platform bridges crypto and fiat through a remittance model that avoids the costly intermediaries that dominate traditional remittance routes. Here’s why traders are calling it “the future of payments” within the Ethereum ecosystem: Ethereum’s current rally is likely just the beginning. The infrastructure upgrades, ETF exposure, and global DeFi revival position ETH as a long-term winner. But for those aiming to maximize upside potential, assets like Remittix represent a unique opportunity. As the Ethereum price climbs, keep an eye on the tokens it carries with it, and don’t be surprised if RTX becomes one of the most talked-about names before the next altcoin season is over.

Title: Three Revolutions by Simon Hall: Lenin, Mao and Fidel’s biggest overseas fans came from an unexpected source

Irish people can be as susceptible as anyone to the charms of a communist dictator. Michael Collins and Éamon de Valera approved a $20,000 loan from Sinn Féin to Vladimir Lenin’s Bolsheviks. Young Bob Geldof distributed 100 copies of Mao Zedong’s Little Red Book around Blackrock College, while President Michael D Higgins paid a warm tribute to Fidel Castro when the “giant among global leaders” died in 2016. As Simon Hall shows in his lively, insightful but disjointed study of how revolutions shaped the 20st century, however, Lenin, Mao and Fidel’s biggest overseas fans came from a more unexpected source. Three American journalists played key roles in presenting these tyrants to the West as principled, charismatic and a force for good. Hall frames his episodic narrative around six gruelling journeys that led to either a coup or a scoop. In 1917 Lenin and around 30 other Russian dissidents took a train from Zurich across war-torn Germany to Petrograd’s Finland Station, where his fiery rhetoric inspired the world’s first Soviet republic. That was a cakewalk compared with Mao’s Long March, the 6,000-mile retreat from Chinese nationalist forces in 1934-5 that cost more than 80,000 lives but still established him as the Communist Party’s toughest leader. Castro ended his exile in 1956 by sailing from Mexico to Cuba on what Hall calls “a creaking, leaking leisure yacht”, escaping into the Sierra Maestra mountains and plotting a guerrilla war. The newspaper men profiled here are less familiar, but formidable characters in their own right. John Reed was a bohemian poet who watched Saint Petersburg’s Winter Palace being stormed and penned the Lenin-approved bestseller Ten Days that Shook the World. The goofy, part-Irish Edgar Snow spent three months living among Red Army troops and obediently wrote up Mao’s autobiography. Donnish veteran Herbert Matthews hiked through a dangerous wilderness to secure his star-struck interview with Castro, which caused a sensation when it appeared on the New York Times’s front page. Three Revolutions works best on a storytelling level, full of colourful human details such as Lenin drawing up rules for who could use his carriage toilet. While Hall is clear-eyed about his despotic subjects, however, he goes a little too easy on the newshounds. Journalism may be the first draft of history, but sadly the copy these naive idealists delivered has turned out to need a radical rewrite.

Title: Harvard Reveals $117M BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Stake In SEC Filing – Details

Bitcoin continues to solidify its status as a strategic reserve asset, with growing institutional adoption fueling its long-term bullish narrative. The latest major endorsement comes from one of the world’s most prestigious universities — Harvard. In a recent SEC filing, it was revealed that Harvard University’s investment portfolio acquired $117 million worth of shares in BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF by the end of the second quarter of 2025. This move places Harvard among a growing list of influential institutions integrating Bitcoin into their long-term treasury strategies. The BlackRock spot Bitcoin ETF, now managing $84 billion in assets under management, has quickly become a dominant vehicle for institutional exposure to BTC. Harvard’s decision highlights a broader shift in capital allocation strategies, where Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed as a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty and a high-conviction growth asset. Institutional participation at this scale not only boosts market credibility but also reinforces Bitcoin’s position as a core asset in diversified portfolios. According to Harvard University’s recent Form 13F filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), its $117 million position in BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF ranks as the institution’s fifth-largest investment. This allocation places Bitcoin just ahead of the university’s holdings in major technology giants such as Alphabet, Google’s parent company, and NVIDIA. At the end of the reporting period, Harvard held nearly $114 million worth of Alphabet stock, underscoring the significance of its Bitcoin exposure within its broader portfolio. The decision to prioritize Bitcoin over some of the most established names in global technology signals a notable shift in institutional thinking. For decades, elite endowments like Harvard’s have been known for their conservative, long-term investment approach, focusing on assets with proven resilience and growth potential. Including Bitcoin at this level shows that the university views the digital asset as not only a speculative opportunity but also as a strategic reserve holding with long-term value. Harvard’s move reflects a growing consensus among leading institutions that BTC is emerging as a core asset for diversification, inflation protection, and asymmetric upside potential. The fact that Bitcoin now sits alongside — and in some cases above — blue-chip equities in major portfolios highlights its evolution from a niche investment to a mainstream financial instrument. Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $116,526, consolidating just below the key resistance zone at $122,077. The 3-day chart shows a sustained bullish structure, with price holding well above the 50-day ($101,725) and 100-day ($96,494) moving averages — both trending upward, signaling strong medium-term momentum. After reclaiming the $115,724 support level, BTC has maintained a steady upward bias, suggesting that bulls are still in control despite recent volatility. The consolidation phase just under resistance indicates market indecision, with buyers accumulating strength for a potential breakout. A decisive close above $122,077 could open the path toward retesting the all-time highs and potentially extending into price discovery. Volume remains relatively stable, but a noticeable uptick on breakout attempts would strengthen the bullish case. On the downside, failure to hold $115,724 could trigger a pullback toward the $110K–$112K range, where additional support and the 50-day moving average converge.

Title: BlackRock rules out XRP and SOL ETFs despite Ripple-SEC case closure

Share this article With Ripple closing its long-running legal battle with the SEC, industry analysts anticipate that the resolution will make major fund managers more comfortable offering investment products tied to XRP, Ripple’s native crypto asset. Pro-XRP users, in particular, have been eyeing BlackRock, the asset management giant. But it appears BlackRock has no immediate plans to get on board. A BlackRock spokesperson recently told The Block that spot XRP and Solana (SOL) ETFs are not on the firm’s roadmap for now. The confirmation came shortly after ETF Store President Nate Geraci suggested that BlackRock would eventually enter the XRP ETF market as Ripple and the SEC wrap up their appeals. He said it’s hard to justify ignoring crypto assets apart from Bitcoin and Ethereum, but if BlackRock really stays away from other crypto ETFs, they’re essentially stating that only BTC and ETH are worth investing in. Yes, I think BlackRock was waiting to see this before filing for iShares XRP ETF… I’ll own it if I’m wrong. IMO, makes *zero* sense for them to ignore crypto assets beyond btc & eth. Otherwise, they’re basically saying btc & eth are only ones that will ever have value. Bold. pic.twitter.com/FtBqMRFpOl — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) August 8, 2025 However, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas thinks BlackRock is content with its two existing ETFs, those tied to the two largest crypto assets, and sees diminishing returns in expanding further. I just think they are happy w the two. Law of diminish returns from here on out. But again I’ve nothing to go on but my own spidey sense here. — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) August 8, 2025 The analyst is also doubtful that BlackRock will file for an index-based crypto ETF, which potentially includes major assets like XRP, later this year. Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock’s Head of Digital Assets, revealed at the Bitcoin 2024 convention that there was ‘very little’ client demand for crypto ETFs beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Samara Cohen, BlackRock’s Chief Investment Officer of ETF and Index Investments, said in an interview with Bloomberg that the firm would not launch a Solana ETF in the near term. “We really look at the investor’s ability to see what meets the criteria, what meets the bar to be delivered in an ETF,” Cohen said. “For us right now, both between [investing] ability considerations and also what we hear from our clients… Bitcoin and Ether definitely meet that bar. I think it will be a while before we see anything else.” Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account? Create one Create your account Already have an account?

Title: A beginner’s guide to orange wine – is it the new rosé?

Orange wine has been fashionable in wine bars for years and now seems to be taking off elsewhere too. If you are still wondering what it is, think “white wine made like red wine”, as one producer explained it to me. White grapes are crushed and left in contact with the skins, and sometimes pips and stalks too, for a period ranging from hours to days to months. Sometimes called skin contact or amber wine, it was the traditional way to make white wine in many areas before modern technology arrived. It has been made in Georgia and neighbouring Armenia for thousands of years and still is today. More recently it has been revived by winemakers in Slovenia, Friuli and now elsewhere too. In Georgia orange wine is usually macerated, fermented and/or aged in clay amphorae or qvevri, although producers in other countries sometimes use stainless steel or wood. It runs from pale gold to deep brown in colour. Some are a little cloudy, too. Producers are now playing with different hues to create light, fruity summer wines, sometimes called sunset wines because of their pinkish, reddish orange colour. The term can also include rosé and light pale red wines that are served cool. As the juice has been in contact with the skins, orange wines can be lightly tannic, which makes them good with food. They should be served cool or at room temperature rather than chilled as this will highlight the drying tannins in the wine. Provided your fellow wine drinkers like orange wine, it is a great all-purpose party wine that will happily match with all kinds of food, from spicy Indian to grilled red and white meat to salads, pickles and dips. They make nice aperitifs, too: a little bit fruity with a touch of astringency. Fresh and floral with citrus peel, white fruits and a dry, lightly grippy finish. A great introduction to orange wine.

Title: Cars, coffee and clothing are poised to get pricier with new tariffs

Americans are paying more for appliances, home furnishings, toys and shoes than they were a few months ago, and they could soon face higher prices on more goods as the Trump administration’s latest round of sharper tariffs kicks in. The newest round of duties took effect at midnight Thursday, lifting the average U.S. tariff rate to its highest level since the Great Depression. The move solidifies the president’s trade policy after months of negotiations, meaning more manufacturers and retailers are expected to begin raising prices in short order. “Tariffs have moved from being tentative to permanent — and that changes how American businesses are going to respond,” said Justin Wolfers, a professor of public policy and economics at the University of Michigan. “You’re going to start seeing higher prices as soon as businesses become convinced this will stick around, and that clock starts today.” The higher tariffs, which businesses — not countries — pay to the federal government to import goods, are as high as 50% for Brazil and India, but just 15% for the European Union and Japan. For consumers, that escalation is expected to result in higher prices, costing households an average of $2,400 per year, according to estimates from the Budget Lab at Yale University. Americans are likely to face large markups on clothing in the coming months, including a 39% increase in prices for leather shoes and bags, and a 37% rise in clothing costs, the research center found. Even after long-run supply chain adjustments and buying shifts, those prices could remain elevated by nearly 20%. Food prices, meanwhile, could rise more than 3%, while fresh produce could become 7% more expensive as a result of the Trump administration’s tariffs, the Budget Lab found. The center also expects cars — which often rely on components from several different countries — to get 12% more expensive, adding $6,000 to the price of an average new vehicle. Although businesses have so far absorbed the brunt of new tariffs, by covering higher costs themselves or relying on earlier stockpiles of inventory to keep them going, that is quickly changing. Major retailers, including Costco, Williams-Sonoma and Target, that loaded up on products earlier in the year are beginning to deplete those reserves, analysts say. “Consumers are going to pay, starting with their morning coffee,” said Robert Blecker, an economics professor at American University, referring to the 50% tariff on coffee from Brazil. “Although it does seem a lot of firms have been eating some of the tariffs by shaving their profit margins and holding the line on prices, that can’t go on forever.” Walmart, the country’s largest retailer, has begun marking up baby gear, kitchenware and toys. Nike is raising prices on some of its shoes, and many others are beginning to warn consumers that price increases are around the corner. Procter &amp; Gamble, the maker of Tide laundry detergent, Pampers diapers and Oral-B toothbrushes, said it would start raising prices in August on some products by about 2.5% to help offset $1 billion in tariff costs this year. Sharon Azula, who owns a company that sells plush toys and books, had enough inventory to fill orders through much of this year. But now she is preparing to stock up for the holidays, which means she will have to pay an extra 30% on merchandise from China, translating to markups for customers. Adding to the uncertainty: Ongoing trade talks between the U.S. and China. “We know we’re going to have to raise our prices at some point,” said Azula, who founded the Tooth Brigade with her husband in 2019. “If our $16 plush suddenly costs more than $20, are consumers still going to buy it? We can’t pay for the increase ourselves, but we also don’t know if we can keep moving forward with our business.” The toy industry, which imports more than 75% of its products from China, has been among the first to pass on higher costs from the president’s trade war. Toy prices rose by 3.2% between April and June, far outpacing overall inflation of 0.4% in that period, federal data shows. The president says higher tariffs are needed to combat other countries’ unfair trade practices, which have hollowed out American manufacturing and cost millions of factory workers their jobs. By erecting new barriers to foreign products, Trump aims to promote domestic manufacturing while ushering in what he calls a new “Golden Age.” Yet, for products like toys, moving manufacturing out of China is not realistic, said Greg Ahearn, president and chief executive of the Toy Association, a trade group. Not only is labor cheaper in China, but for decades, the country also has built up an infrastructure of “manufacturing expertise and the ethical manufacturing process at the factories,” he said. Everything from final packaging to materials such as springs, motors and plastic parts “can’t be replicated here in the U.S.” An analysis of recent prices from the country’s four largest retailers shows that goods from China have gotten roughly 4% costlier since the Trump administration’s first tariffs took hold this year, according to Alberto Cavallo, a professor at Harvard Business School and co-director of its Pricing Lab. He expects those costs to be up about 10 percent by the end of the year. Americans now face an overall average effective tariff rate of 18.6%, the highest since 1933, according to calculations from the Budget Lab. “We had 2 to 3% average tariffs at the beginning of this year,” said Şebnem Kalemli-Özcan, an economics professor at Brown University. “It is foolish to think there isn’t going to be any economic impact, or that this is going to be all pink and rosy for the American people.” Economists are just beginning to understand how new trade policies are affecting prices, consumer demand and business decisions across the country. The latest data points to slowing economic growth in the first half of the year, as well as pullbacks in business spending, hiring and investment. Households, too, are holding tight as they wait to see how things unfold. Still, inflationary effects have so far been limited to specific categories and have yet to translate to higher across-the-board prices for many families. Some of the administration’s most dramatic proposals, including tariffs of 100% on chips and semiconductors, and up to 145% on Chinese imports, are still in the air. Carmakers have so far shouldered much of import costs themselves instead of passing them onto consumers. General Motors last month said tariffs had cost the company more than $1 billion in the latest quarter, cutting into its profit margins and prompting the company to move some operations to the United States. The cost of a new vehicle in June rose 1.2% year-over-year to $48,907, below the average 10-year increase of 3.9 percent, according to Kelley Blue Book. But the new round of tariffs is expected to make cars pricier, especially those assembled in Mexico and Japan. Consumers will pay an extra 9%, or $3,010, for cars assembled in Japan, including for some Toyota models, such as the Prius and the 4Runner, according to Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive. Cars assembled in Mexico will see the highest price hikes — about 10 percent, or $3,550 — according to Cox. Those include the Honda Fit, the Chevrolet Equinox and the Ford Maverick. In upstate New York, gear manufacturer Gear Motions began raising prices to offset tariffs earlier this year. Although imports make up just 5% of the company’s business, trade uncertainty has complicated just about every part of the firm’s operations, President Dean Burrows said. The company’s gears are used in air compressors, superchargers and car transmissions. Anxious customers are buying less. And it has gotten harder to sell his U.S.-made products overseas; international inquiries have dried up by about 50%, he said, as buyers in other countries look for ways to bypass American manufacturers. “We’re a 140-year-old company and have survived many ups and downs, but the uncertainty right now is what’s unprecedented,” he said. “We have precision gears on the ocean, coming from Italy and I still don’t know whether I’ll have to pay a 15% tariff, or 27.5%. But either way, we have no choice: We’ll pay it, and we’ll pass it on.”

By John Gruber WorkOS simplifies MCP authorization with a single API built on five OAuth standards. A list of various related news items and clips from this, and recent, weeks: Apple Newsroom, on Wednesday — “Apple Increases U.S. Commitment To $600 Billion, Announces American Manufacturing Program”: Apple today announced a new $100 billion commitment to America, a significant acceleration of its U.S. investment that now totals $600 billion over the next four years. Today’s announcement includes the ambitious new American Manufacturing Program (AMP), dedicated to bringing even more of Apple’s supply chain and advanced manufacturing to the U.S. Through AMP, Apple will increase its investment across America and incentivize global companies to manufacture even more critical components in the United States. Separately, also from Apple Newsroom Wednesday — “Apple and Corning Partner to Manufacture 100 Percent of iPhone and Apple Watch Cover Glass in Kentucky”: Apple and Corning today announced a major expansion of their long-standing partnership to make precision glass for Apple products. Apple is making a new $2.5 billion commitment to produce all of the cover glass for iPhone and Apple Watch in Corning’s Harrodsburg, Kentucky, manufacturing facility. This means that 100 percent of the cover glass on iPhone and Apple Watch units sold worldwide will be made in the U.S. for the first time. Corning is creating the world’s largest and most advanced smartphone glass production line at the Harrodsburg facility. Corning will now dedicate this entire facility to manufacturing for Apple, which will help increase Corning’s manufacturing and engineering workforce in Kentucky by 50 percent. From inside the Oval Office on Wednesday afternoon, a 3.5-minute video of Trump’s introductory remarks, then Tim Cook giving Trump a trophy of sorts, with an Apple-logo top made from glass produced at the Corning facility in Kentucky, and a base made from 24-karat gold (perhaps left over from Apple’s decade ago foray into $20,000 “Edition” Apple Watches?). This video is one of the most pathetic things I’ve ever witnessed, for everyone involved. (Note Cook’s awkward laughter when Trump, after claiming that “about $17 trillion is coming into the United States” thanks to the brilliance of his economic statecraft, quips “That’s even a lot of money for you”, looking at Cook.) From the same press event in the Oval Office, a 5-minute video of Cook’s benign but obsequious prepared remarks. Apple’s stock, as I type this after the close of markets on Friday, is up 11.6 percent for the week, and jumped over 5 percent immediately after Wednesday’s announcements. Tripp Mickle, reporting for The New York Times back on May 26, under the headline “Tech’s Trump Whisperer, Tim Cook, Goes Quiet as His Influence Fades”: In the run-up to President Trump’s recent trip to the Middle East, the White House encouraged chief executives and representatives of many U.S. companies to join him. Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, declined, said two people familiar with the decision. The choice appeared to irritate Mr. Trump. As he hopscotched from Saudi Arabia to the United Arab Emirates, Mr. Trump took a number of shots at Mr. Cook. During his speech in Riyadh, Mr. Trump paused to praise Jensen Huang, the chief executive of Nvidia, for traveling to the Middle East along with the White House delegation. Then he knocked Mr. Cook. “I mean, Tim Cook isn’t here but you are,” Mr. Trump said to Mr. Huang at an event attended by chief executives like Larry Fink of the asset manager BlackRock, Sam Altman of OpenAI, Jane Fraser of Citigroup and Lisa Su of the semiconductor company AMD. Later in Qatar, Mr. Trump said he “had a little problem with Tim Cook.” The president praised Apple’s investment in the United States, then said he had told Mr. Cook, “But now I hear you’re building all over India. I don’t want you building in India.” On Friday morning, Mr. Trump caught much of his own administration and Apple’s leadership off guard with a social media post threatening tariffs of 25 percent on iPhones made anywhere except the United States. The post thrust Apple back into the administration’s cross hairs a little over a month after Mr. Cook had lobbied and won an exemption from a 145 percent tariff on iPhones assembled in China and sold in the United States. April 2018: Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met with Tim Cook in Cupertino, including a tour of Apple Park. From a Kif Leswing report for Business Insider regarding the tour: The young prince, often referred to as MBS, was on a charm offensive, according to The New York Times. His goal was to change the Western perspective of Saudi Arabia as a conservative country dependent on oil money where women are treated as second-class people. Instead, Prince Mohammed wants Americans to see Saudi Arabia as a modern country with extensive investments in growth markets like technology. October 2018: Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident and public critic of the Saudi regime, was brutally assassinated — literally chopped to pieces — inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Within weeks, the CIA concluded that Mohammed bin Salman had ordered the assassination. Tim Cook has not met with MBS since. President Trump, at the US-Saudi Investment Forum in May — one stop among several on the Middle East tour, which, per point #6 above, Tim Cook declined to attend — was effusive in his praise and admiration for bin Salman. Per ABC News: President Donald Trump spent the bulk of what was billed as a “major foreign policy address” to outline his vision for the Middle East instead touting his domestic policies and heaping praise on Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman while speaking at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum on Tuesday. Four years after the U.S. intelligence community report was released that concluded that the crown prince approved the assassination of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Trump lauded the crown prince for his leadership and friendship. “He’s your greatest representative, greatest representative. And if I didn’t like him, I’d get out of here so fast. You know that, don’t you? He knows me well. I do — I like him a lot. I like him too much. That’s why we give so much, you know? Too much. I like you too much,” Trump said while speaking in Saudi Arabia. Trump, this week, at the White House event with Tim Cook, per CNBC: “We’re going to be putting a very large tariff on chips and semiconductors,” Trump said in the Oval Office on Wednesday afternoon. “But the good news for companies like Apple is if you’re building in the United States or have committed to build, without question, committed to build in the United States, there will be no charge. So in other words, we’ll be putting a tariff on of approximately 100% on chips and semiconductors. But if you’re building in the United States of America, there’s no charge.” [...] But specifics about the plan, such as how much U.S. manufacturing a company needs to do in order to qualify for the tariff exemption, were not immediately clear. There is, of course, no need to wait for “specifics about the plan”, which almost certainly won’t ever be put in writing. We all know how to qualify for an exemption — it’s up to the whims of Trump. Thumbs up, you’re exempt. Thumbs down, you pay. So, what to make of Cook’s obsequious praise for Trump and gifting of an Apple-branded gold trophy? Your take may well be that Cook is simply now a Trump supporter. Or, your take may be that eating a big shit sandwich like this, right in the Oval Office, is simply what Cook “has to do”. My take remains somewhere in the middle, but closer to the latter than the former. Did Cook have to do this? No. Could the announcement that Apple was accelerating its investment plans for US manufacturing from $500 billion to $600 billion simply have been made via a press release on Apple Newsroom, rather than a made-for-TV press event in the Oval Office? Yes.1 But Cook, and Apple, need to pick their battles. To me, what’s obvious is the power dynamic. We’re not used to considering Apple, a $3 trillion company, as subservient in any relationship. But the US federal government dwarfs even the biggest of companies, and Trump is wielding the powers of the executive branch and the bully pulpit of the presidency in unprecedented ways. Flagrantly illegal and unethical ways, but nonetheless, he’s wielding those powers. No company, no matter how big, can stand as a check or balance to that power. It’s not even a case of “kiss the ring and receive preferential treatment”. It’s more a case of “kiss his ass or else you’ll face punishment”. Trump, like a perverted Santa Claus, keeps only two lists: naughty and nice. Cook and Apple got a taste of that after Cook declined to participate in Trump’s Middle East tour, leading Trump to reflexively declare new tariffs on iPhones assembled in India. Trump offered another taste when he announced this week, with Tim Cook in the room, the supposed 100 percent tariffs on computer chips for companies who aren’t playing ball. (I say supposed because the TACO hypothesis, thus far, has panned out.) Faulting Cook for playing ball and kissing Trump’s ring (among other things) is like faulting a local business for paying into a protection racket — one in which the cops are complicit, and the whole scam exists at the behest of a crooked mayor. Moral rectitude can feel good, but not so much when the cops are burning your store to the ground. There is no authority to appeal to for help when the highest office in the country is running the protection racket. I don’t know what would happen to Apple if they simply refused to play ball with any of this at all. Targeted spiteful tariffs, bogus investigations by the Justice Department, personal vilification in MAGA media. Could Apple weather such a storm, financially, with its head held high? Probably. But to what effect? It wouldn’t change the game. The game is currently shamelessly corrupted. Did Cook’s Oval Office display of fealty and his grotesque golden gift make you feel something? Did it engender an emotional response? Grossed out, perhaps? A little sick? Angry? Offended? Me too. But did you feel good — reassured? proud? — when Cook skipped that Middle East Trump tour in May? You know, the one that ranged from Trump singing the praises of the murderous Mohammed bin Salman (“I like you too much”) to accepting as a gift (that he claims will wind up in the possession of his post-presidential “library”) a 747 luxury jet from Qatar. If you choose to believe that Tim Cook is weak, unethical, greedy, or even — despite his long-professed heroes — secretly a MAGA supporter, there’s likely nothing I can say to disabuse you of the notion. You can’t prove a negative. But I would argue that that line of cynicism is the easy way out. That you’re taking comfort in directing your ire at Cook, and the notion that if Cook had more backbone he’d refuse to play this game. It’s comforting to believe it’s him and his ilk, greedy selfish billionaires, not us as a collective whole. It is disturbing to think that the leader of a beloved, trusted, and widely believed-to-be-ethical company like Apple has succumbed to avarice. That Tim Cook feels no qualms about — or perhaps even delights in — participating in a quid-pro-quo-driven corrupt administration in which flattery, fealty, gifts, and barely-concealed bribes are rewarded. That the United States devolving into kleptocracy suits Tim Cook just fine, because Apple’s pockets are deep enough to pay the vig. But the alternative is more disturbing. What if Tim Cook is, in fact, strong, proud, and driven by a keen sense of moral and ethical clarity? Perhaps Cook declined Trump’s invitation to join his Middle East entourage in May only because he was otherwise busy. But I believe there are bridges he will not cross — and that trip, especially its implicit and explicit praise and sanctification of the Saudi regime in general, and MBS in particular, was one of them. The whole trip was grotesque, and made a mockery of traditional American values. US manufacturing, on the other hand, is a point of genuine alignment between Trump’s desires and Apple’s interests and ethics. Emphasizing that alignment in an Oval Office event, solid gold trophy in hand, is gross, yes, but not at all a corruption of anything Cook believes to be in the genuine interests of Apple or the nation. Consider the possibility that, far from being comfortable with his gift and obsequious ring-kissing this week, Cook was as discomfited by it as anyone. That he is keenly aware that trust and reputation are only accrued slowly, but are always at risk of being squandered quickly, and that this applies both to how he is perceived personally and how Apple is perceived as an institution — a pillar of American ingenuity and industry. His life’s work. And that despite all of that, Cook concluded that debasing himself, selling some shares of his own dignity, was the best course of action — for Apple, for Apple’s customers (and, yes, shareholders), and perhaps even for the country. That ruthless practicality is necessary merely to stay afloat in a sea of abject graft, extortion, and cronyism. That’s dark. That requires considering that the problem isn’t the greed of a few billionaires and executives who ought to resist burgeoning corruption, but that Trump and his sycophants in the Republican Party have already succeeded in corrupting the system. That the corruption isn’t happening, but happened. The United States isn’t heading for existential trouble. We’re in it — and a pathway out is not yet clear. That’s not to say all is forever lost, but that we are, in our current political moment, beyond the point where the game can be played successfully on the level. You can choose to play a crooked game straight, but you can’t win. Business is competition. A loser who played above reproach is still a loser. You need to choose your battles. US manufacturing is Cook’s choice. The White House has long been called the People’s House. The embarrassment of this week’s Oval Office bending of the knee isn’t Cook’s or Apple’s alone. It’s an embarrassment for our entire nation. It’s not him. It’s not them. It’s us. Also worth noting: Apple’s investment plan for US manufacturing is largely in line with their $430 billion plan four years ago at the outset of the Biden administration, and is likely what they’d be committing under a hypothetical Harris administration or second Biden term. Apple’s strategy hasn’t wavered on this front; only the fanfare has. ↩︎ Display Preferences Copyright © 2002–2025 The Daring Fireball Company LLC.

Title: Google Pixel 10 and its Qi2 magnets could be the perfect device to revive the magic of Moto Mods

While every leaked render and marketing tease for Google upcoming smartphone launch might make the Pixel 10 feel like a year-old rerun, the devil’s seemingly in the details. Even setting aside the usual round of software enhancements — only some of which have just begun to leak — it’s clear Google does have some hardware tricks up its sleeve Chief among them is native Qi2 support, which should bring support for magnetic chargers, wallets, stands, and much more to every device in the Pixel 10 lineup. If you’ve used anything newer than the iPhone 12 — or you’ve splurged for a MagSafe-compatible case for all sorts of Android devices — you already know how great magnetic-based accessories are. We’ve seen a handful of brands, including Samsung and OnePlus, dip their respective toes into the world of Qi2 support, but that sense of excitement is seriously dulled when you realize you need those cases for any of these tools to work. Aside from an outlier or two, the Pixel 10 lineup will be the first major Android device to include Qi2’s magnet array within the smartphone itself, with the only sacrifice being a minor (and in my eyes, worthwhile) increase in thickness. But I want more. See, Google’s decision to reuse the design language from last year’s Pixel 9 lineup comes with some added potential now that all four phones have embedded magnets hidden right below the surface: the chance to bring back an idea Motorola abandoned at the tail end of last decade. That’s right, Pixel fans — it’s time for Google to revive Moto Mods. Moto Mods, for those who don’t remember, arrived with the Moto Z in 2016. Motorola’s one-time flagship series had some pretty slick tricks up its sleeve, combining a shockingly slim chassis — even by today’s standards — with a magnetic accessory lineup. Unlike previous attempts to design a modular smartphone, Moto Mods were hot-swappable; while LG’s “Friends” required cracking open the battery compartment on the G5, Moto Mods were, in many ways, more like the MagSafe and Qi2 accessories we’ve come to know and love today. Really, the downfall of Moto Mods had nothing to do with how well they worked, but rather, the limitation of such a product lineup. Motorola only offered Mods on the Z-series, which saw several mainline and spin-off entries released from 2016 to 2019. Early excitement from the company — including the promise of a million dollar offer to the best third-party Mod developer — had fizzled out by 2018, resulting in layoffs from its Chicago-based team and the eventual death of the Z-series after its fourth-gen model. Frankly, Motorola was the wrong company to go about this. At the time, the company’s biggest success — both critically and commercially — was its budget-friendly G-series. Even after its split from Google, Motorola was making solid entry-level and midrange smartphones well before the Galaxy A-series and Pixel A-series stole its thunder. The Moto Z and its various follow-ups weren’t bad, but the focus on expensive accessories and the compromises from the magnetic modular system were apparent from the jump. But there were a lot of good ideas, especially with the Mods themselves. Hasselblad developed a point-and-shoot-esque camera system long before it would partner with OnePlus and Oppo on their respective phones, providing 10x zoom and a real flash. JBL made add-on speakers that ran circles around any built-in offerings at the time. Battery packs, game controllers, photo printers, and even a projector — Moto Mods produced a lot of cool concepts, even if the entire ecosystem never quite managed to go mainstream. And that’s to say nothing of Motorola’s “Style Shells,” which transformed the joys of Moto Maker into something you could do in your home. The Moto Z’s 5.2mm chassis could easily support additional material padded onto the back without feeling too bulky, eliminating the need for a case for plenty of users while delivering an early sense of those fashion-forward vibes the company would later adopt with the Moto Razr. If anything, I think Moto Mods’ inability to score any mainstream success really boils down to timing. The original Moto Z shipped a year before the iPhone X, Galaxy S8, and Pixel 2 XL all started to move towards taller, edge-to-edge panels, while Motorola found itself boxed into a design it promised to support for at least two additional generations. By the end of the Z-series, the company’s devices looked wildly dated next to practically any other smartphone on the market, to say nothing of the (fairly ugly) pogo pins that stuck out like a sore thumb whenever a Mod wasn’t in active use. A good idea poorly executed, in other words — and that’s exactly where Google can swoop in to pick up the pieces. The Pixel 10 lineup seems tailor-made for a Moto Mods-style reboot. Obviously it’s got built-in magnets, just like the original Moto Z had. It’s got a splashy, memorable name in “Pixelsnap,” one that should include various optional first-party accessories in addition to every third-party MagSafe/Qi2 accessory already on the market. And rather than starting with an entirely fresh smartphone series, Google appears to be building this support directly into its entire 2025 flagship lineup, practically guaranteeing far more attention than Moto Mods ever got. But for me, the biggest factor is the Pixel 10’s design. Leaks and teases alike show Google reusing last year’s design, complete with the same squared-off, protruding camera bump that is, when paired with magnets, surprisingly reminiscent of the Moto Z. That phone series used its large, circular camera bump to help hold accessories in place, something that could be easily recreated on the Pixel 10, 10 Pro, and 10 Pro XL. Google’s got plenty of new colors , but I’d love to see a series of first-party Style Shell-type add-ons to deliver just a bit more personalization. It seems, to me, like a match made in heaven. Still, I’m not going to pretend there aren’t some obvious shortcomings here, both compared to Moto Mods themselves and with how something similar would play with the Pixel 10. First, the design. The entire Pixel 10 series, like the Pixel 9 lineup before it, is pretty chunky. While adding on a magnetic backplate might not be that much bulkier than any random case off Amazon, it’s going to pale in comparison to a chassis so sleek, OEMs today are manufacturing “ultra-slim” phones that still can’t compete. A magnetic shell flush with the camera bar would make the entire device over 12mm thick, and that might be a touch too far for those of us who live a caseless lifestyle. Second, we don’t totally know how Pixelsnap works at the moment when pairing Pixel hardware with a magnetic accessory. MagSafe supports some communication between various accessories through NFC, but it’s a far cry from the pogo pin implementation on the Moto Z. Say what you will about its appearance, but there’s a reason pogo pins are still relied on for accessories like tablet keyboards to this very day. I think we can safely say some of the coolest Moto Mod accessories — projectors, game controllers, etc. — simply could not work just through a magnetic connection on its own. But that still leaves plenty of room for Google and third-party partners to really innovate on some excited accessories. Build a hybrid power bank-meets-Bluetooth speaker that aligns perfectly with the shape of either the Pixel 10 and 10 Pro or the Pixel 10 Pro XL. Design a wallet add-on that feels as though it’s part of the device’s design rather than awkwardly protruding from the back. Make a crazy slider QWERTY keyboard just because you can. Hell, even just Style Shell-like back covers would be a worthy endeavor in making the Pixel feel a little more customizable than in years past. While I doubt we’ll ever see Moto Mods come roaring back to life with the same sort of surprising capability, the Pixel 10 certainly feels like the right time to try. I’m struggling to see a reason here for Google to skip out on embracing some of Motorola’s best concepts from a decade ago in a more modern fashion. Not every accessories needs to be perfectly flush with the phone — we’ve seen that for years with MagSafe and Qi2-compliant battery banks. The opportunity is there, though, for both Google and other casemakers to lean heavily into some half-forgotten ideas from 2016. While I doubt we’ll ever see Moto Mods come roaring back to life with the same sort of surprising capability, the Pixel 10 certainly feels like the right time to try.

The Harvard Management Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of the university, has a $116 million position in BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, a 13F form filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission shows. Not one to be left out, Brown University—which first bought exposure to Bitcoin in May—upped its position in BlackRock's ETF and now holds $13 million worth of shares, a similar filing shows. Neither Brown nor Harvard immediately responded to Decrypt's request for comment. The filings are the latest examples of traditional institutions seeking exposure to the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap. Crypto ETFs like BlackRock's Bitcoin Trust—which trades as IBIT—allow investors to buy exposure to the leading cryptocurrency without having to own and store the digital coin directly. BlackRock’s IBIT is the most successful crypto ETF: The fund has received more cash than any other crypto ETF and currently has $86.3 billion in assets under management. Other major institutions have bought exposure to Bitcoin, once an arcane and obscure asset, since the January 2024 approval of the ETFs. A flood of capital has entered the crypto space since the funds started trading, with investors previously too intimidated by things like storing digital coins in crypto wallets now able to easily buy a position. Pension funds and U.S. states have all bought exposure to Bitcoin via the ETFs over the past year, along with more traditional investments like tech stocks and other U.S. equities.

Title: Embattled Intel CEO calls out ‘misinformation’ after Trump demands he step down over alleged ties to Chinese military

Time Published: 2025-08-08T21:32:18Z
Full Content:
Embattled Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan pushed back on “misinformation” over his alleged financial ties to China after President Trump called on him to resign over a potential conflict of interest. “I want to be absolutely clear: Over 40+ years in the industry, I’ve built relationships around the world and across our diverse ecosystem – and I have always operated within the highest legal and ethical standards,” Tan wrote in the letter to Intel staffers on Thursday. He went on to say that the company — which last year was awarded $8.5 billion under the Biden administration’s CHIPS Act — is working with the Trump administration to address the issues being raised. Tan has come under fire from both Trump and Sen. Tom Cotton, the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, over the Intel chief’s past investments in Chinese companies with ties to the Beijing and the military. In a post on his Truth Social platform Thursday morning, Trump wrote that Tan is “highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately.” That missive came a day after Cotton (R-Ark.) sent a letter to Intel Chairman Frank Yeary demanding answers about Tan’s financial dealings because he is concerned “about the security and integrity of Intel’s operations and its potential impact on US national security.” A Reuters report earlier this year claimed Tan invested at least $200 million across hundreds of Chinese firms – some with links to the military – between March 2012 and December 2024. Cotton also raised concerns over Tan’s tenure as CEO at Cadence Design, which last week agreed to pay more than $140 million to settle charges that it sold chips to a Chinese military institution, according to Reuters. In Tan’s memo Thursday, he said that Intel’s board is “fully supportive.” However, the beleaguered boss has been emroiled a power struggle with Intel’s board since taking over as CEO in March, sources familiar with the matter told the Wall Street Journal. The crux of the tensions revolves around whether Intel should continue to manufacture its own chips or exit the business entirely to cut down on costs, according to the report. While Tan has pushed to keep Intel’s own production in place, some board members, led by Yeary, are trying to spin off or sell the money-losing unit, sources said. Yeary has even held talks with Nvidia and Amazon about buying pieces of the business, and explored a potential sale to chipmaker TSMC, according to the Journal. Tan, who was born in Malaysia and grew up in Singapore, replaced ousted CEO Pat Gelsinger following dismal earnings and several rounds of layoffs.

August 08, 2025 16:30 ET | Source: Faraday Future Faraday Future LOS ANGELES, Aug. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (NASDAQ: FFAI) (“Faraday Future” or the “Company”) today announced that it plans to hold a Special Meeting of Stockholders (the “EGM”) on September 19, to seek approval for proposals aimed at supporting the Company’s strategic initiatives and long-term growth. The Company urges all stockholders to vote FOR all proposals. Proposal Highlights： 1. Share Authorization ProposalApproval of an amendment to the Company’s Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the “Charter”) to increase the number of authorized shares of Common Stock by 65,225,672, from 167,245,313 to 232,470,985, representing a 39% increase, and increase the number of authorized shares of the Company’s Preferred Stock, by 5,031,000 shares, from 12,900,000 to 17,931,000, so that the total number of authorized shares, including Common Stock and Preferred Stock, will increase from 180,145,313 shares to 250,401,985 shares. The proposal does not affect the current number of outstanding shares but reflects the Company’s continued adherence to a prudent, disciplined, and relatively low-percentage new share issuance strategy. Having additional authorized shares of Class A Common Stock will help the Company meet its existing obligations including the recent $105 Million financing commitment and be well-positioned to pursue future opportunities, including capital raises, acquisitions, stock dividends or splits, stock issuances under employee benefit plans, and other proper corporate purposes. This increased share capacity is also critical to funding the Company’s ongoing operations and executing its business strategy and facilitate the rapid execution of the Second Chapter of the Bridge Strategy, in alignment with its long-term vision of becoming a leader in the AI-driven EV era and demonstrating the Company’s dedication to putting stockholders first. 2. Private Placement ProposalApproval of the issuance of shares of Class A Common Stock to holders of certain convertible notes and warrants in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(d). This measure ensures compliance with regulatory requirements while enabling the Company to honor its obligations to holders of certain of the Company’s convertible notes and common warrants, which is crucial for the Company to obtain funds to support the production of vehicles in the future. 3. Name Change ProposalApproval of an amendment to the Company’s Charter to change the Company’s name from “Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc.” to “Faraday Future AI Electric Vehicle Inc.” The new name aligns with the Company’s vision to lead the intelligent electric vehicle (EV) industry and highlights its commitment to innovation in AI-driven solutions and smart transportation ecosystems. Additionally, the new name aligns with the Company’s new ticker symbol, FFAI, reinforcing a unified brand identity. 4. Amended 2021 Plan ProposalApproval of an amendment to the Company’s Amended and Restated 2021 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”) to increase the number of shares of Class A Common Stock available for issuance under the 2021 Plan by an additional 9,500,000 shares. The proposed amendment is intended to ensure the Company can continue offering long-term equity incentives as a competitive alternative to cash compensation. This change is critical to attracting, motivating, and retaining top talent, which is essential for executing our business strategy and driving long-term stockholder value. 5. Adjournment Proposal Approval of one or more adjournments of the Special Meeting by the Company from time to time to permit further solicitation of proxies, if necessary or appropriate, if sufficient votes are not represented at the Special Meeting to approve one or more Proposals at the time of such adjournment or if otherwise determined by the chairperson of the Special Meeting to be necessary or appropriate. Recent Key Business Progress with Continued Stockholder Support Powered by ongoing stockholders' backing, our Bridge Strategy has driven comprehensive progress, strengthening both operational and capital fundamentals: "Our Bridge Strategy continues to attract global users, investors, and partners. FF's dual improvements in operational and capital fundamentals are directly attributable to stockholders' long-standing support," YT Jia, Founder and Co-CEO of FF, said. "We're now in the final phase before the year-end rollout of the first FX Super One vehicle in the U.S. market, while simultaneously implementing a major upgrade to our Bridge Strategy that positions FF for accelerated growth. At this critical moment, we've submitted key proposals to advance our business. We urge stockholders to vote FOR all proposals – your decision will determine the company's future!"

August 08, 2025 16:27 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, Aug. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in Novo Nordisk A/S ("Novo" or the "Company") (NYSE: NVO) of a class action securities lawsuit. CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Novo investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/novo-nordisk-a-s-lawsuit-submission-form-3?prid=160233&wire=3 NVO investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Novo during the relevant time frame, you have until September 30, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff. NO COST TO YOU: If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees. There is no cost or obligation to participate.

Title: Not today, AI: Despite corporate hype, few signs that the tech is taking jobs — yet

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time The job market has begun looking shakier. How much is artificial intelligence to blame? Not a whole lot. At least not yet. A review of employment surveys, interviews with labor market analysts and recent company earnings reports shows little evidence, so far, that would support assertions of a widespread economic impact from AI’s growing usage. “It’s such an emotional thing for people, many of whom are determined to see it in the data,” said Martha Gimbel, executive director and co-founder of the Budget Lab at Yale University and a former President Joe Biden economic adviser. “And it’s just not there yet.” Much is riding on the payoff from AI. The stock market has been hitting record highs largely thanks to gains from tech giants like Nvidia, Google parent Alphabet, Facebook parent Meta and Microsoft, which have made enormous investments in pumping out AI-related products. For precisely that reason, analysts say, some businesses may be incentivized to hype AI’s potential as a disruptive force. Through the end of July, the term “AI” has been cited on about two-thirds of second-quarter earnings calls conducted by S&P 500 companies, according to the data provider Factset. That’s up from less than half in the first quarter. Amid a downshifting economy, cost pressures are mounting, prompting corporate leaders to hype AI’s potential as a savings source — even if it’s not quite there yet. “In 2023, you’d have a high-profile public company do a job cut and cite rising interest rates or uncertain macro conditions,” Roger Lee, a tech entrepreneur who also runs a website that tracks tech industry layoffs, said. ”Today, it’s AI.” The most extreme warning about AI’s short-term impact has come from Dario Amodei, co-founder and CEO of AI firm Anthropic. In May, he told Axios that he foresees half of all entry-level white-collar jobs being wiped out in the next one to five years, spiking unemployment to between 10% and 20%. So far, evidence for this scenario is mixed. All job openings, entry-level or otherwise, have been declining since 2023, according to labor market analytics company Revelio Labs, though the trend has not been linear. Revelio said entry-level jobs exposed to AI have been declining fastest — but senior roles exposed to AI have actually begun to recover. The broader picture for white-collar professions most at risk of disruption actually indicates fairly stable employment trends. Last week’s official jobs report showed office and administrative roles have actually returned to their pandemic-era highs, while employment in other professional sectors, like accounting and legal services, has held relatively steady. It’s a gloomier story in tech — but also a more nuanced one when it comes to AI’s impact. The leaders of Amazon and Microsoft have both signaled the ability to run their businesses with reduced headcount thanks to AI. Tech layoffs tracked by Lee’s website hit a three-month high in July, with three companies — Intel, Microsoft and Recruit Holdings, the parent of Indeed and Glassdoor — largely responsible. All three of those companies cited artificial intelligence as playing a role in the job reductions, Lee said. But he noted that in the case of Recruit Holdings, there were no specifics about how AI had impacted the lost positions. The company simply said the technology was “changing the world.” “It does seem like many of the roles being cut are in line with ones being used by AI,” Lee said. “But it’s still being used as a cover in other cases.” A representative for Recruit did not respond to a request for comment. The simple calculus behind AI is that businesses will be able to do more with less, increasing overall productivity while reducing hiring needs. Yet economists say it is difficult to calculate accurate changes in productivity over the short term — though so far, the broadest national measure has shown a deceleration in recent quarters. Most of the benefits of AI are instead accruing to consumers, not businesses, according to a forthcoming paper from researchers at Carnegie Mellon and Stanford University. If it feels like much of the value from the current generation of AI seems mostly to allow ordinary people to generate emails and papers faster, or do quicker research, you’re not imagining things. “Free goods are invisible in the GDP numbers, even if they make consumers better off,” the authors, Avinash Collis and Erik Brynjolfsson, wrote in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed. They calculate consumers derived the equivalent of $97 billion in surplus welfare from generative AI in 2024, compared with $7 billion in revenues logged by the tech firms actually creating AI products. Economies typically see a “J-curve” effect when transformative technologies are introduced, Collis told NBC News. At first there is a bottleneck that can cause some disruptions, though these initial effects are often not captured in official figures. For example, the iPhone increased the total global volume of photos from billions to trillions, something that directly impacted workers at camera giant Kodak, but created incalculable opportunities elsewhere, Collis said. “There will likely be a lot of impact, perhaps on some sectors negatively,” Collis said. “But at the same time lots of new jobs could be created as well.” Other indicators do suggest the stirrings of a more pronounced AI effect on jobs. The July employment survey from consultancy Challenger, Gray and Christmas found companies have blamed “automation and AI implementation” for 20,000 job cuts in 2025, with another 10,000 or so directly attributable to artificial intelligence. Challenger said this shows “a significant acceleration in AI-related restructuring.” Those figures are dwarfed by cuts related to government spending declines and general economic and market conditions, which account for nearly 500,000 lost roles this year, Challenger said. Some companies appear to be keeping payroll counts steady in response to the broad uncertainty in the economy, and using any additional resources to explore AI’s potential to boost their bottom lines. Stacy Spikes, CEO of MoviePass, told NBC News that internal workflows at his company become vastly more efficient thanks to AI. That’s made him more gun-shy about bringing on new workers into certain departments, like software. As of Tuesday, MoviePass’ careers page showed no open positions. “We haven’t seen headcount need to increase,” Spikes said. Businesses like MoviePass still appear to be the exception, however. Analysts at Goldman Sachs say only about 9% of all companies are regularly using new AI tools to produce goods or services. As a result, they see only limited effects at the moment. “When I look at the impact that AI has had on the overall labor market data so far, it looks pretty small to me,” Joseph Briggs, head of the global economics team at Goldman Sachs Research, said on a recent company podcast. Even for recent college grads, who have seen unemployment rates tick higher, “the anecdotes and the relationship that the anecdotes have to AI is often a little bit overstated,” Briggs said. JP Morgan analysts came to a similar conclusion, finding that, for now, its research “failed to find a significant impact on job growth.” But they cautioned that this could change at the next economic downturn. For white-collar workers, “we think that during the course of the next recession the speed and the breadth of the adoption of the AI tools and applications in the workplace might induce large scale displacement for occupations,” they said in a recent note to clients. Others remain more optimistic about the potential for new opportunities to overcome any negative effects. That’s how Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang sees it. As the head of an AI giant, he may also have reason to hype its potential — but his outlook is notably rosier than Anthropic’s Amodei’s. Huang told Axios last month that the technology would ultimately lead to more jobs, even if there are some redundancies elsewhere. “Everyone’s jobs will change,” he said. “Some jobs will be unnecessary. Some people will lose jobs. But many new jobs will be created. ... The world will be more productive.” Rob Wile is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist covering breaking business stories for NBCNews.com. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: AI neo-colonialism: How Big Tech is strip-mining the Global South for data

By Dr. Mathew Maavak, who researches systems science, global risks, geopolitics, strategic foresight, governance and Artificial Intelligence By Dr. Mathew Maavak, who researches systems science, global risks, geopolitics, strategic foresight, governance and Artificial Intelligence The new colonial frontier isn’t restricted to mineral-rich Congo or oil-drenched Venezuela. It’s digital, invisible, and everywhere. From the shantytowns of Nairobi to the barrios of Manila, smartphones hum with the raw material of the 21st century: data, all sorts of data. And just like spices and slaves once sailed westward in imperial galleons, metadata now travels quietly to the cloud servers of Palo Alto and Shenzhen. This isn’t development, it is digital extraction. Welcome to the age of AI colonialism. Big Tech firms from the US, and to a lesser extent China, have turned the Global South into a massive open-pit mine for behavioral data. Under the pretense of “AI for Development,” they build infrastructure, donate connectivity, and sponsor pilot programs but the returns flow in only one direction. Voice samples collected in Ghana become training fodder for Western voice assistants. Facial data gathered in Nigerian policing trials end up fine-tuning surveillance software in San Francisco, where western models have had protracted problems in identifying and tracking darker-skinned individuals. Agricultural data scraped from Filipino farmers help power predictive analytics for agribusiness conglomerates that will hardly benefit the Philippines. This is not a partnership. This is colonial pillage dressed in TED Talk lingo. AI is marketed as a miracle equalizer that will help developing nations leapfrog into the future. We were told AI would bring precision agriculture, predictive healthcare, and smart urbanism, among numerous other utopian transformations, to even the most under-resourced regions. These Davos fantasies were regurgitated for nearly two decades. But where is the proof, the showcase project or evidence that even a fraction of those promises was delivered? The only real revolution happening is the outflow of data that were supposed to power these breakthroughs. Big Tech servers abroad now function like the colonial warehouses and banks of yore. Nor are intellectual properties of individuals and SMEs in the Developing World safe from this new brand of predation. Models, patents, ideas, and profits quietly migrate north while the Global South is left with nothing but pilot programs and PowerPoint decks. Worse still, these tools are increasingly used against the very populations providing the raw material, or should I say, raw data. In Kenya, facial recognition technology was introduced as a policing tool under the guise of modernization. In practice, it has disproportionately targeted political activists who, in turn, are also resorting to AI to level the political battlefield. Who ultimately benefits from this internecine clash? Isn’t this the latest incarnation of the old imperial “divide and conquer” dictum? In India, AI-driven fraud detection systems have misclassified thousands of rural poor, unjustly cutting them off from vital government benefits. Imported algorithmic governance – often designed without regard for local context or cultural nuance – compounds the problem. Ironically, while these systems penalize the most vulnerable, India has emerged as a global hub for sophisticated online scams. It is a digital paradox where the poor are relentlessly surveilled, while the real fraudsters flourish with impunity. Nothing exemplifies AI colonialism better than the biometric boom. Tech firms, often in partnership with NGOs or global financial institutions, are racing to digitize identities across the Global South. Fingerprint scans, iris recognition, voiceprint registration have all been justified as ways to “include the unbanked” or “streamline public services.” But these efforts rarely include meaningful consent or data protection frameworks. In many cases, biometric systems have been imposed without community consultation or independent oversight. One of the most egregious examples is Worldcoin, a cryptocurrency project that offered small payments in exchange for biometric iris scans. Its largest user base? Young people in low-income African nations like Kenya who served as a convenient population to experiment on, far from the regulatory spotlights of Brussels or Washington. (Note; Worldcoin was co-founded by Sam Altman, who is also the co-founder and CEO of OpenAI, which owns ChatGPT). Once collected, this data becomes part of opaque and often proprietary AI systems whose inner workings are unknowable to the very people they affect. Local regulators are usually outgunned, underfunded or more likely, politically compromised. As a result, entire populations are subjected to surveillance and scoring regimes that they neither understand nor control. The worst culprits in this saga are not Big Tech but local politicians and “technocrats” who sell out their nations at bargain basement prices, couched under the double-speak of “best practices” and UN institutional recommendations. Silicon Valley is the global epicenter of thenew East India Companies. These entities are vested with quasi-sovereign power and backed by vast capital reserves, lobbying muscle, and a veneer of corporate benevolence. Where the original East India Company extracted tea and textiles, today’s digital extractors siphon up location metadata, online behavior, biometric identifiers, and social graph mappings. Consider Meta’s “Free Basics” initiative, which offered zero-rated internet access in dozens of developing countries. What seemed like a humanitarian gesture was, in reality, an attempt to create a captive ecosystem – one where Facebook was the internet. It was banned in India in 2016 but continues in other countries, quietly conditioning the digital habits of hundreds of millions of users. An expanded Meta Connectivity is now used by an estimated 300 million people across many countries, including Indonesia, Pakistan, and the Philippines. Critics warn that these platforms could be exploited for surveillance, IP harvesting, and geopolitical intelligence – often without the knowledge or consent of local populations. No one really knows what is happening. Besides, these services are not entirely free either. Pakistani users of Meta’s tech philanthropy were allegedly charged $1.9 million per month. India, once hailed as a rising digital superpower, now serves as a showpiece for AI neo-colonialism. Its vast IT industry, once brimming with promise, is today little more than an outsourced arm of Western conglomerates. Here is a reality check: how many individuals outside India have even one Indian-made app on their phones? There was a brief window when Indian tech seemed poised to lead. In the late ’90s, a major US tech firm allegedly commissioned two parallel teams – one in Silicon Valley, the other in an Indian city – to build a next-generation operating system to challenge Microsoft. The Indian team delivered. The US team could not. Around the same time, Indian innovators like Sabeer Bhatia gave us Hotmail, which arguably accelerated the decline of the traditional postal system. For a brief moment, the digital future seemed multipolar. That was until Big Capital arrived. Rather than reward innovation, Big Tech consolidated. Rival platforms that didn’t serve the globalist surveillance machine were quietly buried. Competition was replaced with shareholder-sanctioned “coordination,” led by the likes of BlackRock and its predecessors. From that point on, Indian IT firms would be reduced from potential innovators to mere subcontractors. And who better to manage this global digital plantation than a new class of compliant Indian C-Suite executives? These are not the disruptors. They are the taskmasters of digital “kanganis,” running the same extractive labor models once perfected by the East India Company. The dream of an “Asian Century” powered by Indian software and Chinese hardware has curdled into a reality of Chinese software, Chinese hardware, and Chinese AI. Indian tech talent has been reduced to glorified middleware, at best. For all the online chest-thumping about Indian-origin CEOs in the US, where is India’s own Jensen Huang? Where is the Indian-founded equivalent of NVIDIA, OpenAI, or even Palantir? There isn’t one. India produces engineers by the millions but owns almost none of the gilt-edged platforms. It trains the talent, but not the trillion-dollar tech. The colony codes and the empire profits. A similar theme is being played out in the US Ivy League system. But is the tide turning? Nigeria has applied brakes on foreign-backed digital ID programs. Kenya has suspended iris-scanning initiatives after massive backlash. A growing chorus of activists, lawyers, and technologists are calling for data sovereignty: the idea that countries should have the same rights over their data that they claim over oil, water, and land. A few pioneering efforts have emerged. In Brazil, the General Data Protection Law has begun to shape public discourse. In South Africa, local AI research groups are working on open, transparent models rooted in African languages and cultural norms. The African Union has even begun early-stage deliberations on a continental data governance framework. But it is an uphill fight. Western governments, in tandem with corporate lobbyists, continue to push for “data liberalization” which is nothing but a euphemism for open access-mediated exploitation. Aid packages, development grants, and tech investments are increasingly tied to these demands. It echoes the structural adjustment programs of the 1980s, where loans came with strings that hollowed out national control. Only now, the strings are coded in algorithms. The Global South needs a coordinated pushback against Silicon Valley’s digital hegemony. This would involve not just resisting predatory data practices but investment in alternative infrastructures such as sovereign cloud storage, ethical AI standards, community-owned data cooperatives, and open-source platforms. This is how a new digital non-alignment paradigm can be achieved. The Global South has been colonized before. But data, unlike oil or sugar, is invisible, infinitely replicable, and easily stolen. That makes the fight harder but also more urgent. In this new age of algorithmic empires, control over information isn’t just about profit, it is about power, freedom, and the right to define your own future.

Title: Trump Signs Executive Order to Allow Crypto into 401(k)

Time Published: 2025-08-08T19:48:36Z
Full Content:
US President Donald Trump has signed a new executive order into effect that will allow American 401(ks) to invest in digital assets and related financial instruments. This could be a massive move for the entire digital currency market, as 401(k)s, also known as retirement funds, collectively hold a massive $6.12 trillion in assets and could invest significantly in them. However, the new presidential proclamation isn’t crypto-specific but a massive overhaul of retirement plan options available to American residents. It includes private equity, real estate, and other alternative investments as well. The move has opened the way for asset managers to tap into trillions of dollars worth of potential investments. According to the wording of the executive order: “My Administration will relieve the regulatory burdens and litigation risk that impede American workers’ retirement accounts from achieving the competitive returns and asset diversification necessary to secure a dignified, comfortable retirement”. The document then tasks the Labor Secretary and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to implement this directive and make it easier for Americans to invest in these disruptive assets. It also asked federal agencies to ensure clarity in the current rules to facilitate the ownership of these assets, but stopped short of asking for specific actions in this regard. Executive orders are one of the primary tools at the disposal of the President’s office in the USA. However, they can be challenged in courts, and the latter have a long precedent of delaying and even striking down orders that don’t line up with the constitution or established precedents. The US pensions market is set to reach a whopping $10 trillion by 2030 with an annual CGR of 9%. The Trump executive order is a major deal for crypto investors in the USA, as previously, federal agencies and executive authority had heavily discouraged crypto in retirement accounts. The move was particularly welcomed by elite asset managers like BlackRock, which was reportedly behind the lobbying of this particular use of presidential power by President Trump. Users on X (formerly Twitter) also chipped in immediately, with one analyst commenting: According to Blackrock’s senior retirement asset manager, Jaime Magyera: “Expanding access to investments long out of reach will help ensure millions of Americans build stronger, more diversified portfolios designed to increase savings and address the practical considerations of DC plan fiduciaries,” The move follows years of lobbying by crypto users and asset managers to improve the process of including crypto in 401(ks). It remains to be seen just how much of a major impact it will have on Bitcoin’s price index, which is currently trading around the $117,000 valuation.

With Ethereum surpassing $4,000, prediction platforms see a bullish sentiment, forecasting potential price targets up to $60,000. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Ethereum (ETH) surged past the $4,000 mark on Aug. 8, hitting its highest level this year after a sustained market rally that saw it gain nearly 50% in the past month. Data from CryptoSlate shows the asset peaked at $4,047 during US trading hours. Notably, the last time ETH traded above $4,000 was in December 2024, when optimism around Donald Trump’s election victory fueled a wave of pro-crypto sentiment in the US. Meanwhile, CoinGlass data reveals the latest rally caught bearish traders off guard. Short positions against ETH suffered losses totaling $134 million in the past 24 hours as prices defied expectations. Ethereum’s breakout comes amid a surge in institutional interest in the digital asset for their treasury reserves. Over the past month, major firms such as SharpLink and BitMine have accumulated significant ETH holdings and announced multi-billion-dollar purchase plans. According to Strategic ETH Reserve data, these entities collectively hold over 3 million ETH—about 2.5% of the total supply—valued at more than $12 billion. BitMine leads with 833,100 ETH, worth approximately $5.2 billion. Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, has expressed a cautious optimism regarding the increasing corporate interest in ETH. While he welcomed the adoption, Buterin cautioned firms against overleveraging their ETH holdings. According to Buterin: “If you woke me up 3 years from now and told me that treasuries led to the downfall of ETH… my guess would be that they turned into an overleveraged game.” In addition to these firms, the Ethereum network has also seen a surge in adoption via exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with a record $5 billion in inflows recorded in July. According to SoSo Value data, the trend has continued into the new month, with the nine funds registering just two days of outflows in August compared to four days of outflows experienced by their Bitcoin counterparts. Additionally, traditional financial powerhouses like BlackRock and Robinhood have expanded their activities around Ethereum, focusing on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Looking ahead, market optimism continues to rise along with expectations of Ethereum’s continued price growth. Crypto bettors on Polymarket, the leading decentralized prediction platform, believe there is a 60% chance that ETH will exceed $5,000 by the end of the year. Meanwhile, 36% of traders believe it could reach $6,000, and 24% predict a rise to $7,000. Notably, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes is more bullish about Ethereum’s price hitting $10,000 by the end of the year. Meanwhile, BitMine’s projections suggest a much higher potential, estimating ETH’s implied price at $60,000. At the time of press 8:22 pm UTC on Aug. 8, 2025, Ethereum is ranked #2 by market cap and the price is up 5.63% over the past 24 hours.

(Bloomberg) -- The heavy hitters of private credit have been waiting for this moment for years. Major lenders, which often cater to companies with dented credit, talk endlessly about the opportunities in investment-grade debt and in financing the breakneck growth of artificial intelligence. They’ve done smaller deals, but this week they caught the biggest fish yet: a $29 billion financing package for Meta Platforms Inc.’s massive data center in Louisiana. That transaction, led by Pacific Investment Management Co. and Blue Owl Capital Inc., hits all the high notes: It’s a top-notch business in a hot sector. It disrupts the usual route that companies like Meta travel to get money from investors through banks. And, it’s huge. “Private credit has been itching to get into this space,” said John Medina, senior vice president on the global project and infrastructure finance team at Moody’s Ratings. “This deal is one of the first of its kind for private credit and if it is successful, we would expect to see more.” The biggest technology companies are in an AI arms race now, and they need cash to win. Elon Musk’s xAI Corp. recently told investors it plans to spend $18 billion on data centers, and is looking at raising debt backed by projects rather than at the corporate level. Others including Amazon.com Inc. and OpenAI Inc. are pursuing their own sites across the US. Morgan Stanley estimates that capital expenditures on AI could exceed $3 trillion in the next three years. For Meta, Pimco is planning to arrange $26 billion in debt and Blue Owl is providing $3 billion in equity. The debt portion is likely to be issued in the form of investment-grade bonds backed by the data center’s assets, people familiar with the matter said, adding that the final structure is still in flux. The bidding war for the financing lasted months. It was competitive because private credit firms have been all-but-begging for access to the investment-grade debt world that banks dominate. Other private credit firms that grappled for the top spot include Apollo Global Management Inc. and KKR & Co., which made it to the final round, as well as Brookfield Asset Management Ltd., Blackstone Inc. and Ares Management Corp., said the people, who were not authorized to speak publicly. Morgan Stanley advised Meta on the deal but isn’t leading the financing. It is the largest funding package related to a specific AI data center by a mile, with others involving xAI Corp. or Coreweave Inc. well below $10 billion. Microsoft Inc., BlackRock Inc. and the United Arab Emirates’ MGX investment vehicle are teaming up to raise $30 billion of private equity that can be leveraged to $100 billion, with Nvidia Corp. and xAI also joining in, but that money is for a series of data warehouses and energy infrastructure rather than an individual project. The most recent debt deal of any kind that’s even near the size of Meta’s was a $26 billion bond sale to support Mars Inc.’s purchase of rival food-maker Kellanova in March. A group of banks put together the financing, which was funneled through to their typical investors in the syndicated market. Dry Powder Private credit firms have about $450 billion of dry powder to invest, according to Preqin data, and are clamoring for this kind of business. The corporate acquisitions that often fuel private credit deals are practically at a standstill. And these firms aspire to more fully become rivals to traditional Wall Street banks — handling everything from advising companies to structuring their debt to providing some of it themselves. Expanding further into investment-grade deals could help make private credit a $40 trillion market, according to an estimate from Apollo. “This ecosystem of private investment-grade is a massive market with a huge tailwind,” Michael Zawadzki, the global chief investment officer at Blackstone’s credit and insurance unit, said last year. Representatives for Apollo, Meta, Pimco, Blue Owl, Brookfield, Blackstone, Ares and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. Those for KKR and xAI didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. KKR and Energy Capital Partners last year agreed to a $50 billion partnership to accelerate the development of infrastructure for artificial intelligence. Blue Owl CEO Marc Lipschultz has compared the AI craze to the Gold Rush: though lenders aren’t out there digging for treasure, they can provide the “picks and shovels” that technology firms need. “In this case, it takes the modern version, the data centers,” he said during a conference call on July 31. “And we are the best placed firm to help develop and to help fund those data centers.” --With assistance from Laura Benitez and Kurt Wagner.

Title: Meta reportedly acquires voice AI startup WaveForms
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/08/08/meta-reportedly-acquires-voice-ai-startup-waveforms/
Time Published: 2025-08-08T19:18:59Z

UPDATED 15:18 EDT / AUGUST 08 2025 by Maria Deutscher Meta Platforms Inc. has reportedly acquired WaveForms AI Inc., a developer of artificial intelligence models optimized to understand speech. The Information broke the news on Thursday. It’s unclear how much Meta is paying for WaveForms. Last December, the startup raised $40 million at a $200 million valuation, which suggests the sale price was in the hundreds of millions of dollars. In recent months, Meta and other tech giants have paid significant premiums to recruit the staff of venture-backed AI startups. WaveForms was founded in 2024 by Alexis Conneau and Coralie Lemaitre. Conneau is a former OpenAI researcher who worked on GPT-4’s Voice Mode feature, which allows users to interact with the model using their voice. Lemaitre is a former Google LLC ad strategist. When WaveForms announced its $40 million funding round last year, Bloomberg reported that the company didn’t yet have a product. A blog post from investor Andreessen Horowitz, which led the round, stated that WaveForms was in the process of training an “end-to-end audio language model.” Processing speech historically required three different AI models. One transcribes the user’s speech into a text prompt, another generates a text-based response to the prompt and a third turns the response into speech. The Andreessen Horowitz blog post indicated that WaveForms’ technology allows one model to perform all three tasks, a potentially more efficient approach. The company also planned to equip its model with the ability to detect emotional cues in speech. The goal was to have the model adapt its output based on those cues. According to The Information, Conneau and Lemaitre have joined Meta as part of the acquisition. It’s unclear whether they will work at TBD Labs, the business unit that is leading the Facebook parent’s AI research efforts. The Wall Street Journal reported today that the unit is staffed by many of the researchers Meta has poached from OpenAI and Google in recent weeks. WaveForms is the second voice AI startup that Meta has acquired in the past month. It previously bought Play AI Inc., which developed a platform that can create voice AI agents for tasks such as processing customer support requests. The company raised $21 million prior to its sale. Meta reportedly told staffers in a memo that Play AI will help enhance its Meta AI chatbot’s voice features. Like ChatGPT, the chatbot provides support for voice commands. Additionally, Meta is developing a feature that allows Meta AI to translate speech in Instagram Reels videos. The WaveForms acquisition may also be part of the effort to improve the chatbot. Additionally, the technology and know-how that Meta is gaining through the deal may help enhance its Llama large language model series. Many of the algorithms in the lineup can process voice input. According to today’s Journal report, TBD Labs is working on a new Llama model known as Llama 4.5 and Llama 4.X internally. The research group is said to be focused on making Meta’s LLMs better at reasoning tasks. It’s unclear when the upcoming Llama model might launch or if it will be available under an open-source license like its predecessors.

AST SpaceMobile’s attempt to justify its use of the amateur radio band for its satellites has done little to assuage concerns from the ham radio community. “AST is again economical with the truth,” an amateur radio operator in Germany named Mario Lorenz wrote to the FCC on Friday. AST SpaceMobile wants to use the 430 to 440MHz bands outside the US to control and track its constellation of 248 satellites, which promise to beam cellular connectivity to smartphones across the globe. However, these bands have long been allocated to amateur radio operations, raising fears that AST’s operations will create widespread interference. On Tuesday, Texas-based AST defended using the radio band, telling the FCC that any radio interference should be minimal. It would use the 430 to 440MHz band for "very limited, non-routine" use, such as for “emergency operations when other frequency bands are unavailable." However, the amateur radio community says AST is already using those bands. On Friday, AMSAT-Deutschland sent a letter to the FCC that says amateur radio users have detected signals from AST’s satellites over the radio bands. “The claim is therefore either a misrepresentation or a deliberate falsehood,” AMSAT-Deutschland wrote. In particular, AST’s BlueWalker-3 satellite was spotted using the radio band up until July 23 as the amateur radio community began campaigning against the spectrum use. Ironically, AMSAT-Deutschland operates as a group devoted to the advancement of satellite communications, along with amateur radio satellites. In the letter, the group even noted: “We applaud AST SpaceMobile’s ambitious goals. However, innovation must not come at the expense of internationally recognized and community-supported amateur radio services.” AMSAT-Deutschland also tells PCMag the clash with AST has hit a nerve with the amateur radio community over concerns it could “set a precedent” if the FCC greenlights the company’s use of the 430 to 440MHz bands for satellite control. In addition, the group is worried that the FCC is “effectively shifting the resulting interference risks to other countries.” “If similar authorizations are granted to other commercial operators, the 430-440 MHz band could gradually become unusable for amateur radio. What is framed as ‘exceptional use’ today risks becoming the norm tomorrow — to the detriment of a long-standing and diverse community of amateur radio users,” the group said. “It also raises questions about AST’s technical maturity,” the group added. “Other large-scale satellite operators — such as SpaceX, with over 6,000 Starlink satellites in orbit — appear to manage TT&C (Telemetry, Tracking, and Command) functions without resorting to use of the amateur UHF band.” AST didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But the company submitted a third-party analysis to the FCC that claims to show the risk of interference to be “extremely unlikely” to amateur radio operations. However, Mario Lorenz, the amateur radio user who helped kick off the protest campaign, told the FCC on Friday that the third-party analysis was flawed. “Yet again, AST tries to get away with handing in only half the homework it was supposed to do,” Lorenz wrote. “Despite its title, the study addresses only a single scenario of interference in the AMATEUR RADIO SATELLITE service," not amateur radio use on the ground. The Bulgarian Federation of Radio Amateurs also told the FCC last month: “Even slight interference under these operating conditions can result in harmful interference as defined in (FCC regulations) 47 CFR §2.1, disrupting communications, damaging experimental data integrity, and jeopardizing control of amateur satellites.” PCMag.com is a leading authority on technology, delivering lab-based, independent reviews of the latest products and services.

Title: Apple's 'BlackBerry Moment'

Do you remember the BlackBerry? If you're younger than 30, you probably think I'm talking about the fruit. Nope. The BlackBerry was by far the most popular smartphone 20 years ago. Back in the mid-2000s, everyone used and loved its QWERTY keyboard and the ability to get emails instantly. Gasp! They were actually really cool. I loved mine, and I was late to trade it for a new device called the Apple iPhone. You may have heard of this one! BlackBerry was among the most valuable companies in the world and the pride of Canada, where it was founded. The stock peaked at more than $140 in May 2008, then plunged as consumers adopted the iPhone en masse over the ensuing years. BlackBerry shares trade at about $3.65 these days. That's epic value destruction of more than 97%. What went so wrong? BlackBerry had an amazingly profitable existing business. Competing with Apple would have meant throwing away this formula for success and probably cratering revenue and income. It's very hard for a public company to pivot radically like this. Shareholders don't like it — they want steadily growing income, not wild swings and big risky bets. So, BlackBerry stuck to its guns for a few years, and by the time it had to change, it was too late: Everyone was already addicted to their iPhones, not their "CrackBerries" (as BlackBerries used to be called). Apple won the mobile revolution, hands down. Its stock has risen more than 3,000% since May 2008, and is now worth $3.33 trillion. A new tech revolution has begun, though. Generative artificial intelligence is remaking the industry in radical ways, and there's concern among some on Wall Street that Apple could be facing its own "BlackBerry Moment" now. This catchy phrase was in the title of a new research note on Friday by Dan Ives, a tech analyst at Wedbush Securities. In a striking departure from his typically bullish tone, Ives issued a stark warning to Apple: Move aggressively into AI or risk becoming the next BlackBerry. While rivals such as OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon surge ahead in AI innovation, Ives said Apple is "on a park bench drinking lemonade," watching, rather than getting in the race. With 2.4 billion iOS devices and 1.5 billion iPhones in circulation, the company holds an unparalleled platform, but it risks squandering that lead without a bold AI play, Ives wrote. The analyst outlined three strategic imperatives for Apple to avoid a BlackBerry moment: When Apple fanboys get upset at their beloved company, it's time to pay close attention. The message is clear: Cupertino must stop watching the AI party from afar and start leading it. (I asked Apple for comment on all this on Friday. It didn't respond.)

Title: Stocks just broke through a key level that indicates a sell-off. Here's how much the S&P 500 will fall before you should buy, according to one strategist
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-outlook-technical-analysis-sp500-resistance-level-broken-2025-8
Time Published: 2025-08-08T16:38:05Z

The stock market flashed a key technical signal that suggests a pullback from all-time highs is on the way. That's according to Jonathan Krinsky, the managing director and chief market technician at BTIG, who thinks the S&P 500 is bound for a 5% pullback soon. The benchmark index just broke through a technical resistance level that suggests a retrenchment is likely, he said, speculating the index could fall to around 6,100 before investors have the opportunity to buy. The S&P 500 saw technical resistance, a price ceiling where sellers are likely to step in and cause a pullback, at around the 6,100 mark in late January, Krinsky said. That was several months before Trump announced his tariffs and drove a steep decline in equities. The index then dropped around 20% from its February peak through the sell-off in early April, before breaking past the key 6,100 level again in late June. "Typically, when you break through resistance, you do get a check back to kind of retest that support. And so we do think that's coming, into this August, September period," Krinsky said, speaking to CNBC this week. "We think you'll get an opportunity to buy around 6,100." There are a few signs that suggest that the stock market is looking vulnerable to a correction, Krinsky added. Here are some of the warning signs he sees: Krinsky pointed to potential vulnerabilities in consumer-facing sectors, like retail and transportation. The consumer discretionary sector of the S&P 500, for instance, has been among the worst-performing areas of the market so far this year. Consumer discretionary stocks in the S&P 500 are down 0.43% since January, one of the only areas of the broader index in the red this year. Other market pros have said they're eyeing weakness in consumer stocks, pointing to the impact of tariffs on inflation and consumer spending. "You're seeing some cracks under the surface," Krinsky said. Historically, semiconductor stocks have lagged behind software stocks in the late summer, Krinsky said, adding that he believed many names in the semiconductor space also looked vulnerable to him. Some chipmakers' second-quarter earnings have been weaker than expected. Advanced Micro Devices missed slightly on earnings estimates for the quarter, while Super Micro Computer missed slightly on earnings and revenue. "August tends to favor software over semis," Krinsky said, though he noted that Nvidia's earnings report, which is coming up at the end of the month, will remain a key influence over the sector's performance. Credit spreads, which are the difference between the yield demanded by investors to hold corporate bonds versus safer debt like US Treasurys, have remained tight this year. For markets, that's a good sign, as wider credit spreads mean investors think there's a higher risk to holding corporate debt over government bonds, and are demanding a higher yield. The ICE Bank of America US High Yield Index Option-Adjusted Spread hovered near 2.95% in the last week, near a historic low. But credit spreads could start to widen, which could be negative for equities, Krinsky said. He pointed to weak manufacturing employment data, which tends to be associated with wider credit spreads. "If we think that credit spreads are about as tight as they can get, they probably have a little bit of room to move wider. That also suggests some risk in the cyclical versus defensive trade," he added. Microsoft and Meta, two of the largest tech titans in the AI trade, reported "blowout" earnings for the second quarter, Krinsky said. But besides both stocks surging after reporting their results, investors haven't been buying more shares, he added. "We haven't seen buying enthusiasm post the print," Krinsky said. "That's the risk. We kind of got as good as it gets from some of those mega-cap earnings, and we just see a little bit of profit taking into the back half of the summer." Jump to

Title: Ken Paxton Took Victory Lap Suing Woke ‘Cartel’ He Quietly Invests Fortune In

Time Published: 2025-08-08T16:37:26Z

Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is taking a victory lap for spearheading a multi-state lawsuit taking on the world’s largest asset managers, but is quietly sitting upon thousands of shares of mutual funds managed by one of the targets of his complaint, according to recent financial disclosures. Paxton cheered a Texas judge’s ruling on Aug. 1 denying a petition from the investment juggernauts — BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard — to dismiss a lawsuit brought by the attorney general and ten other Republican states. Though Paxton had then cast Vanguard as part of an “investment cartel” who works to “squeeze more money out of everyday Americans,” his holdings in five Vanguard mutual funds have largely flown under the radar. (RELATED: Trump Admin Backs Red States’ Antitrust Suit Against Financial Titans To ‘Protect Coal’) “I just secured a major win against Blackrock, Vanguard, and State Street,” Paxton wrote in an Aug. 1 post to the social media platform X — after a judge green-lit his antitrust lawsuit, arguing the money managers illegally conspired to slash coal production under the guise of a left-wing climate agenda. “These financial corporations created an investment cartel to illegally control national energy markets, and today’s victory represents an important step in holding them accountable.” Paxton is running to unseat Republican Texas Sen. John Cornyn in a primary contest that is shaping up to be one of the most brutal races of the midterms. Though Paxton has taken an early lead in polling, Cornyn — with the backing of Senate Republicans’ campaign arm and several outside spending groups — is mounting a concerted effort to close the gap. President Donald Trump, who said in April that he likes both candidates, has not yet issued an endorsement. The attorney general submitted a personal financial disclosure for his Senate run on June 16 — reporting thousands of shares in six Vanguard mutual funds valued between $1.6 million and $6.25 million. The amounts on financial disclosure forms are reported in ranges making Paxton’s net worth derived from the Vanguard shares difficult to pin down. Cornyn’s backers are criticizing Paxton’s investment holdings in Vanguard funds, noting the attorney general has repeatedly slammed the investment firm for allegedly bleeding Texans’ pocketbooks dry by illegally conspiring to drive up energy prices. “The fact that Paxton profits off the very practices he condemns shows he’s more interested in personal gain over principled leadership,” pro-Cornyn super PAC Texans for a Conservative Majority executive director Aaron Whitehead told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “If he truly believes this firm is hurting Texans why is he investing his personal money with them?” WASHINGTON, DC – AUGUST 01: Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) (L) and Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) speak in the hallway between votes at the U.S. Capitol on August 01, 2025 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) “You can always count on Crooked Ken Paxton to act unethically, dishonestly and selfishly, as he has done here. Texans can’t trust Ken Paxton, something he proves on a daily basis,” Cornyn campaign senior adviser Matt Mackowiak told the DCNF. Paxton’s investments in Vanguard, a pioneer of ultra-low cost investing, are a mixed bag of passively managed index funds and actively managed portfolios. He reported holding between 3,100 and 12,495 shares spread across five Vanguard mutual funds, according to a financial statement filed with the Texas Ethics Commission in June for the 2024 calendar year. Paxton has invested between $1 million and $5 million in Vanguard’s Institutional Index Fund (VIIIX), representing the largest investment holding on his Senate financial disclosure form. The low-cost index fund is passively managed by the firm and tracks the performance of the S&P 500 index, which seeks to mirror the performance of the nation’s largest stocks. The attorney general has also invested between $100,000 and $250,000 in Vanguard’s Primecap Fund (VPMCX), an actively managed “large-growth” fund offered by the firm, which touts outperforming the S&P 500 by an average of 2% annually. An additional Vanguard fund listed on Paxton’s disclosure is held by his wife, Texas State Senator Angela Paxton. She has invested between $50,000 and $100,000 in a Vanguard index fund that matches the performance of the overall stock market, according to Paxton’s Senate financial disclosure forms. Angela Paxton filed for divorce in July after 38 years of marriage, citing “biblical grounds.” Spokespersons for Paxton did not respond to the DCNF’s multiple requests for comment. “I will continue fighting to protect Texas and defend America’s energy independence from this unlawful conspiracy,” Paxton said regarding his lawsuit against Vanguard and other asset managers on Aug 1.

Ripple’s multi-year legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission reached a decisive conclusion this week, triggering a sharp rally in XRP’s price and trading volume. The settlement confirmed that Ripple’s past programmatic and institutional sales of XRP were lawful, removing a major source of uncertainty that had weighed on the token since the lawsuit began. Within hours of the news, XRP surged 5.21% to $3.22, while trading volume climbed 164.43%, signalling renewed confidence from both retail and institutional traders. Analysts say the ruling could reshape market perceptions of XRP and potentially pave the way for future institutional products tied to the asset. Pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan announced that the legal dispute over Ripple’s previous programmatic and institutional XRP sales has been resolved with the SEC. The clarification confirms that these sales were compliant under US law, establishing that XRP itself is not a security. This development follows years of litigation that placed XRP under intense regulatory scrutiny, with Ripple and its community consistently challenging the SEC’s stance. The resolution has been widely interpreted as a significant turning point for the asset, particularly in the United States market. Analysts note that the combination of legal clarity and increased liquidity could drive more institutional participation in the months ahead. The latest ruling has bolstered expectations that large financial institutions may reconsider their stance on XRP. Some market commentators have even suggested that asset management giant BlackRock could explore an XRP exchange-traded fund, a move that would broaden access to the token for mainstream investors. While no official ETF filing has been made, industry experts believe XRP’s regulatory clarity gives it a competitive advantage over other digital assets still facing classification uncertainty. This could help position XRP as a viable option for both cross-border payment solutions and investment products. The settlement has reignited debates between the XRP and Bitcoin communities. Bitcoin-only advocates have continued to brand altcoins as securities, with MicroStrategy chairman Michael Saylor repeatedly asserting that only Bitcoin qualifies as a commodity. Morgan pushed back against these claims, highlighting XRP’s performance since its launch, which he calculated as exceeding 50,000% growth. He also responded to recent criticism from Bitcoin maximalists such as Adam Livingston, who alleged that Ripple could use banks to offload XRP onto retail investors. Traders are now monitoring whether XRP can sustain its upward momentum. The recent surge, combined with the removal of legal uncertainty, has given the asset a stronger market position. However, the cryptocurrency landscape remains highly competitive, and community sentiment continues to influence market moves. If institutional interest materialises, analysts expect XRP could see further demand growth, especially if new investment products are introduced. The ruling may also spark fresh regulatory conversations around the status of other digital assets, potentially influencing the broader crypto market.

Title: What you need to know before investing in 2025: a guide to smart decisions in crypto market (experience guide)

Something unusual is happening in the crypto space before the next altcoin season. After a sharp correction in mid-August, momentum is once again shifting. We’ve been watching the cycles for years at global crypto news media. And based on what we’re seeing now, from politics, price patterns to presale activity to sentiment across the board, our specialists believe something is about to pop. It’s rare to see all the ingredients line up at once, but right now, we’re watching a setup that checks all the boxes. According to our team’s experience, this is the kind of setup that doesn’t come often and that every smart investor should consider… and when it does, it tends to leave a historical mark. Has 2025 delivered? Regulatory signals from US political figures like Donald Trump are turning crypto from speculation into strategy. The long-standing XRP vs. SEC case is finally tilting in XRP’s favor, with the token now appearing in official financial disclosures by companies like Flora Growth and Webus International. At the same time, pressure on Jerome Powell to cut interest rates is pushing liquidity back into the markets, reigniting appetite for risk-on assets like crypto. Ethereum is also finalizing critical Layer 2 updates, adding scalability and reducing costs, a major win for the altcoin space. As altcoin price prediction in 2025, one narrative keeps getting stronger: investors are no longer chasing hype only, they’re hunting real value. And tokens with utility, scalability, and story, according to our analysts, are the elements you need to know before investing. Elon Musk recently made waves again by updating his profile with a Pepe meme, reviving interest in frog-themed tokens. Michael Saylor continues to double down on Bitcoin, not as speculation, but as a financial reserve. These are not isolated events , they are public signals from people who shape markets. So the question is no longer “Is crypto here to stay?”. The better question might be: If you’re looking for the next potential breakout, the next story that holds together meme culture, utility, staking rewards, and a price so low it feels impossible , this is your moment to find it: The meme coin market reached a staggering $91 billion peak this July, igniting buzz about a potential meme supercycle. But here’s the twist: Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE), the two OG meme coins, may no longer be the names leading that charge. It’s not that they’ve failed , in fact, quite the opposite. They’ve become crypto’s version of blue-chip stocks: predictable, mainstream, and with most of their explosive upside behind them. Analysts still anticipate modest rallies , perhaps 2x to 5x , before the year’s end. But let’s be honest: you don’t buy Apple stock in 2025 expecting 100 x returns. Same logic applies here. The circulating supplies are massive. For investors seeking life-changing upside, the rocket ships have already left the launch pad. If you’re looking for the next Shiba, the next DOGE — the real underdog play — you need to find it where no one else is looking. Pepeto isn’t just another frog meme. It’s the spiritual reboot of PEPE, but this time, it comes with structure, substance, and real infrastructure to back it. The project has already attracted tens of thousands of holders, with over $5,860,439.25. At just $0.000000145, Pepeto is still in the stage SHIB and DOGE were when only insiders were watching and none of the investments guide were handed to smart investors. But not for long, this is our call: The token is about to list , and when it does, the price curve may never look back according to its utility and use case of the token. If it only hits the price of PEPE? That’s indeed over 100x potential. And it’s not just theory , here is why Pepeto has the elements to make it happen: If you’ve been waiting for the meme coin with real backbone, this is your moment. Pepeto isn’t just another frog-themed token riding hype, it’s a redemption play from one of the minds behind the original PEPE, built to correct what that project missed: value, infrastructure, and lasting potential. With a live demo exchange already shown to the public, staking that dwarf competitors with 252% rewards, and a presale price that’s still a fraction of a cent, Pepeto is entering the final presale hours before its price increase. The room for upside here isn’t just theoretical , it’s mathematically visible. Every cycle has its star: Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, PEPE. This time, it’s what’s early invetors call : the God Of Frogs – Pepeto. Ask yourself, how often do these chances come around? DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE all exploded because early believers took the leap. Now they’re the faces of a billion-dollar club. Pepeto stands at that same threshold , the kind of moment that only looks obvious in hindsight, or later in historical data. As crypto enters a meme supercycle, driven by regulatory momentum, ETH Layer 2 progress, altcoin rallies, and even Trump’s pro-crypto stance, Pepeto is positioned perfectly, not just to grow rapidly, but to stand still. If you missed SHIB at $0.00000001… you might not want to miss Pepeto now. To learn more about PEPETO, visit its website, Telegram, Instagram, and Twitter.

Title: These visa holders reveal a program that can transform lives — and quickly unravel them

Good morning. Still struggling to sell that Cybertruck? The US Air Force is looking to buy two to use as target practice. Don't worry, they need only be towable — they're blowing them up anyway. In today's big story, seven current and ex-employees at Google, Meta, Amazon, and more share the opportunities and anxieties of living on the H-1B visa. What's on deck: Markets: The US economy is inching toward a stagflation scenario — again. Tech: xAI's head lawyer is leaving the company to spend more time with his kids. Business: Trump is calling for Intel's CEO to resign. Crisis communications warned Intel to not stay quiet. But first, life on the H-1B visa. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. The H-1B visa is a gateway to the American dream — a chance for skilled immigrants to shape the future of US technology and innovation. That opportunity also comes with risk. One layoff and the clock starts ticking: 60 days to find a new employer, or leave the country. In any job market, that would be a daunting deadline. But in today's climate, where layoffs have swept the tech industry, it's a tight race against time. Some Americans can take solace in the hope that the market will rebound; for now, they're clinging to their desks. For H-1B holders, there's no waiting out the storm. No margin for error. 60 days, remember? Thanks to visa data from federal filings, we have a glimpse at what could be at stake financially: eye-popping salaries for top AI talent. Business Insider spoke to seven current or former H-1B recipients who moved from India and found work in Big Tech. Their stories, as told to BI, reveal a program that can transform lives — and quickly unravel them, too. "My life feels temporary in a lot of ways," said Surabhi Madan, a senior software engineer at Google. She said she faces challenges that her friends don't: "I'm anxious about making mistakes when I drive or file taxes. I don't volunteer because I'd have to contact my immigration lawyer to check that it wouldn't jeopardize anything." After six years at Twitter, Debpriya Seal was laid off and left with 60 days to find a new employer. "The market was tough. It was the last quarter of the year, when companies tend to slow hiring. I hoped I'd find a job in time, but I had to consider moving back to India. I started looking into selling my possessions on Facebook Marketplace." Debjit Saha, now the cofounder of a real estate startup in Buffalo, says the rules shape how he runs his own company. "As an H-1B holder, I have to be careful to only do the type of work outlined in my petition. Even though I'm the cofounder, I can't do things outside my remit as CTO, like marketing." Wendy's reports earnings. Hallam Bullock, senior editor, in London. Grace Lett, editor, in New York. Meghan Morris, bureau chief, in Singapore. Akin Oyedele, deputy editor, in New York.

Title: OpenAI debuts GPT-5 AI model, Trump calls for Intel CEO to resign, and IPOs keep popping

UPDATED 10:55 EDT / AUGUST 08 2025 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof AI continues to suck all the air and the dollars out of the room, with a flurry of new models and new fundings this week. It’s still a breakneck race in AI, as OpenAI, Anthropic and Google all released new models and agents. In particular, OpenAI debuted its GPT-5 flagship model, which combines the reasoning abilities of its o-series with the faster responses of its GPT series. CEO Sam Altman (pictured) played his best Steve Jobs imitation in the more than hourlong presentation, except for the lack of a turtleneck. You’re excused if you can’t keep up with all these models. OpenAI’s biggest challenge actually won’t be fellow foundation model makers but the likes of JPMorgan, whose data holds the real value for the future of AI — so explain Dave Vellante and George Gilbert in their latest Breaking Analysis. Investors don’t seem to be thinking that far ahead, though, as OpenAI’s reported talks on its latest stock sale carrying a $500 billion valuation for the company keep upping the need to execute perfectly to grow into it. Lots of cybersecurity companies took this week’s Black Hat USA conference as an opportunity to announce new products, including Palo Alto Networks, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Microsoft, and SentinelOne chose this week to announce it’s buying Prompt Security. Overall, though, AI was the key theme, as researchers and companies gear up efforts to use AI to battle AI-driven attacks. Apple sucked up to Trump again and promised to invest an additional $100 billion into U.S. manufacturing. Fine as far as it goes (though that solid gold plaque presented to Trump seems wildly over the top, no?), but if you believe Trump when he says U.S. chipmaking will return soon and Apple will make the iPhone with all-American parts, well, I’ve got some 100% tariffs to sell you. And what’s with Trump’s demand that Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan step down? Just Trump being Trump, I guess? Tan says he’s “engaging” with Trump, so maybe this will blow over. It’s not as if Tan doesn’t have a few other things to deal with. The drumbeat of initial public offerings continued this week with Firefly Aerospace debuting with a 34% pop over its initial offering price. Cryptocurrency exchange Bullish also filed. It was a decidedly mixed bag for enterprise tech earnings this week, as Palantir, Digital Ocean, Arista, Extreme Networks and others outperformed, but AMD, Supermicro, Kyndryl and others disappointed. Next week’s earnings include Cisco, CoreWeave and Applied Materials. Here’s all the news and analysis in enterprise and emerging tech from SiliconANGLE, theCUBE Research and beyond: How Jamie Dimon becomes Sam Altman’s biggest competitor The era of physical AI is at hand, says Zeus Kerravala: Nvidia: Let’s get physical with AI Tsk tsk: Cloudflare says Perplexity is using stealth, undeclared crawlers to evade website no-crawl directives OpenAI reportedly in talks

Title: Amazon Stock To $100?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Despite considerable growth in both revenue and profits, Amazon’s stock (NASDAQ: AMZN) performance has raised concerns among investors due to a mix of slowing growth in its vital cloud division, fierce competition in artificial intelligence (AI), a high valuation, and overarching economic pressures. Over the past four years, Amazon has increased its revenue by $200 billion and $37 billion in net profit, with profits rising by 112% thanks to improving margins. However, during the same timeframe, its stock has only seen a 33% increase, and its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has dropped by 34%. In 2021, Amazon’s valuation multiple stood at 51 times earnings, signaling high expectations for future growth. Now, with a reduced multiple of 34x trailing earnings, investors are questioning whether this valuation remains justified, particularly as growth expectations are being moderated. Now, we also have a contrasting scenario on Amazon Stock: Path To 2x Growth. Indeed, we believe that this wide range of upside and downside possibilities underscores a fundamental reality: AMZN is a volatile stock. That being said, if you are looking for upside with less volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative — it has outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its launch. Additionally, see – The Trade Desk: Buy TTD Stock Now At $60? A variety of factors contribute to investor anxiety, presenting potential obstacles for Amazon’s stock. AWS has traditionally been Amazon’s main source of profit, with estimated adjusted EBITDA margins around 45%, compared to 15% for its North American operations and 11% for its international businesses. Any slowdown in this segment greatly influences the company's overall profitability and investor confidence. While Amazon’s Q2 AWS growth of 18% topped analyst projections, it lagged behind the growth rates of its primary rivals, Microsoft Azure (39%) and Google Cloud (32%). This gap is a significant reason for the stock's recent slump, as investors fear that AWS is losing its competitive edge in the key cloud market. Even a notable partnership with OpenAI has not fully alleviated these worries. The surge in AI has heightened demand for cloud services, yet some view Amazon as falling behind its competitors. Rivals like Microsoft and Google offer highly integrated AI solutions (like GPT and Gemini, respectively), which are often simpler for customers to adopt. Conversely, AWS’s approach frequently necessitates greater technical expertise from developers to combine various services. Wider economic factors present additional threats for Amazon: Amazon’s stock has shown volatility during previous market downturns, sometimes performing worse than the S&P 500 index. The substantial 55% drawdown in 2022 indicates that a significant drop from current levels is not unusual. This history of volatility, combined with a high stock price, leads to cautious investor sentiment. See – Buy or Sell AMZN Stock – for more details. To summarize, it also does not aid that AMZN stock remains expensive; it trades at nearly 34x trailing earnings. Certainly, the company’s revenue has increased significantly over recent years, growing at an average rate of about 11% over the last three years (compared to 5% for the S&P 500). However, this growth might diminish rapidly if the economy worsens and if the company fails to adequately seize its share of the AI cloud market. At existing multiples, even slight disappointments could prompt a disproportionate correction in the stock, as demonstrated by its performance following its positive Q2 results. The high valuation of AMZN stock could restrict its upside potential in the near to medium term. Alternatively, the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices), delivering strong returns for investors. Why is this the case? The quarterly rebalanced combination of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks has provided a responsive means to capitalize on favorable market conditions while limiting losses during downturns, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: On Independence Day, Foreign Agribusiness Will Be Told Get Out, “Quit India!”

Editor Solutions Colin Todhunter, OffGuardian On 15 August, India will celebrate its Independence Day. There will be the usual celebratory flag-waving and flypasts in Delhi along with sound bites about ‘the world’s biggest democracy’. But what has ‘independence’ come to mean? Placing an X on a ballot paper every now and then does not constitute democracy. If people are misinformed, misled and manipulated to think and act in a certain way, while backroom deals are carried out without their knowledge, then what value ‘democracy’? Then there is no freedom, no self-determination. Someone else is determining the agenda. The Quit India Movement was launched by Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian National Congress on 8 August 1942, demanding the immediate end of British rule in India. It inspired a mass civil disobedience campaign featuring strikes, demonstrations and sabotage, despite the British arresting Gandhi and many Congress leaders immediately after the movement’s start. The movement saw remarkable nationwide participation—including women, students, workers and peasants. Although it was violently suppressed by the colonial authorities, it galvanised the struggle for independence. The Quit India Movement significantly weakened British authority, promoted unity among diverse groups and set the stage for India’s eventual independence. Now, in 2025, the spirit of the Quit India Movement is being explicitly invoked by today’s farmer protests to inspire unity, resilience and a nationwide call to action. The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM)—a coalition of 40-plus farmers’ unions across India—is at the forefront of a continuing struggle against government policies that are eroding rural livelihoods, national sovereignty and federal governance. Their concerns centre on an emerging authoritarian central government controlled by corporate interests and international finance capital, which threatens to subordinate the role of India’s states and dismantle vital protections for farmers and rural communities. SKM, alongside allied organisations such as the All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS), argues that the Union Government’s push for agricultural reforms under slogans like ‘One Nation, One Market’ jeopardises the constitutional federal structure. These reforms—including the draft National Policy Framework on Agriculture Marketing (NPFAM)—seek to unify India’s disparate agricultural marketing systems into a centralised, corporatised national market. According to the SKM, this transformation will severely diminishe the decision-making power of state governments over agriculture, land, industry and markets—domains constitutionally assigned to them. The NPFAM draft envisions a rescaling of agricultural marketing, replacing state-regulated wholesale markets (mandis) and rural haats with private, corporate-controlled entities integrated via Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) and blockchain technologies. Under this model, powerful private corporations, including conglomerates like Adani, Ambani, Tata, Cargill, Pepsi, Walmart, Bayer and Amazon, would engage directly with farmers, bypassing traditional state-regulated market structures. The consolidation of storage facilities and marketing channels under corporate control raises fears of price manipulation and diminishes farmers’ negotiating power. This change will essentially fundamentally restructure India’s agri-food sector and is aimed at integrating it deeply into global supply chains controlled by agribusiness and international finance capital. This is little more than a neocolonial strategy that would hand over India’s food security and agricultural governance to transnational corporations. In 2025, farmers are still protesting. The roots of the protests can be traced back to the three farm laws introduced and subsequently repealed in late 2021 following widespread protests. The SKM and the AIKS warn that the NPFAM is effectively a rebranded return of those laws, seeking to achieve their objectives through new policy frameworks. Key elements of the NPFAM echo the earlier laws’ intent to deregulate markets, permit private agribusiness entry and promote contract farming under conditions favourable to corporate interests. The absence of legislative guarantees for a legal Minimum Support Price (MSP) for agricultural produce and minimum wages for agricultural workers remains a still-unaddressed primary concern, as is the lack of accountability mechanisms to regulate corporate practices. Farmers face the prospect of becoming mere producers of raw materials for corporate supply chains, with prices dictated by powerful processing industries and exporters. The AIKS stresses that central government proposals, including deepening financialisation via futures and options markets, will enable global corporations and financial firms to assert dominance over the food industry, intensifying farmers’ economic vulnerabilities. The critique extends to dismantling of India’s longstanding food security frameworks: Facilitating corporate interests, the government seeks the withdrawal of state involvement in these key institutions, exposing India to volatile international markets controlled by global agribusiness, thereby undermining food sovereignty and rural welfare. In response to this proposed neoliberal shock therapy, the SKM has launched a series of coordinated protests to press their demands and safeguard farmers’ rights. On ‘Quit India” Day on 13 August, symbolically invoking the historic Quit India Movement, farmers nationwide will conduct vehicle and tractor parades, public demonstrations and the burning of effigies representing Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This protest specifically targets proposed Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) — particularly with the US — fearing they will exacerbate corporate dominance and market flooding with (GMO) cheap imports. The date, 13 August, comes two days before Independence Day celebrations. Something that may appear increasingly hollow as time marches on and we see the recolonisation of India’s economy by foreign interests. From 15 August, the campaign will include public hearings, grassroots mobilisation and awareness drives culminating in a large-scale worker-farmer protest action in Delhi and various state capitals on 26 November, marking five years since the historic farmers’ protests at Delhi’s borders. The movement’s core demands include a constitutionally or legally enforced MSP aligned with recommendations from the Swaminathan Commission, ensuring farmers receive at least 50% above the cost of production, loan waivers and financial relief tailored for farmers. Farmers also want the withdrawal of bans on using 10-year-old tractors in the National Capital Region (NCR), the restoration of fertiliser subsidies, regulation of spurious agricultural inputs. Stronger state infrastructure to maintain food security is called for along with support for small-scale producers and meaningful dialogue involving farmer organisations and state governments. Many of the key demands are long standing, but official responses to the protests and farmers’ demands have sometimes involved tear gas, water cannons and other harsh measures, reflecting attempts to suppress dissent and reassure international investors of a stable climate for foreign direct investment. In late 2021, SKM leader Rakesh Tikait noted that around 750 protesters had died in the prolonged struggle. Various officials have been recorded endorsing harsh crackdowns on demonstrators, further fuelling resentment and mistrust. This marks a broader trend of state suppression intended to clear the path for a corporate-financial takeover of the agricultural domain. The SKM and the AIKS protests and demands are well-founded. In India, as elsewhere, we are seeing the erosion of traditional diets and farming practices, resulting in an increasing reliance on ultra-processed foods and global corporate supply chains. Moreover, underinvestment in rural infrastructure and agriculture over decades has been deliberate, portraying Indian farming as backward and ripe for ‘modernisation’ that privileges corporate profit over food sovereignty. The commodification and financialisation of food and agricultural land will serve to further embed corporate influence at all levels, from seed to store (or, increasingly, e-commerce platform), paralleling a global pattern of food insecurity and corporate dominance. This corporate hijack is not unique to India. In late 2024, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer met with Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, and expressed enthusiasm for partnering with the global investment firm. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds, in a letter, warmly welcomed this collaboration, stating that Labour looks forward to working with BlackRock to “change the face of our UK”. But what kind of “change” is being envisioned? It appears to involve making life increasingly difficult for farmers, especially through inheritance tax policies designed to push them off their land. This would pave the way for BlackRock to acquire farmland that is treated simply as an ‘asset class’, leading to industrial-scale agriculture and subsidy-driven green investments that could see vast expanses of countryside covered by solar panels. Given BlackRock’s global ambitions, Larry Fink is likely eager to replicate this strategy in India, especially as the country’s government advances development of a land market catering to international finance interests. India stands at a crossroads. The 2025 protest campaign reflects deeper battles over food sovereignty, federalism, rural livelihoods and the democratic rights of citizens. The struggle is not merely against specific trade deals or policies but against an overarching neoliberal agenda that threatens to fully disempower farmers and reshape India’s agricultural landscape to suit global capital at the expense of millions.

Title: The Real Cost of DEI Rollbacks in Customer Experience Strategy

CMSWire's Marketing & Customer Experience Leadership channel is the go-to hub for actionable research, editorial and opinion for CMOs, aspiring CMOs and today's customer experience innovators. Our dedicated editorial and research teams focus on bringing you the data and information you need to navigate today's complex customer, organizational and technical landscapes. We've got you covered. Our society finds itself at a critical juncture, particularly within the realm of marketing and customer experience. The nationwide boycott of McDonld's and Walmart—planned for August by The People's Union USA over the company's rollback of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives—exemplifies the complex challenges facing CMOs today. While DEI initiatives have demonstrably enhanced consumer relationships and internal operations, a growing wave of corporate rollbacks presents a complex paradox for marketing leaders. The challenge for IT and marketing leaders today is to understand not only the intrinsic value of DEI but also the tangible costs of its abandonment, and how to proactively champion inclusive practices amidst political and social pressures. And here in August, on National Black Business Month, there is no better time to foster this dialogue and help chief marketing officers develop some action steps amid rising political division and pressure on corporations to pull back. CMOs and CX leaders have a critical opportunity to lead with intention—making diversity and inclusion a core strategy for long-term growth and brand credibility. DEI initiatives are not merely social endeavors; they are powerful strategic tools that bolster the authenticity of customer experiences. A commitment to DEI creates a better understanding of customers, enabling businesses to empathize with and serve a diverse customer base effectively. This leads to more personalized service and stronger customer relationships, ultimately improving customer retention. A diverse customer experience team can also translate into better access to new markets, helping companies reach previously misunderstood areas. Inclusive strategies do more than drive social value — they deliver measurable impact across customer relationships, loyalty and retention. Beyond understanding, DEI enhances marketing effectiveness and customer trust. When marketing teams reflect diverse perspectives, they create campaigns that resonate authentically with varied customer segments rather than relying on generic messaging. This inclusive approach helps brands develop community-focused marketing that highlights genuine investment in local services and diverse suppliers. A diverse and inclusive workforce provides multiple perspectives on marketing campaigns, helping brands avoid distasteful messages that could make audiences feel excluded or mocked. Related Article: Building Customer Trust — Statistics in the US for 2025 DEI also reduces language barriers in customer service. Many companies in the U.S. primarily offer English support, excluding millions of potential customers. A diverse and inclusive workforce, including bilingual contact centers, allows customers to speak their native language, boosting retention and customer relationships by creating ease and streamlining the experience. Finally, a diverse and inclusive work environment offers additional opportunities for CX innovation. When staff feel appreciated and empowered, they bring a wider range of unique insights and perspectives to the table, leading to more innovative and effective services for customers. This diverse input makes problem-solving and brainstorming quicker and more effective, helping organizations stay ahead in providing personalized customer experiences. Despite these clear benefits, many major companies and organizations have recently scaled back, renamed, or eliminated their DEI programs. President Donald Trump signed two executive orders this year — Executive Orders 14151 and 14173, on Jan. 20 and Jan. 21, respectively — that eliminated DEI programs within government agencies and contractor projects. This created an antagonistic environment, forcing corporations and universities to adjust or eliminate long-standing programs in an appeasement effort. But as companies altered their programs, they found that those decisions carry significant financial and reputational risks for brands, as Target's recent experience starkly demonstrates. Boycotts can be effective for social change, such as the 1960 Greensboro sit-ins during the Civil Rights era, where students refused to leave a Woolworth lunch counter in Greensboro, NC. Yet only recently have boycotts proven to be influential on the consumer’s decision to purchase. The internet era, which has allowed consumers to interact with retailers and brands more frequently, has altered how messaging is managed, especially for brands built on inclusion. When companies pull back on DEI, they risk alienating a significant portion of their consumer base. A 2022 Harris report commissioned by Google found that 82% of consumers “would prefer a consumer brand’s values to align with their own”. Another 75% of respondents reported parting ways with a brand over a conflict in values. This reflects a personal connection consumers have to brands, with a shifting number of people seeing themselves directly affected and taking action based on their identity and support for causes. Related Article: Double up on DEI: The Real Impact on Customer Experience Recent data highlights the financial and reputational damage that can result when brands pull back from diversity and inclusion efforts. Target's experience serves as a cautionary tale: the company missed analyst sales expectations by nearly half a billion dollars in Q1 2025, with net sales falling nearly 3% to $23.8 billion, down from $24.5 billion in Q1 2024. Foot traffic declined 5.7% year-over-year, and for 10 consecutive weeks following its DEI rollback announcement, Target experienced declining store traffic, down 9% year-over-year in February and 6.5% in March. The company's stock plummeted 12%, erasing billions in market value, while Target revised its sales projections downward, now expecting a "low single-digit decline" for fiscal 2025 instead of the previously forecast 1% growth. In contrast, Costco, which publicly defended and maintained its DEI commitments, saw its foot traffic rise 7% year-over-year during the same period. McDonald's now faces similar pressure, with The People's Union USA organizing a week-long boycott claiming the fast food giant went back on its promised investment in diversity initiatives. McDonald’s representatives acknowledge a change in some initiatives, including a supplier program. But they claim the changes will not minimize their commitment. The damage from DEI rollbacks extends beyond immediate sales figures. It results in eroding trust, diminished brand perception, and a weakening of emotional loyalty and long-term equity. As Valeria Piaggio, global head of sustainable growth and transformation at Kantar, notes in a Mediapost article on the rollbacks, marketers want to be "loved, trusted and believed in," and this emotional connection, which drives value, is "at risk." For brands like Target that spent years building a purpose-driven identity centered on inclusion, walking back these commitments "breaks the brand narrative" and "the consumer contract," causing the emotional foundation of the relationship to collapse. This volatility means even a "fringe boycott" can cause "outsized reputational harm." Moreover, CMOs must recognize the immense purchasing power of diverse consumer segments. Black consumers, according to Nielsen in its latest report, have an annual purchasing power expected to reach $2 trillion by 2026, up from $1.7 trillion in 2024. Organizations like the NAACP are responding to DEI cuts by empowering Black consumers to be intentional about where they spend their money, launching initiatives like the Black Consumer Advisory to highlight companies that promote diversity. According to eMarketer, a February Harris Poll cited by Axios revealed that 50% of Black consumers have recently stopped shopping at companies with differing political views, the highest among all demographics surveyed. Deprioritizing diversity can leave "significant growth on the table," doing a "disservice to shareholders." In an age characterized by political polarization and corporate appeasement, CMOs have a golden opportunity to proactively embrace actions that reinforce diversity and inclusion as a strategic imperative for sustained growth and brand integrity. The most effective way to understand a diverse customer base is to have a diverse team that reflects their backgrounds and experiences. CMOs should prioritize hiring individuals across all ethnicities, races, ages, abilities, religions, cultures, genders and sexual orientations. This diversity provides invaluable insights, leading to more personalized service and expanding access to new markets. Customers increasingly align with brands whose values resonate with their own. CMOs must ensure that their teams understand multiple perspectives, avoiding ad messaging that could be offensive. This commitment demonstrates genuine awareness and alignment with consumer priorities like community service and equity. Customers reward that commitment with their customer loyalty. E.l.f. Beauty, for instance, has leveraged its diverse employee base and loyal following of younger, diverse customers, featuring transgender and non-binary models. According to Black Enterprise, E.l.f. Beauty has seen its stock price increase by over 700% since 2020, building a loyal young customer base that trusts the brand. A significant portion of the population prefers customer service in their native language. CMOs should advocate for multilingual support in contact centers and digital channels, allowing customers to feel at ease and streamlining their experience. This proactive step not only boosts customer retention and relationships but also captures a broader market segment that may otherwise seek out competitors offering such support. DEI is about recognizing and valuing the unique experiences each individual brings. CMOs should cultivate a culture where all team members feel appreciated and empowered to share their thoughts and unique ideas. This inclusion leads to a wider range of insights, making problem-solving and brainstorming for customer experience initiatives quicker and more effective, ensuring the brand stays ahead of the curve. As data increasingly represents customer interactions from personalized recommendations to AI-generated models, CMOs must ensure that data modeling technologies apply ethical standards so that inclusion efforts do not begin to operate with the systematic approaches that were used for exclusion. One way is to advocate for "human-in-the-loop" protocols with AI. The protocol is valuable when AI is used to generate visual imagery. One example is the fashion models of various body types, ages, sizes and skin tones that Levi's is doing with Lalaland.ai. It is crucial that algorithms and datasets do not craft visualizations of people with negative social biases. Brands must ensure the design and deployment of algorithm-based systems avoid discriminatory outcomes. The current environment, marked by both a strong consumer preference for inclusive brands and political pressure against DEI, presents a unique challenge for CMOs. However, by understanding the proven benefits of DEI for CX, recognizing the costs of retreat and proactively implementing strategies that embrace diversity, CMOs can not only protect but also enhance their brand's perception, loyalty and long-term financial health. The true business risk lies not in maintaining DEI values but in retreating from them. Even a brand’s perceived retreat from ethics in the eyes of its customers leaves significant future opportunities for building customer trust and fostering great customer experiences on the table.

The nationwide boycott of McDonld's and Walmart—planned for August by The People's Union USA over the company's rollback of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives—exemplifies the complex challenges facing CMOs today. While DEI initiatives have demonstrably enhanced consumer relationships and internal operations, a growing wave of corporate rollbacks presents a complex paradox for marketing leaders. The challenge for IT and marketing leaders today is to understand not only the intrinsic value of DEI but also the tangible costs of its abandonment, and how to proactively champion inclusive practices amidst political and social pressures. And here in August, on National Black Business Month, there is no better time to foster this dialogue and help chief marketing officers develop some action steps amid rising political division and pressure on corporations to pull back. CMOs and CX leaders have a critical opportunity to lead with intention—making diversity and inclusion a core strategy for long-term growth and brand credibility. DEI initiatives are not merely social endeavors; they are powerful strategic tools that bolster the authenticity of customer experiences. A commitment to DEI creates a better understanding of customers, enabling businesses to empathize with and serve a diverse customer base effectively. This leads to more personalized service and stronger customer relationships, ultimately improving customer retention. A diverse customer experience team can also translate into better access to new markets, helping companies reach previously misunderstood areas. Inclusive strategies do more than drive social value — they deliver measurable impact across customer relationships, loyalty and retention. Beyond understanding, DEI enhances marketing effectiveness and customer trust. When marketing teams reflect diverse perspectives, they create campaigns that resonate authentically with varied customer segments rather than relying on generic messaging. This inclusive approach helps brands develop community-focused marketing that highlights genuine investment in local services and diverse suppliers. A diverse and inclusive workforce provides multiple perspectives on marketing campaigns, helping brands avoid distasteful messages that could make audiences feel excluded or mocked. Related Article: Building Customer Trust — Statistics in the US for 2025 DEI also reduces language barriers in customer service. Many companies in the U.S. primarily offer English support, excluding millions of potential customers. A diverse and inclusive workforce, including bilingual contact centers, allows customers to speak their native language, boosting retention and customer relationships by creating ease and streamlining the experience. Finally, a diverse and inclusive work environment offers additional opportunities for CX innovation. When staff feel appreciated and empowered, they bring a wider range of unique insights and perspectives to the table, leading to more innovative and effective services for customers. This diverse input makes problem-solving and brainstorming quicker and more effective, helping organizations stay ahead in providing personalized customer experiences. Despite these clear benefits, many major companies and organizations have recently scaled back, renamed, or eliminated their DEI programs. President Donald Trump signed two executive orders this year — Executive Orders 14151 and 14173, on Jan. 20 and Jan. 21, respectively — that eliminated DEI programs within government agencies and contractor projects. This created an antagonistic environment, forcing corporations and universities to adjust or eliminate long-standing programs in an appeasement effort. But as companies altered their programs, they found that those decisions carry significant financial and reputational risks for brands, as Target's recent experience starkly demonstrates. Boycotts can be effective for social change, such as the 1960 Greensboro sit-ins during the Civil Rights era, where students refused to leave a Woolworth lunch counter in Greensboro, NC. Yet only recently have boycotts proven to be influential on the consumer’s decision to purchase. The internet era, which has allowed consumers to interact with retailers and brands more frequently, has altered how messaging is managed, especially for brands built on inclusion. When companies pull back on DEI, they risk alienating a significant portion of their consumer base. A 2022 Harris report commissioned by Google found that 82% of consumers “would prefer a consumer brand’s values to align with their own”. Another 75% of respondents reported parting ways with a brand over a conflict in values. This reflects a personal connection consumers have to brands, with a shifting number of people seeing themselves directly affected and taking action based on their identity and support for causes. Related Article: Double up on DEI: The Real Impact on Customer Experience Recent data highlights the financial and reputational damage that can result when brands pull back from diversity and inclusion efforts. Target's experience serves as a cautionary tale: the company missed analyst sales expectations by nearly half a billion dollars in Q1 2025, with net sales falling nearly 3% to $23.8 billion, down from $24.5 billion in Q1 2024. Foot traffic declined 5.7% year-over-year, and for 10 consecutive weeks following its DEI rollback announcement, Target experienced declining store traffic, down 9% year-over-year in February and 6.5% in March. The company's stock plummeted 12%, erasing billions in market value, while Target revised its sales projections downward, now expecting a "low single-digit decline" for fiscal 2025 instead of the previously forecast 1% growth. In contrast, Costco, which publicly defended and maintained its DEI commitments, saw its foot traffic rise 7% year-over-year during the same period. McDonald's now faces similar pressure, with The People's Union USA organizing a week-long boycott claiming the fast food giant went back on its promised investment in diversity initiatives. McDonald’s representatives acknowledge a change in some initiatives, including a supplier program. But they claim the changes will not minimize their commitment. The damage from DEI rollbacks extends beyond immediate sales figures. It results in eroding trust, diminished brand perception, and a weakening of emotional loyalty and long-term equity. As Valeria Piaggio, global head of sustainable growth and transformation at Kantar, notes in a Mediapost article on the rollbacks, marketers want to be "loved, trusted and believed in," and this emotional connection, which drives value, is "at risk." For brands like Target that spent years building a purpose-driven identity centered on inclusion, walking back these commitments "breaks the brand narrative" and "the consumer contract," causing the emotional foundation of the relationship to collapse. This volatility means even a "fringe boycott" can cause "outsized reputational harm." Moreover, CMOs must recognize the immense purchasing power of diverse consumer segments. Black consumers, according to Nielsen in its latest report, have an annual purchasing power expected to reach $2 trillion by 2026, up from $1.7 trillion in 2024. Organizations like the NAACP are responding to DEI cuts by empowering Black consumers to be intentional about where they spend their money, launching initiatives like the Black Consumer Advisory to highlight companies that promote diversity. According to eMarketer, a February Harris Poll cited by Axios revealed that 50% of Black consumers have recently stopped shopping at companies with differing political views, the highest among all demographics surveyed. Deprioritizing diversity can leave "significant growth on the table," doing a "disservice to shareholders." In an age characterized by political polarization and corporate appeasement, CMOs have a golden opportunity to proactively embrace actions that reinforce diversity and inclusion as a strategic imperative for sustained growth and brand integrity. The most effective way to understand a diverse customer base is to have a diverse team that reflects their backgrounds and experiences. CMOs should prioritize hiring individuals across all ethnicities, races, ages, abilities, religions, cultures, genders and sexual orientations. This diversity provides invaluable insights, leading to more personalized service and expanding access to new markets. Customers increasingly align with brands whose values resonate with their own. CMOs must ensure that their teams understand multiple perspectives, avoiding ad messaging that could be offensive. This commitment demonstrates genuine awareness and alignment with consumer priorities like community service and equity. Customers reward that commitment with their customer loyalty. E.l.f. Beauty, for instance, has leveraged its diverse employee base and loyal following of younger, diverse customers, featuring transgender and non-binary models. According to Black Enterprise, E.l.f. Beauty has seen its stock price increase by over 700% since 2020, building a loyal young customer base that trusts the brand. A significant portion of the population prefers customer service in their native language. CMOs should advocate for multilingual support in contact centers and digital channels, allowing customers to feel at ease and streamlining their experience. This proactive step not only boosts customer retention and relationships but also captures a broader market segment that may otherwise seek out competitors offering such support. DEI is about recognizing and valuing the unique experiences each individual brings. CMOs should cultivate a culture where all team members feel appreciated and empowered to share their thoughts and unique ideas. This inclusion leads to a wider range of insights, making problem-solving and brainstorming for customer experience initiatives quicker and more effective, ensuring the brand stays ahead of the curve. As data increasingly represents customer interactions from personalized recommendations to AI-generated models, CMOs must ensure that data modeling technologies apply ethical standards so that inclusion efforts do not begin to operate with the systematic approaches that were used for exclusion. One way is to advocate for "human-in-the-loop" protocols with AI. The protocol is valuable when AI is used to generate visual imagery. One example is the fashion models of various body types, ages, sizes and skin tones that Levi's is doing with Lalaland.ai. It is crucial that algorithms and datasets do not craft visualizations of people with negative social biases. Brands must ensure the design and deployment of algorithm-based systems avoid discriminatory outcomes. The current environment, marked by both a strong consumer preference for inclusive brands and political pressure against DEI, presents a unique challenge for CMOs. However, by understanding the proven benefits of DEI for CX, recognizing the costs of retreat and proactively implementing strategies that embrace diversity, CMOs can not only protect but also enhance their brand's perception, loyalty and long-term financial health. The true business risk lies not in maintaining DEI values but in retreating from them. Even a brand’s perceived retreat from ethics in the eyes of its customers leaves significant future opportunities for building customer trust and fostering great customer experiences on the table.

Title: JPMorgan Just Flipped On The Fed—Predicted To Fuel A Huge Bitcoin Price Boom

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin and crypto have rocketed higher this week, climbing as the market bounces back to $4 trillion from a sell-off that sparked fears of a crash. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price hit an all-time high of $123,000 per bitcoin last month, with traders betting the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock could be about to blow up up the market. Now, as legendary billionaire Ray Dalio issues a shock crypto recommendation, analysts with JPMorgan have flipped to predict the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September—setting up a situation “eerily similar” to bitcoin’s 2024 second half price surge. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run "For [Fed chair Jerome] Powell, the risk management considerations at the next meeting may go beyond balancing employment and inflation risks," JPMorgan analyst Michael Feroli wrote in a note to clients seen by Reuters. JPMorgan predicts the Fed will cut interest rates by 25 basis points at its September meeting, pointing to labour market growth stalling and U.S. president Donald Trump’s nomination of the dovish chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, Stephen Miran, to a temporary seat on the Fed board, replacing outgoing governor Adriana Kugler. Powell has come under massive pressure from Trump this year, whose attacks over interest rates have raised the possibility that the era of Fed independence could be coming to an end. "In the off chance Miran is governor by the time of the next meeting, that could imply three dissents. That’s a lot of dissents," Feroli said, adding that if the jobs market continues to weaken it could justify a larger cut of 50 basis points. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free newsletter for the crypto-curious CME’s Fed Watch tool is now showing the market is pricing in an around 90% chance of an interest rate cut in September, creating a situation that mirrors the 2024 September rate cut that took market off-guard and spurred the bitcoin price to a record-breaking rally. "Last year’s August growth scare spurred the Fed into a ‘catch-up rate cut rush’ from September to December 2024, doubling bitcoin’s price in the process," Presto Research’s Peter Chung and Min Jung wrote in a note this week. “The current setup feels eerily similar.”

Analysts are split on whether BlackRock will file for spot XRP ETF. Analysts are split on whether BlackRock will file for a spot XRP ETF. But the latest regulatory update could be a positive catalyst for it to make the move, per Nate Geraci. BlackRock may apply for a spot Ripple[XRP] ETF after the U.S SEC and Ripple Labs ended their appeals. This was a bold projection by Nate Geraci of ETF Institute, adding that, “Yes, I think BlackRock was waiting to see this before filing for iShares XRP ETF…” He said that it would make ‘zero sense’ for the firm not to explore beyond Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH]. If it sticks to only BTC and ETH, then it would mean that only the two assets have value, Geraci wrote. As of press time, the asset manager had not applied for both XRP and Solana [SOL] ETFs. This made it the only potential issuer with BTC and ETH ETF offerings that was yet to make that move. Last year, Samara Cohen, CIO at BlackRock, noted that institutional investors were only focused on BTC and ETH. Hence, at that time, she added that they may not apply for other crypto ETFs in the near term. However, Geraci believes that BlackRock could file for SOL and XRP ETFs before the October approval deadline. For his part, Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas opined that the firm may just stick to the two top crypto assets, citing ‘diminished returns’ beyond ETH. Source: X Meanwhile, the approval odds for spot XRP ETF surged to nearly 80% after the SEC and Ripple Labs opted to end their appeals. Source: Polymarket Interestingly, the chances had dropped to 66% on the 7th of August. This followed revelations of alleged blockage of crypto ETFs by Democrat SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw. But Balchunas noted that the commissioner was ‘outnumbered’ and could not prevent the products from going live, maintaining 95% of approval. “She’s outnumbered = we haven’t changed our odds, still at 95%.” On the market front, over $6 billion XRP has been offloaded in the past few days, flipping whale demand to negative. While this was a threat to the $3 support, the latest update on the dismissal of the SEC and Ripple Labs appeals triggered an 11% upswing to $3.3. However, Options traders were still heavily hedging against further downside risks despite the relief rally. Per Laevitas’ data, there was a premium for short-dated put options (bearish bets). Also, the 25 Delta Skew turned negative and dropped across the 1-day, 1-week, and 3-month tenors, illustrating weakening sentiment. Source: Laevitas Notably, traders bought over 1.8 billion XRP at each of the $2.70–$2.80 and $2.40–$2.50 zones, reinforcing these levels as key support areas. These zones now serve as potential floors in the event of a short-term pullback.

You won't want to start your day without it. By Francisco Rodrigues (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Crypto markets rallied in the past 24 hours, with the CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index rising 5.3% as fresh U.S. policy signals and regulatory clarity supported risk appetite across the sector. Bitcoin BTC$122,181.91 gained a relatively muted 1.3% to $116,500. The rally took off after President Donald Trump signed an executive order opening 401(k) retirement plans to a broader range of investments, including cryptocurrencies. The order directs the Department of Labor and Securities and Exchange Commission to publish new guidance for retirement accounts. “This move effectively opens access to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for retirement investors, unlocking a staggering $8.7 trillion in assets under management.,” James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, said in an emailed statement. Jake Ostrovskis, OTC trader at Wintermute, told CoinDesk that the impact of the move could not be understated. “Just a 2% allocation to Bitcoin and Ethereum would represent 1.5x the total cumulative ETF inflows to date, while a 3% allocation would more than double the entire market,” Ostrovskis said. “Critically, these would be largely price-insensitive buyers focused on meeting allocation benchmarks rather than tactical trading.“ In practice, that means 401(k) funds would create “sustained, predictable demand flows that could provide a structural bid for digital assets regardless of short-term price volatility,” Ostrovskis added. While crypto has never been formally banned from the retirement investments, previous guidance strongly discouraged fiduciaries from offering it. Meanwhile, the Ethereum blockchain hit a new record for average daily transactions this week, according to data from Dune Analytics. The increase was underpinned by the SEC's clarification earlier this week that certain liquid staking models don’t constitute securities under the 1933 Securities Act, making it safer for institutions to offer staking services. Ether's (ETH) price surged 4.6% over the past 24 hours to near $3,900. While fireworks were going off in the crypto sector, TradFi was more subdued. The S&P 500 dropped in Thursday’s session, and the Nasdaq closed 0.35% higher, furthering the concentration of megacaps in the indexes. The 10 largest stocks now account for 76% of the entire stock market capitalization, data shared by Barchart shows. Gold rose on tariffs being imposed on some bullion bars. Looking ahead, investors are bracing for July’s inflation report, due next week, which may influence the odds of a dovish Fed interest-rate cut in September. Stay alert!

Title: Trump’s Executive Order Could Be Bitcoin’s Next Big Catalyst: CEO

Time Published: 2025-08-08T11:00:33Z

Mike Novogratz, chief executive of Galaxy Digital, told CNBC that a new executive order from US President Donald Trump could make it easier for retirement plans to include cryptocurrencies. According to reports, the order asks the Labor Department to review ERISA rules so alternatives such as crypto, private equity, and real estate can be offered inside 401(k) plans. That’s a policy signal that could matter to many savers, but it will not instantly change how plans operate. Based on reports, Americans hold about $8.7 trillion in 401(k) assets, so even small allocations would add up. Novogratz said that if companies like Fidelity, BlackRock or T. Rowe Price package crypto in retirement-friendly vehicles, mainstream access would increase. That could let ordinary savers get exposure through tax-advantaged accounts they already use. Plan sponsors and record-keepers remain subject to ERISA responsibilities and questions of duty of care. Those responsibilities mandate fiduciaries to act in a prudent way for participants, and introducing volatile assets creates genuine legal and compliance concerns. Thus, though the executive order reflects a change, regulators and plan providers must sort through operational realities before numerous retirement accounts hold significant crypto positions. Plan administrators will need custody solutions, audit trails, and low-cost product structures to make crypto fit with defined contribution plans. Many crypto vehicles carry lockups or higher fees, and that clashes with how 401(k) menus are usually set up. Litigation risk also remains: a sharp drop in value could lead to scrutiny from participants or courts. Regulators will likely balance investor protection against widening access, and asset managers will balance demand with legal caution. Market moves show the headline effect in action. Based on reports, Bitcoin traded at $116,500, up 3.0% in the past day, while Ethereum traded at $3,810, a 6% rise in the same timeframe. Novogratz has pointed to institutional products such as BlackRock’s Bitcoin Trust as evidence of growing demand. Those products help create familiar entry points for big money and retail investors alike. Don’t expect an instant tidal wave. Product teams at major managers will likely pilot custody and compliance setups before offering broad access. Plan sponsors may start with small, optional allocations or specialized windows rather than adding crypto to default funds. Small percentages across many accounts could still add up to large dollar flows if given time. In short, based on reports and Novogratz’s remarks, the executive order is a major political signal that could encourage more retirement capital toward crypto over time after Trump gives the EO its final seal of approval.

Time Published: 2025-08-08T10:33:12Z

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / AUGUST 08 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / AUGUST 08 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies.

Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / AUGUST 08 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing.

Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 82 – Why Apple Could be the Key to Intel’s Future – The latest Arm Neoverse announcement further cements our opinion that its architecture, business model and ecosystem execution are defining a new era of computing; and leaving Intel in its dust. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explain why and how Apple could hold a key to saving Intel’s (and America’s) semiconductor industry leadership position. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 81 – A Digital Skills Gap Signals Rebound in IT Services Spend – Recent survey data from ETR shows that enterprise tech spending is tracking with projected U.S. GDP growth at 6% to 7% this year. Many markers continue to point the way to a strong recovery including hiring trends and the loosening of frozen IT project budgets. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR, who will share fresh data, perspectives and insights from the latest survey data.

Episode 79 – Moore’s Law is Accelerating and AI is Ready to Explode – Moore’s Law is dead right? Think again. While the historical annual CPU performance improvement of ~40% is slowing, the combination of CPUs packaged with alternative processors is improving at a rate of more than 100% per annum. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is going to unveil some data that suggests we’re entering a new era of innovation where inexpensive processing capabilities will power an explosion of machine intelligence applications. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 78 – Arm Lays Down the Gauntlet at Intel’s Feet – Exactly one week after Pat Gelsinger unveiled plans to reinvent Intel, Arm announced version 9 of its architecture and put forth its vision for the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings.

August 8, 2025 Back in 2020, Google merged its Android TV and Chromecast efforts and launched a Google TV interface aimed at increasing discovery. While its focus to promote relevant content — basically based on your preferences and watch history from various streaming apps installed on the TV — has ramped up, Google has also worked hard to continuously inject ads to generate revenue streams other than licensing fees paid by TV manufacturers. However, the efforts do not seem to be working much in Google’s favor. As per a recent report by The Verge (paywalled), the tech giant, whose most significant revenue source is advertising, is struggling to make enough money from ads on the TV platform. The report says Google has spent millions of dollars on making the platform lucrative to advertisers, but has yet to make a profit on its investments. And with “costs exploding,” Google is forced to re-evaluate how much more it wants to invest. In a desperate attempt to generate more money from Google TV ads, it is renouncing control of ad slots and freely offering them to streaming service providers who publish their apps on the platform, in exchange for a commission. This approach goes against what other brands like Ruko and Vizio employ, where they reserve some of the ad slots, including those within the apps, and claim the entirety of the commission from those. Google appears to have now hit the panic button and is relinquishing control over those ad spaces, according to The Verge‘s report. Google’s nervousness can also be backed by its share in the North American smart TV market. While more than two-thirds of US households are estimated to own a smart TV, according to Park Associates, only about 10% of them use Android or Google TVs. The percentage is much higher worldwide, where about a quarter of new TVs are shipped with one of Google’s interfaces. However, that also accounts for an “operator tier,” which is highly customized by TV manufacturers or companies operating them, which takes away a significant portion of Google’s revenue. In the US, where Google can exert more control, the smart TV market is dominated by Samsung, LG, and Roku. Meanwhile, Amazon, which currently stands at about 5%, is increasing pressure on Google by engaging in aggressive retail placements. The Verge notes Amazon recently partnered with Hisense to launch smart TVs with its Fire TV OS — replacing Google TV from the brand’s previous lineup. Amazon is reportedly also incentivizing retail partners like Costco to sell its Fire OS-based Hisense TVs by offering “bounties” up to $50 per TV activated. Adding to the platform’s woes, Google TV’s ad revenue is seemingly being cannibalized by its cousin, YouTube. Notably, YouTube’s views on smart TVs have increased consistently over the years, and it currently makes up for 25% of the views that all streaming services receive in the US. As a result, Google’s sales teams are forced to prioritize it over the Google TV platform. This has also triggered budget cuts and layoffs in the Google TV team, as reported back in June. So, unlike Android, Google TV hasn’t given the tech giant the monopoly it was hoping for. But what does that say about the platform’s future? We aren’t quite sure yet, but it doesn’t look all bright and shiny for the team. For now, Google is looking at shorter-term partnerships with TV manufacturers, and uncertainty looms around Google TV’s future. While we hate the ads, we sure hope Google doesn’t give up on yet another service. It could, however, mean Google scales back its efforts and prioritizes other profitable avenues.

Title: Ripple and SEC settle, sparking XRP’s 10% rally and BlackRock ETF speculation

The legal certainty from Ripple's SEC settlement sparks speculation of a potential BlackRock XRP ETF project. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have agreed to formally end their appeals in the high-profile lawsuit that has dragged on for nearly four years. In a joint filing on Aug. 7, both parties confirmed they will withdraw their appeals following a Commission vote. Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, said the agreement marks the close of a dispute that began in December 2020. Under the settlement terms, XRP will not be classified as a security, and each side will cover its own legal costs. This outcome is seen as a major win for Ripple, placing it alongside other crypto firms like Coinbase that have resolved conflicts with the SEC. Following the news, the XRP token price jumped by more than 10% to $3.33 as of press time, according to CryptoSlate’s data. The settlement has fueled speculation about a potential spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) from BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager. The firm already issues leading ETF products tied to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth, suggested BlackRock may have been waiting for legal clarity before considering an XRP product under its iShares brand. He argued that ignoring assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum could imply that no other cryptocurrencies have long-term value. However, he stressed that his views are speculative, saying: “I’ll own it if I’m wrong.” Meanwhile, not everyone shares Geraci’s optimistic outlook about a potential BlackRock XRP ETF. Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas expressed skepticism, saying he believes BlackRock is content with its two existing crypto ETFs. He cited the “law of diminishing returns” for adding more products, though he admitted his opinion was based more on intuition than concrete evidence. Despite his doubts about BlackRock pursuing an XRP ETF, Balchunas remains optimistic about the broader regulatory environment. He estimated a 95% chance of an XRP ETF receiving approval before the end of the year. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: ‘Disaster in the Making’: Trump to Open 401(k)s to Crypto, Private Equity Vultures

Yves here. Private equity has been trying for many years to get their products sold to retail investors. Trump has greatly lowered the bar with his executive order. However (and I do not want to sound like a Pollyanna) but if the private equity part was as easy as a Presidential stroke of a pen, it would have happened already. Selling a financial product to retail investors requires considerably more financial reporting and compliance. That involves another layer of fees and costs when private equity is already pulling out so much in fees and costs as to make private equity less attractive on a risk-return basis than stocks. That is not to say that the new SEC chair won’t try to bend the rules. See our May post: New SEC Chief on Board with Letting Retail Chumps Invest in Private Equity Even as Pros Like Kuwait Sovereign Wealth Fund Sound Red Alert But see some of our many posts on private equity’s overstated performance, and the fact that many investors are finally waking up: Private Equity Pummeled by Higher Interest Rates as Portfolio Companies and Credit Funds Struggle; Use of PIK Loans Now Recalls Late 1980s LBO Crisis Billionaire Blasts Private Equity’s Continued Grifting as Performance Falls Further Private Equity Becomes Roach Motel as Public Pension Funds and Other Investors Borrow As Funds Remain Tied Up Private Equity Seeks to Foist Companies It Can’t Sell on Employees As CalPERS Doubles Down on Private Equity, New Analysis Finds CalPERS’ Private Equity Returns “Based on a Mirage;” Another Study Reaffirms that Private Equity Drags Down Performance And that’s before getting to how private equity rentierism is destructive to the public. There is plenty where this came from: Private Equity on Campus: Why College Students Are Sleeping in Cars Buy and Bust: Collapse of Private Equity-Backed Rural Hospitals Mired Employees in Medical Bills Fed Hawkishness, Crypto Implosion, and Private Equity Subscription Lines of Credit Imperil Silicon Valley Bank and Freak Out Bank Stock Investors Plunder: Private Equity’s Plan to Pillage America But it seems inevitable that retail retirement assets will become the last chumps for both PE and crypto. The only question is to what degree. By Jake Johnson, staff writer for Common Dreams. Originally published at Common Dreams U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order on Thursday that would allow private equity and cryptocurrencies into Americans’ 401(k)s, appeasing corporate interests that lobbied for the change and disregarding warnings about the risks it poses to retirement accounts. Citing an unnamed senior White House official, CNN reported that “the order calls for the Labor Department and Securities and Exchange Commission to issue guidance to employers about providing access to those alternative investments in their retirement accounts.” The private equity industry has been working for years to gain access to a portion of the roughly $12 trillion that Americans have saved in workplace retirement plans. “This is the holy grail for private equity,” Axios reported Thursday, noting that federal rules currently bar most defined-contribution plans from investing in private equity and crypto. Both industries spent big on the 2024 election; the investment management behemoth BlackRock, whose CEO has advocated opening 401(k)s to private equity, donated to Trump’s inaugural committee. James Baratta and Whitney Curry Wimbish noted in The American Prospect earlier this year that “there was added desperation from the industry” for access to 401(k)s “because of their dire need for cash amid weakening performance and fewer deals.” “Some firms have begun mortgaging their own funds for money to pay out limited partners,” they added. “Retail investors represented trillions in untapped potential.” Helaine Olen, managing editor at the American Economic Liberties Project and a longtime personal finance columnist, said in a statement Thursday that “stuffing private equity, crypto, and other ‘alternative assets’ into 401(k)s is about propping up scams and bailing out an industry that’s run out of buyers—and it’s being done at the expense of Americans’ retirements everywhere.” “There’s a reason most employers didn’t bite when Trump tried this the first time and why the private investments industry has put on such a thick lobbying campaign,” said Olen. “These funds are high-fee, risky, and opaque. Private equity consistently underperforms the S&P 500. This is a windfall for billionaire fund managers and a disaster in the making for regular Americans trying to save for retirement.” Last week, the Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund and American Federation of Teachers released a report warning that if private equity is given a foothold in 401(k)s, “millions of workers saving for retirement would be exposed to higher risks and steep fees in products that lack basic investor protections and transparency requirements.” The report found that private equity profitability “has been in a year-over-year decline” for the past two decades and that “fee structures—paid directly by investors or indirectly through portfolio companies—are prone to extensive manipulation.” Lisa Donner, co-executive director at Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund, said that “private equity executives have enriched themselves by the billions, taking high fees and other charges from working people’s hard-earned retirement savings in pension funds.” “Now they want fees from the trillions of dollars in individual retirement accounts,” Donner added, “putting millions of more people at risk.” Perhaps the US economy is replicating what happens to snakes under stress? I think it is inevitable, but how to protect ourselves, other than the old fashioned hard work of reading the prospectus and calling the 1-800 line to harangue the advisors? My biggest nightmare is that this crap ends up in target date funds. The sheep will be sheared. What if the 800 line is staffed overseas or even worse, supplemented with a Q&A guided response built on the best AI offerings? Hey dear consumer, please invest your life savings and hold it with “diamond hands!”. \sarc Employers just found a use case for hiring young whippersnapper lawyers fresh from law school. Write some safe harbor language that puts a wide legal moat as possible, and include in all our detailed retirement planning disclosures. Employers all shifted away from defined benefit pensions and that was no accident, unfortunately for mine, ours and future generations. It will be … I had to move my entire IRA holdings, save a few shekels out of Vanguard, for this very reason. The phone customer service deteriorated to the point where it took hours to get through to an overseas call center, none of whom had any authority to do much other than tell me balance info. Welcome to the Motel Crypto Hell … you can check in anytime you want … “It’s a lovely place…” We’re considering this for our IRAs (401(k)s with Fidelity for me, 457(b) 2ith WA PERS for the LHG). Where did you move your funds to? Of course this is all a test run for the real White House objective – privatizing Social Security to Wall Street so that it can be pillaged by them. That is the ultimate aim. Where is a blue dress when you need one? Ask Jeffrey Epstein’s friend. The bubble for crypto is being inflated to incredible levels. Bitcoin is now at $130,000, there are Bitcoin credit cards and now Bitcoin is going to be in 401k funds. I don’t know where this will stop. But in the short term, it’s a rational investment as it’s certain to go up wildly in the next few months at least. I wonder if Bitcoin will reach 1,000,000 before it crashes. Unlike tulips, it has a committed, international, user base. It certainly has more uses then tulips. What’s trending now is using Bitcoin as collateral and never selling it. Obv it will go down at some point but as long as you don’t get liquidated by having a low LTV you’d be fine $4.01k update: This is what everybody was hoping for-legitimacy of packaged air cleverly disguised as cryptos, Bitcoin in particular. Now to come up with appropriate nicknames… Green(screen)backs ” Everybody” ? Which “everybodies”? How many “everybodies”? I understand the regret in missing out on not having a one-figure investment in Bitcoin, some skin in the game. Its never too late and they’re still making 1’s & 0’s~ Which one will they run out of first? I invested in cans of canned fish in cans. I am slowly eating them down. If crypto crashes back to truth-value zero before I have eaten all my cans of canned fish, the fish inside the cans of canned fish that I will still have at that time will still be safely inside of their cans. So whoever might be regretting not having bought Bitco at the start, it isn’t me. I have been true to my pledge, the No Crypto pledge. I pledge, on my honor, that I will neither use crypto nor invest in crypto. And I will not tolerate those who do. The linked AFT/AFREF/AAUP report From Public Pensions to Private Fortunes on how Private Equity morphed from its 1980’s leveraged looting model into a fee-driven billionaire factory is well worth downloading and reading. My only criticism of the report is that it fails to emphasize how campaign cash and outright graft have destroyed the democratic process that should have caused regulators, legislators, and fiduciary boards to rein-in this devastating looting of the commons. Trump’s proposal is nakedly transactional, like everything he does.

Wait till AI hacks into the invulnerable, immutable, and unhackable crypto system. It seems, in this day and age, the latest and greatest digital invention 10 years ago, becomes obsolete with the passage of time. Devil’s Own Advocate: What if Bitcoin et al was the stalking horse that Wall*Street pinned the tale on, when things come a cropper? When things come a cropper, the canned fish inside my cans of canned fish in cans will still be inside my cans of canned fish in cans. Those who can invest in Reality and Survival should do so rather than investing in munny or sekyooriteez or stokz or bahndz or such, to the extent that they are able. Those who are only a little bit able can still invest a little bit in a little bit of Reality and Survival. Sardines perhaps? But would they be eating sardines or trading sardines? https://novelinvestor.com/happy-hour-trading-sardines/ Sardines are wonderful. They are low on the food chain so they accumulate least-feasible contanimants. They last for several years inside the cans so you can eat them at leisure. And the cans themselves can be saved for arts-and-crafts purposes around the home. I must confess, I had never heard of the concept of trading sardines till now. It makes a fine apocryphal tale. If you are speculating on trading sardines, why would you ever bother to worry about what is in the can? Till you are hungry and have to liquidate your speculative investment one can at a time. ( If some of my sardines become unfit to eat due to being held for too long before eating, they will still be fit to feed to the garden). Your email address will not be published.

Title: Dogecoin Isn’t Done Yet – Grok’s Surprising Price Prediction & $MAXI Recommendation
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-price-prediction-grok-buy-maxi-doge/
Time Published: 2025-08-08T07:04:05Z
Full Content:
Dogecoin’s name is written in golden letters in meme coin lore. After all, it was the first major meme coin that really showed to the world that humor and finance can indeed blend, and blend beautifully, and that an investment opportunity doesn’t need to titillate a Harvard graduate’s intellect to be wildly profitable. Currently trading at $0.2202, $DOGE has climbed a chunky 27% over the past month. With a new altcoin bull run seemingly on the horizon, speculation is rife on whether this dog-themed token could turn back the clock and deliver mind-boggling rallies once again. To find out, we turned to Grok for Dogecoin’s price prediction for 2025 and beyond. Why Grok? Because it’s one of the best AI chatbots out there, and the only one directly integrated with X, the hub of pipping-hot crypto updates from both under-the-radar crypto wizards and mainstream industry voices. This gives Grok a unique ability to sweep the floor and piece together a sharper, more accurate narrative on what’s next for $DOGE. Keep reading to see why Grok thinks $DOGE could hit $0.50 (a bold call, to say the least) by the end of 2025, the forces driving it higher, and why buying a Doge-based presale meme coin like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) could be the best way to ride Doge’s next leg up. The biggest reason behind Grok’s bold $DOGE price prediction is that the token is sitting in a rare sweet spot where both fundamental and technical factors are flashing green. For starters, Dogecoin is preparing to integrate a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) verification system, which would allow transactions to be verified without revealing sensitive information, boosting both privacy and scalability. This kind of tech upgrade strengthens Dogecoin’s long-term credibility and makes it more attractive for mainstream adoption. Why is an ETF approval such a big deal? Because it would open the floodgates for institutional investors and everyday traders to buy $DOGE through regular brokerage accounts, potentially triggering a surge in demand and liquidity. On the daily chart, Dogecoin has just broken above the 10 and 20 EMAs with a fat green candle. Even better, this bounce is coming straight from the 0.5-0.618 Fibonacci zone (drawn from the $0.14287 low) – a ‘golden pocket.’ In simple words, this setup makes it highly likely that the bullish momentum will continue, potentially pushing $DOGE to $0.28746, i.e., the high of the Fib range. Even more interesting? The rebound is happening exactly at a long-standing upward trendline, the same one that kicked off a 400% price surge back in December 2024. If history repeats, $DOGE could be on track to blast through Grok’s $0.50 target and potentially even challenge its all-time highs. So, buying $DOGE now at just $0.2202 could potentially set you up for 100%+ gains in the coming months. Awesome, innit? After all, these are returns most investors would likely never see even in multiple years in stocks. However, in the wild world of crypto, the real moonshots come from looking for low-cap, low-priced tokens ready to ride a major wave. As for the Dogecoin wave, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) could be the next crypto to explode, with the potential to deliver 1000x gains once it hits the exchanges. Like all explode-worthy meme coins, Maxi Doge is built around a mascot with undeniable gravitas. A Shiba Inu dog with revenge in his eyes, protein shakes in his veins, and big, bulky muscles to intimidate every cutesy, wholesome mascot in the meme coin space, Maxi has the kind of presence that stops you in your tracks. Bold. Iconic. Impossible to ignore. But revenge from whom? Dogecoin, Maxi’s distant cousin. The one who hogged all the limelight at every family gathering, leaving poor little Maxi with a cocktail of insecurity, self-hatred, and loneliness. Determined to dethrone Dogecoin’s dominance, Maxi hit the gym and stared at candlestick charts all day, and all night. His reasoning? The crypto market never sleeps, so why should you? And that’s exactly the raw, untamed energy $MAXI embodies. A place with no rules to follow, no mould to fit into. Here, ‘gainz’ is the only religion, even if it takes 1000x leveraged YOLO bets to get there. While Maxi Doge is a meme coin through and through – meaning it doesn’t have any underlying value, utility, or rEvOlUtIoNaRy mission to sell you – holding $MAXI tokens unlocks a bunch of community benefits, including: Even better? Maxi Doge has reserved a chunky 40% of its total token supply for marketing. This will include influencer partnerships and gamified trading challenges. This shows how serious the devs are about $MAXI’s virality. Despite being one of the newest crypto presales on the market, Maxi Doge has already raked in an impressive $470K in early investor funding, proving that if you’ve got a viral idea, a loyal community, and hype, the money pours in fast. Right now, you can scoop up 1 $MAXI for just $0.000251. The easiest way to buy is through Best Wallet, where you can purchase from directly within the app. Alternatively, you can head to Maxi Doge’s official website, connect your crypto wallet, and buy from there. Learn all about this rage-fueled degen project in its whitepaper. And follow its X and Telegram to catch every update before the next pump. With Dogecoin poised for a 100%+ rally in the coming months, thanks to bullish price action, upcoming tech upgrades, and the looming possibility of an ETF approval, now’s the perfect time to back Doge-inspired, low-cap, high-upside meme coins like Maxi Doge ($MAXI).

Title: BlackRock Rumored to Dump $664M in Bitcoin and Ethereum—What Happens if Trust Breaks?
URL: https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/blackrock-rumored-to-dump-664m-in-bitcoin-and-ethereum-what-happens-if-trust-breaks/
Time Published: 2025-08-08T06:44:00Z
Full Content:
New reports suggest that BlackRock may be preparing to offload over $664 million in Bitcoin and Ethereum, as ETF-linked wallet data shows potential movement across key custody addresses. According to blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence, four wallets tied to BlackRock’s IBIT and ETHA ETFs appear to have shifted large reserves in recent days – raising alarms among market watchers about whether a major liquidation event is on the horizon. The total holdings in question—11,400 BTC and 26,000 ETH—represent one of the largest aggregated positions by a single asset manager. While no official confirmation has come from BlackRock, analysts are warning that even the rumor of such a dump could be enough to destabilize market sentiment in the short term. And if investor confidence is shaken, it could lead to capital fleeing toward more nimble, high-growth crypto plays—especially emerging tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE that offer early-stage upside and no institutional overhang. Why a BlackRock sell-off could shift the narrative The speculation has ignited concerns about centralized influence over crypto markets. If BlackRock, seen as a trusted bridge between Wall Street and blockchain, begins unloading assets, it could signal broader doubt in current valuations – or even pre-positioning for a deeper macro pullback. Either way, such a move risks breaking trust among retail and institutional investors alike, particularly those who bought into ETFs expecting long-term holding strategies. Historically, market shocks like this have led to surges in interest for smaller, decentralized, community-backed tokens. And with sentiment this fragile, even a partial dump could redirect billions in retail flow toward early-stage opportunities tokens not yet tied to institutional risk or old-cycle baggage. $5,000 could deliver $550,000 once MAGACOIN FINANCE hits major exchanges That’s precisely why MAGACOIN FINANCE is now emerging as a top pick among early-mover investors. Still in its early phase, this politically charged coin has already outperformed expectations in terms of engagement, wallet sign-ups, and on-chain activity. But it’s the projected upside that’s turning heads: analysts now believe that a $5,000 investment at today’s rate could grow into $550,000 once MAGACOIN FINANCE gets listed on major exchanges and becomes globally accessible. What sets it apart? MAGACOIN FINANCE is blending virality with calculated rollout mechanics and a built-in ideological movement – attracting both hype traders and long-term ecosystem builders. Its rounds are closing fast, and the token has already surpassed early momentum levels seen in SHIBA INU and DOGE’s initial phases. Unlike assets weighed down by ETF custody issues or legacy reputation, MAGACOIN is clean, nimble, and built for exponential scaling. And in a post-BlackRock trust shake-up, MAGACOIN FINANCE could offer the kind of fresh start and narrative clarity the market desperately needs. As institutions wobble, early-stage plays surge While large asset managers like BlackRock have brought credibility to the crypto space, they’ve also introduced traditional finance behaviors – like strategic selling, liquidity protection, and risk management – that don’t always align with crypto’s ethos. If retail begins to feel burned by centralized exits, expect a mass migration to new, decentralized alternatives, particularly those not yet influenced by ETF politics or institutional pacing. Projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which have no legacy exposure and are just entering their growth phase, stand to capture the fallout from any broken trust in the top-tier token space. Conclusion: Institutions may sell – early movers will seek the next frontier Whether or not BlackRock executes a full sell-off, the market is clearly watching. And in moments like these, capital tends to flow fast toward uncorrelated opportunities. With MAGACOIN FINANCE offering projected 110x upside and gaining global traction ahead of its major listings, it’s no surprise that analysts are calling it the top altcoin bet in a post-ETF correction world.

Title: XRP price jumps 11% as SEC and Ripple formally dismiss appeals

About us Copy link After nearly five years of courtroom combat, the US Securities and Exchange Commission and Ripple Labs are putting away their swords. The two sides jointly agreed to dismiss their respective appeals in the XRP securities case, officially ending one of crypto’s largest legal battles and sending the token up 11% on Thursday. “Following the Commission’s vote today, the SEC and Ripple formally filed directly with the Second Circuit to dismiss their appeals,” Ripple chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty wrote on X, “The end, and now back to business.” According to the SEC, the joint stipulation covers Ripple Labs, CEO Brad Garlinghouse, and co-founder Christian Larsen. The dismissal resolves the agency’s civil enforcement action, leaving in place a final judgment imposing a $125,035,150 penalty on Ripple and a permanent injunction against violating the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933. Ripple had sought to cut that figure to $50 million as part of a conditional settlement, but Judge Analisa Torres rejected the proposal in June, ruling that neither side had “come close” to justifying a change to her final judgment. ETFStore president Nate Geraci said the truce “clears the way” for spot XRP exchange-traded funds, with Bloomberg analysts putting approval odds at 95% ahead of an October deadline. “I think BlackRock was waiting to see this before filing for iShares XRP ETF,” Geraci added, arguing it makes “zero sense” for issuers to ignore crypto assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. XRP is currently trading for $3.31. Kyle Baird is DL News’ Weekend Editor. Got a tip? Email at kbaird@dlnews.com.

Title: Ireland women’s rugby coach defends capping two ex-England players in World Cup prep

Ireland head coach Scott Bemand has defended the inclusion of two new players in Ireland’s World Cup preparation. It comes after former England international Ellena Perry was named to make her debut off the bench in Saturday’s warm-up match against Canada in Belfast. Perry, who earned the last of her 11 England caps in 2020 and therefore satisfies World Rugby’s stand down rules for switching nations, qualifies through an Irish grandparent. She was brought into the set-up a few weeks ago but, with tighthead prop Christy Haney struggling to make the World Cup squad due to a hamstring injury, Bemand has decided to play Perry as loosehead cover on the bench. Perry is the second new player from outside the Irish system given a debut in as many weeks. Last weekend, Exeter centre Nancy McGillivray, who has been named in England squads without ever being capped, debuted after qualifying through her Irish-born father. She has been on Ireland’s radar for some time, but only became available after her England contract expired in June. Both Perry and McGillivray are expected to be named in the final World Cup squad, to be announced on Monday. Perry is likely to come in for the injured Haney, while McGillivray is not expected to oust any of Eve Higgins, Aoife Dalton or Enya Breen, Ireland’s centres from the Six Nations. Instead, an outside back is likely to make way. Ahead of Saturday’s game in Belfast, Bemand was asked if introducing players from outside the system so close to the competition risked upsetting the squad dynamic. “If done incorrectly [yes],” he said. “But with Christy [Haney] picking up the hamstring niggle we needed to bring in and supplement front row. So actually, everything has been done well, in my opinion. [ Former England prop Ellena Perry in line to make Ireland debut against CanadaOpens in new window ] “Elle [Perry] is a good player, and she’s a really good person, having worked with her before. She’s known to a good few of the girls [Perry is teammates of Neve Jones and Sam Monaghan at Gloucester] and they would endorse that.” While the new caps can be explained by injury and waiting for contracts to expire, that Ireland looked externally may send a message that the current development pathways don’t have World Cup-ready players. Uncapped Ulster and Railway prop Sophie Barrett was one name overlooked by the inclusion of Perry. Yet, other inclusions, such as the potential World Cup place for Under-20 forward Beth Buttimer, would push back against that narrative, one which Bemand is keen to dispel. “If you look at the number of players now coming through from the women’s national talent squad, in girls that are getting touch points through Sevens, through Celtic Challenge, through the Under-20s, our depth is night and day to how it looked two years ago. “Sophie’s [Barrett] nearly ready and if we had to call Sophie up, we’d be confident in what Sophie’s capabilities are. She also hasn’t played Test match rugby yet. “Ivana Kiripati, Ailish Quinn, Jemima Adams Verde ... we’ve got three players that have had touch points with the 20s in the near recent past. Ailish came on and got a first cap last week against Scotland. “So girls coming through the pathway, through the Under-20s is significant. It’s brilliant. I’m excited for the future.” IRELAND (v Canada, World cup-warm-up, Affidea Stadium, Belfast, Saturday, 12pm): Stacey Flood (Railway Union/Leinster); Béibhinn Parsons (Blackrock College/Connacht), Aoife Dalton (Old Belvedere/Leinster), Enya Breen (Blackrock College/Munster), Anna McGann (Railway Union); Dannah O’Brien (Old Belvedere/Leinster), Aoibheann Reilly (Blackrock College/Connacht); Niamh O’Dowd (Old Belvedere/Leinster), Neve Jones (Gloucester Hartpury), Linda Djougang (Old Belvedere/Leinster); Ruth Campbell (Old Belvedere/Leinster), Fiona Tuite (Old Belvedere/Ulster); Grace Moore (Trailfinders/IQ Rugby), Ivana Kiripati (Creggs/Connacht), Brittany Hogan (Old Belvedere/Ulster).

Title: Transport authority approves settlement of Swords BusConnects corridor legal action

The board of the National Transport Authority (NTA) has approved a proposed settlement to halt legal action taken against its planned BusConnects corridor from Swords to Dublin city centre. The NTA would not disclose the terms of the settlement, but the board’s approval raises hopes judicial review proceedings will be dropped to allow construction of the 12km route granted planning permission more than a year ago. The Swords corridor is one of 12 segregated bus routes to be built as part of the €4 billion scheme to transform the capital’s bus services. The planned route runs from the south side of Swords town in north Dublin, past Dublin Airport and through Santry along the Swords Road, then along the Drumcondra Road and Dorset Street to the top of O’Connell Street and Parnell Square. The NTA secured permission from An Bord Pleanála for the route in June of last year, but judicial review proceedings against the board’s decision were initiated in August by two separate parties: owners of a business park near the airport and a veterinary practice south of Swords. The cases have not yet been heard in the High Court but in their submissions to An Bord Pleanála both Brendan Collins, of Collinstown Business Park, and Conor O’Scanaill, of O’Scanaill Veterinary Surgeons, raised concerns about the effect the bus corridor would have on their properties. Minutes of a recent NTA board meeting show details of a “settlement proposal” were presented to the board by interim NTA chief executive Hugh Creegan. “Following the overview provided, the board approved the terms of the proposed agreement to settle the particular judicial reviews proceedings being taken in relation to the Swords to City Centre Core Bus Corridor scheme,” the minutes state. This is the first settlement approved by the board in an effort to bring an end to legal action taken against one of the bus corridor schemes. Of the 12 corridors, judicial review proceedings have been taken in relation to seven, the corridors from Swords, Clongriffin, Belfield/Blackrock, Blanchardstown, Templeogue/Rathfarnham, Bray and Kimmage. The other five now have “full” planning permission as the time frame by which they could be challenged in the courts has expired. These are the routes from Ballymun/Finglas, Liffey Valley, Ringsend, Tallaght/Clondalkin and Lucan. [ BusConnects route will come in ‘on time, on budget’, says Darragh O’BrienOpens in new window ] Green Party transport spokesman Feljin Jose said the delays caused by the judicial reviews were extremely concerning. “The NTA has to build three of these at the same time over the next four to five years to get this done this side of 2035. Seven out of the 12 approved corridors in judicial review is not a good return rate and will add at least a year, maybe up to two years, delay.” The settlement of the Swords cases would be a win for Dubliners, he said. “Without knowing the details of the settlement I can only say it’s good news if the cases are dropped and the quicker we can get this done and have bus priority and improved cycling and pedestrian infrastructure.” The plaintiffs and their legal representatives declined to comment on the settlement agreement. A spokeswoman for the NTA said it could not comment on the details of the proposed agreement “other than to acknowledge that the board approved the terms of the agreement at the June board” meeting. Construction of the first core bus corridor from Liffey Valley to the city centre is due to begin next month.

Title: Rugby’s next generation: Meet the rising stars of Leinster, Ulster, Connacht and Munster
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/08/08/irelands-next-gen-whos-who-in-the-four-provincial-rugby-academies/
Time Published: 2025-08-08T05:00:00Z
Full Content:
Connacht academy manager Eric Elwood knows the value of a good young ‘un having led the Ireland Under-20s to a Grand Slam in 2007. So it’s no surprise that the province’s first-year intake for next season includes three players – flanker Bobby Power, hooker Mikey Yarr and secondrow David Walsh – from Neil Doak’s national age-grade squad. Another, number eight Aaron O’Brien, would have played but for injury. Connacht welcome eight players into the academy – five from Leinster in Yarr, Walsh, Dan Ryan, an Ireland Under-19 international wing educated at St Michael’s College, and outhalf Conor O’Shaughnessy, who played All-Ireland League for Blackrock College last season having made the short journey to Stradbrook from the school. O’Brien was a standout schools player at St Mary’s College and also in underage representative rugby with Leinster and Ireland. They join Power, fellow Galway man Seán Walsh, a centre who has represented Ireland at Under-19 international level, and backrow Diarmuid O’Connell from Carrick-on-Shannon. Elwood’s decision to recruit outside the province is sensible and underlines that he is looking to attract the best young players into the pathway. Newbridge-born prop Billy Bohan is in his second year, while wing James Nicholson (Wicklow) and hooker Matthew Victory (Dublin) are in their final year. Connacht are not alone in this respect as Ulster and Munster also have players born in Leinster in their respective academies, hardly a surprise given the numbers game, not least population size. Ulster have persuaded Balbriggan-born wing Aitzol Arenzana-King, a former Irish 20s Grand Slam winner, to make the journey to Belfast where he will join Dubliners Sam Berman and Tom Brigg, along with South African-born centre Wilhelm de Klerk, who came to Dublin as a 10-year-old and played rugby in St Michael’s. Richie Murphy’s Grand Slam and World Cup exploits with the Irish 20s was a facilitator in attracting some top young players to Ulster from outside the province. Hooker Connor Magee, prop Flynn Longstaff, promising outhalf Daniel Green and wing Josh Gibson join Arenzana-King as the five new faces in the academy. Props George Hadden, from Gorey, and Ronan Foxe from Rahugh near Tullamore are in their final year in the Munster academy. The first-year intake of five players includes two, Oisín Minogue and Tom Wood, fought their way into starting positions with the Irish 20s despite being a year young for the grade. Openside flanker Minogue got better with every opportunity through the Six Nations and then the World Championship in Italy, while Wood also demonstrated impressive composure and a tidy skill set to eventually claim the number 10 jersey in the maelstrom of a difficult season for the squad. They are joined by secondrow Conor Kennelly, prop Emmet Calvey and centre Eoghan Smyth. Five of Leinster’s nine strong first-year intake played for the Irish 20s last season – centres Connor Fahy and Ciarán Mangan, wing Páidí Farrell, prop Alex Mullan and secondrow Mahon Ronan. Todd Lawlor would have but for injury. Six of the newbies are backs. There are 71 academy players in total across the four provinces, broken down to Leinster (20), Munster (18), Ulster (17) and Connacht (16), of which 27 are first years next season. Leinster and Ulster contracted more backs than forwards, while the reverse was the case for Munster and Connacht.

Title: The Big Tech Visa: 7 current and former Big Tech employees share their H-1B visa stories
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/h-1b-visa-big-tech-immigration-green-card-2025-8
Time Published: 2025-08-08T04:05:01Z

The H-1B visa is a gateway to the American dream for skilled immigrants, but the path for some is paved with anxiety, guilt, and uncertainty. Big Tech companies like Amazon, Meta, Google and Apple are among those allocated the highest number of these visas annually. And they can pay top dollar — sometimes as much as $500,000 — to secure talent, H-1B data reviewed by Business Insider shows. The largest demographic of H-1B beneficiaries over the last decade has been Indian nationals working in computer-related roles, according to USCIS records. Business Insider spoke to seven current or former H-1B recipients who moved from India and found work in Big Tech. Their experiences reveal a program that grants access to life-changing opportunities and also imposes limitations that shape everything from career moves to family planning. Business Insider's review of H-1B filings reveals the salaries that Big Tech companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, and Meta are paying employees. See the salary data here. Tech layoffs, immigration policy shifts, and a booming Indian tech sector add to the daily pressure of living on this temporary visa in the United States. For some, high salaries and career opportunities make the precarity worth it; for others, doubt is creeping in. These are their stories, as told to Business Insider. Pushkar Singh, 31, is a staff engineer at Google, where he's worked in AI ads. He lives in California. The H-1B visa has allowed me to continue my work in the US, but the biggest issue is the psychological toll. I've been on an H-1B visa with Google for nearly seven years. My appetite for risk is lower because of my visa. Although you can switch jobs on an H-1B, you want to avoid moving to companies where there are high turnover rates to avoid getting fired. You've contributed so much in work and taxes, but if you're laid off, you only have 60 days to find a new job. You don't have the luxury of waiting for the economy to improve before getting back into the job market. I joined Google in Bangalore in 2015. I was interested in AI, but there weren't many opportunities in India. All the cutting-edge work was happening in Silicon Valley. In 2017, the company relocated me to work on the ads team in California on an L-1 visa, which is for internal company transfers. I wanted to switch to an H-1B visa to give me a bit more peace of mind because you can't really switch companies on an L-1. Google sponsored my petition, and I was selected in the H-1B lottery on the first attempt in 2018. I've helped develop cool technologies for Google Ads, like PMax, which helps small businesses use AI for their advertising. Alongside the psychological impact of being on an H-1B, there's also uncertainty around family. My wife and I have to be mindful about starting a family or moving our parents here. If I lost my job, I might have to take my entire family back to India within 60 days. I've seen misconceptions about the H-1B visa that it is replacing US jobs. Companies that hire a lot of H-1B workers have to give Americans fair opportunities for employment. I also get paid similarly to my US colleagues, so I don't think it's fair to say H-1B visa holders are cheap labor. I support the H-1B program but also think it can be improved. Having part of the application process take the person's achievements into account, like other visas such as the O-1 or EB-1, could mean that good people don't miss out. Surabhi Madan, 30, is a senior software engineer at Google. She lives in New York. I've been with Google for eight years and am a senior software engineer. Now I'm in a phase of my life where I'm thinking more about long-term stability. I enjoy my work, but there is an internal expectation to do well because, on an H-1B visa, my performance is the only thing in my hands. I've thought about teaching full- or part-time, but I can't have a secondary job on an H-1B. A career change also seems challenging: I would have to return to a student visa to get a graduate degree, and salaries for high school teachers may not meet the minimum requirement for work visas. I came to the US in 2013 to pursue a bachelor's at Brown. I interned at Google's New York office and landed a full-time offer before I graduated. I kicked off the process for my Optional Practical Training and received my H-1B visa in the lottery on my first try. Once, after returning to the US from traveling abroad, a border officer asked me about the purpose of my visit. I said, "I live here." The officer responded, "You don't live here; you work here." I remember thinking, "It's true." Even after more than a decade in the US, I have challenges that my friends don't. My life feels temporary in a lot of ways. I'm anxious about making mistakes when I drive or file taxes. I don't volunteer because I'd have to contact my immigration lawyer to check that it wouldn't jeopardize anything. Friends are buying apartments and thinking about having families. I find it hard to put down roots. Every time I renew my apartment lease, I have the option for one or two years. I always choose one year. My visa has become a consideration in family planning, too. I've looked into egg freezing recently. But I had this vision of having to return as a tourist with a suitcase to pick up my eggs if my status changed, and decided it wasn't worth it. I also can't imagine having another person depend on me while on a temporary status tied to my job. Once a year, I ask myself if this is still worth it. So far, the answer has been, "yes." Living in the US has granted me so many opportunities; I'm grateful. On the days I feel more anxious, I focus on the things in my control. I also have a decent financial cushion, another huge benefit of working in tech in the US for eight years. Debpriya Seal, 40, lives in California. He was laid off from Twitter in 2022, leaving him with 60 days to find a new employer to sponsor his visa and remain in the US, per the program's restrictions. In early November 2022, I got an email saying I'd been laid off. It was the worst season of my professional life. I came to the US for a master's degree in 2012 and joined Twitter in data engineering four years later. Twitter transferred my H-1B visa from my previous company and sponsored my green card application, which is still pending. Being laid off was emotional because I'd given six years to Twitter, but I didn't have much time to think about it. I had to find a new job before my visa ran out in 60 days. The aggressive timeline felt like I was running down the clock. It was a constant dilemma to try to be prepared enough for interviews in a time crunch. I looked for data and machine learning jobs, trying to get referrals from friends. I probably applied to around 50 companies overall. Requiring a visa sponsorship probably made things harder for me. The first thing I'd say when speaking with HR departments of potential employers is that I'd require sponsorship. When you apply to Big Tech companies like Facebook, Apple, or Amazon, this generally isn't an issue. During the application process, a few companies told me they couldn't sponsor H-1Bs. The market was tough. It was the last quarter of the year, when companies tend to slow hiring. I hoped I'd find a job in time, but I had to consider moving back to India. I started looking into selling my possessions on Facebook Marketplace. After roughly a month, I was offered a staff software engineer position at Intuit. They filed for my H-1B transfer. I was so relieved. I've since moved to a role at LinkedIn. Overall, my experience with the H-1B visa has mostly been positive. I can renew it and change companies relatively smoothly. There are just a few elements I'd say are unfair, like the fact that the lottery is basically a lucky draw, and the 60-day window if you get laid off. Soundarya Balasubramani, 29, is the founder and CEO of The Curious Maverick LLC. She divides her time between San Francisco and Bengaluru, India. I moved to the US on an F-1 visa to study at Columbia, then got a job at Salesforce, which sponsored my H-1B visa. Salesforce, where I was a product manager from 2019 to 2021, had a comprehensive internal process for sponsoring my H-1B. I uploaded my passport and degree certificates to a portal and was later I was told I'd been selected in the lottery. Big companies also often have in-house legal counsel or partner law firms to handle immigration processes for employees. In January 2023, I moved back to India to start a company focused on educational content and talent mobility. I felt I needed to move to become a founder. (My US work authorization meant I had to stay employed by the company that hired me.) Coming back to the US was always part of my plan. I applied for an O-1 visa, which is for "extraordinary individuals," with my own company sponsoring me. It was approved in 2023, and I moved back that October. Getting an O-1 is much harder than getting an H-1B. The visa is for people at the top of their fields, so the burden of proof is pretty high. I had to submit evidence, such as awards, publications, and recommendations. Although the American immigration system has problems, I can't imagine making the same kind of money anywhere else. My starting salary at Salesforce was $130,000, plus bonus and stocks. I could save aggressively and send money back home. People on H-1Bs ask me about starting a side project. They have ideas, but feel like they can't execute them because of immigration restrictions. India is booming, and I think people in the US are feeling a pull. They wonder if the green card backlog or constant fear of layoffs is worth it. Indians on H-1Bs get criticism from two sides. Some people make negative statements about there being too many Indians in the US tech space, but there are also Indians who'll say you're propagating brain drain from India. Debjit Saha, 38, is the cofounder and CTO of HomeAbroad Inc., a real estate company in Buffalo, New York. I started a company in the US as an H-1B visa holder. I have to follow the rules very carefully while running my business. I came to the US in 2013 on a student visa for a master's in computer science. After finishing my studies, I started a full-time software engineer role at Oracle, where I worked until June 2021. They sponsored my H-1B. While at Oracle, I had an idea for starting a business. My cofounder and I were discussing how immigrants struggle to get good mortgage rates because they lack credit history. We wanted to build a solution. I relied on my employer for my H-1B visa status and was cautious of not violating my immigration status. Attorneys I consulted told me I could invest in the business but couldn't run its day-to-day operations. My cofounder was the CEO while I continued working for Oracle. Eventually, I left the US in 2022 while our business, HomeAbroad, petitioned to transfer my H-1B. To transfer my visa, our company had to show that it could pay me a salary that matched what those in similar occupations in our area made. We're a bootstrapped company, so my cofounder and I invested our own money in the company as working capital. My salary was then paid through operational revenue. In 2023, I returned as the CTO. As an H-1 B holder, I have to be careful to only do the type of work outlined in my petition. Even though I'm the cofounder, I can't do things outside my remit as CTO, like marketing. It's a slippery slope, so it's always good to consult attorneys about whether you can take on a certain responsibility. I've been following recent immigration debates and have tried to have a fallback plan. I'm looking into the EB-1 green card pathway. The H-1B visa has helped me build a career in the US, and I feel fortunate to be building my company here. The Indian market is growing, but I think America is still the best place to get an education and enter the workforce. Vaashu Sharma is a senior software engineer at Airbnb, who moved from California to Bengaluru in November 2024. I did my bachelor's in India and moved to the US in 2016 to pursue a master's in computer science at Stony Brook University. After graduating, I landed a job at IBM. I got an offer from Meta a year later and worked there for four years. I was on a type of student work authorization called OPT for three years before I got my H-1B visa in my fourth attempt at the lottery. In 2022, I moved to Google for a new challenge. Two years later, I moved to Bengaluru. Being closer to my family and the culture I grew up with was my biggest reason to move home. I was tired of missing celebrations and festivals. I also felt Big Tech companies' presence had increased in India since I left. I saw positive changes in the products being built and salary potential. Visa challenges also made my husband and me want to move home. We fell into different cycles for our three-year H-1B visa renewals. While we were allowed to live and work in the US once our extension was approved, international travel became complicated. Once you leave the US on an old visa stamp, re-entry is only permitted with a renewed stamp. Post-pandemic, visa appointments were limited due to a significant backlog. Because it was so difficult to secure a slot in India to get new stamps, we weren't traveling back home. We missed important events and were scared that if we ever got bad news about our family in India, we couldn't be there. The H-1B also felt restrictive. We made good money and were growing our careers, but we couldn't pursue side hustles or take a career break. And the worry that we could be deported was always there. I landed a senior software engineer role at Airbnb in Bengaluru. Groceries can be delivered within 10 minutes, and we can afford to hire help with cooking and cleaning. The pros of living in India heavily outweigh the cons, like overcrowding or pollution. Sai Chiligireddy is an engineering manager at Amazon, where he works on Alexa. He lives in Seattle. I came to the US in 2014 to pursue a master's at Texas A&M University. I knew I could receive a longer period of student work authorization as a STEM major. Even if I didn't get an H-1B, I thought I'd have three years of solid work experience and could pay off any loans before moving back to India. After graduation, I worked for a year and a half at Juniper Networks. It was there, while trying for the H-1B lottery, that I heard about a Canadian visa program that gave applicants points based on their education, family ties, and work experience. I moved to Canada after landing a software engineer position at Amazon — and three failed attempts at getting an H-1B in the lottery. I loved my team in the Vancouver office, and the move boosted my career. But starting from scratch twice in five years was the most emotionally taxing thing I've ever done. I'm not an extrovert, so leaving my friends and family in the US and building new relationships was difficult. I got citizenship after living in Canada for three years. Shortly after, I moved back to Seattle because my H-1B application was pulled in the lottery on my fourth try. There are positives to living in the US as a Canadian citizen. I feel less restricted than my Indian friends, who need to get their visas stamped overseas and spend their vacation time waiting for embassy appointments. Canadians are eligible for the North American Free Trade Agreement professional or "TN" visa, which I can fall back on if there are changes to the H-1B. I still face challenges. The queue for green cards is based on the country of birth, and is exceptionally long for those born in India. I'm still on H-1B, and even though I have more leeway than others, I make sure that I am giving 100% or more at work and try to ensure that I'm always providing value to the company so my job is safe. My job would feel more like a job if I had a green card; now, it's what keeps me in the US.

Title: Who Pays The Cloud Compute Bill?; AppLovin Bounces Back On Ads

Time Published: 2025-08-08T04:03:13Z

Your SaaS Is Grass The great AI pivot happening across business sectors right now – particularly in data-driven marketing – has led to a sudden, strange gap in the payment models of many SaaS and ad tech companies. The Information has some insider details on software companies, such as Replit and Anysphere, that cranked up revenue after launching successful generative AI coding agents in the past year or two. But even 12x growth in annual recurring revenue (i.e., SaaS earnings), as in Replit’s case, has proven insufficient. As of February, the company’s gross margins were an attractive 36% – but they’ve since dropped to negative 14% post-agentic launch, because Replit’s LLM bills are based on usage. And usage is through the roof. Earlier this week, AdExchanger reported on Zillow’s pilot test of “containerized RTB.” This is another example of vendors – here Index Exchange and Chalice – having to deal with cloud bandwidth costs that must be retrofitted into the CPM-based ad tech business model. Relatedly, LiveRamp CEO Scott Howe announced on the company’s earnings call earlier this week that it’s begun testing a new usage-based pricing model, currently in beta with 40 customers, based on its issuing of “fungible tokens across all products.” These tokens act like interchangeable units or credits that customers consume as they use LiveRamp’s services. AdLovin AppLovin has been on a rollercoaster ride since mid-February, when several anonymous investors and funds published critical reports and shorted the stock. Its share price dropped from $510 to $220 over just a couple of weeks. But AppLovin has mostly bounced back. Its shares now stand at $437 as of the end of trading Thursday. AppLovin was helped by its positive Q2, during which its ads business grew 77% to $1.26 billion. The company’s updated guidance calls for between 58% and 60% growth for the rest of the year, notes Eric Seufert at Mobile Dev Memo. There’s more, though. AppLovin also placed an important stake in the ground. CEO Adam Foroughi told investors that the company’s self-serve commerce advertising beta program – a product akin to Meta’s Advantage+ Shopping Campaigns and Google’s Performance Max – will open to all advertisers by the first half of 2026. That’s a big step, considering AppLovin has carefully limited its participants, which helped buoy campaign ROAS since there are fewer advertisers soaking up the demand. Something to watch out for: When AppLovin’s commerce media becomes an open program, achieving the same performance benchmarks will be much more difficult. Grok ’N’ Roll No CEO? No problem. While we’re at it, who needs a media buyer, strategist or account manager, either? According to Elon Musk, X certainly doesn’t. He says Grok will replace all three of them. Musk’s vision, as described during a live Spaces session on Wednesday, is that brands will eventually be able to outsource the entire process of creative production and optimization to Grok. Once advertisers upload their ads to Grok, Musk said, advertisers won’t need “to do anything at all.” His goal, Digiday surmises, is to get people “to buy directly from the app.” But buyers aren’t sold. During the Spaces, senior marketers from Lowe’s, Uber, SharkNinja and Kia tuned in to ask questions – and they specifically highlighted their brand safety concerns. But, hey, at least the ads will be, uh, pretty? Roman Grachev, who leads X’s ad engineering team (which exists apparently?) was present during the session and noted that Grok will assign an “aesthetic score” to all ads uploaded to the system. The ads that the AI model deems superior will have preferential ranking in the app. But Wait! There’s More! Magnite hints at future legal action against Google. [Digiday] WPP’s profit margin is down 70% as it suffers from client losses and macroeconomic effects.

Title: Trump opens the door for crypto and private equity in your 401(k) plan
URL: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-401k-changes-cryptocurrencies-private-equity-executive-order/
Time Published: 2025-08-07T23:48:01Z
Full Content:
Watch CBS News August 7, 2025 / 7:48 PM EDT / CBS/AP President Trump on Thursday signed an executive order that could allow millions of Americans saving for retirement through 401(k) accounts to invest in higher-risk private equity and cryptocurrency assets. The executive order doesn't immediately change how people will invest for retirement through their employer-sponsored accounts, as federal agencies would need to rewrite regulations to allow expanded investment choices. That's a process that experts say could take months, or longer, to complete. But once done, employers could offer a broader array of mutual funds and investments to workers, according to the White House. New plans could invest in alternative assets, particularly private equity, cryptocurrencies and real estate. The move comes as the 401(k) has become the primary vehicle for American workers to save for retirement, with most employers offering a menu of investment choices among major asset classes, such as stock-based mutual funds. The $5 trillion private equity industry, which makes investments into private businesses rather than publicly traded stocks, has for decades wanted to compete for a role in retirement plans. At the same time, the cryptocurrency industry, whose executives strongly supported Trump's 2024 campaign, has aimed for more mainstream acceptance among Americans. "It was inevitable that bitcoin would make its way into American 401(k)'s," said Cory Klippsten, the CEO of Swan Bitcoin. "As fiduciaries realize bitcoin's risk-adjusted upside over the long term, we'll see growing allocations, especially from younger, tech-savvy workers who want hard money, not melting ice cubes." The EO could give private equity and crypto firms long-sought access to a pool of funds worth trillions. Investment companies applauded Mr. Trump's executive order, with TIAA, which manages the retirement assets of teachers, professors and other academics, and investing giant BlackRock saying they support the measure for providing a broader number of investment strategies to workers. "We believe end investors can benefit from the advantages that private investments can offer when embedded within professionally managed vehicles like target date funds or through guaranteed annuity products," TIAA said in a statement emailed to CBS MoneyWatch. The president's order directs the Labor Department and other agencies to redefine what would be considered a qualified asset under 401(k) retirement rules. Americans' retirement plans are governed by a law known as the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, better known as ERISA. Employers are required by law to offer retirement options that are in the best interest of their employees, not Wall Street. Most retirement plans for Americans are made up of stock and bond investments, and to a much lesser extent, cash and heavily traded commodities such as gold. Even after the regulations are written, it will take time for the major retirement plan companies such as Fidelity, Vanguard, T. Rowe Price and others, to develop appropriate funds for employers to use. Employers are not likely to revise their retirement plan options quickly as well, so it may take several years before crypto and private equity investments are mainstream in an individual's retirement plan. The price of bitcoin was up 2% on Thursday to $116,542 and has nearly doubled since Trump was elected. Under Democratic President Joe Biden, federal regulators were to treat cryptocurrency investments with "extreme care" because of the extreme volatility of crypto. It is not uncommon for bitcoin, ethereum and other big cryptocurrencies to move up or down 10% in a single day, whereas a 2% or 3% single-day move in the stock market would be considered historic. For cryptocurrency companies, which donated millions to Trump's campaign as well as his inauguration, one goal was to get their industry qualified under ERISA. Coinbase, one of the largest crypto companies in the United States, was also a major donor toward Trump's military parade in Washington this summer. Under Trump, the Securities and Exchange Commission dropped its lawsuit against Coinbase, where the Biden administration said crypto should be treated as a security. Crypto is particularly popular among young Americans. While volatile, bitcoin has generally moved upward since it was created by an anonymous programmer nearly 20 years ago. Private equity firms rely heavily on high-net-worth individuals and state and private pension plans, which have extremely long investment timelines. But having access to Americans' retirement assets would open up a deep pool of cash. Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman has told investors going back to at least 2017 that it was a "dream" of his and the industry to be able to draw upon these retirement assets. Previous administrations, Republican and Democrat alike, had agreed that private equity investments, which can be riskier, more expensive and less liquid than traditional stock and bond market mutual funds, should not be included in 401(k) plans. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

NEW YORK, Aug. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo” or the “Company”) (NYSE:NVO) in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired Novo securities between May 7, 2025, to July 28, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors have until September 30, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day.

Title: JUST IN – Trump Executive Order To Expand 401(k) Investment Options, Including Crypto

Time Published: 2025-08-07T23:00:34Z

US President Donald Trump is preparing to sign an executive order this Thursday that could shake up how Americans invest for retirement. The move would allow 401(k) plans to include a wider range of assets — like private equity, real estate, and yes, even cryptocurrency. The order, as reported by Bloomberg News, tells the Labor Department to take another look at the current rules under ERISA — that’s the Employee Retirement Income Security Act — and figure out how to give retirement plan administrators more room to include less traditional, higher-risk investments. Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer has been tasked with working alongside the Treasury, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and other federal agencies to make this happen. The main goal? Give plan sponsors a clearer roadmap to offer more diverse investment options, without falling foul of the law. Donald Trump will sign an executive order that aims to allow private equity, real estate, cryptocurrency and other alternative assets in 401(k)s https://t.co/IXetIBnTzL — Bloomberg (@business) August 7, 2025 Right now, most of the $12 trillion sitting in 401(k)s is invested in good old-fashioned stocks and bonds. But with this new push, savers might soon get the option to invest in assets that were once out of reach. That said, it’s not as simple as just adding a few new buttons on a retirement dashboard. Offering private equity or crypto means plan administrators will have to show that they’ve done their homework — that the managers are qualified, the fees are fair, and that everything lines up with fiduciary standards. Supporters of the move argue that expanding into private markets could lead to better long-term returns, especially in times when public markets are lagging. Critics, however, worry about the downsides — like high fees, limited access to funds, and the risks that come with less liquid investments. Big players like Blackstone, Apollo, and KKR could benefit big-time from the change. In fact, BlackRock is already planning to roll out a new 401(k) fund with private investments in 2026. Empower Retirement is expected to launch similar offerings later this year. What really stands out in this executive order is its nod to crypto. It’s the latest in a series of moves that show Trump warming up to digital assets. Just this past summer, the White House hosted “Crypto Week,” discussed new rules for stablecoins, and even floated the idea of a national Bitcoin reserve. The new order reportedly asks the SEC to loosen restrictions that have kept crypto out of most retirement plans. If successful, this could open the door for Bitcoin, stablecoins, and other digital assets to become part of Americans’ retirement portfolios.

Title: Trump signs order opening way for alternative assets in 401(k)s

Skip to comments. Posted on 08/07/2025 3:19:37 PM PDT by JSM_Liberty U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday that aims to allow private equity, real estate, cryptocurrency, and other alternative assets in 401(k) retirement accounts. The order smoothes the way for private equity and other fund managers to tap into trillions of dollars of Americans' retirement savings. It could open up a vast new funding source to managers of alternative assets outside of stocks, bonds, and cash, though critics say it also could bring too much risk into retirement investments. "The Securities and Exchange Commission must consider ways to facilitate access to alternative asset investments by participants in defined-contribution retirement plans," ... the White House said.

Title: Trump opens 401(k)s to private equity. Here's how much to invest.

Time Published: 2025-08-07T22:03:46Z
Full Content:
In the past, the private equity world has been largely populated by ultra-rich investors, endowments and pension funds. That is about to change. Retirement savers with 401(k) accounts are gaining access to the private investment market, which mostly pivots on privately held companies, rather than public ones. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, announced in June that it will offer a 401(k) target-date retirement fund that includes private investments, with a launch date in 2026. Another retirement giant, Empower, said in May that it will offer private investments in some workplace accounts later this year. Other retirement plan providers have made similar moves. And President Trump signed an executive order on Aug. 7 that calls for federal guidance on adding private investments and other "alternative assets" to 401(k) plans, effectively opening the door to those investments for retirement savers. "Alternative assets, such as private equity, real estate, and digital assets, offer competitive returns and diversification benefits," a new federal fact sheet states. "President Trump is expanding access to these assets to ensure a dignified and comfortable retirement for all Americans." Firms that invest in private assets are pushing to gain access to 401(k)s and other “defined-contribution” workplace retirement plans, a $12 trillion market. Private equity firms raise money to buy, manage and sell companies for profit. Investors are typically very wealthy individuals or institutions. The private credit marketplace loans money to companies or individuals outside the banking and fixed-income industries. Regular retirement savers haven’t had much access to private investments in the past. The minimum investment in a private equity fund might be in the millions, or at least the hundreds of thousands, according to Investopedia. Your money might be tied up for years. But there’s a reason wealthy investors and endowment managers like private equity funds. In recent decades, “They actually have done better than the stock market by 1 to 2 percentage points,” said Robert Brokamp, a senior adviser at The Motley Fool. Private equity yielded average annual returns of 10.5% from 2000 through 2020, Investopedia reports. Other estimates range higher. Private equity is considered a high-risk, high-return alternative to the stock market, which, of course, carries its own risks. “Why do wealthy people like it? Because it has the highest upside,” said Keith Singer, a certified financial planner in Boca Raton, Florida. Along with the upside comes a steep downside. Private companies face fewer regulations and reporting requirements than public ones. It can be hard to divine how much money a private company earns. “These are private companies, and with that comes less transparency,” Brokamp said. “That’s part of the reason people stay private: They don’t want to do all the regulatory filings that come with going public.” The number of public companies has dropped “by about half” since the mid-1990s, Brokamp said. Private companies tend to stay private longer and do public stock offerings later. Stocks carry risk, but a retirement saver who puts money in an S&P 500 index fund is “investing in some pretty well-established companies,” Brokamp said. Private equity, by contrast, often involves companies in distress. Bankruptcies run higher. “Private equity is riskier than public equity,” said Caleb Silver, editor in chief of Investopedia. “It’s more speculative in nature because you are investing in companies that, in some cases, have no proven track record.” Given the risk, Silver suggests an everyday retirement saver should not invest “more than 10% of your portfolio” in private investments: “It’s simply too risky.” Some of the emerging 401(k) offerings seem tailored to manage that risk. BlackRock, for example, plans to offer private investments within a broader target-date retirement fund. Target-date funds generally offer a mix of stocks, bonds and other investments, with the mix growing more conservative as you approach retirement. The new BlackRock fund would allocate only 5% to 20% of its holdings to private investments, with the quotient dropping as you age. Private equity tends to be illiquid: Investors generally see their money tied up for months or years. In a 401(k), by contrast, you can typically buy or sell investments daily. That should be less of a concern, though, when private equity sits in a target-date fund, which includes publicly traded investments that can be sold if an investor wants out. In 2020, the Trump Administration issued an “Information Letter” instructing that 401(k)-type retirement plans could invest in private equity without violating federal regulations. The law requires 401(k) managers to act in the best interest of investors, protecting them from large losses and excessive fees. The new executive order instructs federal agencies to make any regulatory changes necessary to allow for private investments and other alternative investments, including cryptocurrency. Some observers fear, however, that the risks of private investment may be too steep for everyday retirement savers. In June, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) penned a letter to the CEO of Empower about its plan to offer private investments in 401(k) accounts. “Given the sector’s weak investor protections, its lack of transparency, expensive management fees, and unsubstantiated claims of high returns, we are seeking information on how your company will ensure the safety of the billions of dollars of retirement savings it safeguards as it implements this program,” Warren wrote. Empower responded, in essence, that retirement savers deserve a crack at the lucrative private investment market, after decades of exclusion. “Empower believes in the democratization of private investing,” wrote Edmund F. Murphy III, the Empower CEO. Even so, leaders of the 401(k) industry will “feel more comfortable” about private investments if Congress approves legislation that explicitly allows it, said Thomas Gahan, managing director of Procyon Partners, a financial advisory firm in Shelton, Connecticut. Gahan spoke to USA TODAY before Trump signed the executive order. Gahan predicts more 401(k) providers will offer private investments as an option in the target-date funds, as BlackRock plans to do. “I think it’s a stepping stone,” he said. The 401k industry may eventually allow any retirement saver to invest in funds made up entirely of private investments, Gahan predicted earlier this year, but probably not without legislation that explicitly permits the investments – or an executive order from Trump. That order has now arrived. “This will happen over time,” he said, “not overnight.”

On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day.

Title: Precious Akpe-Moses storms into 100m final at European Under-20 Championships

The race is already on for the latest addition to the Irish athletics medal rush, Precious Akpe-Moses putting herself into contention by making the 100 metres final on day one of the European Under-20 Championships. Akpe-Moses stormed through her heat and semi-final during Thursday’s opening sessions in Tampere, Finland improving her lifetime best to 11.62 seconds when nailing her automatic final spot by finishing second in her semi-final. The younger sister of Gina Apke-Moses, who won this 100m title at the European Under-20 100m title back in 2017, her semi-final time improved her previous best of 11.64 and she’ll go into Friday’s final ranked fourth fastest overall. Racing in the third of three semi-finals, Apke-Moses needed to make the top two to ensure qualification, and did exactly that – the athlete from Blackrock AC, in Louth, finishing second to Uliana Stepaniuk from Ukraine, who is still only 17, and who improved her best to 11.50 when winning. Conor Kelly went into his 400m heat the top ranked under-20 in Europe, his 45.85 clocked at the Morton Games last month the only sub-46 second entry. The Finn Valley AC athlete, who turned 18 last month, qualified with ease, winning his heat in 46.94 seconds, clearly keeping plenty in reserve. Sean Doggett, from Athenry AC, also finished second in his heat in 47.59 to secure automatic qualification for Friday’s semi-finals. Cormac Dixon is also the top-ranked athlete in the 3,000m, running 7:56.59 indoors in the US earlier this season, and the Tallaght AC athlete also cruised through, finishing fourth in his heat in 8:19.80 – that final set for Saturday’s evening session. Cian Crampton, from Edenderry AC, made it safely through to Saturday’s final of the discus, ranked fourth overall with his best throws of 57.94m to finish second in Group A. A big performance from Theo Hanlon (Suncroft AC) in the men’s shot put qualifiers also landed him in the final, with a best of 18.00m. There were a couple of near misses, Gemma Galvin, from Ennis Track AC, flailing just short of making the 1,500m final after running 4:25.06 to finish seventh in her heat. She ended up ranked 13th overall, with the top 12 progressing. Oisin Lynch, from Killarney Valley AC, also missed out on a place in the 800m final, running 1:50.88 to finish fifth in his heat, while Ethan Dewhirst (Tir Chonaill AC) was disqualified for a false start in his 400m hurdles heat. In the 50 years since John Treacy claimed Ireland’s first medal in these championships, winning bronze in the 5,000m in Athens in 1975, plenty of other successful names have followed in his footsteps, including Mark Carroll, Ciara Mageean, Sarah Lavin, Sarah Healy, Kate O’Connor and Rhasidat Adeleke. In the last month alone, Irish athletes have won 11 international medals, Kate O’Connor winning gold in the heptathlon at the World University Games, before Nicola Tuthill added silver in the hammer. Tuthill also won the silver medal at the European Under-23 Championships in Bergen, Norway, one of four Irish athletes to win medals there, along with Anika Thompson (gold in the 10,000m and bronze in the 5,000), Nick Griggs (silver in the 5,000m) and Eimear Maher (bronze in the 1,500m). At the European Youth Olympics in Skopje, North Macedonia last month, another four Irish athletes won medals: Erin Friel and Ben Sykes won bronze in the 400m and 100m respectively, before Ellis McHugh and Joe Burke also won bronze in the 400m hurdles and 200m respectively. Elsewhere, Sarah Lavin was back in action days after winning her 10th Irish title in the 100m hurdles, and took another impressive win at the Serbia Athletics Meeting in Belgrade, which is part of World Athletics Continental Tour Bronze series, clocking 12.90 seconds.

Title: Trump clears way for alternate assets like private equity, crypto in 401(k)s

President Trump signed an executive order Thursday allowing alternative assets like private equity, cryptocurrency and real estate in 401(k)s. The order directs the Labor Department to review guidance around private market investments in retirement plans subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Trump’s directive smoothes the way for private equity and other fund managers to tap into trillions of dollars of Americans’ retirement savings. It could open up a vast new funding source to managers of alternative assets outside of stocks, bonds, and cash, though critics say it also could bring too much risk into retirement investments. “The order directs the Securities and Exchange Commission to facilitate access to alternative assets for participant-directed defined-contribution retirement savings plans by revising applicable regulations and guidance,” the White House official said on condition of anonymity. Such a move could be a boon for big alternative asset managers such as Blackstone, KKR and Apollo Global Management by opening the $12-trillion market for retirement funds, known as defined contribution plans, to their investments. Some of those firms have already struck partnerships with asset managers who run those plans. The world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, plans to launch its own retirement fund that includes private equity and private credit assets next year. Stay up on the very latest with Evening Update. Please provide a valid email address. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Never miss a story. Empower, the second-largest retirement plan provider in the US, said it’s joining asset managers like Apollo to start allowing private assets in some accounts later this year. Bitcoin, the world’s top cryptocurrency, was aboout more than 2% to $116,819.60 shortly after Trump signed the order at around 3:50 p.m. ET. Trump ordered Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer to work with federal regulatory agencies like the Treasury Department and Securities and Exchange Department – the latter of which was asked to facilitate access to alternative assets. During Trump’s first term, the Labor Department issued fresh guidance allowing private market exposure in 401(k) plans. Since his return to the White House, officials have been weighing whether to ease some of the legal concerns that have long kept alternative assets out of retirement plans, which consist mostly of stocks and bonds. Allowing private assets in 401(k)s gives savers more investment options and could result in greater returns, proponents have argued. Critics contend these assets are risky and could leave retirement plan administrators vulnerable to lawsuits. The order follows Trump’s campaign pledge to make the US “the crypto capital” of the world. He recently signed into law the first piece of legislation regulating stablecoins pegged to the US dollar, and in March issued an executive order calling for the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Trump’s White House includes venture capitalist David Sacks of San Francisco-based firm Craft Ventures, who serves as the first-ever AI and crypto czar. His administration has taken a friendlier approach to regulating the industry, dismissing and putting on pause lawsuits and probes that target crypto giants like Coinbase and Robinhood. The Trump family is involved in several crypto ventures of its own, including a sizable stake in crypto firm World Liberty Financial, investments in a bitcoin-mining company and Trump- and Melania-branded memecoins.

Title: 120 Million Square Feet: Store Closings In The United States Are On Pace To Set A New Record High In 2025

Time Published: 2025-08-07T19:49:14Z
Full Content:
The Economic Collapse Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression? If everything is going to be just fine, why are thousands of stores closing all over the country? So far this year, the total amount of retail space that has been permanently closed has surpassed 120 million square feet. We have never seen anything like this before. Store closings spiked during the early days of the pandemic, but in 2025 stores are being permanently shuttered at an even faster pace. In fact, during the first six months of this year 5,822 store closures were recorded… Store closures across the U.S. continue to rise, and remain on track to far significantly surpass both new openings and the figures seen in 2024. According to a new report from research and advisory firm Coresight Research, cited by CoStar News, 5,822 store closures were recorded as of June 27, compared to 3,496 closures announced during the same period of 2024. If stores continue to close at this rate, we will break the old record that was established during the pandemic by a wide margin. We are also being told that the total amount of retail space that has been permanently shuttered in 2025 has reached a staggering 120 million square feet… In June, store closings by Plano, Texas-based home goods seller At Home and Philadelphia-based pharmacy chain Rite Aid, which have both filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, “pushed the total amount of retail space to close in the U.S. this year to over 120 million square feet,” Coresight said. The real estate churn is happening “as cyclical impacts confront structural shifts,” according to one executive at the research firm. Wow. You may have noticed that there are an increasing number of abandoned buildings in your particular area. Sadly, this is just the beginning. Consumers are under more financial stress than we have ever seen, and that has resulted in a substantial decline in store traffic… Many of the retail store closures are a result of declining store traffic as more consumers respond to inflation by reducing spending. There also are more consumers turning to online shopping especially for apparel, accessories and household items. The winner is not merely Amazon but increased competition from Temu and Shein marketplaces and social commerce outlets like TikTok. Needless to say, more stores are being closed down with each passing day. After filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, Claire’s announced that it will be closing 18 more stores… Claire’s, a mall-based teen accessories retailer, has identified several locations across the country it plans to close after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Claire’s U.S., which operates Claire’s and Icing stores, made the filing in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware on Wednesday. It’s the second time since 2018 the company has filed for bankruptcy. While the company says the majority of its retail stores will remain open while it “continues to explore all strategic alternatives,” Claire’s said it identified 18 stores ahead of the Aug. 6 bankruptcy filing it would close, filings show. And home goods retailer At Home just announced that it will be closing 6 more stores… The home goods retailer At Home is closing an additional six stores across the country, bringing its total closure tally to more than two dozen as it grapples with high debt and dwindling sales. The furniture and home decor retailer based in Coppell, Texas, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on June 16, pointing to “broader economic and retail-specific market pressures,” in court documents. The bankruptcy filing and store closures follow several other “big box” retailers that have also significantly downsized their brick-and-mortar footprints this year, including Big Lots, Joann Fabrics, Kohl’s, JCPenney, Macy’s, and Party City. The retailer intially announced 26 store closures in June, before paring that down to 24 when it decided to keep open two stores in New Jersey and Wisconsin. The company added another six stores to the list, according to a statement by retail firm Hilco Consumer-Retail on Aug. 1, bringing the current number of stores it will shutter in the coming months to 30. We see more stories like this every single day. So what is going to happen if our economic momentum continues to take us very rapidly in the wrong direction? Earlier today, we learned that the percentage of student loans entering serious delinquency is absolutely exploding… The total amount of outstanding student loan debt was $1.64 trillion in the second quarter of 2025 after rising by $7 billion in the quarter. Additionally, the share of student loan debt entering serious delinquency, considered 90 days or more late, jumped to 12.9% at the end of June, up from 8% in March and above pre-pandemic trends that were around 9-10% from 2012 into early 2020, when the moratorium initially took effect. The American people are drowning in debt, and I expect delinquency rates of all types to continue to rise in the months ahead. We are going to see more layoffs too, and the fact that continuing claims for unemployment benefits just hit their highest level since 2021 is not a good sign at all… Recurring applications for unemployment benefits surged to the highest since November 2021, adding to recent signs that the labor market is weakening. Continuing claims, a proxy for the number of people receiving benefits, rose by 38,000 to 1.97 million in the week ended July 26, according to Labor Department data released Thursday. On top of everything else, U.S. manufacturing activity is now in contraction territory… From March to July, U.S. manufacturing activity contracted, according to the Institute for Supply Management’s monthly survey. The Manufacturing PMI last registered at 48, below the 50 score that differentiates growth and decline. The effective average tariff rate on all imported goods now stands at around roughly 18% versus 2.3% last year, the highest levels since the 1930s. We are in so much trouble. After evaluating all of the latest economic numbers that have come in, Mark Zandi has come to the conclusion that the “economy is on the precipice of recession”… Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, on Monday wrote a post on X that the “economy is on the precipice of recession” – citing the weaker-than-expected jobs report released Friday and the inflation data from the previous day that showed consumer prices rose as indicating the economy’s precarious position. “Consumer spending has flatlined, construction and manufacturing are contracting, and employment is set to fall. And with inflation on the rise, it is tough for the Fed to come to the rescue,” he wrote. It is hard to argue with him. Of course what is eventually coming is going to be so much worse than just a “recession”. As conditions deteriorate, will store closings slow down or will they speed up? The answer to that question is obvious. If there are stores in your local area that you really enjoy, I would visit them now while you still can, because they might not be there next year.

August 07, 2025 15:14 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Aug. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, announces the filing of a class action lawsuit on behalf of purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2025. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s growth potential. Notably, Novo Nordisk’s asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood that such patients would switch to Novo Nordisk’s branded alternatives. Further, defendants greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise, Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: Creatorverse: The Billion-Dollar Appeal of Creator-First Subscriptions

How Substack, Kajabi, Patreon and more are solving the industry’s sustainability problem Hey Creatorverse readers, A lot of digital ink has been spilled about the money you can make in the creator space. But while social media monetization and brand deals get a lot of love, less is written about highly profitable subscription-based universe of the creator ecosystem. “[Social media platforms] are constantly going to tweak the algorithm to make sure that the way they make money is optimized. But if you’re a creator and you’re used to certain rules of the game and that changes, your business can go upside down overnight,” Ahad Khan, CEO of Kajabi, told me. For a monthly fee, Kajabi allows creators to build assets like digital shops, email newsletters, courses and podcasts. Instead of floating around in YouTube or TikTok’s algorithm hoping the right person clicks on the right link, platforms like Kajabi give creators a way to build a more direct connection to their fans. And the company has emerged as a sustainable option for many creators. Since the company’s launch in 2010, creators have collectively earned $10 billion through Kajabi, according to the company. Overall, 1,800 Kajabi creators have reached millionaire status, more than 70 have crossed the $10 million threshold and at least one has surpassed $100 million. According to Khan, creators only need to make about $8,300 a month in order to build a six-figure business. “It’s a very sustainable way to make a living, if you do it right,” he said. And Kajabi is far from alone when it comes to profitable platforms that directly connect creators to their fans. Here’s what companies are saying about how much creators are making on their platforms: Creators who use platforms like these don’t have to post as often since offering pay-walled content gives them a way to make passive income. Not only does that help eliminate burnout, but it also gives creators more control over their businesses. Entrepreneurs who use these platforms are also much more likely to use social media to promote their paid offerings than rely largely on social monetization. Of course, this isn’t a strategy that works for everyone. The biggest categories under Kajabi’s umbrella are health, fitness, business and finance — topics that have an evergreen quality to them and that people are always anxious to learn more about. But it just shows there is at least some sort of tried-and-true strategy for the 15% of creators who are making over $100,000 a year. Now onto what you may have missed the rest of the week. Kayla CobbSenior Reporterkayla.cobb@thewrap.com P.S. You don’t want to miss a livestream roundtable I’ll be moderating, “Creator Power: The Business of Influence,” at noon PT on Aug. 14. Sign up today here. Clarification: A previous version of this story mistakenly classified Raptive as a subscription based company. It is actually a creator media company with open web creators and has been removed from the list. Regal is hoping Dude Perfect will do for it what Taylor Swift did for AMC The theater chain struck a deal with the five-person duo known for trick shots. Starting in September, the “Dude Perfect: The Hero Tour” documentary will play on more than 800 screens across the U.S., U.K., Western Europe and Australia. The original deal will run for two weeks with an option for extension. Though more creators have been heading to theaters lately (“House of Eden” anyone?), this move is more about Regal trying to fill the 25%-drop-in-ticket-sales hole in its heart. But even for a group that has over 61 million subscribers on YouTube, Dude Perfect probably won’t bring in the crowds Taylor Swift brought to AMC. Amazon’s betting more on creator podcasts, and Nielsen is getting into the podcast tracking game Wondery CEO Jen Sargent is leaving the Amazon-owned podcasting company in the midst of a restructuring move that will impact roughly 110 jobs. Basically, Amazon is folding Wondery’s narrative podcasts into Audible and focusing more on creator-led talk shows like Jason and Travis Kelce’s “New Heights” and Dax Shepard’s “Armchair Expert.” Also this week, Nielsen announced it will be collaborating with Edison Research to launch a podcast dataset as part of the company’s media planning tool. Two big news stories, one big bet on podcasts. WGA is starting to seriously talk about creators ahead of 2026 negotiations As the elections for the WGA West board heat up, YouTube creators are becoming a source of discussion. Board candidate Dahéli Hall said that the guild needs to find a “nuanced way” to protect creators, and incumbent board member Adam Conover agreed that creators were the “future.” It’s still early days,and it’s very possible this idea will be dropped. But the tides, they are a-turnin’. Meta, YouTube and Reddit are up All three companies were winners this quarter, owed in large part to the rise of AI. YouTube’s ad revenue hit almost $10 billion for the quarter, a 13% year-over-year increase. As for Reddit, the influx of AI chatbots worked in the company’s favor, increasing its revenue by 78% to hit just under $500 million in its second quarter — the best growth the company has seen since 2022. But the big winner was Instagram and Facebook’s parent company Meta. The company’s $48 billion revenue caused its shares to jump 11%. Roblox surpasses 100 million daily active users You know who else did well? Roblox. The online game platform averages 111 million daily active users during the quarter — a 41% increase — and secured $1.44 billion in net bookings. Roblox continues to be a massive deal, especially among Gen Z and Gen Alpha gamers. In fact, videos related to Roblox have surpassed 1 trillion views on YouTube, an achievement the company celebrated with the YouTube’s Roblox Museum. Snap and Spotify are down You know who didn’t have a great quarter? Snap. After its reported $1.34 billion in revenue missed Wall Street’s expectations, shares for the company dropped 15%. CEO Evan Spiegel blamed a bungled update and Trump’s trading policies for the weak quarter. Spotify also had a hard August with its shares dropping 11% after earnings — the biggest decline the company has ever seen. But fear not. The music streamer’s stock has already bounced back 7% after the announcement of its price hike.

Title: 'Disaster in the Making': Trump to Open 401(k)s to Crypto, Private Equity Vultures

Quality journalism. Progressive values. Direct to your inbox. U.S. President Donald Trump signs an executive order in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on July 31, 2025. "Stuffing private equity, crypto, and other 'alternative assets' into 401(k)s is about propping up scams and bailing out an industry that's run out of buyers," said one critic. U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order on Thursday that would allow private equity and cryptocurrencies into Americans' 401(k)s, appeasing corporate interests that lobbied for the change and disregarding warnings about the risks it poses to retirement accounts. Citing an unnamed senior White House official, CNN reported that "the order calls for the Labor Department and Securities and Exchange Commission to issue guidance to employers about providing access to those alternative investments in their retirement accounts." The private equity industry has been working for years to gain access to a portion of the roughly $12 trillion that Americans have saved in workplace retirement plans. "This is the holy grail for private equity," Axios reported Thursday, noting that federal rules currently bar most defined-contribution plans from investing in private equity and crypto. Both industries spent big on the 2024 election; the investment management behemoth BlackRock, whose CEO has advocated opening 401(k)s to private equity, donated to Trump's inaugural committee. James Baratta and Whitney Curry Wimbish noted in The American Prospect earlier this year that "there was added desperation from the industry" for access to 401(k)s "because of their dire need for cash amid weakening performance and fewer deals." "Some firms have begun mortgaging their own funds for money to pay out limited partners," they added. "Retail investors represented trillions in untapped potential." "Private equity executives have enriched themselves by the billions, taking high fees and other charges from working people's hard-earned retirement savings in pension funds." Helaine Olen, managing editor at the American Economic Liberties Project and a longtime personal finance columnist, said in a statement Thursday that "stuffing private equity, crypto, and other 'alternative assets' into 401(k)s is about propping up scams and bailing out an industry that's run out of buyers—and it's being done at the expense of Americans' retirements everywhere." "There's a reason most employers didn't bite when Trump tried this the first time and why the private investments industry has put on such a thick lobbying campaign," said Olen. "These funds are high-fee, risky, and opaque. Private equity consistently underperforms the S&P 500. This is a windfall for billionaire fund managers and a disaster in the making for regular Americans trying to save for retirement." Last week, the Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund and American Federation of Teachers released a report warning that if private equity is given a foothold in 401(k)s, "millions of workers saving for retirement would be exposed to higher risks and steep fees in products that lack basic investor protections and transparency requirements." The report found that private equity profitability "has been in a year-over-year decline" for the past two decades and that "fee structures—paid directly by investors or indirectly through portfolio companies—are prone to extensive manipulation." Lisa Donner, co-executive director at Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund, said that "private equity executives have enriched themselves by the billions, taking high fees and other charges from working people's hard-earned retirement savings in pension funds." "Now they want fees from the trillions of dollars in individual retirement accounts," Donner added, "putting millions of more people at risk." U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order on Thursday that would allow private equity and cryptocurrencies into Americans' 401(k)s, appeasing corporate interests that lobbied for the change and disregarding warnings about the risks it poses to retirement accounts. Citing an unnamed senior White House official, CNN reported that "the order calls for the Labor Department and Securities and Exchange Commission to issue guidance to employers about providing access to those alternative investments in their retirement accounts." The private equity industry has been working for years to gain access to a portion of the roughly $12 trillion that Americans have saved in workplace retirement plans. "This is the holy grail for private equity," Axios reported Thursday, noting that federal rules currently bar most defined-contribution plans from investing in private equity and crypto. Both industries spent big on the 2024 election; the investment management behemoth BlackRock, whose CEO has advocated opening 401(k)s to private equity, donated to Trump's inaugural committee. James Baratta and Whitney Curry Wimbish noted in The American Prospect earlier this year that "there was added desperation from the industry" for access to 401(k)s "because of their dire need for cash amid weakening performance and fewer deals." "Some firms have begun mortgaging their own funds for money to pay out limited partners," they added. "Retail investors represented trillions in untapped potential."

Title: Oligarch’s Heirs Reveal US Fund Bets in Family Office Revamp

Time Published: 2025-08-07T17:02:30Z
Full Content:
Badri Patarkatsishvili’s family set up a firm to manage his multibillion-dollar fortune after the mustachioed Georgian tycoon died suddenly at his English mansion in 2008. As his heirs fended off opportunists seeking a slice of the billionaire’s assets, the money manager kept a low profile, offering few details of how it handled the wealth he amassed alongside fellow oligarchs Boris Berezovsky and Roman Abramovich following the collapse of the Soviet Union. That’s starting to change. The Patarkatsishvilis’ family office, Bili Capital, has revealed more than two dozen bets on funds from some of the biggest names in global finance, including BlackRock Inc. and Ares Management Corp., on a recently launched website. Patarkatsishvili’s 70-year-old widow, Inna, the de facto head of the family after his death, also ceded her stake in the firm within the past year, registry filings show. That move coincides with the resolution of a long-running legal battle over the fortune of Georgia’s one-time richest man, and has separately led to Inna’s son-in-law, Yevhen Hunyak, 51, becoming Bili Capital’s only shareholder. As a result, a second-generation member is now in sole control of one of London’s biggest — and historically most discreet — family offices for the first time. A representative for the Patarkatsishvili dynasty, who describe Bili Capital as a multi-generational family office overseeing more than $1 billion in assets, didn’t respond to requests for comment. The disclosures give rare insight into one of the biggest fortunes to emerge from Russia’s so-called “wild ‘90s” as the country transitioned from communism to a market-based economy. They also make the once-secretive Bili Capital more transparent than many other family offices, whose public profiles often comprise a single-page website with little information. At least one-fifth of individuals among the world’s 500 biggest fortunes now have a family office that help to oversee wealth totaling more than $4 trillion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Bili Capital’s “transparency on what they’re doing makes them much more accessible, and relatable, to the outside world,” said David Hawkins, founder of Cliveden Advisory, a strategic consulting and reputation-management firm for ultra-wealthy individuals. “They likely want to do more deals.” Bili Capital’s other fund allocations include Silicon Valley venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz, index-fund pioneer Vanguard and Mubadala-backed Fortress Investment Group. It also oversees direct stakes in a Georgia theme park, a mineral-water company and a real estate developer serving Miami’s Fisher Island enclave for the ultra-wealthy. ‘The Muscle’ Patarkatsishvili began to build his fortune in the early 1990s when he teamed up with Berezovsky, one of the most influential oligarchs of that decade, to run car dealership LogoVaz. The pair later partnered with Abramovich to help establish Russian oil giant Sibneft out of state-owned assets, with Berezovsky leveraging his Kremlin connections and Patarkatsishvili keeping business relations running smoothly behind the scenes. “Berezovsky was the public face of their alliance, while Badri was the muscle,” said David Lingelbach, who headed Bank of America Corp.’s Russian operations during the 1990s and is now a professor of entrepreneurship at the University of Baltimore. “He’s such an interesting oligarch as everything about him was so opaque. He was one of the most powerful — if not the most powerful – person in Georgia.” In 2001, Abramovich acquired the Sibneft stakes owned by Patarkatsishvili and Berezovsky for more than $1 billion after their relationship with the Kremlin soured. Berezovsky later tried unsuccessfully to sue Abramovich over that deal in one of London’s most high-profile legal battles, before he was found dead at his own English mansion in 2013. Abramovich is worth $7.8 billion today, according to Bloomberg’s wealth index. Bili Capital’s revamp comes after years of battles over the patriarch’s assets have receded, freeing his heirs to focus on what’s left of the fortune. Since his death, the family has been entangled in several cases, including a $3 billion claim in 2008 by Berezovsky, who alleged that a portion of his former business partner’s holdings — often stashed in secretive tax havens — rightfully belonged to him. Berezovsky withdrew his claim four years later, while the family also successfully fended off a distant relative positioning themselves as Patarkatsishvili’s heir. Another case dating to 2016 wrapped up this year at the UK’s highest court. By some estimates, the family has recovered at least $2 billion of Patarkatsishvili’s assets, though that’s just a fraction of what his overall wealth was believed to be at the time of his death. Branding Strategy Founded in December 2008, Bili Capital is led by Chief Executive Officer Sergey Ershikov and Chief Financial Officer Ilia Demidov, who both previously worked at Russian lender Alfa-Bank. Like other family offices, the closely held firm isn’t regulated as it doesn’t manage money for external investors, limiting transparency requirements. Allocating to funds instead of striking deals under its own name also allows it to keep a low profile, while its longtime holding entity is in Jersey, a low-tax territory neighboring the UK that offers exemptions from publicly disclosing consolidated accounts. A 2022 job posting for Bili Capital cited further assets including a yacht, a fleet of vehicles and several European homes, underscoring how the firm caters to both the financial affairs and jet-setting lifestyle of its owners. The online post also described the firm developing a “branding” strategy, signaling how it has been considering its public image for years. “Reputational capital is important,” said Hawkins, who also advises family offices. “It’s a necessary form of insurance.” In a section entitled “Meet our family,” Bili Capital’s website features a black-and-white image of Inna accompanied in a countryside setting by her two daughters: Liana, 45, the founder of an arts production company, and Iya, 42, a human rights activist. Iya’s husband Hunyak, the co-founder of a private children’s dental group and Bili Capital’s sole shareholder since September, stands to the right of the three women with a small gap between them. The group are all smiling, with no trace of their past traumas. ©2025 Bloomberg L.P. This article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.

Title: OpenAI Is About to Make Employees Millionaires

It’s a figure so large it almost loses meaning: $500 billion. That is the staggering valuation OpenAI, the company behind the revolutionary ChatGPT, could soon command. The company is in discussions with investors for a deal that would allow its current and former employees to sell their privately held shares, a source familiar with the matter told Gizmodo. This type of deal, known in financial jargon as a secondary sale or a tender offer, would more than double OpenAI’s recent $260 billion valuation, catapulting Sam Altman’s company into the same league as legacy titans like Costco. The news, first reported by The Information and Bloomberg, confirms the AI craze isn’t slowing down. But more importantly, it reveals OpenAI’s secret weapon in the brutal war for talent that is defining Silicon Valley. For the company’s employees, it means a massive payday is coming. For its rivals, it’s a clear signal that OpenAI is willing to pay any price to keep its geniuses in-house. OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment. To understand why a private company is suddenly worth half a trillion dollars, you have to look beyond its technology and focus on its people. The world of elite AI research is remarkably small, and companies like OpenAI, Google, and Meta are locked in a fierce battle to recruit and retain the few hundred minds capable of building the next generation of AI. Recently, this talent war has intensified, with Meta aggressively poaching top AI researchers from OpenAI, reportedly offering salaries well into the millions. How can OpenAI compete with guaranteed multi-million dollar paychecks? By turning its employees’ stock options into real, life-altering wealth. According to the source, OpenAI and potential investors, including Thrive Capital (founded by Josh Kushner, Jared Kushner’s brother), are discussing a deal that would let employees and alumni sell their stock. Based on past sales, many OpenAI staffers could pocket anywhere from $2 million to $10 million each, depending on their equity. This is the power of “golden handcuffs.” An engineer might be tempted by a rival’s massive salary, but it’s much harder to walk away when your current company is allowing you to cash out millions while your remaining stock continues to skyrocket in value. The deal transforms “paper wealth” into a tangible fortune, creating a powerful incentive to stay and see how much higher the valuation can climb. This financial maneuver comes as OpenAI is on a tear. The companyâs annualized revenue has nearly doubled to $12 billion in just a few months, driven by the massive adoption of ChatGPT and its enterprise products. OpenAI also recently secured $8.3 billion in new investment commitments as part of a larger $40 billion funding round. This massive influx of capital is a war chest. Investors are betting that OpenAI is poised for even bigger things, with the highly anticipated launch of GPT-5 expected in the coming weeks. A powerful new model could give it a decisive edge over its main rivals, including Google’s Gemini and Anthropic’s Claude. This financial muscle will allow OpenAI to accelerate its research, acquire complementary technologies, and invest in the incredibly expensive computing power needed to train more advanced models. At a time when all major players are in a race to build Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)âAI systems smarter than humansâOpenAI now has the resources to lead the pack. But such a high valuation also raises the stakes. OpenAI will be under immense pressure to deliver on the transformative potential its valuation implies, all while navigating the complex ethical and societal challenges that come with creating world-changing technology. This $500 billion figure confirms OpenAI is the undisputed face of the AI revolution. But it also raises a fundamental question. The company was founded as a non-profit dedicated to ensuring AI benefits all of humanity. Now, it operates as a hyper-capitalist rocket ship, fueled by venture capital and creating immense wealth for a select few. Does the future of AI belong to investors chasing returns and the engineers cashing in, or is there still room for the original mission of building something for everyone? As OpenAI’s valuation soars into the stratosphere, that question becomes more urgent than ever. Correction: A previous version of this article referred to Costco as a “legacy tech titan.” The wholesaler chain has a valuation close to that of OpenAI’s, though it is not a tech company.

The only thing stopping the mass layoffs isn't technology. It's that no CEO wants to be the first one to face the political firestorm. In a divided America, a Kentucky town used AI to strip away political labels and discovered its residents agree on almost everything. The move is a stunning reversal, proving that even the most powerful AI company can't ignore a mutiny from its loyal user base. Mo Gawdat thinks the next 12-15 years will be dark, not because of robots but because of our own âstupidity.â At a journalism convention, the talk was about AI's dangers. But at a local restaurant, I found a different story, one of pragmatic adoption, surprising creativity, and a quiet revolution already underway. After losing top talent to Meta and fumbling key deals, the ChatGPT maker just dropped two massive announcements in a single week, a powerful counter-attack in the brutal war for AI supremacy.

Title: Can Rupert Murdoch Conquer LA?

The tabloid baron will launch a West Coast version of the New York Post next year. Los Angeles can expect a lot more lurid tabloid coverage in its media future, to judge by the New York Post’s track record It’s been a busy week for Rupert Murdoch, the extremely elder statesman of American yellow journalism. He’s currently fending off a $20 billion lawsuit from President Donald Trump, who’s seeking revenge from the Murdoch-owned Wall Street Journal after it ran a story on a nude drawing and lewd note Trump denies he drew or wrote for the man he currently also denies was his close personal friend, Jeffrey Epstein. Trump also has an older score to settle with Murdoch’s Fox News for its early (and accurate) election-night call that Arizona had gone for Biden in 2016. The 94-year-old Murdoch claims his fragile health prevents him from being deposed for Trump’s suit against the Journal anytime soon. Anxious to ensure that the suit goes forward, Trump announced that he had come to an agreement with the frail tabloid titan that he must be apprised of Murdoch’s health every three days—in order to make sure, one assumes, that Murdoch isn’t getting away with anything. While Murdoch may be in delicate health, one of his media properties, the New York Post Media Group, made a surprise announcement this week that it’s expanding into Los Angeles. Murdoch is no stranger to LA. He owned 20th Century Fox for decades until Disney gave him $71.3 billion for the company in 2019. That deal greatly expanded Disney’s intellectual-property archive, but it left the film world with one fewer major studio making theatrical movies and flouting the industry’s now-dominant model of reviving legacy franchises ad infinitum. Murdoch’s new foray into LA media will be called the California Post and is projected to start rolling off the presses next year. What’s surprising is not that Murdoch still wants more of the media world—it’s that in 2025, he’s making a bold move into newspapers. Where every other media guru talks digital and streaming, of AI and YouTube channels and podcast empires, Murdoch chose to return to his 1950s roots in Adelaide, Australia. Back then, he had a particular genius for sensing weak newspapers in untapped, vital markets. And true to form, Murdoch and his top print team at the New York Post sensed a media market so underserved, and a competitor so weak, it must have reminded Murdoch of an ailing Aussie backwater recycler—Patrick Soon-Shiong’s Los Angeles Times. “Los Angeles is fast becoming a news desert,” the Post’s PR flacks announced on Monday. “Thousands of stories are going untold and countless perspectives aren’t being represented by a media ecosystem that has lost touch with the people—especially as the city and state face unprecedented challenges and leadership vacuums.” They’re not wrong. While the paper will be based in LA, Murdoch plans to cover the whole state with the California Post, from the Mexican border to Hollywood to Silicon Valley, Governor Gavin Newsom’s probable presidential run, and the Bay Area. And Murdoch will offer Los Angeles something it has not had in a long time—a tabloid paper. Los Angeles is the second-biggest media market in the country, with a population of 13 million. And yet the Times, the city’s iconic legacy newspaper, currently struggles with a print circulation of less than 70,000 and just over 200,000 online subscribers. The Times’ closest rival is the LA Daily News, with a print circulation of around 56,000. After Soon-Shiong bought the Times, he moved it out of its iconic downtown headquarters in 2018 to El Segundo. He then shut down its printing plant in 2024. At the start of this year, the paper laid off 115 editorial employees—more than 20 percent of its newsroom. This July on Jon Stewart’s podcast, Soon-Shiong announced that the Times will soon go public, under a plan similar to the municipal ownership scheme that’s kept the Green Bay Packers in the possession of its fan base. It’s not clear just how many remaining fans the LA Times can claim, but it’s likely well short of what it would take to reverse the paper’s tailspin. The LA Times blames its woes on this winter’s fires for decimating important print subscriber markets in the Palisades and Altadena, but that doesn’t account for the layoffs or the reported $30–50 million the paper loses annually. The current nosedive goes back to Soon-Shiong’s decision to kill the Times’ 2024 presidential endorsement for Vice President Kamala Harris. In her home state, and in a city targeted by Trump as a blue woke stronghold, Soon-Shiong’s decision looked purely craven. The Times endured the same brutal market reversals that Jeff Bezos’s Washington Post faced after the Amazon baron’s order to spike that paper’s Harris endorsement, suffering a steep drop in subscriptions and an equally devastating loss of credibility among its readership. When Soon-Shiong bought the Times, he wrote in an e-mail to his new staff, “As someone who grew up in apartheid South Africa, I understand the role that journalism needs to play in a free society.” As with Bezos—who was initially hailed as a brave voice against creeping MAGA authoritarianism in Washington—Soon-Shiong rapidly shed his pet image of himself as a supporter of crusading, reform-minded journalism in favor of editorial dictates all but designed to drive away serious news consumers. Bezos remade the Post’s op-ed section into a libertarian agitprop outlet. Soon-Shiong concocted an AI-makeover for the Times’ opinion coverage that assigns a bias meter reading for its published content, once more substituting inert and unreliable tech programming for critical thinking. Needless to say, the section’s editors fled shortly after the gimmicky experiment was announced. Keith Poole, the New York Post’s current editor in chief, sees big opportunities in the Times’s self-inflicted woes: “California is the most populous state in the country, and is the epicenter of entertainment, the AI revolution and advanced manufacturing—not to mention a sports powerhouse,” he said in the statement laying out plans for the California Post. “Yet many stories are not being told, and many viewpoints are not being represented. With the California Post, we will bring a common-sense, issue-based approach to metropolitan journalism.” The California Post should not have much trouble competing with the Times on its Hollywood and sports coverage. When Soon-Shiong took over the paper in 2018 he told The Washington Post, “One of our priorities is to be the sports paper of the nation.” And how did that go? “Of the 14 major pro and college teams in the region, the Times only has a traveling beat writer for the Lakers, Dodgers, Rams, Chargers, USC and UCLA,” The Sporting Tribune recently reported. After the Times sold its printing plant, it discontinued daily box scores, standings, and game stories because the paper’s news deadline was now 3 pm. The Post is also well positioned to have its Hollywood coverage overtake that of the Times. Even though the Times has a huge legacy advantage on this beat, back to publishing the work of reporters like the legendary studio-era gossip troll Hedda Hopper, the modern Times approaches the entertainment scene as just another industry—albeit one central to the region’s economy. Like most tabloid impresarios, Murdoch has always viewed entertainers and celebrities as the lifeblood of circulation. The British phone-hacking scandal, and the sensationalist coverage in the Post’s successful Page Six gossip franchise both underline how Murdoch properties thrive on gut-punch celebrity gotcha reporting. It’s a safe bet that the California Post will fill a massive gossip void in LA’s mainstream Hollywood coverage. Certainly there’s no shortage of paparazzi and TMZ-style scandal reporting coming out of LA—but you don’t find it in the Times or trade outlets like The Hollywood Reporter and Deadline. This week, the Times’ Hollywood Inc. section is covering the exits of several Paramount executives and management hires under the new Skydance buyout of the studio, as well as news of recent streaming deals. Page Six includes bikini photos of Gwyneth Paltrow’s daughter, Apple Martin, Raven Symone talking about her ex-boyfriend getting someone else pregnant and asking Raven to be the godmother, and paparazzi shots of Denise Richard with a possible black eye and allusions to domestic violence. It’s not that Los Angelenos are above that sort of thing, but the prestige-driven daily papers and trades want us to be. Murdoch knows we’re not, and it’s a market that’s never failed him. Sarah Sophie Flicker Joan Walsh Books & the Arts / John Fabian Witt Ben Schwartz But the broader challenge here is that the Post’s understanding of “commonsense” journalism is anathema to the Los Angeles reader base. The irony is that Soon-Shiong, in his fumbling mogul way, is already steering his paper toward a money-losing and MAGA-appeasing worldview. If that pivot costs him up to $50 million a year, and prompted the paper’s desperate move to a crowd-funded business model, why does the NY Post think it will fare any better by injecting “many viewpoints” into the mediasphere of Southern California? This week, Poole’s Post ran a cover featuring Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani and Senator Elizabeth Warren meeting in New York with the headline “African-American meets Native American.” It’s hard to see how a parallel embrace of race-baiting will appeal to readers in LA—particularly given Trump’s steady barrage of ICE raids at workplaces, churches, and playgrounds, all backstopped by the cynical deployment of members of the National Guard and United States Marines as political props. For this and countless other reasons, LA and New York do not have the same political base. LA’s last Republican mayor left office in 2001. It’s true that the California Post plans a statewide marketing strategy, meaning that the right-wing voters in the state’s interior, as well as Orange County and San Diego, could rally to the paper—though that will likely still be a tough sell to MAGA followers who increasingly consume news online and via social media and know that Trump views Murdoch as an enemy. Maybe Murdoch’s dramatic expansion plan will yield a robust new audience for the Post’s right-leaning tabloid fare—but it seems far more likely that, at least in LA, the California Post will join Murdoch’s acquisitions of MySpace and Vice Media as a big media bet that somebody should have talked him out of. In this moment of crisis, we need a unified, progressive opposition to Donald Trump. We’re starting to see one take shape in the streets and at ballot boxes across the country: from New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s campaign focused on affordability, to communities protecting their neighbors from ICE, to the senators opposing arms shipments to Israel. The Democratic Party has an urgent choice to make: Will it embrace a politics that is principled and popular, or will it continue to insist on losing elections with the out-of-touch elites and consultants that got us here? At The Nation, we know which side we’re on. Every day, we make the case for a more democratic and equal world by championing progressive leaders, lifting up movements fighting for justice, and exposing the oligarchs and corporations profiting at the expense of us all. Our independent journalism informs and empowers progressives across the country and helps bring this politics to new readers ready to join the fight. We need your help to continue this work.

Title: Eli Lilly Weight-Loss Pill Trial Disappoints, Offsetting Solid Profit and Sales

Ely Lilly (LLY) shares sank 14% Thursday when the pharmaceutical firm reported disappointing results from a late-stage study of its experimental obesity pill. The news offset Lilly's strong quarterly results. The company said in a Phase 3 trial, patients taking a 36 milligram dose of its oral GLP-1 drug, orforglipron, without food and water restrictions showed an average weight loss of 12.4%, or 27.3 pounds, in a 72-week period. That's below the 15% average weight loss of rival Novo Nordisk's (NVO) Wegovy injectable treatment. Some on Wall Street were looking for orforglipron to come in closer to that level. In an interview, Lilly CEO David Ricks argued that the company wasn't disappointed with the results even though they were "one or two points below what (the) Street had." Ricks added the goal was to create a pill that was convenient to take, could be made on a huge scale, and would provide weight loss that was competitive with other GLP-1 medicines, "and that's what we've achieved." The company explained that it plans to seek regulatory approval of orforglipron by the end of the year. Along with the orforglipron announcement, Lilly released its second-quarter financial data Thursday, reporting adjusted earnings per share of $6.31, with revenue up 38% year-over-year to $15.56 billion. Both exceeded Visible Alpha forecasts by a wide margin. The gains came from soaring demand for its current weight-loss drug, Zepbound, which had a 172% jump in sales to $3.38 billion. Sales of another GLP-1, Mounjaro, used to treat both obesity and Type-2 diabetes, were up 68% to $5.20 billion. Lilly raised its full-year adjusted EPS range to $21.75 to $23.00, compared to the earlier estimate of $20.78 to $22.28. It sees revenue of $60 billion to $62. billion, versus the previous outlook of $58 billion to $61 billion. Shares of Eli Lilly traded at their lowest level since January 2024. However, the study outcome lifted U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk 7%. TradingView

Title: Questioning the Corporation

Yves here. It’s frustrating to see a piece that presents itself as well researched get information important to its argument wrong. I still recommend the article below by John Ruehl because it provides a detailed discussion of the growth and development of the corporate form, going back to precursors in the Roman Republic. However, when he gets to the modern era, he makes some glaring error which ironically undermine his effort to depict modern large corporations as dangerously unaccountable to the public’s interest. First, Ruehl perpetuates the canard that corporations exist to serve shareholders, citing a too-often invoked Michigan ruling. In fact, shareholders are residual claimants. All others from the supplier to employees to the landlord to the taxman come ahead. We’ve debunked this idea long form many times. Hoisting from a 2014 post: One of my pet peeves is the degree to which the notion that corporations exist only to serve the interests of shareholders is accepted as dogma and recited uncritically by the business press. I’m old enough to remember when that was idea would have been considered extreme and reckless. Corporations are a legal structure and are subject to a number of government and contractual obligations and financial claims. Equity holders are the lowest level of financial claim. It’s one thing to make sure they are not cheated, misled, or abused, but quite another to take the position that the last should be first. As we wrote last year: If you review any of the numerous guides prepared for directors of corporations prepared by law firms and other experts, you won’t find a stipulation for them to maximize shareholder value on the list of things they are supposed to do. It’s not a legal requirement. And there is a good reason for that. Directors and officers, broadly speaking, have a duty of care and duty of loyalty to the corporation. From that flow more specific obligations under Federal and state law. But notice: those responsibilities are to the corporation, not to shareholders in particular…Shareholders are at the very back of the line. They get their piece only after everyone else is satisfied. If you read between the lines of the duties of directors and officers, the implicit “don’t go bankrupt” duty clearly trumps concerns about shareholders… So how did this “the last shall come first” thinking become established? You can blame it all on economists, specifically Harvard Business School’s Michael Jensen. In other words, this idea did not come out of legal analysis, changes in regulation, or court decisions. It was simply an academic theory that went mainstream. And to add insult to injury, the version of the Jensen formula that became popular was its worst possible embodiment. One good source for the fact that economists, rather than legal decisions, were the basis for the acceptance of this idea, is a 2005 article by Frank Dobbin and Dirk Zorn, “Corporate Malfeasance and the Myth of Shareholder Value.” This paper looked back to the 1970s, the era of diversified and often underperforming firms (remember the conglomerate discount?). Deregulation, high inflation, and a lax attitude towards anti-trust enforcment stoked a hostile takeover boom. Economists celebrated this development as disciplining chief executives and moving assets into the hands of managers who could operate them more productively. In reality, the success of these early deals depended mainly on asset sales, both of non-core operations and of hidden sources of value, like corporate real estate, as well as leverage and slashing bloated head office staffs (the across-the-company headcount efforts became more prominent in the 1990s). Later in that post, we describe the seminal role of an internally inconsistent New York Times op-ed in 1970 in starting this ideological ball rolling. Another serious sour note is when Ruehl depicts the like of BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard as wielding enormous influence with corporations. Earth to base, they don’t. These huge shareholders are indexers. Their business in index replication at the lowest cost. They don’t sell shares because they don’t like how a company is run. They might lighten up because its price falls and so it represents a smaller amount of the index. On top of that, all of these giant fund managers compete for the lucrative 401 (k) business of public companies. Think they are going to sabotage getting those mandates by pressuring the C-Suite? Even for active manager, this idea of investor influence was eviscerated in Amar Bhide’s classic Harvard Business Review article, Efficient Markets, Deficient Governance. Aside from a small cohort of activist fund managers (aka greenmmail artists), even a big fund manager will not hold a large enough position of a public company to make it worth the bother to get them to shape up. It’s easier to sell a stock whose management is doing things you don’t like. One proof of the impotence of big shareholders: In 2009, investors got wind of Goldman’s intent to pay staff big bonuses. They were opposed, seeing it as a slap in the face to taxpayers who’d bailed them out. A group visited CEO LLoyd Blankfein to tell him they strongly opposed the plan. Blankfein went ahead anyhow. So the real scandal here is not investor influence. It’s an agency problem, that top executives control corporate assets and influence the fate of employees and communities, yet for the most part are accountable only to themselves. By John P. Ruehl, an Australian-American journalist living in Washington, D.C., and a world affairs correspondent for the Independent Media Institute. He is a contributor to several foreign affairs publications, and his book, Budget Superpower: How Russia Challenges the West With an Economy Smaller Than Texas’, was published in December 2022. Produced by Economy for All, a project of the Independent Media Institute Home to almost 70 percent of Fortune 500 companies, Delaware’s reputation as America’s “corporate capital” has faced challenges in recent years. Tesla’s and SpaceX’s high-profile exits to Texas in 2024highlighted other cracks in Delaware’s seamless relationship with large corporations, compounded by other states jockeying to attract businesses. Delaware’s government has launched a legislative charm offensive in response, passing several amendments in March 2025, which have eased restrictions on insider deals and reinforced the state’s commitments to low taxes and a business-friendly legal framework. Corporations can be created in minutes almost anywhere, yet all share a core identity as legal entities with rights and responsibilities. Over time, they have replaced religious institutions and political parties as the most powerful actors in society, largely shaping what we consume, how we work, and influencing behavior and social norms. Their modern form traces back to 17th-century charters, with roots in Roman law. Though often tools of the state, global corporations have proven capable of operating across borders and legal systems, developing unprecedented sovereignty and power. The benefits of corporations, including lower prices from scale, capital-driven innovation and efficiency, and global reach, have been undermined by the relentless accumulation of financial assets, particularly in the West. Short-term gains often supersede long-term value and sustainability, and despite stronger regulation on paper, modern corporations operate with greater independence from the state and increasingly avoid public accountability. The basic model behind them remains intact, with core legal principles like limited liability and separate legal personality, stemming from early corporate charters from the 1600s and fully developed by the 1800s, still forming the corporate foundation despite enormous growth in their scale and influence. Over the years, calls for democratic renewal and institutional imagination have been mounting, pointing to a long-overdue rethinking of corporate power. Building up to and Defining the Corporation Before modern corporations, societies around the world developed institutions to pool capital and dilute risk for trade, construction, and investment. In the Roman Republic, societas publicanorum had transferable shares (partes), professional managers, and central offices, and bid on state contracts for tax collection and infrastructure. However, Roman law allowed any partner to dissolve the business at will, limiting their longevity, and these types of partnerships faded under the empire’s centralized bureaucracy. After 313 CE, following the Edict of Milan, which legalized Christianity, the Catholic Church gained legal standing that helped it become one of Europe’s first enduring corporate-like entities. By the eighth century, European monarchs began issuing charters that bestowed privileges to monasteries, universities, towns, and tax collection, while guilds of merchants and artisans also emerged in the 11th century. This century also saw the emergence of the commenda in Italy, which allowed passive investors to fund merchant voyages for a share of the profits, an early form of limited liability that spread across Europe. Family banking dynasties from Florence emerged in the 14th and 15th centuries, building pan-European financial networks and eventually expanding to other industries like mining and manufacturing. Similar models developed globally. The commenda is believed to be inspired by Islamic qiradpartnerships that began in the sixth century, where one party provided the capital and the other conducted trade. Beginning in the 1600s, large family firms in China thrived with imperial support. Maritime guilds thrived in Southeast Asian port cities like Majapahit and Srivijaya. Still, it was in Europe, where Roman and Canon Law fused, that legal innovation evolved most dramatically and took on the modern corporate form by the 17th century. Before the rise of modern corporations, most businesses were family-run shops, temporary partnerships, or informal arrangements that lacked legal separation from their owners. What earlier institutions lacked was the five features defining the modern corporation; representation allowing designated agents to act on behalf of the firm without binding investors; entity-shielding protecting corporate assets from the debts of investors; capital lock-in preventing investors from pulling funds or forcing liquidation; transferable shares letting investors exit without disrupting operations; and limited liability ensuring investors aren’t personally responsible for corporate debts. The most foundational corporate characteristic is a legal personality, the ability to exist separately from its owners, with its own rights and responsibilities. From the Latin corpus (“body”), this concept lends context to former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney’s controversial 2011 remark that “corporations are people.” These features enable corporations to attract capital, own property, sign contracts, and avoid dissolution with membership changes. They vary widely from public to private, with tradable or restricted shares, and can be state-owned, profit-driven, or mission-based. But nearly all corporations share these core traits, which have been used by some to build the most flexible, powerful, and enduring institutions ever created. The Dutch and British East India Trading Companies The Dutch East India Company (VOC), founded in 1602, is widely considered the first modern multinational corporation. Though joint-stock ventures had existed earlier (mostly as short-term partnerships for single voyages), the VOC stood apart by introducing permanent capital, tradable shares, and a form of limited liability, attracting strong investment. As maritime trade and colonialism expanded over the previous century, long-term capital was increasingly required for risky, lucrative ventures in spices, textiles, and tea. The VOC met this demand by locking in investment, limiting shareholder exposure, and providing an orderly way to exit. Backed by the Dutch state, it merged competing firms into a single entity with centralized management, enabling it to scale up with unprecedented freedom. Dutch political institutions also played a role in the VOC’s power. As a new republic, the Netherlands offered investors protection from royal interference. Unlike other European countries where royal families funded and closely monitored colonial expeditions, the VOC operated with more autonomy. It received a perpetual charter and became the first company listed on a stock exchange, and was empowered to sign treaties, raise armies, and wage war, all while shielding shareholders from personal accountability. Despite collapsing in 1799 due to debt and corruption, it pioneered a corporate form unlike anything before. Two years before the VOC’s founding, its counterpart, the English East India Company (EIC), was formed in 1600. The EIC didn’t obtain permanent capital until 1657 and was slower to adopt liquidity. But the English Civil War curbed royal power after 1657, allowing it to evolve in ways that mirrored the VOC. The Bank of England, founded as a corporation in 1694, helped stabilize credit lines and made it easier for the EIC and other corporations to raise capital. The EIC eventually came to colonize and rule large parts of India, establishing a civil service and even clashing militarily with the VOC. Yet its power drew intense scrutiny. Following the Bengal Famine of 1770, the English parliament passed the Regulating Act of 1773 and Pitt’s India Act of 1784, curbing the EIC’s powers. The company was finally dissolved in 1874. “In 1857, the Indians rose in revolt against high-handed and oppressive Company rule… The Company lost all its administrative powers following the Government of India Act of 1858, and its Indian possessions and armed forces were taken over by the Crown. … The East India Company itself was formally dissolved by Act of Parliament in 1874,” according to the UK Parliament website. Though the VOC’s model was emulated by the EIC and influenced commercial ventures elsewhere in Europe, such corporations remained a form of special incorporation granted by state charter, not open to anyone. This exclusivity began to loosen over time, but the South Sea Bubble crash of 1720, seen as the first major financial crash, triggered fears of economic instability and unchecked corporate power. In response, governments reimposed strict controls, requiring corporations to obtain specific approval and follow stringent guidelines. Corporations proved essential during Britain’s industrial revolution, which began in the late 1700s. To support economic growth, parliament introduced reforms: the Joint Stock Companies Regulation and Registration Act of 1844 allowed businesses to register without special legislation, while the Limited Liability Act of 1855 extended legal protections to shareholders. These reforms, combined with Britain’s access to capital markets and imperial power, kick-started rapid corporate expansion in Europe. Arriving late to maritime trade, the Dutch and English drove corporate innovation to keep up with other European powers. Politicians supported corporate growth, benefiting from lucrative shares in the monopolies they helped create. But the VOC and EIC demonstrated the promise and peril of corporations. They could generate wealth and wield power beyond what states alone could achieve, but they also bred corruption and posed political threats. European leaders, therefore, aimed to harness the benefits of corporations while limiting their power by closely tying them to government control. The United States and the Modern Corporate Form Early British joint-stock companies like the Virginia Company planted the first corporate seeds in North America in the early 17th century. But while European models like the VOC and EIC inspired early colonial enterprises, the corporate form developed more slowly in the U.S. after independence, in both scale and structure. Shaped by a deep-rooted “distrust” of monopolies and state-chartered privilege, and wary of corporations as instruments of elite power and financial instability, many Americans didn’t trust companies that had special deals with the government. Instead, they preferred smaller, more personal business models like family-run shops, partnerships between a few people, or joint-stock ventures where people pooled money but didn’t have the legal structure of modern corporations that offered them protections. The early U.S. enterprises also lacked strong, centralized authority and consistent legal protections, especially for property and contracts, and many investors in states like Florida, Texas, and California avoided corporate structures until they were included in the U.S. Constitution. Yet this decentralized system ultimately gave corporations room to grow. Without strong federal control, states competed to attract businesses by loosening incorporation requirements. New York led with the first general incorporation law for manufacturers in 1811, with other states soon following and expanding the scope of the law. The vast, unexploited North American landmass and push for industrialization made the corporate structure increasingly attractive, further aided by America’s quicker and widespread adoption of limited liability and lighter state oversight compared to Europe. While state legislatures tried to regulate corporations with rules on capitalization, voting rights, and director terms, these measures proved mostly ineffective. Corporations amassed enormous influence, with “company towns” illustrating their growing control over local economies and governance. Corporate imperialism returned under an American banner, with the United Fruit Company, which controlled enormous banana plantations in Central America and used its political influence to overthrow governments. These towns still exist in some shape or form today. “The original coal and textile towns in America are now largely ghostly, but places like Hershey and Corning, New York, which were invigorated by the Corning glass company, are still going strong. Plus, as the LA Times writes, businesses such as Google and Facebook today are providing housing, amenities, and transportation for their workers—meaning that while we think of company towns in sepia tones, they’re also in digital blue,” statesSmithsonian magazine. In The Visible Hand, Alfred D. Chandler Jr. suggests that the dominance of American corporations by the 20th century was due to their managerial hierarchies rather than entrepreneurs, which provided them with stability, coordination, and centralized planning. This is partly supported in The Company: A Short History of a Revolutionary Idea, which argues that robber barons were replaced by “the faceless manager” and the multidivisional firm. By the 1930s, legal scholar Adolf A. Berle and economist Gardiner C. Means, whose work shaped modern corporate governance theory, warned that dispersed shareholders had lost control to entrenched managers and called for reforms in corporate oversight. The 1919 Dodge v. Ford case had already enshrined shareholder primacy in U.S. law, declaring that directors must prioritize shareholder profits. But rather than democratizing ownership, the rise of institutional investors, like pension and mutual funds, and other financial giants, further concentrated power among select shareholders. By the end of the 20th century, globalization offered American corporations, as well as others, a platform to dominate beyond natural borders. The American corporate model became the ruling template in a worldwide ecosystem, largely controlled by shareholder interests and executive compensation tied to quarterly earnings pressures. The Growing Power of Corporations Over time, corporations have become the dominant business entities. Despite only representing 18 percent of U.S. businesses, corporations generate nearly 82 percent of all revenues. Around 20,000 large corporations employ as many people as the 31.7 million small businesses, according to the 2024 data provided by payment processor company Clearly Payments. Many of them now function as monopolies or organized cartels. In the 2010 Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission case, the Supreme Court affirmed that corporations have First Amendment rights, including the right to “use money amassed from the economic marketplace to fund their speech.” Borderless by design, major corporations drive a race to the bottom for cheap international labor and pass sustainability costs onto consumers. Countries often lack the strength to rein them in, and where they can, corporations simply exploit tax havens and flexible jurisdictions. As economist Lynn A. Stout observed, outdated yet profitable business practices like shareholder primacy are hard to shake. Accountability and sustainability appear largely ignored, with corporations long prioritizing profit over public safety. Asbestos manufacturers suppressed evidence of its deadly health effects to keep selling their products. Tobacco firms knowingly misled the public about cancer risks for decades.Purdue Pharma, owned by the Sackler family, used its LLC status and shell corporations to dodge accountability for the opioid crisis. According to an Associated Press investigation, “the Sacklers’ wealth is shielded in a web of companies and trusts, some registered in offshore tax havens far from Purdue’s Connecticut headquarters,” states a 2019 article by CBS News. Calls for corporate responsibility have grown as the power of corporations has increased. The corporate social responsibility movement began with philanthropy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and resurged in the 1970s. Beginning in the mid-2000s, ESG and stakeholder activism sought to revive this initiative, but became politicized and have waned, even as corporate influence continues to grow. As “universal owners” of the economy, institutional investors like BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street control vast shares and command corporate influence. While it was hoped their broad holdings would make them stewards of the economy, short-term thinking and weak oversight continue to limit meaningful action like prioritizing long-term sustainability, fair labor practices, and avoiding hoarding wealth. Corporations are wielding new tools of dominance through AI and digital technologies. “Companies such as Walmart, Tyson Foods, Koch Industries, Maersk, Siemens, and Unilever are using AI tools to swiftly find and engage with alternative suppliers during unexpected disruptions. They are also employing AI tools to pre-qualify suppliers ahead of time. These AI tools provide buyers with enhanced information that allows them to beat their competitors in securing alternate sources of supplies,” points out a Harvard Business Review 2023 article. They can also deflect accountability through PR campaigns, obscure controversies through complex supply chains and legal structures, and offload responsibility to subsidiaries, contractors, or consumers. Combined with the growing use of private military and security contractors, some modern corporations operating in unstable or contested regions are regaining a degree of coercive power reminiscent of the colonial-era trading giants. The core problem is that while we retain some voice in the political system, that influence doesn’t extend to massive corporate structures. “Voting with our wallets” offers little power when essential services are dominated by a handful of interconnected firms. Reform While the corporate model dominates, alternatives continue to evolve. In early 20th-century China, corporate law was weakly enforced, and corporations were uncommon. Today, China exerts control over both state-owned and private corporations, embedding Chinese Communist Party officials into corporate governance. This hybrid model places corporate activity under tighter oversight, supported in part by nationwide social credit scores for all companies. President Teddy Roosevelt promoted trust-busting as the solution to corporate abuse by big business, but as economist Lawrence Mitchell notes, the prior era of fierce competition among smaller companies was also disastrous. He identified the real problem of states competing for corporate charters in a “race to the bottom,” a danger that Justice Louis Brandeis also noted in 1933. Roosevelt even acknowledged in 1902 that only the federal government could properly regulate interstate corporations, which Mitchell supports. So, how should governments regulate monopolies? Some countries have taken a more open approach to consolidation. The German government, for example, legalized collusion and cartel formation to control prices and output in ways that serve national interests, actively encouraging the attempted merger of Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank since 2019. Cooperatives offer another path. The first successful cooperative, the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers, was founded in 1844 in the UK, championing democratic control, open membership, and profit-sharing. In Spain, the Mondragon Corporation, a federation of worker-owned cooperatives founded in 1956, has become the “leading business project in the Basque Country and one of the largest corporations in Spain.” Rather than lay off workers, Mondragon often reallocates them across its network. New reformist approaches are also emerging in Europe. France’s 2019 PACTE Act allows companies to define a social purpose beyond profit, embedding missions into corporate charters and expanding employee influence in mergers and executive oversight. Economist Mariana Mazzucato has promoted this mission-driven model as part of her vision for innovation-led governance. In the U.S., Delaware’s recent legislative push is part of a broader effort challenging shareholder primacy, notably since the 2019 Business Roundtable, where top CEOs pledged to serve all stakeholders. Delaware and other American states already allow businesses to register as benefit corporations (B-corps), balancing profits with goals like environmental protection or community development. Existing corporations can convert by amending their founding documents. CHS Inc., a major agricultural cooperative ranked 115th on the Forbes 500 list in 2025, meanwhile, demonstrates how cooperative principles still have traction in the country. It has emerged as one of the “largest farmer-owned cooperatives in the world.” Digital finance is also leading to experimentation in how businesses are owned and operated. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), for example, are blockchain-based communities with decentralized governance that make decisions by vote. Aiming for transparency and shared control, they face clear hurdles. Unclear legal status has slowed adoption, while security flaws, including a major 2016 breach, have seen millions stolen due to a code exploit. Governance challengesinclude low participation, power centralization, and slow decision-making. “In some high-profile DAOs, the majority of governance tokens are often held by the founders and early investors, which can skew decision outcomes in favor of their interests rather than the broader community,” states a blog by Colony, a platform providing a framework for DAOs. Not all innovation prioritizes the public good. The “Network State” concept, coined by tech entrepreneur Balaji Srinivasan, envisions venture-backed private cities, colonies, and zones across the U.S., Latin America, Africa, and beyond. These digital-first enclaves aim for diplomatic recognition and eventual sovereignty through special economic zones, framing private microstates as expressions of libertarian freedom. Efforts to reduce shareholder power can also backfire by merely concentrating power in the hands of corporate managers rather than all stakeholders. Elon Musk is a clear example; by retaining large ownership stakes, employing dual-class shares, and keeping firms like X, Tesla, and SpaceX private or under holding structures, he has shielded himself from shareholder influence while consolidating control. The planned incorporation of Starbase, Texas, a township effectively governed by SpaceX, demonstrates how this management style can dovetail with Network State ambitions. Born in the Dutch Republic, matured in England, and transformed by the United States, the march of the modern corporation has proven remarkably resilient over the centuries. Hudson’s Bay Company, founded in 1670 as an English trading giant like the EIC, once controlled vast swaths of North America and now exists as a retail chain. Corporate power in general, however, continues to expand. After early overreach by the VOC and EIC prompted containment efforts, corporations have resurged through globalization, financialization, and advances in technology. Short-term profit maximization is seen as natural, with structures geared away from wider stakeholder responsibility. Many firms resist direct governance to escape the negative optics of being seen as too powerful, which would bring more scrutiny and accountability. Yet some corporations have grown so large that they have become pillars of modern society and carry significant responsibility, even if they do not openly acknowledge it. Without altering their growing influence, the future will be shaped less by democratic will through established channels and more by concentrated, private authority. ‘So, how should governments regulate monopolies?’ I’m sure that the Chinese have a few good ideas. If any of their billionaires get out of line and start muscling in on the government (cough*Jack Ma*cough), they tend to go missing. Sometimes they turn back up again. Sometimes they don’t. In reading this article, I was struck how he insisted that corporations must aim for ‘longevity’. But in one of John Michael Greer’s novels – “Retrotopia” – he mentioned that it was not always so. That for example a corporation might be set up to build a road, it would raise the funds needed, it would then use those funds to have the road built, set aside money for maintenance, and would then dissolve itself after having completed the purpose that it was set up for. That sounded so strange the first time I read that. Some of it may depend on the type of corporation. A couple of examples from the entertainment and real estate areas. in the entertainment industry it is not uncommon for there to be a production company formed strictly for the production of one movie or television show. Because of the way it is financed or distributed it is hard to tell when you look at the credits. (As they are involved in distribution it does allow for some leeway in getting satisfaction if there is a problem.) The real estate part I know of is that it is not unheard of for the bigger company to form a LLC (Limited Liability Corporation) to actually construct a building. After the building is built the LLC “sells” the building but it is always done that they continue to hold all responsibilities for the construction, but that is just for show as it ceases to exist. “Blankfein went ahead anyhow.” Sounds like Llyod could serve in any number of ‘representative’ elected offices. Interesting reading the background to the idea corporations have to but shareholders first. It always bugged me for two reasons. I mean General Electric couldn’t decide ro day that they were going to start importing and selling heroin as they thought it would give a better return to shareholders. Clearly they still have to follow the laws of the land of face the consequences. And secondly, even if it was the case that it was a legal requirement, so what? It’s nit a law of nature or of physics. It could only ever be a law of man and those can be changed. As I recall, some conservatives advocate that corporations should violate laws if the profits ensuing from violating the laws are larger than the associated penalty. Maybe this is a calculation done by citizens as well, so corporations would be following Citizens United into people hood. A country could enforce laws and set the penalties for law violation high enough to discourage societal harmful behaviors. But the USA seems to have harsh justice for little people with a policy of “friends don’t let friends do time” for the rich and connected. I never go over the Ford pardon of Nixon as the pardon was justified as healing to the nation and Nixon had “suffered enough”. . In an it will never happen desire, I desperately want there to be minimum fines attached to overcharging or embezzling the government. I recognize that the system has been gamed enough that they don’t even have to pay back the government (see the special master throwing out the DOJ case against United Health for overcharging Medicare by 2 billion dollars), but in my world not only would it be incumbent on United Health for proving that the various supposed treatments occurred and that the charges were accurate for those treatments. And if they weren’t they would be required to pay back the full amount plus an additional 50% of that amount just to keep their C suite executives out of jail. There should be no return on investment for deceiving customers and employees. AND bankruptcy law should be rewritten to have owner corporation continue to be on the stick for any lawsuits or liabilities from fraud or malfeasance of fully owned subsidiaries rather than allowing that to die with the bankruptcy of said subsidiary. Whenever I hear of a corporation skating in some manner, I remember that beacon of Republican responsibility prosecuting minor crimes in NY left and right (homeless people washing windshields, minor drug offenses, etc) because that was going to increase overall adherence to the law. I always compared it to the trickle down theory as in all profits go to the top and all penalties go to the bottom. It’s not really talked about much outside of law journals but all of the British colonies in America were set up as corporate entities, not just the Virginia Company. If you read the charters of each of them, it’s truly not far off from corporate organization documents of today. The legacy of this structure remains and it seems very anachronistic but I guess it’s all we got. +1 on the reform path of Cooperatives. Just change the bylaws of a corporation to one member = one share/vote, you bring in democracy and accountability of the management to the workers. And I know this may sound crazy, but if, in the same spirit and reasoning chattel slavery was made illegal, we could do the same to human rental (i.e. wage system), all corporations with employees would effectively have to become Worker-Cooperatives. Instead of Capital renting humans, Humans would rent capital, which makes much more sense. It’s a great path towards democracy….. The venerable Hudson’s Bay Company shuttered its last retail store just a few months ago. The end of an era. Fond memories of their iconic point blankets and clothing. I bought one of the point blankets a couple of years ago as a sort of nostalgic, ironic hat tip to the early days of Canadian colonization, well aware as I am of the horrors that came with it. They were not made in Canada — Yorkshire, I think. I have no love for the Weston family but they just bought the original HBC charter and are donating it to a museum. https://www.piquenewsmagazine.com/the-mix/not-meant-to-be-manitoba-museum-reflects-as-bay-charter-heads-elsewhere-11049467 HBC was Canada’s East India Company, another example of colonialism at its worst. Very fine intro, Yves. A corporate charter was at one time simply a grant by the sovereign of limited liability to protect investors from being dragged underwater by a failing business concern. An investor might lose their share value in a business failure but their other assets were protected. This promoted investment in enterprises which benefitted the polity as a whole by building necessary infrastructure and providing employment. Under today’s system of Inverted Totalitarianism the corporations control the sovereign state through massive infusions of campaign cash while looting infrastructure and destroying employment in order to enrich corporate executives and officers encouraged by stock “incentive” compensation to game short-term performance through looting. Self-dealing executives and officers becoming major shareholders created an enormous conflict of interest. The “Last have become the First” negating the entire social justification for a sovereign grant of corporate status. All of which was proceeded by an ideology cut from/cobbled together and funded by Capital from bastardized theology aka TINA/Powell memo thingy … Thank you, Yves, for this article and the fine commentary. It’s indeed frustrating to see the zombie shareholder primacy myth making rounds, raising again from the dead to eat our brains. That’s specially true when the author even cites Lynn Stout, arguably the most important scholar to debunk this myth. But there’s one point I wanted to ask you for further thoughts, if you’d be kind enough to bear with me. I always thought that it was part of the plan for the ETF managers of the world (particularly BlackRock) to wield greater influence over big corporations. They certainly make loads of money with ETF on their own right, but when you index something like S&P500, you’re making sure you have the right stocks, i.e. of the corporations that actually matter right now. Ditto for oil, tech, whatever. It makes it much easier to coordinate a strategy among them. The common assumption is that Blackrock, Vanguard etc. are sitting on their hands with that much power on their hands. Although you’re right that they won’t sell the shares as a form of pressure, they can still vote as shareholders. Not selling their shares makes their threat more worrisome in this case. BlackRock became more notorious because it tried to do the old Whig/Democrat/liberal/”woke” thing of pretending to care about ESG etc. and, after this is accepted and normalized, legitimately exert its own illegitimate control for its own purposes. As the article noticed, the worst kind of push-back materialized (the Tory/Republican/”conservative” one); instead of pretending to care, we won’t even pretend anymore and outright burn anyone suggesting that we care about the environment, society, workers, consumers… Unfortunately, most of the evidence I have is my tin foil hat and the eternal lust for power of these groups. But you really think that the voting rights they get from significant proportions of shares in big companies is siting idle? I also don’t think I understood the 401(k) argument. Is it that corporations choose these institutional investors for managing the pension funds? Thanks for bearing with me! No, they will always vote with management (save extremely bad governance abuses) because they want the 401(k) business, which has vastly higher margins than running index funds. Tons of fees and grifting via how they handle trades by plan participants in and out of funds. Also the margins on index funds are too thin to support any kind of corporate lobbying. You actually have to have a reasoned position on important proxy issues. That takes staff. Indexers compete on the tightness of their index replication and having the lowest fees possible. Any extra expenses undermine competitiveness. A finer epitaph I know not … In full agreement as an owner of index mutual funds and ETFs. As an owner of Vanguard funds, my understanding of the corporate model is each fund exists as a entity with the fund share holders acting as beneficial owners, though I generally don’t vote or give a proxy for the annual meetings. The funds as a group own the actual “Vanguard” that provides all the services to the funds. As an investor, I mostly take an interest in managed funds when they want to pass resolutions changing the fundamental investing rules (what they can buy and hold). I have seen in the past efforts to allow funds to hold what I consider riskier holdings in order to goose short term returns. The link to the 1919 Dodge v. Ford case was interesting. Yves, great intro! The pep talks we got from upper management about “shareholder values” always made more sense when one substituted “my bonus”. And once all my co-workers saw how they were implementing these “shareholder values”, we realized that had morphed into “bone us”. Your email address will not be published.

Title: Does the Stock Market Know Something We Don’t?

The uncomfortable fact about its historic run is that no one is sure why it’s happening—or what could bring it to an end. Listen to more stories on the Noa app. This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here. Can anything stop the stock market? The U.S. economy recently weathered the worst pandemic in 100 years, the worst inflation in 40 years, and the highest interest rates in 20 years. Yet from 2019 through 2024, the S&P 500 grew by an average of nearly 20 percent a year, about double its historical average rate. Despite President Donald Trump’s erratic economic policies, which include the highest tariffs since the 19th century, the market is already up by about 8 percent in 2025. As the stock market soars ever higher, the theories of why it rises have suffered the opposite fate. One by one, every favored explanation of what could be going on has been undermined by world events. The uncomfortable fact about the historic stock-market run is that no one really knows why it’s happening—or what could bring it to an end. According to textbook economics, the stock market’s value reflects what are known as “fundamentals.” An individual company’s current stock price is derived from that firm’s future-earnings potential, and is thus rooted in hard indicators such as profits and market share. The value of the market as a whole, in turn, tends to rise and fall with the state of the broader economy. According to the fundamentals theory, the market can experience the occasional speculative bubble, but reality will bite soon enough. Investors will inevitably realize that their stocks are overvalued and respond by selling them, lowering prices back to a level that tracks more closely with the value justified by their fundamentals—hence the term market correction. The fundamentals story held up well until the 2008 financial crisis. Within six months of the U.S. banking system’s collapse, the market fell by 46 percent. In response, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to almost zero and pushed money back into the economy by purchasing trillions of dollars in securities from financial institutions. The Fed’s goal was to get the economy going again quickly. This didn’t happen. For most of the 2010s, corporate earnings were modest, GDP and productivity growth were low, and the labor market remained weaker than it had been before the crisis. In other words, the fundamentals were not great. Yet the stock market soared. From 2010 to 2019, it tripled in value. Rogé Karma: The Federal Reserve’s little secret This gave rise to what became known as the “liquidity” theory of the market. In this telling, the force driving the ups and downs of markets was the Federal Reserve. As long as the central bank was willing to keep flooding the financial system with cash, that money would eventually find its way into the stock market, causing valuations to rise regardless of what was happening in the real economy. The apotheosis of the liquidity theory came in early 2020: The stock market crashed when the coronavirus pandemic hit, and the Fed once again responded by turning on the money taps. By mid-summer, unemployment was still above 10 percent, but the stock market had already rebounded past its pre-pandemic peak. But the liquidity theory’s run was short-lived. In 2022, as inflation replaced unemployment as the economy’s biggest problem, the central bank reversed course, quickly raising interest rates and selling its securities. As the liquidity theory would predict, the stock market took a nosedive, falling by close to 20 percent. Then something strange happened. The Fed continued to raise interest rates over the course of 2023, to their highest levels in two decades, and kept them there in 2024. It also drained about $2 trillion of liquidity from the financial system. Yet the market took off once again. The S&P 500 rose by nearly 25 percent in both 2023 and 2024, making it the market’s best two-year run of the 21st century. “Between 2008 and 2022, the view on Wall Street was we were experiencing a liquidity-driven market,” Mohamed El-Erian, an economist and the former CEO of the asset-management firm PIMCO, told me. “That wasn’t at all the case in ’23 and ’24.” The stock market’s performance in those years was unusual for another reason. More than half of the S&P 500’s total growth in 2023 and 2024 was driven by the so-called Magnificent Seven companies: Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Tesla, and Nvidia. During those two years alone, Tesla’s value rose by 286 percent, Meta’s by 355 percent, and Nvidia’s by 861 percent. The biggest firms have always been responsible for a disproportionate share of the market’s growth, but never had the gains been so acutely concentrated. The phenomenon couldn’t be explained solely by superior business performance; the Magnificent Seven’s stock prices had begun to exceed earnings by record amounts, implying that their valuations had more to do with expectations about future growth. This gave rise to a new theory: The stock market was being supercharged by the coming AI revolution—or, at least, by belief in it. The Magnificent Seven’s extreme surge began in early 2023, shortly after the release of ChatGPT, which kicked off a wave of interest and investment in the AI sector. The seven companies seem especially well positioned to prosper from the emerging technology, either because they provide crucial inputs to the development of AI models (Nvidia), are investing heavily in building their own models (Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet), or stand to benefit significantly from automation (Amazon, Tesla, Apple). To some experts, the situation has all the markings of a speculative bubble. In a recent blog post, Torsten Sløk, the chief economist at the asset-management firm Apollo, pointed out that the top 10 companies in the S&P 500 today are more overvalued—meaning their stock prices exceed their earnings by larger factors—than the top 10 companies at the height of the 1990s dot-com bubble were. Take Nvidia, the chipmaker that recently became the first company in history to hit a $4 trillion valuation. Historically, the average price-to-earnings ratio for a company in the U.S. market has been about 18 to 1, which means that to buy a share of stock, investors are willing to pay $18 for every $1 of the company’s yearly earnings. Nvidia’s current price-to-earnings ratio is 57 to 1. AI boosters argue that these valuations are justified by the technology’s transformative potential; skeptics respond that the technology is far from being adopted at scale and, even if it eventually is, that there’s no guarantee that these seven specific companies will be the ones to rake in the profits. “We’ve seen this story play out before,” Jim Bianco, an investment analyst, told me, pointing to the dot-com crash of the early 2000s. “Just because there’s a truly revolutionary technology doesn’t mean stocks are correctly pricing in that reality.” If the current market froth is indeed an AI bubble, then a day must come when the bubble bursts. For a moment, that day appeared to have arrived on April 2, when Trump announced his “Liberation Day” tariffs. Over the next week, the stock market fell by 12 percent, and the Magnificent Seven took even steeper hits. But then, on April 9, Trump backed down from his most extreme tariff proposals and, a few weeks after that, de-escalated what seemed like an imminent trade war with China. The market swiftly recovered and launched into a bonanza even wilder than those of the previous two years. The S&P 500 has risen nearly 30 percent since its post–Liberation Day low, setting all-time records, and the Magnificent Seven have come roaring back. This gave rise to the concept of the “TACO trade,” as in “Trump always chickens out.” The idea is that Trump hates falling stock prices and will back off from any proposal that puts the market in jeopardy. So rather than sell their stocks every time the president threatens to impose crippling trade restrictions, investors should continue to pour money into the market, confident that the proposals Trump ultimately leaves in place won’t do much damage. The flaw in the TACO theory is that Trump hasn’t completely chickened out. Tariffs are the highest they’ve been in more than a century, and the president is announcing new ones all the time. Still, the market appears largely unfazed. When Trump announced “trade deals” with the European Union and Japan that set the tariff on most goods arriving from those places at 15 percent, the stock market actually rose. Even last week, when the president announced a sweeping new set of global tariffs—an announcement immediately followed by a brutal jobs report suggesting that tariffs were weakening the economy—the market suffered only a blip. As of this writing, it is higher than it was before the announcement. This leaves a final theory, one that has nothing to do with Trump, AI, or the Federal Reserve. Thirty years ago, almost all of the money in the U.S. mutual-fund market was actively managed. Retirees or pension funds handed over their savings to brokers who invested that money in specific stocks, trying to beat the market on behalf of their clients. But thanks to a series of regulatory changes in the late 2000s and early 2010s, about half of fund assets are now held in “passive funds.” Most retirees hand their savings over to companies such as Vanguard and Fidelity, which automatically invest the money in a predetermined bundle of stocks for much lower fees than active managers would charge. The most common type of passive fund purchases a tiny share of every single stock in an index, such as the S&P 500, proportional to its size. Annie Lowrey: Could index funds be “worse than Marxism”? Some experts believe that this shift is the best explanation for the otherwise inexplicably resilient performance of the stock market. “The move to passive funds is a radical shift in the structure of financial markets,” Mike Green, the chief strategist at Simplify Asset Management, told me. “To think that wouldn’t dramatically impact how those markets behave is just silly.” Active investors are highly sensitive to company fundamentals and broader economic conditions. They pore over earnings reports, scrutinize company finances, and analyze market trends, and will often sell at the first sign of an economic downturn or poor company performance, which causes markets to “correct.” Passive investors, on the other hand, typically just pick a fund or two when they set up their retirement accounts and then forget about them, meaning they are automatically buying stocks (and rarely selling), no matter what. In June 2020, for example, Vanguard released a statement bragging that fewer than 1 percent of its 401(k) clients had tried to sell any of their equities from January to the end of April, even as the economy was melting down. Thus, whereas a market dominated by active investors tends to be characterized by “mean reversion”—in which high valuations are followed by a correction—a market dominated by passive investors is instead characterized by “mean expansion,” in which high valuations are followed by even higher valuations. “When there’s a constant flow of passive money coming in, betting against the market is like standing in front of a steamroller,” Green said. “You’d be crazy to do it.” A market dominated by passive investors also naturally becomes more concentrated. Active investors tend to avoid larger stocks that they believe might be overvalued, but the opposite is true for passive investors. Because they allocate funds based on the existing size of companies, they end up buying a disproportionate share of the biggest stocks, causing the value of those stocks to rise even more, and so on. The explosion of passive funds over the past 15 years could explain why the market has become less sensitive to real-world downturns, more likely to keep going up no matter what, and dominated by a handful of giant companies. Or that theory could end up being disproved by unforeseen events. It wouldn’t be the first. Support for this project was provided by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.

Title: How AMD Stock Falls To $80

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. AMD stock (NASDAQ:AMD) has had a strong run this year so far, rising nearly 35% since early January, driven by recovering CPU demand and investor enthusiasm around generative AI. But with the stock now trading at a lofty 42x forward earnings, investors may want to pause and ask: how much of this valuation is justified, and how much is riding on high expectations? Here’s the thing, a 50% drawdown from current levels would not be unprecedented. It happened in 2022, when AMD stock lost over 60% of its value in just a few quarters. With the stock now around $163, a return to $80 levels isn’t out of the question. And after a mixed Q2 earnings report and mounting macroeconomic pressures - including tariffs under President Donald Trump - a reality check may be in order. See our counter scenario on AMD Stock upside to $330. Indeed, we believe this broad range of upside and downside potential represents a simple fact, that AMD is a pretty volatile stock. Valuation Rests on AI Hope. But Are Things Going To Plan? A key driver of AMD's premium valuation is its potential in the AI chip space. However, Q2 revenues from the company’s data center division, which houses its AI accelerator business, fell short of expectations with revenue rising just 14% to $3.2 billion. What's worse - AI chip sales appear to have declined year-over-year, held back by export restrictions to China and a pause as customers await the next-gen Instinct MI350. Compare this with Nvidia, which reported over 70% growth in its data center business to $39 billion last quarter. AMD’s AI efforts remain a distant second, and it may be missing out on a significant chunk of the capital pouring into generative AI infrastructure. Should you buy or fear AMD stock? For perspective, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Alphabet together spent roughly $222 billion in capex in 2024, projected to surge to $360 billion in 2025. AMD's inability to capture a larger share of that spend raises concerns about whether its AI narrative can continue to support such a high multiple. There are some positives as well. The Trump administration recently eased restrictions on AMD’s MI308 chip shipments to China, which could provide a near-term revenue boost. However, Nvidia’s entrenched position - bolstered by its proprietary CUDA software ecosystem - makes customer switching harder and limits AMD’s upside. AI Spending Sustainability, Competition There are also broader risks to the AI story. Despite massive infrastructure spending, most companies have yet to figure out compelling monetization models for AI. Shareholder pressure could eventually mount to improve returns, and this could cause tech giants may slow their GPU spending. Meanwhile, many of the big tech companies are building their own custom AI chips. Google has its TPUs, Microsoft is rolling out Maia, Amazon has Trainium and Inferentia, and Meta is building in-house silicon optimized for its own AI workloads. These in-house efforts could reduce dependency on AMD (and Nvidia), and could meaningfully reduce their addressable market. Even if the GPU story stumbles, could AMD fall back on CPUs? Not without challenges. AMD’s bread-and-butter PC and server CPU businesses could face pressure as the U.S. economy softens. Inflation remains elevated, job growth is moderating, and President Trump’s new tariffs on key trading partners risk driving up costs, dampening consumer spending and business investment alike. That could impact PC sales and in turn hit CPU revenues. How resilient is AMD stock during a downturn? AMD stock has fared worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. Worried about the impact of a market crash on AMD stock? Our dashboard AMD Dropped 6.4% In A Day. Have You Fully Evaluated The Risk? has a detailed analysis of how the stock performed during and after previous market crashes. Inflation Shock (2022) • AMD stock fell 65.4% from a high of $161.91 on 29 November 2021 to $55.94 on 14 October 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 18 January 2024 • Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $211.38 on 7 March 2024 and currently trades at around $163. Covid Pandemic (2020) • AMD stock fell 34.3% from a high of $58.90 on 19 February 2020 to $38.71 on 16 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 22 July 2020 Global Financial Crisis (2008) • AMD stock fell 91.2% from a high of $20.35 on 1 January 2007 to $1.80 on 25 November 2008, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 21 August 2018 Premium Valuation In summary, it also doesn’t help that AMD stock is still expensive; it trades at almost 49x trailing earnings and 42x forward earnings. Sure, Advanced Micro Devices' Revenues have grown considerably over recent years, rising at an average rate of about 15% over the last 3 years (vs. 5% for S&P 500). However, this growth could fade quickly if the economy takes a turn for the worse and if the company fails to meaningfully capture share of the AI chip market. At current multiples, even modest disappointments could trigger an outsized correction in the stock. The rich valuation of AMD stock limits its upside potential in the near-to-mid term. As an alternative, the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid- and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

At 72 weeks, all three doses of orforglipron, met the primary endpoint and all key secondary endpoints compared to placebo, delivering clinically meaningful weight loss as an adjunct to a healthy diet and physical activity. For the primary endpoint, orforglipron 36 mg, taken once per day without food and water restrictions, lowered weight by an average of 12.4% (27.3 lbs) compared to 0.9% (2.2 lbs) with placebo using the efficacy estimand.1 "Obesity is one of the most pressing global health challenges of our time, driving global chronic disease burden and impacting more than one billion people worldwide," said Kenneth Custer, Ph.D., executive vice president and president of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health. "With orforglipron, we're working to transform obesity care by introducing a potential once-daily oral therapy that could support early intervention and long-term disease management, while offering a convenient alternative to injectable treatments. With these positive data in hand, we are now planning to submit orforglipron for regulatory review by year-end and are prepared for a global launch to address this urgent public health need." In the ATTAIN-1 trial, orforglipron met the primary endpoint of superior body weight reduction compared to placebo. Participants taking the highest dose of orforglipron lost an average of 27.3 lbs (12.4%) at 72 weeks using the efficacy estimand. In a key secondary endpoint, 59.6% of participants taking the highest dose of orforglipron lost at least 10% of their body weight, while 39.6% lost at least 15% of their body weight. In addition to achieving significant weight loss, orforglipron was also associated with reductions in known markers of cardiovascular risk, including non-HDL cholesterol, triglycerides and systolic blood pressure in pooled analyses across all doses. In a pre-specified exploratory analysis, the highest dose of orforglipron reduced high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels by 47.7%. Efficacy Estimand Results Orforglipron 6 mg Orforglipron 12 mg Orforglipron 36 mg Placebo Primary Endpoint Mean percent change in body weight from avg.baseline of 103.2 kg(227.5 lbs) and 37.0 BMIi -7.8% (-8.0 kg; -17.6 lbs) -9.3% (-9.4 kg; -20.7 lbs) -12.4% (-12.4 kg; -27.3 lbs) -0.9% (-1.0 kg; -2.2 lbs) Key Secondary Endpoints Percentage of participants achievingbody weight reductionsof ≥10%i 35.9 % 45.1 % 59.6 % 8.6 % Percentage of participants achieving body weight reductionsof ≥15%i 16.5 % 24.0 % 39.6 % 3.6 % iSuperiority test was adjusted for multiplicity. For the treatment-regimen estimand,2 each dose of orforglipron led to statistically significant improvements across the primary and all key secondary endpoints. The overall safety profile of orforglipron in ATTAIN-1 was consistent with the established GLP-1 receptor agonist class. The most commonly reported adverse events were gastrointestinal-related and generally mild-to-moderate in severity. The most common adverse events for participants treated with orforglipron (6 mg, 12 mg and 36 mg, respectively) were nausea (28.9%, 35.9% and 33.7%) vs. 10.4% with placebo, constipation (21.7%, 29.8% and 25.4%) vs. 9.3% with placebo, diarrhea (21.0%, 22.8% and 23.1%) vs. 9.6% with placebo, vomiting (13.0%, 21.4% and 24.0%) vs. 3.5% with placebo, and dyspepsia (13.0%, 16.2% and 14.1%) vs. 5.0% with placebo. Treatment discontinuation rates due to adverse events were 5.1% (6 mg), 7.7% (12 mg) and 10.3% (36 mg) for orforglipron vs. 2.6% with placebo. The overall treatment discontinuation rates were 21.9% (6 mg), 22.5% (12 mg) and 24.4% (36 mg) for orforglipron vs. 29.9% with placebo. No hepatic safety signal was observed. The detailed ATTAIN-1 results will be presented next month at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) Annual Meeting 2025 and published in a peer-reviewed journal. More results from the ATTAIN Phase 3 clinical trial program will be shared later this year, along with findings from the ACHIEVE Phase 3 clinical trial program evaluating orforglipron for adults with type 2 diabetes. About orforglipron Orforglipron (or-for-GLIP-ron) is an investigational, once-daily small molecule (non-peptide) oral glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist that can be taken any time of the day without restrictions on food and water intake.3 Orforglipron was discovered by Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. and licensed by Lilly in 2018. Chugai and Lilly published the preclinical pharmacology data of this molecule together.4 Lilly is running Phase 3 studies on orforglipron for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and for weight management in adults with obesity or overweight with at least one weight-related medical problem. It is also being studied as a potential treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and hypertension in adults with obesity. About ATTAIN-1 and ATTAIN clinical trial program ATTAIN-1 (NCT05869903) is a Phase 3, 72-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing the efficacy and safety of orforglipron 6 mg, 12 mg and 36 mg as monotherapy to placebo in adults with obesity, or overweight with at least one of the following comorbidities: hypertension, dyslipidemia, OSA or cardiovascular disease, who did not have diabetes. The trial randomized 3,127 participants across the U.S., Brazil, China, India, Japan, South Korea, Puerto Rico, Slovakia, Spain and Taiwan in 3:3:3:4 ratio to receive either 6 mg, 12 mg or 36 mg orforglipron or placebo. The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate that orforglipron (6 mg, 12 mg, 36 mg) is superior to placebo in body weight reduction from baseline after 72 weeks in people with a BMI ≥30.0 kg/m² or a BMI ≥27.0 kg/m² with at least one weight-related comorbidity and a history of at least one self-reported unsuccessful dietary effort to lose body weight. All participants in the orforglipron treatment arms started the study at a dose of orforglipron 1 mg once-daily and then increased the dose in a step-wise approach at four-week intervals to their final randomized maintenance dose of 6 mg (via steps at 1 mg and 3 mg), 12 mg (via steps at 1 mg, 3 mg and 6 mg) or 36 mg (via steps at 1 mg, 3 mg, 6 mg, 12 mg and 24 mg). Dose reduction was only allowed for GI tolerability if other mitigations failed. The ATTAIN Phase 3 global clinical development program for orforglipron has enrolled more than 4,500 people with obesity or overweight across two global registration trials. The program began in 2023 with additional results anticipated this year. About LillyLilly is a medicine company turning science into healing to make life better for people around the world.

Title: Apple just got a big win in Trump’s tariff war. It may have bigger concerns | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Apple CEO Tim Cook should be breathing a sigh of relief. The White House on Wednesday ratcheted tariffs on Indian imports up by an additional 25%, raising the total levies on one of the United States’ most crucial trading partners to 50% when they kick in later this month. But smartphones are exempt from President Donald Trump’s new levies on India, marking a crucial win for the tech giant as it approaches its most important time of the year: its annual September iPhone launch followed by the holiday season. Apple will also dodge incoming new tariffs on semiconductors, since it’s committed to building iPhone components in the United States, Trump said Wednesday. That’s not to say tariffs won’t hurt; CEO Tim Cook said tariffs will likely cost the company $1.1 billion this quarter. But analysts say Apple has bigger concerns, such as its future product strategy and approach to artificial intelligence, a burgeoning field that the tech behemoth is perceived to be behind in. Under different circumstances, such high tariffs could have spelled trouble for Apple. The iPhone is Apple’s most important product, making up the majority of its revenue. Most iPhones sold in America come from India. And the Americas, which includes the United States, is Apple’s largest market. “In terms of the longer-term issues, more than a year out, I would say tariffs are probably 20% of it,” said Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, who has covered Apple for decades. “I think what’s going on the regulatory environments (is) probably 25%, and 55 is related to how they’re going to capitalize on AI.” Tariffs are a challenge for Apple, but one that analysts seem confident the company can manage. A combination of Apple’s diversified supply chain – which it partially shifted to areas like India and Vietnam around five years ago to reduce reliance on China during COVID – along with its high margins and Cook’s operations expertise put the company in a strong position. Supply chain resilience is “supposed to allow you to adjust tactically to any major changes that comes unexpected,” said Runar Bjørhovde, a research analyst for market research firm Canalys. That held true even before Apple committed to investing an additional $100 billion in the United States to manufacture iPhone parts domestically on Wednesday. While moves like these don’t directly impact tariff policy, they do likely help Apple curry favor with the administration, especially as Trump has pressed Apple to build its iPhones domestically. “Look, he’s not making this kind of an investment anywhere in the world, not even close,” Trump said. “He’s coming back. I mean, Apple is coming back to America.” Some analysts already expected that the iPhone would be exempt from the upcoming levies on India ahead of Wednesday’s tariff announcement. But the back-and-forth tariff policies, which have changed multiple times throughout the year, make it challenging to predict what could happen in the future. “Because (smartphones are) such an important category, the relationship that Apple has with both administrations, and specifically, even the US administration, we do think that they will be able to maneuver against this threat,” said Nabila Popal, senior director with the International Data Corporation’s data and analytics team. “But it is important, of course. It does present a risk.” That said, analysts largely believe India and China are Apple’s only two options for producing US-bound iPhones at scale. And since iPhone models available in the United States don’t precisely match those sold elsewhere, Apple can’t just redirect iPhones intended for different markets. New iPhones sold in America, for example, don’t have physical SIM card slots anymore, and they support millimeter wave 5G, the kind of connection that provides faster, low-latency speeds but usually only at a short distance. “It’s a massive tactical nightmare to deal with,” said Bjørhovde. “Because you have to try and find a sweet spot and figure out what comes next.” Cook said iPhones will continue to be assembled outside of the United States for “a while” during an event at the Oval Office announcing the new $100 billion investment on Wednesday. But he pointed to the company’s strategy of instead producing iPhone components stateside. “Well, if you look at the bulk of it, we’re doing a lot of the semiconductors here, we’re doing the glass here, we’re doing the Face ID module here, and so there’s a ton of it, and we’re doing these for products sold elsewhere in the world,” Cook said. “And so there’s a lot of content in there from United States.” The narrative that Apple is behind in AI has been looming over the company all year – and some analysts see it as a more challenging issue to overcome than tariffs. Apple delayed a high-profile upgrade to its Siri assistant that would have enabled it to provide more personalized answers and act across apps, bringing it up to speed with the agent-like capabilities that Google and OpenAI are pursuing with their digital helpers. And the company’s rivals are still using that setback as ammunition to promote their own products over Apple’s. Just this week, Google posted an ad for its upcoming Pixel 10 phone that said: “If you buy a new phone because of a feature that’s coming soon, but it’s been coming soon for a full year, you could change your definition of soon.” Apple’s initial batch of AI features also didn’t launch in time for the iPhone 16’s arrival last September. At the same time, many of Apple’s peers are seeing booming returns from their AI investments. Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) both hit $4 trillion in market capitalization in July, a milestone Wall Street previously thought Apple (AAPL) might reach first. That’s partially because of their fundamentally different products and business models. Apple is a consumer hardware company. In contrast, Microsoft, Meta (META) and Nvidia also provide the tools that businesses rely on to support AI-powered services and features, like cloud computing, chips and AI models. Still, Apple saw stellar earnings results for the June quarter, surpassing expectations for iPhone sales – including in China – and overall revenue. But during Apple’s earnings call, analysts pressed Cook about his perspective on AI and what it means for the company’s products. Those questions ranged from whether AI services might be eating into search engine usage, whether the forthcoming Siri upgrade could drive future new products and whether Apple would consider acquiring AI companies to further its product roadmap. “Taking a step back, we see AI as one of the most profound technologies of our lifetime,” Cook said in his opening remarks during the earnings call. “We are embedding it across our devices and platforms and across the company. We are also significantly growing our investments.” But Apple can’t risk falling too far behind when it comes to the iPhone’s AI capabilities. By doing so, it could create an opportunity for Samsung, Google and Qualcomm – the three of which dominate the Android phone space – to pull ahead, says Ted Mortonson, managing director and technology sector strategist at financial services company Baird. “What’s more important with investors is, after the iPhone 17, what do they really do?” he said. “I mean, as far as generative AI and AI functionality, that that’s the real focus on Apple right now.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: What CFOs say about AI when they’re speaking off the record

Diane Brady is an award-winning business journalist and author who has interviewed newsmakers worldwide and often speaks about the global business landscape. As executive editorial director of the Fortune CEO Initiative, she brings together a growing community of global business leaders through conversations, content, and connections. She is also executive editorial director of Fortune Live Media and interviews newsmakers for the magazine and the CEO Daily newsletter. Good morning. Everyone is talking about AI. Earlier this week, we hosted a dinner with 17 CFOs from some of the world’s largest companies, where they talked about how they’re using AI in their jobs. Some are using it to highlight how different words are likely to impact sentiment on earnings calls, based on historical data. Many use it to create scenarios around earnings projections against the vagaries of tariffs, policy shifts, technology investments and more. They’re creating hyper-personalized data sets and go-to-market strategies that not only use AI agents but tailor interactions to customers’ AI agents. I also learned about their strategies for embedding AI knowledge throughout their organizations, from top-down learning to metrics for getting promoted into the senior ranks. And while most are not yet cutting jobs in response to AI, they’re also not adding to their overall headcount. The dinner, sponsored by Deloitte and ServiceNow, was conducted under the Chatham House rule to encourage conversation by sharing highlights anonymously. But during my on-the-record chat with economist Rebecca Patterson, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and former chief investment strategist at Bridgewater Associates, we heard about the impact of a shift in fiscal policy. “It’s not just the fact that Congress ignored the Congressional Budget Office and historical norms in enacting the reconciliation bill,” she noted. “It’s also the size of the increase to future deficits at a time when the economy has been growing above its long-term potential. I thought we would see some fiscal hawks push back more and water down the ultimate bill, or that there would be a longer fight. I was wrong.” Patterson also said she expects policies under the Trump Administration to “lean towards” structurally higher inflation. And she talked about the continued strength of the U.S. relative to other economies and the transformative impact of AI. Insights from leaders on the front lines are critical in shaping the themes of this column and underscore the unique role that Fortune plays in convening and creating connections. Next up is Brainstorm Tech, which Andrew Nusca will lead on Sept. 8 to 10 in Park City, Utah. One Strategy Group CEO David Meadvin told me yesterday that “there’s nowhere better for genuine relationship building.” I believe him. I’ll be going there to moderate some conversations and cohost a dinner for CEO Initiative members with Qualtrics CEO Zig Serafin. If you’d like to join us at Brainstorm Tech, you can apply here. Trump’s tariffs are now in effect Americans must now pay steep taxes if they want to import from countries like Syria (41%), Laos and Myanmar (40%) or Switzerland (39%). Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter failed to change the White House’s mind over the last few days and it remains unclear why Switzerland was singled out for such a harsh rate. Quote of the day: “We are now in a new world. Even to trade nerds, the complexity of this is just bonkers,” Chad Bown, of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told the FT. 100% tariff on semiconductor chips The president said he would double the price of imported computer chips but not for companies that are “building in the United States.” Few other details are available. Apple pledges $600 billion U.S. investment In an amazing coincidence, the iPhone maker yesterday said it would add $100 billion to its existing domestic “manufacturing” commitments and add 20,000 jobs to its payroll. Apple stock was up 4% on the news. Palantir’s rise, explained Palantir’s blowout earnings on Tuesday capped a 555% year-over-year stock surge, raising the defense-tech company’s market cap to over $400 billion. Here’s how the Alex Karp-led company became one of the 25 most valuable companies in the world. AI will destroy jobs, ex-Google exec says Google X’s former chief business officer Mo Gawdat says the notion AI will create jobs is “100% crap,” and even warns that “incompetent CEOs” are on the chopping block. The tech guru predicts that AGI will be better at everything than most humans. Only the best workers in their fields will keep their jobs “for a while,” and even “evil” government leaders might be replaced by the robots, he said. Microsoft raids Google’s AI ranks Mustafa Suleyman, one of the founders of Google’s DeepMind, who is now head of Microsoft AI, is raiding his old company for talent, calling them personally on the phone with the promise that life at Microsoft has more of a startup vibe than Google does. He has poached two dozen Googlers with compensation that far exceed those paid at DeepMind. Trump favors meeting with Putin to end Ukraine war The president told European leaders and U.S. reporters yesterday that he was open to meeting Putin soon to get a ceasefire in Ukraine. But he also sounded sceptical about Putin’s motives, saying he had “been disappointed before with this one.” White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said Trump was “open to meeting with both President Putin and President Zelensky” and “wants this brutal war to end.” Disney earnings and NFL deal Disney posted solid earnings on Wednesday, just a day after announcing that Disney’s ESPN sports network is acquiring major NFL media assets in exchange for a 10% equity stake in ESPN. The company raised its full-year guidance for fiscal 2025 and now believes it will finish the year with an 18% year-over-year gain in adjusted earnings. S&P 500 futures were up 0.48% this morning, premarket, after the index closed up 0.73% yesterday. STOXX Europe 600 was up 0.5% in early trading. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 was down 0.33% in early trading.

Despite its fair share of ups and downs, 2025 has shaped up to be a banger year for crypto. Both market giants like $BTC and $ETH, and low-cap wildcards like $PENGU and $TROLL, have been painting the charts green, racking up good gains for early investors. Looking ahead, the momentum shows no signs of slowing. Big institutions are gobbling up $BTC and $ETH like it’s a Black Friday sale. Crypto ETFs are widely expected to get the green light by Q3 according to James Seyffart. And mainstream adoption continues to surge thanks to improving regulation and scalability breakthroughs. So, to help you unearth high-potential tokens, we turned to ChatGPT, the world’s most popular (and arguably most powerful) AI chatbot. Thanks to its ability to analyze massive troves of on-chain data, market sentiment, social trends, and real-time developments, GPT is surprisingly capable of spotting high-potential cryptos before the herd catches on. Sure, that was in stocks, but it proves the AI’s ability to crunch numbers and make smart picks in volatile markets. So, keep reading to discover ChatGPT’s top picks for the best crypto to buy right now, complete with insights into what makes these projects noteworthy. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is building a new Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin that will integrate with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). By adding Solana-style capabilities and bridging to the Bitcoin Layer 1, Hyper delivers ultra-fast transactions, low fees, and full Web3 compatibility to the Bitcoin ecosystem – all while maintaining the network’s top-tier security. Given Bitcoin’s lofty price predictions – Standard Chartered says it could hit $200K by year-end – ChatGPT picking a Bitcoin-themed token as the best altcoin to buy now isn’t all that surprising. So, how does it work? A decentralized, non-custodial canonical bridge will let you interact with the SVM-powered Web3 environment on Hyper’s Layer-2. The bridge mints an equivalent wrapped amount of your native $BTC on the Bitcoin Hyper network, ready for use on various side-chain platforms and dApps. These ‘wrapped’ tokens are fully compatible with the Layer 2 and can be used for: All without having to put up with Bitcoin’s painfully slow speeds. It’s worth noting that Bitcoin Hyper’s presale is progressing faster than Usain Bolt; it has already raised $7.4M+, with several whale purchases ($74.9K, $54.1K, $37.9K, and $19.6K) in past three months alone. As for the upside, $HYPER could surge up to 2,449% and hit $0.32 by the end of 2025. Right now, you can buy Bitcoin Hyper for a low price $0.01255. Visit Bitcoin Hyper for more information. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) powers Best Wallet, a free crypto wallet that solves the most common issues associated with crypto on-boarding – confusing tech and stressful secret key management. Best Wallet is not just easy to use, though. It’s also versatile, which perfectly positions it to benefit from the rapidly growing global crypto wallet market, which is expected to reach $57.61B by 2029 at a CAGR of 31.9%. Security-wise, this wallet is non-custodial and relies on Multi-Party Computation to secure private keys. In plain English, you won’t have to worry about data leaks or hacks. Your wallet’s secret key is split between your device and a private server, never being fully revealed to any external source. It’s also very intuitive. You can go from making your first wallet to swapping tokens across top blockchains within minutes. Holding the $BEST token also gives you lower fees. One of Best Wallet’s features worth mentioning is its Presale Aggregator, which lets you buy the best crypto presales directly from within the app. This sets a new benchmark for convenience in the wallet industry, as you don’t have to visit any external presale sites. Buying $BEST right now (at just $0.025445 per token) will give you early access to this presale aggregator, plus governance rights and generous staking rewards (currently 93% APY). The project has in total raised over $14.5M in early investor funding, with a new price increase due in 12 hours. Now’s a good time to buy $BEST if you want to support the project. Visit Best Wallet Token’s official website. The biggest hub of meme coins, Solana ($SOL), is currently riding both fundamental and technical tailwinds that could push it beyond the $200 mark – and possibly even $300 – by the time Santa Claus comes down through your chimney. One of the biggest reasons to remain bullish on $SOL is the overwhelming likelihood of a spot Solana ETF being approved by the SEC in the third quarter. According to Bloomberg, the chances now stand at a staggering 95%. Such approval could significantly increase retail participation, driving up both trading volume and demand. Things look positive from a technical analysis perspective, too. After bouncing off a key support zone, $SOL has now pulled back to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level. This is considered a strong bullish signal because it’s often seen as the ‘golden pocket’ where asset prices tend to find support before continuing their upward trend. Interestingly, the support zone in question is the same one that triggered a ~100% rally back in October-November 2024. If a similar move plays out this time, $SOL could climb to around $250 in the current rally alone. The token is currently trading around $169, up 13% over the past month. The best part is that you can readily find Solana on Binance and other top crypto exchanges. Overall, ChatGPT’s list of recommendations included a fantastic blend of low-cap presale gems, like $HYPER and $BEST, and established, proven performers like $SOL. So, you can create a well-rounded portfolio for yourself for August and beyond. That said, this article is not financial advice. Remember that crypto is volatile.

Title: A laid-off Accenture manager has been job hunting for 21 months. Recruiters keep telling him he's too expensive.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/laid-off-accenture-manager-struggles-salary-expectations-tough-job-market-2025-7
Time Published: 2025-08-07T07:41:01Z

Alexander Valen thought his more than two decades of experience in the tech industry would help him find a job, but he said it sometimes feels like a disadvantage. In November 2023, Valen was laid off from his project manager role at the consulting firm Accenture, where he said he managed up to 150 developers, architects, and software testers, depending on the project. Over the past 21 months, Valen said he's had more than two dozen interviews but hasn't been able to land a job. He and his wife, a stay-at-home mom, have relied on DoorDash earnings, unemployment benefits, and family support. But it hasn't been enough, and Valen said they've fallen behind on their mortgage payments. "More recently, it's just dead — I don't hear anything," Valen, who's 51 and lives in Florida, said of his job applications. "It's like a black hole, and I don't know what's going on." In recent months, Valen said even landing interviews has become challenging. The end of his Accenture tenure and his conversations with recruiters have led him to draw one conclusion: It's a particularly tough job market for workers with a lot of experience and corresponding pay expectations. "The first thing recruiters say when they see my profile is it's very expensive," he said. Valen's experience reflects a broader shift in the US labor market that's made it more difficult for workers in managerial positions to find jobs. Several corporations, including Microsoft, Google, Intel, Amazon, and Walmart, have announced plans to reduce the number of managers. And it's not just big businesses. Gusto, a small and midsize payroll and benefits platform, found that manager firings and layoffs have risen 66% between January 2022 and September 2024 for those ages 45 to 54 — and more than 400% for those ages 35 to 44. This trend, dubbed the Great Flattening, reflects a broader push to reduce costs and bureaucracy, moves business leaders say will make their organizations more efficient. But for some laid-off managers, finding new employment has been far from easy. Amid economic uncertainty, ranging from tariffs to the early impacts of AI adoption, US businesses are hiring at nearly the slowest pace in more than a decade. Business Insider has heard from hundreds of Americans over the past year who are struggling to find work as US businesses slow hiring and flatten management structures. Share your story by filling out this quick form and read more below: Throughout his final year on the job, Valen said he noticed a shift: clients were requesting lower-cost workers, and he spent as long as two months "on the bench," meaning that he wasn't assigned to any client projects. Since being laid off, Valen's pay level has continued to feel like a barrier. His Accenture role paid about $87 an hour, and he said he's targeted roles that pay between roughly $65 and $85 an hour or roughly $135,000 to $177,000 annually. But in the current hiring landscape, some recruiters have told him that his compensation level is too steep for their clients. It's left Valen struggling to find openings where there's demand for someone with his experience and salary expectations. "I applied for one job and they're like, 'We're going to have to pay you $35 an hour.' That's really, really low." Valen said he decided to stay in the running for the role but didn't get an interview. While he's willing to stray a bit from his target compensation range, he said he doesn't want to go below $50 an hour — about $104,000 annually. Over the last few months, Valen said his job search has been particularly frustrating. When he manages to find a job posting that seems like a good fit, there are often already hundreds of applicants, making his chances of landing the role feel slim. Valen said recruiters he's connected with have told him they get up to hundreds of LinkedIn connection requests a day, and that it's become difficult to figure out which candidates to prioritize. AI tools are partially to blame, as they make it easier for job seekers to apply to more roles than ever, and perhaps even help some people misrepresent their skills and qualifications. In response to his job search challenges, Valen said he's expanded his search beyond project manager positions to business analyst and sales roles — even applying for a kitchen team member role at Chick-fil-A, though it didn't lead to an interview. He's also tried to build his AI knowledge through experimentation with various tools, though he's unsure how much of an edge this will give him over other candidates. If he could give advice to other struggling job seekers, he'd tell them not to give up and to look for opportunities to improve their skills while looking for work. But as his search drags on, he said it sometimes feels like no advice makes much of a difference. "It's a crazy market," he said. "I don't know what to do right now." Jump to

Title: A founder said her $200 million newsletter empire had over a million subscribers. Her own records tell a different story.

Daniella Pierson is a proponent of faking it till you make it. The 30-year-old founder of The Newsette Media Group, known for its daily newsletter about style and pop culture, says it's been key to her trajectory: a $9 million SoHo apartment, a net worth reported to be $220 million, and mentors like Serena Williams and Diane von Furstenberg. "I faked it till I made it," she told a Stanford Business School audience in 2024, recalling that she pretended to be an intern when her company was a one-woman affair to drum up interest and used made-up names when communicating with partners. A Business Insider investigation into Pierson's enterprise reveals that pretending to be her own intern may not have been her only distortion of reality. A review of internal documents and dashboards, recordings of meetings, and interviews with more than 10 company insiders uncovered questions about what Pierson has told the public and advertisers about her business when compared with what her own records show — including how many subscribers her newsletter has. A spokesperson for Pierson confirmed to Business Insider that The Newsette's daily newsletter goes out to about 500,000 subscribers each day. That's less than half the 1.3 million subscribers claimed in a 2025 pitch deck to advertisers and the million-plus referenced by Pierson in multiple public appearances. The spokesperson said that the larger figure reflects the company's overall email list, which includes what they described as "disengaged subscribers" who have been "funneled out" of the daily newsletter by a quality control mechanism. In a statement sent to Business Insider and posted on Instagram, Pierson called criticism of her business a "smear campaign," and said claims involve "false statements and fabricated information" meant to hamper her ability to continue supporting women through her companies. "They messed with the wrong person," she wrote. Pierson has touted The Newsette Media Group's 2021 revenue — $40 million, according to both Pierson and former employees — in public appearances as recently as last year. She's never publicly revealed revenue figures for subsequent years. Company documents seen by Business Insider paint a less rosy picture for last year: The company's 2024 revenue goal was $5 million. The Pierson spokesperson said this number was not accurate but declined to provide further information. They added that the company is currently profitable. Part of the revenue decline can be attributed to the 2023 shuttering of Newland, the creative agency that Pierson launched in late 2020 as part of The Newsette Media Group. She said Newland drove more revenue than the newsletter business itself in 2021. The Newsette Media Group now employs eight people, down from 40 at its peak, the Pierson spokesperson said. Pierson's business, by multiple measures, has fallen from its heights. It's a problem she's familiar with. In a 2024 TEDx Talk, Pierson spoke about "all of the billionaire guys" who had raised capital and whose companies were now "worth zero." "People don't realize, you have $1 billion on paper, that paper can burn real fast," she said. Over the past decade, Pierson has perfected her founder narrative. An identical twin, Pierson struggled in school and was labeled, in her own telling, "the dumb twin." When she got to Boston University, she said in multiple podcast interviews, she floundered in school, uninspired by learning about the Earth's crust and how to properly measure the area of a triangle. She decided to focus on what she did like — magazines — and founded The Newsette as a newsletter during her sophomore year at the age of 19. Every morning, she'd wake up at 5 a.m. and spend five hours drafting a newsletter for her subscribers. During class, she DM-ed people on Facebook, telling them that if they brought on new subscribers, they could add "Newsette ambassador" to their résumés. "When I started in 2015, there weren't any newsletters out there," she'd later tell the audience at Stanford. (Prominent launches of newsletters with a similar flair included The Skimm in 2012 and Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop in 2008.) Once she graduated and had hammered out the product details, she couldn't find investors. Instead, she took a $15,000 loan from her parents. She's said she has since repaid the loan and has posted on Instagram that she "made her mom a millionaire" by giving her a stake in Newsette Media Group. Without venture backing, she had to be profitable right away, she said, so she began selling ads, making $25,000 in her first month of accepting advertisers in 2017. Pierson was successful in attracting press attention, at first from small college-targeted outlets and her hometown station, later from outlets including Elle, WWD, and Business Insider. The interviews were peppered with her catch-phrases: The Newsette was a "gift in your inbox," she often said, and at the beginning, she had three employees, "me, myself, and I." In 2019, a meeting with von Furstenberg, whom Pierson calls her fairy godmother, resulted in a partnership with the fashion designer: a publication called the Weekly Wrap, which Pierson said on the "Money Rehab" podcast was one of her big breaks. In early December 2019, she appeared on Forbes' 30 Under 30 list, saying The Newsette had grown to 500,000 subscribers. Revenue, Pierson said in a number of interviews, shot from $1 million in 2019 to $7 million in 2020 to $40 million — $10 million of it profit — in 2021. She said that revenue and the company's 500,000-plus subscribers allowed her to sell a 1.25% stake in the company at a $200 million valuation. The Pierson spokesperson declined to say who the investor was. Based on The Newsette Media Group's valuation and her stake in Wondermind, a mental-health startup she had cofounded with Selena Gomez and Gomez's mom, Forbes reported she was worth $220 million in August 2022. That made her the youngest, wealthiest self-made BIPOC woman in America, according to the magazine, a title she repeats with gusto. An examination of company documents shows a growing gap between the subscriber numbers Pierson gave publicly and what was on the books. On August 10, 2022, the day the Forbes story came out touting more than half a million subscribers, The Newsette had 411,000, according to documentation reviewed by Business Insider. In a 2023 interview with Forbes, she said it was on track to reach 1 million subscribers by the end of the year. According to company documentation, The Newsette had no more than 570,000 subscribers that year. At the 2024 Stanford talk, she said she had hit the 1 million mark; the records say The Newsette had fallen below 500,000. She repeated those numbers to advertisers. A pitch deck used earlier this year claims that The Newsette has "1.3 million+ subscribers" who receive its weekday, Saturday, and Sunday editions. A spokesperson for Pierson told Business Insider that there are 1.2 million emails in the company's total contact list — including people who no longer receive the newsletter regularly — and said the daily edition currently goes out to about 500,000 active subscribers. Jacob Donnelly, the founder of A Media Operator, a newsletter-based publication for people building digital media companies, said that standard industry practice is that the number of subscriptions refers to the number of people who receive the newsletter. "If I were to go out and say I have 1.3 million subscribers, what I'm saying to the advertiser is when I hit send, it's going out to 1.3 million people," he said, speaking generally and not about The Newsette specifically. "If someone is not subscribed to a product, I don't see how they could be classified as a subscriber." In a meeting with a potential advertiser earlier this year, a recording of which Business Insider reviewed, Pierson mentioned a subscriber count of "a million" and boasted that "every single day, our sponsors get at least 250,000 unique views." In the more than two years of newsletter data that Business Insider reviewed, The Newsette's newsletter only hit that many unique opens one time. More than half of the days, it had fewer than 200,000. At the end of 2020, von Furstenberg personally pitched Pierson to Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Pierson previously told Business Insider. The tech giant soon became one of the first clients of Newland, a creative agency that became, for a short time, The Newsette Media Group's cash cow. In 2021 and into 2022, Newland completed a number of projects for Amazon; Pierson told the Stanford audience that the company "was responsible for tens of millions of dollars in revenue." The agency took a 360-degree approach to social media marketing, coming up with the brief, hiring the talent, and handling the paid media. Campaigns included a viral Prime Day TikTok push featuring Snoop Dogg and a number of creators, and content for Women's History Month with Keke Palmer, Mindy Kaling, and von Furstenberg. According to two former employees familiar with the financials, the $40 million revenue figure Pierson touted represented gross revenue, or all of the money that flowed through the company, inclusive of cash reserved for talent and paid media. Most publicly owned ad agencies report net revenue — the money left over once a campaign is finished — and not gross revenue, which includes money the agency gets to pay for things like celebrity endorsements. When Amazon underwent a reorganization toward the end of 2022 and into 2023, the company largely paused its new work with Newland, according to four former employees. Amazon declined to comment to Business Insider about its business with Newland. After Amazon's departure, Pierson struggled to bring new clients to the agency, said four former employees. Newland, Pierson said, grew to eventually employ the majority of Newsette Media Group's employees. In December 2022, Newsette conducted one of several rounds of layoffs. Former employees said the layoffs were due to a cash crunch. By the end of 2023, Newland had completely folded. The Pierson spokesperson said the job cuts were not due to a "financial crunch," but were made for the sake of "efficiencies." For 2024, the company's revenue goal was a modest $5 million, according to internal documents. The Pierson spokesperson said those numbers were not accurate, but declined to provide additional numbers or documentation. In addition to Newsette Media Group, Pierson has been involved in other ventures. In 2021, she was announced as the co-CEO of Wondermind, a mental health website that she cofounded with Selena Gomez and the singer's mother, Mandy Teefey. In 2023, she quietly left the company; the circumstances of her departure have not been disclosed. After a press release about Pierson's investment in a group attempting to purchase Forbes went out, she posted on X that she was "on the board" of the magazine. The deal ended up falling through, and she was never on any board. Her most recent venture launched in May. Chasm is a $25,000-a-year membership club that aims to "close the gender gap through entrepreneurship." The club says its members include singer Lionel Richie and Spanx's Sara Blakely, neither of whom responded to Business Insider's request for comment. Membership fees will fund a website and award monthly five-figure grants to entrepreneurs, the first of which was announced on August 6. After being contacted for comment, Pierson issued a statement — which she also shared on Instagram — claiming there was a coordinated effort by individuals "who represent everything that my gender equality initiatives have fought to change." She said they had launched a "smear campaign" against her and her companies, spreading "false statements and fabricated information" aimed at eliminating her ability to "continue to put millions of my own dollars into helping women." "These false statements don't just affect me," she wrote. "They affect the thousands of women who we fund, spotlight, or promote via my companies." She said The Newsette Media Group "absolutely did" make $40 million in 2021, and defended Chasm, saying it was "on track to give away free resources and grants for female entrepreneurs worth millions this year alone." In a 2021 podcast interview, Pierson offered a vision of what it takes to succeed as an entrepreneur. "If you can sell yourself," she said, "you can basically do anything."

Title: Billionaire Bill Gross says GameStop now trades more like Bitcoin than a meme stock
URL: https://cryptobriefing.com/gamestop-bitcoin-trading-patterns/
Time Published: 2025-08-07T04:16:27Z
Full Content:
Share this article Legendary investor Bill Gross said GameStop (GME) is shedding its meme stock roots and now “mimics Bitcoin.” The “Bond King” recently told Business Insider that GameStop is “much less volatile” and no longer behaves like a meme stock, though he still considers it “a good candidate for option selling.” According to Gross, GameStop has moved in a pattern similar to Bitcoin. The stock rose in late 2024, dipped in spring 2025, and then rebounded in May. It has traded between $20 and $35 over the past 12 months, a stark contrast to its wild swings from $1 in the summer of 2020 to an intraday peak of $121 in January 2021. GameStop reached a 12-month high above $35 in May, just one day before the company revealed its first Bitcoin purchase. GameStop’s 4,710 BTC stash is now valued at around $539 million. The stock has since declined; it closed at approximately $23 on Wednesday, down 27% year-to-date, per Yahoo Finance data. Gross said he’s steering clear of new meme stocks like American Eagle, despite profiting from shorting GameStop and AMC during the 2021 trading frenzy. American Eagle recently gained meme stock status after a Sydney Sweeney ad campaign fueled retail buzz. He noted that retail traders are focusing on tech giants Microsoft and Meta, which are up 30% and 25% this year, respectively, due to artificial intelligence enthusiasm. GameStop, holding over $9 billion in cash and marketable securities, intends to continue investing in Bitcoin and other digital assets. However, unlike Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, and others, the video game retailer is following its own playbook. CEO Ryan Cohen said previously that the company would be selectively engaging when the risk-reward balance is favorable. Cohen also discussed the potential for accepting crypto payments for trading cards, dependent on customer interest. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Litigation Partner Brandon Walker Encourages Investors Who Suffered Losses In SpaceMobile (ASTS) To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options If you are a long-term stockholder in SpaceMobile between November 14, 2023 to April 1, 2024 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Bragar Eagel & Squire partner Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore directly at (212) 355-4648. NEW YORK, Aug. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, is investigating potential claims against AST SpaceMobile, Inc. (NASDAQ: ASTS) on behalf of long-term stockholders following a class action complaint that was filed against SpaceMobile on April 17, 2024 with a Class Period from November 14, 2023 to April 1, 2024. Our investigation concerns whether the board of directors of SpaceMobile have breached their fiduciary duties to the company. On April 1, 2024, after the market closed, SpaceMobile issued a press release disclosing that production of five Block 1 BlueBird satellites had been “impacted by two suppliers, leading to delays in integration and testing.” As a result, these five satellites were expected to be transported to the launch site between July and August 2024, later than the previously expected launch in the first quarter of 2024. On this news, SpaceMobile’s stock price fell $0.62, or 23.6%, to close at $2.01 per share on April 2, 2024, on unusually heavy trading volume. The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that production of the Company’s five Block 1 BlueBird satellites had been negatively impacted by two suppliers of key subsystems; (2) that a result, the Company had not substantially completed the production of the Block 1 BlueBird satellites; (3) that, as a result, the Company’s five Block 1 BlueBird satellites were not on track to launch in the first quarter of 2024; and (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. If you are a long-term stockholder of SpaceMobile, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore by email at investigations@bespc.com, by telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form.

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang met with President Donald Trump earlier today, reports CNBC's Kristina Partsinevelos, after the firm hit back against kill switches in its GPUs in an earlier blog post. NVIDIA, the most valuable company in the world, is at the center of the global technology industry's attention due to its AI GPUs and their sales restrictions. Its recent blog post came after an earlier announcement shared that the firm expected the Trump administration to grant China AI GPU export licenses, and while the content of Huang's meeting with Trump is unclear, it could revolve around the license approvals and kill switches inside the GPUs. While the Trump administration has decided to process China AI GPU licenses, it is unclear while NVIDIA has started to receive them. The firm's smaller rival, AMD, has yet to receive licenses for the chips that were restricted for sale to China earlier this year; a fact that its CEO, Lisa Su, confirmed in an interview earlier today. As a result, NVIDIA could be waiting for the license approval, with a key bargaining point being backdoors, as it tries to secure approval for the Chinese products. Huang's visit to the White House comes as Apple CEO Tim Cook is also expected to be present there to announce a $600 billion investment package in the US. The package is expected to add $100 billion to Apple's earlier investment, with the firm's shares rising by 6% today on the news. Apple has run into trouble with the Trump administration as its efforts to shift production to India from China have come right when the US government is increasing the pressure on the country to stop buying Russian oil. As a result, the shares gained today as investors expected a thaw in its relations with the government. Since CNBC spotted Huang at the White House with a camera placed to note Cook's arrival, it's unclear why the CEO is meeting with the president. However, given the current environment surrounding its China GPUs, potential backdoors and license approvals, it's likely that these could be the talking points on the agenda. NVIDIA has already announced a $500 billion AI data center infrastructure investment in the US, which makes it unlikely that the firm could announce more investments later during the afternoon. #Breaking.

Facing thousands of complaints, AST SpaceMobile is pushing back against concerns that the company’s giant satellites risk interfering with amateur “ham” radio operations across the globe. On Tuesday, the company sent a letter to the US Federal Communications Commission, defending its plan to use the 430 to 440MHz radio bands outside the US to track and control its proposed fleet of 248 satellites. Those bands have long been allocated to amateur radio operations, including for emergency communications, so the community has been campaigning to stop AST from gaining access. It flooded the FCC's online system with over 2,500 comments, many of them protesting AST’s plan to use the spectrum. AST SpaceMobile finally responded by telling the FCC that it has designed its satellites to "mitigate interference" with amateur radio bands. In addition, the company says it’s proposing "very limited, non-routine" use of the 430 to 440MHz bands and only for launch and early orbit phases for its satellites or "emergency operations when other frequency bands are unavailable." AST also says it can shut down radio band use if interference is detected. In addition, the company has submitted an analysis from a third-party company, RKF Engineering Solutions, which found the risk of interference to amateur radio operators to be “extremely unlikely.” “Modeling shows that even under worst-case conditions, the probability of interference with amateur satellite service is extremely small—less than 0.1% per pass, and only a handful of events were observed in a 30‑day simulation,” the analysis says. AST is urging the FCC to greenlight its plan to launch and operate commercial services over its 248-satellite constellation, which is designed to beam connectivity to everyday smartphones. The resulting system will compete with SpaceX's cellular Starlink service, which is already available through T-Mobile. However, the amateur radio community has been calling on the FCC to deny AST's push to use the 430 to 440MHz bands. On Tuesday, the American Radio Relay League sent its own letter to the Commission, highlighting the stiff opposition across the amateur radio community to the spectrum use. “At least 17 national radio amateur societies from around the world took the extraordinary step of making their opposition known to the Commission,” the letter says. Some of the amateur radio groups also claim to have detected interference in Europe from AST’s fleet of existing satellites, the first five BlueBirds and the BlueWalker 3. “Unlike many commercial services, amateur radio is often the only communication system still operational during natural disasters and emergencies,” the Bulgarian Federation of Radio Amateurs told the FCC. In its letter to the FCC, AST said: “Despite contrary claims from some amateur radio commenters, AST SpaceMobile is not transmitting in the 430-440 MHz band on the BB1s or BW3.” Still, one amateur radio group has detected evidence that AST merely shut down the radio communications from the BlueWalker-3 satellite two weeks ago.

Better-than-expected sales and guidance weren’t enough to lift Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock over the high bar set by its run-up in recent months. AMD on Tuesday reported second-quarter sales that topped estimates, and offered Wall Street a rosier-than-expected outlook for the current quarter. Still, shares of the Nvidia competitor were down nearly 7% in recent trading. Above-consensus revenue was driven by strength in AMD’s gaming segment, while earnings, margins, and data center sales were negatively impacted by an $800 million charge related to restrictions on the sale of AI chips to China. The company projected growth at all of its units in the third quarter, and forecast double-digit revenue growth as it ramps sales of its MI355X next-gen AI chip. Most analysts attributed the market's reaction on Wednesday to high expectations and a lofty valuation. “We believe guidance for the AI chip business was in line with Buyside expectations (based on our investor discussions), which is why the stock traded lower," according to Citigroup analysts. Bank of America analysts predicted Wall Street was reacting negatively to "likely ignorable earnings noise" and that the stock wasn't helped by its approximately 80% run-up in the three months leading up to Tuesday's results. One big unknown still hanging over AMD is how much revenue the company will generate when it resumes sales of its MI308 chip to China. (The MI308 was designed expressly for Chinese customers to satisfy Biden-era restrictions.) AMD and Nvidia last month said the Commerce Department had agreed to restart reviewing their export license applications after abruptly halting them earlier in the year. Nonetheless, AMD excluded MI308 sales from its guidance on Tuesday. “There are no China GPU licenses yet, which didn't hurt the outlook but possibly is a letdown for those modeling a $500mn quarterly China contribution in Q3/Q4,” wrote Bank of America analysts in a note on Wednesday. But BofA saw reason for optimism in the outlook. “AMD now expects ~$1.7bn in Q3 GPU sales even without ~$800mn of lost China revenue, suggesting overall ~$500mn higher outlook excluding China vs. $2.0bn pre-ban consensus.” Wedbush analysts echoed that bullish view. “The Q3 outlook was better than expected on substantial Q/Q DC GPU growth expectations, even without assuming any MI308 export licenses are granted,” they wrote. “In turn, we believe this guide sets up AMD to exceed our prior outlook for the out quarters.” Analysts at Wedbush raised their AMD stock price target to $190 from $170 on Wednesday. The firm maintained its “outperform” rating on the stock. Citigroup lifted its price target to $180 from $165 but stood by its “neutral” rating, citing elevated expectations. Seven of the 11 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha with current AMD ratings and price targets rate the stock a “buy,” with the remainder assigning it a neutral rating. The average price target of $183 implied about 5% upside from Tuesday’s closing price. AMD shares were trading at about $161 midday Wednesday.

Title: Lucid (LCID) faced challenges in Q2, but here’s why the CEO is still confident about the future

Lucid Group’s (LCID) stock is dropping on Wednesday after the company missed Q2 expectations. CEO Marc Winterhoff admitted during a new interview that the auto tariffs and the end of the $7,500 EV tax credit “keeps us up at night,” but promises things are looking up from here. After missing top and bottom line expectations, Winterhoff told investors on the company’s earnings call that Lucid is “entering a pivotal new phase.” Despite the reassurance, Lucid’s CEO admitted several things negatively impacted earnings. For one, its gross margin for the quarter was -105%, due to $54 million in extra costs from tariffs. Lucid also lowered its production goal for the year from a firm 20,000 to between 18,000 and 20,000. The company stated that the updated range reflects the changing market. During an interview on Wednesday morning, Winterhoff told CNBC’s Phil LeBeau that changes in trade, tariffs, and tax credits are “something that, you know, keeps us up at night.” Lucid posted revenue of $259.4 million, missing Wall Street’s estimates of around $280 million. It also reported a wider-than-expected net loss of $790 million, or a loss of $ 0.34 per share. Winterhoff told LeBeau that the biggest challenge Lucid faced in Q2 was tariffs, which had a bigger impact on gross margins than expected. However, it should work itself out throughout the remainder of the year, Lucid’s CEO added. The other topic that many were wondering about was the availability of Earth magnets. Winterhoff explained that, unlike most of its competitors, Lucid was able to overcome the issue. If it weren’t for Lucid’s quick actions, the company would have had to stop production in Q2. Instead, Winterhoff said that the company now has the raw materials, earth magnets, and licensing for the remainder of the year. Lucid’s CEO added, “We are actually in a good place right now.” The company secured a partnership with Uber and Nuro to develop and deploy 20,000 robotaxis over the next six years. As part of the agreement, Uber is investing $300 million into Lucid. Although it missed expectations, Lucid is still making progress. The EV maker is coming off its sixth straight quarter with record deliveries. It also produced a record number of vehicles in Q2. After overcoming supply chain issues that limited Gravity output, Lucid said it’s on track to “significantly increase production” in the second half of the year. Lucid ended the quarter with $4.86 billion in total liquidity, which it expects will provide funding through the second half of 2026, when it plans to launch its midsize platform. The midsize platform will have at least three “top hots,” or vehicles, including an electric SUV and Sedan. With prices expected to start at around $50,000, Lucid’s midsize EVs are expected to go head-to-head with the Tesla Model Y and Model 3. Lucid Group’s (LCID) stock is down about 10% on Wednesday following Q2 earnings. Despite share prices surging after the Uber partnership last month, Lucid’s stock is still down nearly 30% over the past 12 months. The company is planning a reverse stock split, which will be voted on at an upcoming investor meeting, to boost the share price and attract larger investors.

Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter The ambitious Oracle heir, who once counted Steve Jobs as a mentor, hopes to turn Paramount Skydance into a tech-era media monolith. But does he have the team — or the vision — to scale that mountain? By Steven Zeitchik, Alex Weprin August 6, 2025 When David Ellison had an informal meeting with New York-based media executives at a restaurant in the city earlier this year introducing the Hollywood producer to the kind of people he’d soon be communing with, the vibe was, to say the least, amiable. The Skydance founder was awaiting FCC approval on his bid to buy Paramount, and so he chatted a little and mostly listened, the executives joking about the challenged landscape as Ellison responded with platitudes about his vision for a well-run Paramount. But one point about Ellison stood out to attendees: He talked a lot about gaming. Related Stories Reporter's Notebook The 20-Year David Ellison Plan, AI Intrigue and Other Questions After Paramount's Big Media Day Business Can Paramount Pivot to Big Tech? David Ellison Outlines His Silicon Valley Vision The emphasis spoke volumes about where Ellison’s eye is trained as he takes over Paramount: Steward a company anchored by a traditional film studio and freighted down by a lot of dated television assets, sure, but also make a big push to digital frontiers. Skydance already has a hand in this world with such VR games as Archangel and The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners, and the chance to develop and acquire gaming companies to pair with Paramount’s robust intellectual properties and 80 million-strong streaming service Paramount+ could prove appealing. On Aug. 7, the $8 billion Skydance-Paramount deal finally closes, putting Ellison in charge of the country’s second-oldest studio — and, notably, one of its most troubled media companies. For the 42-year-old, the news represents a remarkable rise, coming just 15 years after he founded his firm and not much longer since he was written off as a wannabe actor and USC film school dropout making vanity projects like Flyboys. Even with the billions Skydance received from Ellison’s family — particularly father Larry Ellison, worth $303 billion, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index — his resurgence is the kind of thing biographers devote chapters to. The comeback for Paramount, on the other hand, is far from assured. As control of the company moves from one prominent American business family (the Redstones) to another, Ellison has talked up his tech game and has cited family friend Steve Jobs as a mentor who gave him early tough love on Skydance. Certainly the millennial comes in with some advantages: the advent of AI (which, among other things, will make content production cheaper); the use of Oracle’s top-flight cloud service to compete with what Amazon MGM can do with Amazon Web Services (AWS); Skydance’s existing partnerships with Apple and Meta on the gaming side; and even the tantalizing rumors of an Oracle stateside TikTok purchase. (If nothing else, those algorithms will make Paramount+ more Netflix-y sticky.) The automation factor in particular could get supercharged at Paramount, which unlike rivals Disney and Universal has not taken an oppositional attitude toward the tech. All suggest a company with lots of strategic upside, and those who see Paramount as an also-ran might be reminded that the rules are about to reset for everyone, as AI-powered personalized content and automated production prepare to sweep through the industry. “He’s the kind of person who’s going to take advantage of these innovations,” says a longtime exec who knows Ellison and Paramount but is not tied to either one. But how much the existing infrastructure will allow such leaps remains to be seen. Paramount is still a company built for the 1990’s, with a network TV business in CBS that is solid if hardly shiny and a cable business that is neither. Film studios are generally not a high-upside 2020’s bet, especially if some of your biggest franchises, like Mission: Impossible and Star Trek, are many installments deep. For all the hype about tech, the executive team is largely old-school Hollywood too, as new C-suite occupants such as NBC Universal veteran Jeff Shell, Sony marketing executive Josh Greenstein and even Netflix mainstay Cindy Holland cut their teeth on content, not computation. No known upstart is yet waiting in Skydance’s wings; no splashy tech import is ready to take Hollywood by storm. And talk of great tech-content synergies have accompanied many a media merger (remember AOL-Time Warner? Or AT&T-Warner?) only to end up as one more ill-fitting cost-cutting exercise (remember Discovery-Warner?) One X-factor is Andy Gordon, an incoming board member and a longtime Goldman Sachs kingmaker who’s spent the last five years with Gerry Cardinale’s entertainment-minded investment-management company RedBird Capital — and which along with Korean juggernaut CJ Group has put a lot of money into Skydance. (Along with Larry Ellison, RedBird has also helped finance the acquisition.) The ties between RedBird and the new Par go deep — Shell comes from there too — and the expectation is that Gordon as incoming Paramount COO and chief strategic officer will run point on exactly the kind of deals for his new company that he made with the likes of All3Media and Artists Equity at his old one (though, you know, with digital and AI firms). Ellison is the first figure with any tech ties, even familial, to take over a legacy media company, crossing a bridge that Disney, Universal and Rupert Murdoch have refrained from approaching. (New Paramount president Jeff Shell likes this fact, calling his ally “the perfect executive for the next-generation Hollywood company,” as “he not only can go to a table read, but he can go to the next room and code.”) At the very least, Ellison’s Hollywood experience has grown; while he was sometimes sidelined as a financier under earlier Paramount regimes, his role morphed into something more consistently substantively creative under recent studio chiefs Jim Gianopulos and Brian Robbins. Still, getting Hollywood nuts and bolts like talent relations right isn’t easy, and to say Ellison got a “C” on one of his first tests as a mogul — negotiations on a new global streaming deal with South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone — would probably involve some grade inflation. A person with knowledge of the negotiations says Ellison reassured the pair’s reps that he would sign off on a deal, but days turned to weeks with no movement. The foot-dragging led Parker and Stone to flex their power, including by threatening legal action against Shell and RedBird Capital over allegedly manipulating negotiations with rivals to lower the price for Paramount. The South Park-ers eventually got their big payday. CBS’ scrapping of Stephen Colbert and the whole Late Show franchise didn’t endear Ellison much either to the talent community, whatever the extent his knowledge of or wink at George Cheeks’ moves may have actually been. The imminent slashing of deals and inevitable staff layoffs as a cost-cutting wave arrives will further stress those relationships. And Ellison’s dynamic with journalists will be put to the test as 60 Minutes remains in free fall after Bill Owens’ departure (though Tanya Simon’s elevation reassured staff for now) and a controversial $16 million settlement with the Trump administration widely seen as quid pro quo for getting FCC-approved in the first place. CBS News also will install an ombudsman, scouring for bias, which has sparked anxiety among staff. Acquisition talks with Bari Weiss’ The Free Press will raise questions about the politics of Ellison, who has described himself as a “socially liberal” person; so will his father’s ongoing tight relationship with Donald Trump. Many of the metaphors around Ellison spotlight his love of flying – he got his pilot’s license as a teenager and has been performing aerobatic stunts ever since – as Tom Cruise and every journalist in town has invoked stalls, tailslides and inside loops to describe Ellison’s approach to challenges. But in Hollywood the more apt analogy might be to Brad Pitt’s World War Z, a movie Ellison’s money bailed out after its budget ballooned and an explosive climactic scene shot in Budapest (for Red Square) was deemed, in technical industry parlance, bad. Ellison kicked in millions for rewrites and reshoots, saving the film and launching a summer blockbuster. The irony was that the filmmaking team did this by going small: the third act of that 2013 movie as newly penned by Damon Lindelof and Drew Goddard famously featured a much quieter and more intimate ending in which Pitt walks carefully to outwit a single zombie. The Hollywood meaning is hard to miss: sometimes the unexpected move saves the day. Also, if you take a wrong step, you could get devoured. Pamela McClintock contributed to this report.

Stratechery Plus Learn MoreMember Forum Stratechery Plus Learn MoreMember Forum Latest Podcast Listen to Podcast Listen to this post: It’s fun — and often accurate — to think of tech companies in pairs. Apple and Microsoft defined the PC market; Microsoft and Intel won it. Google and Meta dominate digital advertising; Apple and Google won mobile. That, however, is not the defining pair of the smartphone era, which ran from the introduction of the iPhone in 2007 to the launch of ChatGPT in 2022; rather, the two most important companies of the last two decades of tech were Apple and Amazon, specifically AWS. The Apple part is easy: the iPhone market created the smartphone paradigm, from its user interface (touch) to its distribution channel (the App Store), and was richly rewarded with a bit under half of the unit marketshare and a bit under all of the total profits. Google did well to control the rest in terms of the Android operating system, and profit from it all thanks to Google Search, but it was Search that remained their north star; the company’s primary error in the era was the few years they let the tail (Android) wave the dog (Google). The AWS part is maybe less obvious, but no less critical — and the timing is notable. Amazon created AWS in 2006, just 10 months before the iPhone unveiling, and the paradigm they created was equally critical to the smartphone era. I explained the link in 2020’s The End of the Beginning: This last point gets at why the cloud and mobile, which are often thought of as two distinct paradigm shifts, are very much connected: the cloud meant applications and data could be accessed from anywhere; mobile made the I/O layer available everywhere. The combination of the two make computing continuous. What is notable is that the current environment appears to be the logical endpoint of all of these changes: from batch-processing to continuous computing, from a terminal in a different room to a phone in your pocket, from a tape drive to data centers all over the globe. In this view the personal computer/on-premises server era was simply a stepping stone between two ends of a clearly defined range. AWS was not the only public cloud provider, of course — Azure and Google Cloud Platform were both launched in 2008 — but by virtue of being first they both defined the paradigm and also were the the first choice of the universe of applications that ran on smartphones or, more accurately, ran everywhere. If Apple and AWS were the definers — and thus winners — of the smartphone era, then it was Microsoft and Nokia that were the losers. The reasons for their failure were myriad, but there was one common thread: neither could shake off the overhang of having won their previous paradigm; indeed, both failed in part because they deluded themselves into thinking that their previous domination was an advantage. For Microsoft that previous paradigm was the PC and the Windows platform, which the company thought they could extend to mobile; from 2014’s Microsoft’s Mobile Muddle: Saying “Microsoft missed mobile” is a bit unfair; Windows Mobile came out way back in 2000, and the whole reason Google bought Android was the fear that Microsoft would dominate mobile the way they dominated the PC era. It turned out, though, that mobile devices, with their focus on touch, simplified interfaces, and ARM foundation, were nothing like PCs. Everyone had to start from scratch, and if starting from scratch, by definition Microsoft didn’t have any sort of built-in advantage. They were simply out-executed. It took Microsoft years — and a new CEO — to realize their mistake, up and to the point where they put their enterprise productivity dominance at risk; from 2015’s Redmond and Reality: There’s reality, and there’s Redmond, and if one thing marked the last few years of Steve Ballmer’s tenure as the CEO of Microsoft, it was the sense that those were two distinct locales. In reality, Android (plus AOSP in China) and iOS were carving up the world phone market; in Redmond Ballmer doubled-down on the losing Window Phone bet by buying Nokia. In reality Office was losing relevance because of its absence on the mobile platforms that mattered; in Redmond Ballmer personally delayed Office on iOS until the Windows Modern née Metro version was finished. And in reality, all kinds of startups were taking aim at the Microsoft enterprise stack; in Redmond, Microsoft was determined to own it all, just as they had in the PC era. It’s fitting that Microsoft and Nokia ended up together; perhaps they were able to jointly go to therapy for success-induced obliviousness of market realities. Nokia dominated the phone market for the decade prior to the iPhone, and even once the iPhone was announced, blithely assumed that they could simply lean on their existing advantages to fend off the Silicon Valley usurper. From 2013’s Blackberry — and Nokia’s — Fundamental Failing: Nokia dominated all the parts of this stack you don’t see: they had, and in some respects, still have, the best supply chain and distribution network. In addition, they had high quality hardware that served every segment imaginable. Notably absent in these strengths is the OS and Apps. By 2009, BlackBerry OS and Symbian were clearly obsolete, and their app ecosystems, such as they were, were eclipsed by iOS and then Android. The problem, as I alluded to above, is that while the OS was ultimately under the control of BlackBerry and Nokia, respectively, and thus could be fixed, the efficacy of their ecosystem wasn’t, and wouldn’t be… And so, by far the smartest strategic thing either could have done would have been to accept their weakness — they didn’t have an adequate OS or ecosystem — and focus on their strengths…Nokia should have adopted Android-stock, and used their unmatched supply chain and distribution to do to their competitors, well, exactly what Nokia had been doing to their competitors for the last decade (if you think Samsung is running roughshod over everyone today, in 2007 they could only manage 41 million phones compared to Nokia’s 110 million). Both BlackBerry and Nokia would have gotten a good OS and thriving ecosystem for free and been able to compete and differentiate themselves on the exact same vectors they had previously. To put it another way, RIM and Nokia had never been successful because of their OS or ecosystem, yet both decided their best response to iOS and Android was to build a new OS! In fact, the strategic superiority of the Android option for RIM and Nokia was even then so obvious that I suspect their core failing was not so much strategic as it was all-too-human: pride. Owning an ecosystem seems much more important than owning services or supply chains, even if building said ecosystem completely devalues what you’re actually good at. If the first commonality in Microsoft and Nokia’s failure is the assumption that dominance in one paradigm would seamlessly translate into dominance in the next, then the second was in not making the strategically obvious choice — embracing iOS and Android for Windows, and Android for Nokia — for fear of losing control and long-term relevance. What separates the two companies is that Microsoft, under CEO Satya Nadella, rectified their mistake, while Nokia doubled-down with Windows Phone; that is why Microsoft still matters today — more than ever, in fact — while Nokia phones no longer exist. The two companies that stood in constrast to Microsoft and Nokia were Google and Samsung; while their dominance of the non-iPhone market seems obvious in retrospect, it wasn’t at all pre-ordained. What is impressive about both companies is that they had the opposite of pride: both were quite shameless, in fact. From 2013’s Shameless Samsung: Every pre-iPhone phone maker is irrelevant, if they even exist, except for Samsung, who is thriving. Samsung the copycat was smart enough to realize they needed to change, and quickly, and so they did. Or maybe it wasn’t being smart. Maybe it was simply not caring what anyone else thought about them, their strategy, or their inspiration. Most successful companies, including Apple, including Google, seem remarkably capable of ignoring the naysayers and simply doing what is right for their company. In the case of smartphones, why wouldn’t you copy the iPhone? Nokia refused and look where that got them! We, especially in the West, have a powerful sense of justice and fairness when it comes to product features and being first. Business, though, is not fair, even if it is more just than we care to admit. Just as Samsung blatantly copied Apple hardware, Android blatantly copied the iOS interface: Plenty of people mocked Google for this shift, but not me: Apple figured out what worked; it would have been foolish to not copy them. Foolish like Microsoft and Nokia. There were striking resemblances in last week’s earnings calls from Apple and Amazon, not just to each other, but to this early smartphone era that I have just recounted. Both companies are facing questions about their AI strategies — Apple for its failure to invest in a large language model of its own, or deeply partner with a model builder, and Amazon for prioritizing its own custom architectures and under-deploying leading edge Nvidia solutions — and both had similar responses: It’s Early Tim Cook (from a post-earnings all-hands meeting): Cook struck an optimistic tone, noting that Apple is typically late to promising new technologies. “We’ve rarely been first,” the executive told staffers. “There was a PC before the Mac; there was a smartphone before the iPhone; there were many tablets before the iPad; there was an MP3 player before iPod.” But Apple invented the “modern” versions of those product categories, he said. “This is how I feel about AI.” Andy Jassy: The first thing I would say is that I think it is so early right now in AI. If you look at what’s really happening in the space, it’s very top heavy. So you have a small number of very large frontier models that are being trained that spend a lot on computing, a couple of which are being trained on top of AWS and others are being trained elsewhere. And then you also have, I would say, a relatively small number of very large-scale generative AI applications. We Will Serve Actual Use Cases Tim Cook: We see AI as one of the most profound technologies of our lifetime. We are embedding it across our devices and platforms and across the company. We are also significantly growing our investments. Apple has always been about taking the most advanced technologies and making them easy to use and accessible for everyone, and that’s at the heart of our AI strategy. With Apple Intelligence, we’re integrating AI features across our platforms in a way that is deeply personal, private, and seamless, right where users need them. Andy Jassy: We have a very significant number of enterprises and startups who are running applications on top of AWS’ AI services and but, like the amount of usage and the expansiveness of the use cases and how much people are putting them into production and the number of agents that are going to exist, it’s still just earlier stage than it’s going to be, and so then when you think about what’s going to matter in AI, what are customers going to care about when they’re thinking about what infrastructure use, I think you kind of have to look at the different layers of the stack. And I think…if you look at where the real costs are, they’re going to ultimately be an inference today, so much of the cost in training because customers are really training their models and trying to figure out to get the applications into production. Our Chips Are Best Tim Cook: Apple Silicon is at the heart of all of these experiences, enabling powerful Apple Intelligence features to run directly on device. For more advanced tasks, our servers, also powered by Apple Silicon, deliver even greater capabilities while preserving user privacy through our Private Cloud Compute architecture. We believe our platforms offer the best way for users to experience the full potential of generative AI. Thanks to the exceptional performance of our systems, our users are able to run generative AI models right on their Mac, iPad, and iPhone. We’re excited about the work we’re doing in this space, and it’s incredibly rewarding to see the strong momentum building. Andy Jassy: At scale, 80% to 90% of the cost will be an inference because you only train periodically, but you’re spinning out predictions and inferences all the time, and so what they’re going to care a lot about is they’re going to care about the compute and the hardware they’re using. We have a very deep partnership with Nvidia and will for as long as I can foresee, but we saw this movie in the CPU space with Intel, where customers are anchoring for better price performance. And so we built just like in the CPU space, where we built our own custom silicon and building Graviton which is about 40% more price performance than the other leading x86 processors, we’ve done the same thing on the custom silicon side in AI with Trainium and our second version of Trainium2…it’s about 30% and 40% better price performance than the other GPU providers out there right now, and we’re already working on our third version of Trainium as well. So I think a lot of the compute and the inference is going to ultimately be run on top of Trainium2. We Have the Data Tim Cook: We’re making good progress on a more personalized Siri, and we do expect to release the features next year, as we had said earlier. Our focus from an AI point of view is on putting AI features across the platform that are deeply personal, private, and seamlessly integrated, and, of course, we’ve done that with more than 20 Apple Intelligence features so far, from Visual Intelligence to Clean Up to Writing Tools and all the rest. Andy Jassy: People aren’t paying as close attention as they will and making sure that those generative AI applications are operating where the rest of their data and infrastructure. Remember, a lot of generative AI inference is just going to be another building block like compute, storage and database. And so people are going to actually want to run those applications close to where the other applications are running, where their data is. There’s just so many more applications and data running in AWS than anywhere else. Both Apple and Amazon’s arguments are very plausible! To summarize each: Apple: Large language models are useful, but will be a commodity, and easily accessible on your iPhone; what is the most useful to people, however, is AI that has your private data as context, and only we can provide that. We will provide AI with your data as context at scale and at low cost — both in terms of CapEx and OpEx — by primarily running inference on device. People are also concerned about sharing their personal data with AI companies, so when we need more capabilities we will use our own compute infrastructure, which will run on our own chips, not Nvidia chips. Amazon: Large language models are useful, but will be a commodity, and widely available on any cloud. What is the most useful to companies, however, is AI that has your enterprise data as context, and more enterprises are on AWS than anywhere else. We will provide AI with a company’s data as context at scale and at low cost — both in terms of CapEx and OpEx — by primarily running inference on our own AI chips, not Nvidia chips. What is notable about both arguments — and again, this doesn’t mean they are wrong! — is how conveniently they align with how the companies operated in the previous era. Apple powered apps with Apple Silicon on the edge with an emphasis on privacy, and Amazon powered apps in the cloud with its own custom architecture focused first and foremost on low costs. The risk both companies are taking is the implicit assumption that AI is not a paradigm shift like mobile was. In Apple’s case, they assume that users want an iPhone first, and will ultimately be satisfied with good-enough local AI; in AWS’s case, they assume that AI is just another primitive like compute or storage that enterprises will tack onto their AWS bill. I wrote after last fall’s re:Invent: The emphasis on “choice” in the presentation, first in terms of regular AWS, and then later in terms of AI, is another way to say that the options are, in the end, mere commodities. Sure, the cutting edge for both inference and especially training will be Nvidia, and AWS will offer Nvidia instances (to the extent they fit in AWS’ network), but AWS’s bet is that a necessary component of generative AI being productized is that models fade in importance. Note this bit from Garman leading up to his Bedrock discussion: We talked about wanting this set of building blocks that builders could use to invent anything that they could imagine. We also talked about how many of the cases we walked through today, that we’ve redefined how people thought about these as applications change. Now people’s expectations are actually changing for applications again with generative AI, and increasingly my view is generative AI inference is going to be a core building block for every single application. In fact, I think generative AI actually has the potential to transform every single industry, every single company out there, every single workflow out there, every single user experience out there… This expansive view of generative AI’s importance — notice how Garman put it on the same level as the compute, storage, and database primitives — emphasizes the importance of it becoming a commodity, with commodity-like concerns about price, performance, and flexibility. In other words, exactly what AWS excels at. To put it another way, AWS’s bet is that AI will be important enough that it won’t, in the end, be special at all, which is very much Amazon’s sweet spot. Go back to that illustration from The End of the Beginning: Apple and Amazon are betting that AI is just another primitive in continuous computing that happens everywhere. The most optimistic AI scenarios, however, point to something new: A better word for “Anywhere” is probably autonomous, but I wanted to stick with the “Where” theme; what I’m talking about, however, is agents: AI doing work without any human involvement at all. The potential productivity gains for companies are obvious: there is a massive price umbrella for inference costs if the end result is that you don’t need to employ a human to do the same work. In this world what matters most is performance, not cost, which means that Amazon’s obsession with costs is missing the point; it’s also a world where the company’s lack of a competitive leading edge model makes it harder for them to compete, particularly when there is another company in the ecosystem — Google — that not only has its own custom chip strategy (TPUs), but also is integrating those chips with its competitive leading edge large language model (Gemini). Tim Cook, meanwhile, has talked for years now about his excitement about AR glasses, which fit with the idea of augmentation; Mark Gurman reported in Bloomberg earlier this year: Still, all of this is a stepping stone toward Cook’s grand vision, which hasn’t changed in a decade. He wants true augmented reality glasses — lightweight spectacles that a customer could wear all day. The AR element will overlay data and images onto real-world views. Cook has made this idea a top priority for the company and is hell-bent on creating an industry-leading product before Meta can. “Tim cares about nothing else,” says someone with knowledge of the matter. “It’s the only thing he’s really spending his time on from a product development standpoint.” Still, it will take many years for true AR glasses to be ready. A variety of technologies need to be perfected, including extraordinarily high-resolution displays, a high-performance chip and a tiny battery that could offer hours of power each day. Apple also needs to figure out applications that make such a device as compelling as the iPhone. And all this has to be available in large quantities at a price that won’t turn off consumers. What seems likely to me is that for this product to succeed, Apple will need to figure out generative AI as well; I posited last year that generative AI will undergird future user interfaces in The Gen AI Bridge to the Future. From a section recounting my experience with Meta’s Orion AR glasses: This, I think, is the future: the exact UI you need — and nothing more — exactly when you need it, and at no time else. This specific example was, of course, programmed deterministically, but you can imagine a future where the glasses are smart enough to generate UI on the fly based on the context of not just your request, but also your broader surroundings and state. This is where you start to see the bridge: what I am describing is an application of generative AI, specifically to on-demand UI interfaces. It’s also an application that you can imagine being useful on devices that already exist. A watch application, for example, would be much more usable if, instead of trying to navigate by touch like a small iPhone, it could simply show you the exact choices you need to make at a specific moment in time. Again, we get hints of that today through deterministic programming, but the ultimate application will be on-demand via generative AI. This may sound fanciful, but then again, I wrote in early 2022 that generative AI would be the key to making the metaverse viable: In the very long run this points to a metaverse vision that is much less deterministic than your typical video game, yet much richer than what is generated on social media. Imagine environments that are not drawn by artists but rather created by AI: this not only increases the possibilities, but crucially, decreases the costs. That may have also sounded fanciful at the time, but it’s already reality: just yesterday Google DeepMind announced Genie 3; from their blog post: Today we are announcing Genie 3, a general purpose world model that can generate an unprecedented diversity of interactive environments. Given a text prompt, Genie 3 can generate dynamic worlds that you can navigate in real time at 24 frames per second, retaining consistency for a few minutes at a resolution of 720p. […] Achieving a high degree of controllability and real-time interactivity in Genie 3 required significant technical breakthroughs. During the auto-regressive generation of each frame, the model has to take into account the previously generated trajectory that grows with time. For example, if the user is revisiting a location after a minute, the model has to refer back to the relevant information from a minute ago. To achieve real-time interactivity, this computation must happen multiple times per second in response to new user inputs as they arrive… Genie 3’s consistency is an emergent capability. Other methods such as NeRFs and Gaussian Splatting also allow consistent navigable 3D environments, but depend on the provision of an explicit 3D representation. By contrast, worlds generated by Genie 3 are far more dynamic and rich because they’re created frame by frame based on the world description and actions by the user. We are still far from the metaverse, to be clear, or on-demand interfaces in general, but it’s stunning how much closer we are than a mere three years ago; to that end, betting on current paradigms may make logical sense — particularly if you dominate the current paradigm — but things really are changing with stunning speed. Apple and Amazon’s risk may be much larger than either appreciate. Genie 3 is, as I noted, from Google, and thinking about these paradigm shifts — first the shift to mobile, and now the ongoing one to AI — has made me much more appreciative and respectful of Google. I recounted above how the company did what was necessary — including overhauling Android to mimic iOS — to capture its share of the mobile paradigm; as we approach the three year anniversary of ChatGPT, it’s hard to not be impressed at how the company has gone all-in on relevancy with AI. This wasn’t a guarantee: two months after ChatGPT, in early 2023, I wrote AI and the Big Five, and expressed my concerns about the company’s potential disruption: That, though, ought only increase the concern for Google’s management that generative AI may, in the specific context of search, represent a disruptive innovation instead of a sustaining one. Disruptive innovation is, at least in the beginning, not as good as what already exists; that’s why it is easily dismissed by managers who can avoid thinking about the business model challenges by (correctly!) telling themselves that their current product is better. The problem, of course, is that the disruptive product gets better, even as the incumbent’s product becomes ever more bloated and hard to use — and that certainly sounds a lot like Google Search’s current trajectory. I’m not calling the top for Google; I did that previously and was hilariously wrong. Being wrong, though, is more often than not a matter of timing: yes, Google has its cloud and YouTube’s dominance only seems to be increasing, but the outline of Search’s peak seems clear even if it throws off cash and profits for years. Meanwhile, I wasn’t worried about Apple and Amazon at all: I saw AI as being a complement for Apple, and predicted that the company would invest heavily in local inference; when it came to Amazon I was concerned that they might suffer from not have an integrated approach a la Google, but predicted that AI would slot in cleanly to their existing cloud business. In other words, exactly what Apple and Amazon’s executives are banking on. I wonder, however, if there is a version of this analysis that, were it written in 2007, might have looked like this: Nokia will be fine; once they make a modern OS, their existing manufacturing and distribution advantages will carry the day. Microsoft, meanwhile, will mimic the iPhone UI just like they once did the Mac, and then leverage their app advantage to dominate the lower end of the market. It’s Google, which depends on people clicking on links on a big desktop screen, that is in danger. I don’t, with the benefit of having actually known myself in 2007, think that would have been my take (and, of course, much of the early years of Stratechery were spent arguing with those who held exactly those types of views). I was, however, a Google skeptic, and I’m humble about that. And, meanwhile, I have that 2023 Article, where, in retrospect, I was quite rooted in the existing paradigm — which favors Apple and Amazon — and skeptical of Google’s ability and willingness to adapt. Today I feel differently. To go back to the smartphone paradigm, the best way to have analyzed what would happen to the market would have been to assume that the winners of the previous paradigm would be fundamentally handicapped in the new one, not despite their previous success, but because of it. Nokia and Microsoft pursued the wrong strategies because they thought they had advantages that ultimately didn’t matter in the face of a new paradigm. If I take that same analytical approach to AI, and assume that the winners of the previous paradigm will be fundamentally handicapped in the new one, not despite their previous success, but because of it, then I ought to have been alarmed about Apple and Amazon’s prospects from the get-go. I’m not, for the record, ready to declare either of them doomed; I am, however, much more alert to the prospect of them making wrong choices for years, the consequences of which won’t be clear until it’s too late. And, by the same token, I’m much more appreciative of Google’s amorphous nature and seeming lack of strategy. That makes them hard to analyze — again, I’ve been honest for years about the challenges I find in understanding Mountain View — but the company successfully navigated one paradigm shift, and is doing much better than I originally expected with this one. Larry Page and Sergey Brin famously weren’t particularly interested in business or in running a company; they just wanted to do cool things with computers in a college-like environment like they had at Stanford. That the company, nearly thirty years later, is still doing cool things with computers in a college-like environment may be maddening to analysts like me who want clarity and efficiency; it also may be the key to not just surviving but winning across multiple paradigms.

Title: MNTN Reports Strong First Earnings, Touts New AI Creative Tools
URL: https://www.adweek.com/convergent-tv/mntn-reports-strong-first-earnings-touts-new-ai-creative-tools/

$68.5 million: MNTN’s total revenue for the second quarter, up 25% year-over-year. Nearly 4,000: The number of advertisers currently using MNTN’s technology, according to CEO Mark Douglas. “That rate is increasing at over 1,000 a quarter,” he added. 97%: The percentage of MNTN’s new (as of 2025) customers that had never advertised on TV before using the platform. $69.5-70.5 million: How much the company expects to make in the third quarter. 77%: MNTN’s gross margin, up from 70% in Q2 of 2024. That represents a 700 basis point improvement, the company said, largely due to MNTN’s decision to spin off Ryan Reynolds’ creative agency, Maximum Effort. Ahead of its first earnings call, MNTN saw a spike in stock price that took it to almost double the $16-per-share value it debuted at on May 21, dropping only slightly after yesterday’s earnings call. While Douglas didn’t offer an explanation for the dip, he pointed to the overall positive trend of the company’s stock prices as evidence of investors’ confidence in MNTN’s proposition: to give small- and midsized businesses access to performance-based CTV advertising. Douglas also claimed that the growth MNTN saw this quarter—85% uptick in active performance TV customers—is sustainable for the foreseeable future. “There are just a significant number of small- [and] midsized businesses,” he told ADWEEK. “We’re bringing them into the TV realm, and the rate at which are doing that is accelerating—we think it’s actually sustainable for quite a while.” He pointed to Meta, which made $46.6 billion in ad revenue in Q2 from millions of advertisers. The company is also piloting generative AI tools that help advertisers create TV ads, Douglas said. “We’re already generating thousands of AI-generated ads—over 1,000 customer-facing and 18,000 test ads,” he said. MNTN plans to officially launch the product later this year, which Douglas expects will make it easier for smaller advertisers to create 30-second TV spots at a significantly cheaper rate. MNTN expects to be able to continue to increase its gross margin following a significant jump in the past year, targeting growth between 75-80% in future quarters. “We’re sitting at 77% for the quarter, and that’s a quarter in which we didn’t have [Maximum Effort] and the creative costs, so that that’s a significant reduction,” Patrick Pohlen, MNTN’s chief financial officer, told investors during the call. By cutting hosting and media costs over the next few quarters, Pohlen expects MNTN will continue to improve on gross margin, he said. Kathryn Lundstrom is Adweek's sustainability editor.

Title: These are the top takeaways for investors from the latest high-profile earnings reports
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-earnings-q2-amd-scmi-palantir-ai-tech-stocks-2025-8

Companies have reported mostly strong second-quarter earnings so far, but there are some specific takeaways investors should be aware of. So far, 82% of companies that have reported results have beaten estimated. According to FactSet, if that percentage holds, it will represent the highest percentage of quarterly earnings beats since the third quarter of 20221. Earnings will continue rolling in over the coming weeks, with tech titan Nvidia set to report at the end of August. Until then, here are some key insights from the last results: What happened: Advanced Micro Devices and Super Micro Computer both reported earnings for the second quarter on Tuesday, with mixed results. AMD beat on revenue, but missed earnings estimates slightly. The chipmaker posted adjusted earnings per share of $0.48, a hair below the expected $0.49 a share. Lisa Su, AMD's CEO, said the firm's AI revenue declined on a year-over-year basis largely due to US export restrictions, which have prevented AMD from selling its MI308 AI chip to China. Shares were down as much as 8% on Wednesday. Super Micro, meanwhile, missed slightly on both earnings and revenue. The chipmaker said revenue came in at $5.76 billion, below the expected $5.89 billion, and earnings per share came in at $0.41, below the $0.44 Wall Street expected. The miss was partly fueled by the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs, Charles Liang, the CEO, said on a call with analysts on Tuesday. Shares of the chipmaker were down 17% after the results. What it means: AI chip manufacturers are caught in the crossfire of the trade war. That's expected to remain a key concern as the US irons out the details of its trade relationship with China. The US and China have until August 12 to strike a trade deal before higher tariffs kick in, another headwind that could rattle the market and semiconductor stocks in particular. "Industry-wide tariff impact is only now being felt and could result in headwinds for the entire semiconductor industry," Gadjo Sevilla, a senior analyst at EMARKETER, wrote in a note. What happened: McDonald's beat on earnings and revenue expectations for the quarter, but voiced concerns about the health of lower-income consumers and the ability of Americans to keep spending. The fast food franchise said revenue came in at $6.84 billion for the quarter, above the $6.7 billion analysts expected. Earnings per share came in at an adjusted $3.19, above estimates of $3.15. "Re-engaging the low-income consumer is critical," Chris Kempczinski, the CEO, said on the company's earnings call, adding that low-income Americans were more likely to visit the chain than other income groups. "This bifurcated consumer base is why we remain cautious about the overall near-term health of the US consumer." What it means: Consumer spending is in focus for retail giants and for Wall Street, given the cumulative effects of inflation in recent years and Trump's tariffs. Economists say tariffs could stoke inflation, as companies can pass along the cost of import duties to consumers. For now, though spending remains fairly strong, even as concerns have risen recently around a pullback among both high and low-income households. What happened: Palantir blew past estimates for second quarter earnings. The data software firm revealed that its revenue surpassed $1 billion for the first time, reflecting a 55% year-over-year increase. Shares popped as much as 10% after its results, bringing the stock up 130% year-to-date. What it means: The AI trade is alive and well, with firms still benefitting from the hype for artificial intelligence. Wedbush Securities called Palantir the "Messi of AI" in a note to clients shortly after the firm reported earnings. In a separate note, analysts lifted their price target for the stock to $200 a share, implying 15% upside from current levels. "Palantir remains one of our top tech names to own in 2025 and this deal represents another opportunity for PLTR to capitalize on while continuing to generate unprecedented traction for its entire portfolio across the federal and commercial landscapes," analysts said. What happened: Microsoft and Meta both beat on earnings last week. Microsoft took in $76.4 billion in revenue and $3.65 in earnings per share, above estimates of $73.8 billion and $3.37 a share. The company also joined the $4 trillion club for the first time as its stock surged following its earnings report, with shares up 26% year-to-date. Meta, meanwhile, took in $47.5 billion in revenue and $7.14 in earnings per share, above estimates of $44.83 billion and $5.89 a share. The stock is up 27% year-to-date. What it means: Mega-cap tech is still dominating the market. Tech was best-performing area of the S&P 500 in July, with the sector up 5% in the month. The Nasdaq hit 14 record highs in July, causing Deutsche Bank to declare that "tech-ceptionalism" has resumed for the market. The strong outperformance of large-cap stocks accelerated, further widening the gap between small-cap peers. "We continue to favor US large cap Tech over its small cap counterpart, as it takes a highly speculative market (i.e. 2021) or Big Tech to fall out of favor (i.e. 2022, Q4 2024) for the latter to outperform," Nicholas Colas, the co-founder of the research firm DataTrek, wrote in a note.

Title: These are the top takeaways for investors from the latest high-profile earnings reports

Companies have reported mostly strong second-quarter earnings so far, but there are some specific takeaways investors should be aware of. So far, 82% of companies that have reported results have beaten estimated. According to FactSet, if that percentage holds, it will represent the highest percentage of quarterly earnings beats since the third quarter of 20221. Earnings will continue rolling in over the coming weeks, with tech titan Nvidia set to report at the end of August. Until then, here are some key insights from the last results: What happened: Advanced Micro Devices and Super Micro Computer both reported earnings for the second quarter on Tuesday, with mixed results. AMD beat on revenue, but missed earnings estimates slightly. The chipmaker posted adjusted earnings per share of $0.48, a hair below the expected $0.49 a share. Lisa Su, AMD's CEO, said the firm's AI revenue declined on a year-over-year basis largely due to US export restrictions, which have prevented AMD from selling its MI308 AI chip to China. Shares were down as much as 8% on Wednesday. Super Micro, meanwhile, missed slightly on both earnings and revenue. The chipmaker said revenue came in at $5.76 billion, below the expected $5.89 billion, and earnings per share came in at $0.41, below the $0.44 Wall Street expected. The miss was partly fueled by the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs, Charles Liang, the CEO, said on a call with analysts on Tuesday. Shares of the chipmaker were down 17% after the results. What it means: AI chip manufacturers are caught in the crossfire of the trade war. That's expected to remain a key concern as the US irons out the details of its trade relationship with China. The US and China have until August 12 to strike a trade deal before higher tariffs kick in, another headwind that could rattle the market and semiconductor stocks in particular.

While headlines still frame AI and automation as "emerging," behind the scenes, corporations are already replacing humans at a massive scale—without a grand announcement, without public debate, and often, without employees realizing until it's too late. This isn't a prediction. It's a real-time labor displacement strategy playing out across global supply chains, stores, warehouses, and offices. These aren't isolated incidents. This is industrial restructuring at global scale, driven not by AI fear—but by efficiency, uptime, and Return On Investment. It can: Companies aren't framing this as layoffs. They're calling it: But the result is the same: fewer people. More machines. Lower cost. Unlike past automation waves, this one affects: What makes this dangerous is that it's: Here's the path forward—because while AI can be disruptive, it can also be empowering, if we move with clarity and purpose. Yes—AI is replacing jobs. But the real danger isn't just that AI is accelerating. It's that too many people still think they're safe because no one's told them otherwise. This article is your warning. But more importantly—it's your rallying cry. You are not helpless. You are not obsolete. But you do need to move. Now. Because AI isn't waiting for anyone.

August 06, 2025 10:38 ET | Source: Grabar Law Office Grabar Law Office PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Centene Corporation (NYSE: CNC): Grabar Law Office is investigating claims on behalf of shareholders of Centene Corporation (NYSE: CNC). The investigation concerns whether certain officers and directors breached the fiduciary duties they owed to the company. If you purchased Centene (NYSE: CNC) shares prior to December 12, 2024 and still hold shares today, please visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/centene-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call us at 267-507-6085 to learn more. You can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to you whatsoever. WHY? As alleged in a recently filed securities fraud class action complaint, Centene Corporation (NYSE: CNC) provided investors with material information concerning Centene’s expected revenue guidance and adjusted diluted EPS for fiscal year 2025. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in the Company’s enrollment and morbidity rates, as well as strong retention rates in Centene’s Medicare business. The Complaint alleges that Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Centene’s enrollment and morbidity rates. The Complaint claims that such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Centene’s securities at artificially inflated prices. WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW: If you purchased Centene (NYSE: CNC) shares prior to December 12, 2024 and still hold shares today, you are encouraged to visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/centene-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call us at 267-507-6085. You can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to you whatsoever. If, alternatively, you purchased your shares between December 12, 2024, and June 30, 2025, you can participate in the class action. $CNC #Centene DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: DV): Grabar Law Office is investigating whether certain officers and directors of DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: DV) breached their fiduciary duties owed to the company. If you have held DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: DV) shares since prior to November 10, 2023, and would like to learn more about the investigation and your rights, please visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/doubleverify-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call us at 267-507-6085. You can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to you whatsoever. Why? As alleged in an underlying securities fraud class action complaint, DoubleVerify (NYSE: DV), via certain of its officers, failed to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company’s high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the above, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. What You Can Do Now: Current DoubleVerify (NYSE: DV) shareholders who have held DoubleVerify shares since prior to November 10, 2023, can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to them whatsoever. If you would like to learn more about this matter, you are encouraged to visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/doubleverify-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua H. Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call 267-507-6085. $DV #DoubleVerify Napco Security Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: NSSC) Shareholder Class Action Survives Motion to Dismiss: If you are a Current Napco Security Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: NSSC) shareholder who has held Napco shares since prior to November 7, 2022, you can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to you whatsoever. Click here to join or learn more: https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/Napco-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua H. Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call 267-507-6085. Why? Key allegations in a recently filed securities fraud class action complaint against the company and certain of its officers have survived a motion to dismiss. That complaint alleges that Napco Security Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: NSSC), through certain of its officers and directors, made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Napco failed to address any material weaknesses with internal controls regarding cost of goods sold ("COGS") and inventory; (2) Napco downplayed the severity of material weaknesses regarding their internal controls; (3) Napco’s unaudited financial statements from September 30, 2022 to the present included “certain errors” such as overstating inventory and understanding net COGS, resulting in overstated gross profit, operating income and net income for each period; (4) as a result, Napco would need to restate its previously filed unaudited financial statements for certain periods; and (5) as a result, Defendants’ statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. On April 11, 2025, the federal court determined that key allegations would survive Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint. In so holding, the court determined “Plaintiffs have adequately stated Exchange Act claims by pleading scienter [knowledge of wrongdoing] through defendants’ unusual stock sales and by plausibly alleging loss causation between the corrective announcement and stock price drop. Plaintiffs have also stated Securities Act claims against Napco and the underwriter defendants.” . . . “Taking the well-pleaded facts as true, there is no question that plaintiffs have adequately pled scienter. First, the stock sales were highly unusual in timing and amount. As to amount, the total proceeds of over $108 million from stock sales by the officer defendants weigh in favor of a motive. . . . And the officer defendants sold hefty percentages of their holdings – 48.5% for Soloway and 45.5% for Buchel.” What To Do Now: If you have held Napco shares since before November 7, 2022 and would like to learn more about this matter, please visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/Napco-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua H. Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call 267-507-6085. You can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to you whatsoever. $NSSC #Napco Treace Medical Concepts, Inc. (NASDAQ: TMCI) If you have held Treace Medical Concepts (NASDAQ: TMCI) shares continuously since prior to May 8, 2023, you can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the Company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost you. Visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/treace-shareholder-investigation/, or contact Joshua H. Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com or call 267-507-6085 to learn more. Why? A recently filed securities class action complaint alleges that, Treace Medical Concepts, Inc. (NASDAQ: TMCI), via certain of its officers, made materially false and/or misleading statements and failed to disclose adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, the Complaint alleges Defendants failed to disclose that: (1) competition impacted the demand for and utilization of its primary product, the Lapiplasty 3D Bunion Correction System; (2) as a result, Treace Medical’s revenue declined, and the Company needed to accelerate its plans to offer a product that served as an alternative to osteotomy (a surgical procedure involving the cutting and realignment of a bone to improve its position or function); and (3) Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. What You Can Do Now: Current Treace shareholders who have held Treace shares since prior to May 8, 2023, can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to them whatsoever.

Title: Why CQRS and Event Sourcing Are Gaining Ground in High-Concurrency Web Systems

Time Published: 2025-08-06T14:00:09Z
Full Content:
MichaelHilliard, 2025-08-06 In web app development company boardrooms, architects and engineers are debating old assumptions. Scaling up isn’t just about faster servers or better caching anymore. It’s about reshaping how systems think. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) and Event Sourcing are no longer fringe ideas. They’re becoming default choices in high-concurrency systems where consistency, auditability, and performance are non-negotiable. This article doesn’t aim to preach. It exists to explain why these patterns are being adopted, how they work in practice, and where they help solve problems that traditional CRUD-based models keep tripping over. Most developers start with CRUD. It feels intuitive. You create a user, update a record, delete a row. But under load, CRUD systems stretch. When a high volume of concurrent reads and writes hits the same storage, contention begins. Worse, every new feature adds a new write path. Data models balloon with flags, booleans, and optional fields. Business logic hides in service layers. You end up with one model doing too many things. And in distributed systems, this lack of separation multiplies the pain. CQRS and Event Sourcing flip this model. At its core, CQRS says: don't read and write with the same model. A Command updates the system, such as when a user submits an order, changes a password, or adds a product to the cart. These go through a write model. A Query asks the system, 'Show me the order history and get the latest stock count.' That goes through a read model. Separating them has consequences: In high-concurrency systems, this means fewer locks, faster reads, and clearer logic paths. In most systems, state is stored as current values. A user's balance is just a number in a column. With Event Sourcing, state is the result of a series of events. Each deposit, withdrawal, and fee is recorded as an immutable event. To know the balance, you replay the events. This approach brings: When combined with CQRS, your writes produce events, and your reads project those events into models optimized for access. Let’s say you’re building a web-based logistics app used by hundreds of agents updating package statuses every few seconds, while another team is running queries on shipping time averages across regions. With traditional models, these reads and writes compete. Locking, version conflicts, and long-running queries slow everything down. CQRS decouples the two. Writers update the system without interfering with readers. Readers get precomputed views that are updated via events. The result: lower contention, faster response times, and a system that scales horizontally. Event Sourcing, meanwhile, gives you a timeline. When a shipment shows an incorrect status, you can trace exactly how it happened. No need for logs. The data is the log. This isn't a silver bullet. CQRS and Event Sourcing introduce tradeoffs. Even Git is an event-sourced system. Every commit is an event. The current state is a projection. NEventStore and Marten (C#): Useful in .NET stacks for event-based architectures. More teams are now building their own lightweight versions of CQRS and ES without full-stack frameworks. This makes sense for web apps that want the architectural benefits without the lock-in. With CQRS and Event Sourcing, you test behavior, not just state. Did the correct event get produced from the command? Did that event create the expected read model projection? This encourages better domain modeling. Your codebase becomes a journal of behaviors, not just side effects. Debugging means walking the event stream. Many teams now keep tooling to replay and inspect events. This improves incident response. For high-concurrency systems, eventual consistency is often a requirement, not a limitation. Having strongly consistent reads in all cases adds latency and blocks scaling. By designing with eventual consistency in mind, you're treating the system as a distributed one from day one. That means using patterns like: These aren't hacks. They're best practices in systems where throughput matters more than instant state convergence. Traditional systems age badly. You retrofit audit logs, struggle with GDPR requests, and fight schema changes. Event-sourced systems age with grace. You can replay state with new rules. You can build new read models from old data. You can answer questions no one thought to ask before. That’s why technical leads at scale-focused companies are leaning toward these patterns. They help future-proof without pausing product growth. Ask yourself: If yes, CQRS and Event Sourcing aren’t overkill. They’re strategy. But if you're still building MVPs or handling low traffic, the overhead might slow you down. The right move isn’t to blindly adopt CQRS and Event Sourcing. The right move is to learn how and where to use them. There’s a reason these patterns are catching on. They speak to the challenges high-concurrency systems face daily, including data contention, auditability, and operational resilience. It’s not about being clever. It’s about making things clear, testable, and fast. The shift isn’t theoretical anymore. It’s happening, one event at a time. Log in or register to rate You rated this post out of 5.

Title: Nintendo just raised the price on Switch 2 Pro Controller again, but you can land a deal on one right now from $75 (Reg. $90)

Nintendo just hiked the price up on the popular Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller once again. After being announced at $80 back in April before jumping up to $85 ahead of launch, it just saw its MSRP rise again to $90 as part of Nintendo sweeping price hikes that just went live over the weekend. After going out of stock at most major retailers shortly thereafter, you can once again score a “deal” on one at $84.99 via Amazon and even less than that if you’re a Costco member. Again, the price is now officially $90 on the Switch 2 Pro Controller – one of the most popular Switch 2 accessories anywhere. This price is now reflected directly on the Nintendo Store as well select major retailers online (where you can find it in stock). However, anyone can go score one on Amazon right now for $84.99 shipped, which is indeed the launch price but is now $5 under the price of the new MSRP. There’s no telling how long a controller that might not actually see a deep deal for a year or perhaps even more will even be available at this price. Just keep in mind, that if you’re already a paid Costco member, you can score it for even less. Costco already had a deal on the Switch 2 Pro Controller running at $74.99 for more than a few weeks now, but its listing remains impervious to price hikes and is still sitting down at the lowest price we have tracked in brand new condition at retail. Now, the cost of the membership just to score the deal likely isn’t worth it, unless you plan on actually making use of the yearly sub, but for folks already invested in the warehouse box store, this is the best deal around. Nintendo recently announced and put into place price hikes across the previous-generation Switch 1 hardware and it has now taken effect on a number of the Switch Online controllers as well as the Switch 2 Pro Controller and the Switch 2 Joy-Con – the complete details on all of this awaits right here – and it is perhaps only a matter of time before the price jumps land on Switch 2 consoles as well.

Title: Xbox Is An Increasingly Unstable Platform For Anyone To Invest In

GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links. Constantly shifting motivations and tumultuous overhauls have poisoned the well of Xbox's ecosystem. By Moises Taveras on August 6, 2025 at 6:42AM PDT Xbox is going through an identity crisis. The most recent wave of layoffs at Microsoft, which cut about 9,000 jobs including numerous positions at studios under the Xbox banner, suggests as much. These cost-cutting measures are said to be in the service of some realignment or reorganization that's always purported to set up these companies for greater success. And yet they keep happening, further eroding any trust and goodwill the brand may have built up from previous successes. After several waves of job cuts, restructurings, pivots in strategy, and any other corporate jargon I've neglected to mention, I'm beginning to suspect that Xbox's growing instability deserves more scrutiny and concern from its developers and consumers alike. Let's be direct: The journey that Xbox has been on over the last decade appears to be a failure. Its famous spree of purchases and the subsequent management of its studios has churned out about as many blemished games as it has delays, cancellations, and studio closures. That isn't to say Xbox hasn't produced hits and gems, but along the way there, Xbox has also built up quite the track record of critically panned games, cancelled projects, and defunct teams.

By clicking 'enter', you agree to GameSpot's Terms of Use and Privacy Policy enter Now Playing: Xbox Studio Closures Are Confusing | Spot On No matter the aspect that you place under the microscope, Xbox is clearly bleeding through the bandages it keeps applying. Take a glimpse at the stable of teams at Xbox Game Studios, Microsoft's internal publishing division. Its most recent layoff resulted in the closure of at least one team under the banner, The Initiative, and the cancellation of its game Perfect Dark. Turn 10, one of its stalwart developers on the Forza franchise, has been reportedly cut to the bone. Rare, which was working on Everwild while maintaining the live-service title Sea of Thieves, is invariably in a worse position on the other side of the layoffs than it was before. The brunt of the damage from moves like these falls on the affected teams and their workers, and it's a disappointingly common move for Xbox, which has done this at least once before when a similar reorganizing shuttered four teams in May 2024, including Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks. These closures came within a few short years of Microsoft's acquisition of Bethesda. Another layoff followed shortly after the completed purchase of Activision Blizzard, cutting several jobs across its teams and leading to the cancellation of a survival game at Blizzard. The fact remains that bringing Bethesda's tremendous portfolio of megaton hits like Fallout and The Elder Scrolls in-house, as well as Activision Blizzard (and mobile developer King), should've stemmed the bloodloss, but Xbox's hemorrhaging and proclivity for retail therapy only seemed to worsen with each purchase. Anything else suggests the reckless endangerment of an entire industry. These moves should've uniformly led to greater stability for developers under the Xbox banner and a greater deal of games on the platforms. They didn't. Some studios, like Obsidian, have miraculously flourished under these conditions, producing new franchises and hits in existing ones, solidifying its place in Xbox's crumbling hierarchy of studios. Others, like Arkane Austin, haven't been as lucky. And gamers and developers alike suffer when that's the case. If everyone's going through it, who exactly is benefitting from Xbox's continued vision--or lack thereof? The motivation behind many of these purchases is an obvious one: Game Pass. Since its launch in 2017, the subscription service has been Xbox's biggest talking point, and as the years have passed, it has grown into the single biggest driver for engagement with the gaming division. Following the Xbox One's opening fumbles and hurdles, Microsoft devised a silver bullet that could rebuild its ecosystem and assure its biggest and smallest games had an audience. The service has even paid for the development of independent and third-party titles, making it a lifeline to some. But Game Pass has been a pain to grow despite its occasional surges, and its continued upkeep remains costly despite Xbox's claims that the service is profitable, with some major caveats. As a result, Xbox has even transformed Game Pass for the worse, introducing tiers that sell greater benefits for high-paying subscribers, all the while stripping access to portions of the expansive game library from members at the lowest levels. This move is a sharp reversal of Game Pass' earliest promises to connect gamers to the breadth of the console's titles. What once was often touted as the best deal in gaming has now become so diluted that it is now more anti-consumer than its original incarnation. Another line crossed. And though Game Pass funds the development of a number of projects, and still does, many developers have spoken up about how Game Pass has actually hurt their teams and titles. Mike Rose of the indie publisher No More Robots has been pretty open in the past about how Game Pass can assure a huge launch audience, which is great for teams struggling to find players, but also noted how the team's games would see little change in sales after being on the service. Instead, it typically got spikes just as it was entering the subscription service. Raphael Colantonio, founder of Arkane and later Wolfeye Studios, has become one of the service's biggest critics, recently opining that it is an "unsustainable model that has been increasingly damaging the industry for a decade, subsidized by [Microsoft's] 'infinite money.'" An isolated incident would be one thing, but grievances like Colantonio's have continually cropped up over the years, even if there are other stories that cite Game Pass as instrumental to a game's success. The evidence points to a concerning trend in the Xbox camp that doesn't appear to be going anywhere, and the more it's left as-is, the more likely it seems that developers will have to make a tough decision about their futures in Microsoft's ecosystem. Of course, it's hard to prove either side is wrong or right due to the fact that Microsoft obscures any numbers that could illuminate or disprove these arguments--numbers that Bloomberg's Jason Schreier refers to as "squishy metrics" subject to the whims of "dark accounting wizardry." This means that teams looking for a publishing deal with Xbox simply need to take the company at its word when evaluating whether Game Pass is the right move for their game and their business. But what good is that word with the uncertainty that has persistently hung over Xbox's motivations and decisions for much of the last decade? Is it worth it to take that opportunity and fund that game if the near-future of your team continues to hang in the balance? Doesn't Xbox owe its developers more than false promises of stability once they join the Game Pass service considering how impactfully it can hurt a team's bottom line? Doesn't it owe the same kind of dependability to its subscribers? I feel that answering these questions requires more foresight than I've observed from the brand. After all, this is the gaming giant that settled on the multimedia-heavy approach to the Xbox One that crippled the console out of the gate, and then took away Xbox users' ability to purchase and own digital movies and TV shows recently. It's also the company that settled on an "Everything is an Xbox" marketing campaign that deemphasized the system itself after giving up so much ground to its contemporaries. The campaign isn't an affront itself, but when paired with the worsening Game Pass service, which is how the company can afford to turn smart TVs, Amazon Fire Sticks, and even your PC into an Xbox, the rottenness of the tactic becomes more apparent. Xbox's direction seems to pivot with the wind, and it means that the consumers who buy into its products, as well as the engineers who make them, and the developers that then work to give them value, constantly feel like they're sold up the river for the next big thing that the company does. I don't feel answers coming any time soon. If the latest layoffs are any indication, Xbox's path forward is set in stone, and whatever may come of it has already been deemed worthy of the sacrifice it took to to be realized. As Christopher Dring of The Game Business succinctly puts it, the Xbox we knew is dead. And with it is any semblance of faith this industry and culture can muster for it.

Title: 'Bond King' Bill Gross made millions betting against GameStop. He says the stock is behaving like bitcoin now.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/bond-king-bill-gross-gamestop-meme-stock-bitcoin-crypto-options-2025-8
Time Published: 2025-08-06T13:00:57Z

Bill Gross says he's steering clear of the latest crop of meme stocks for now, despite making millions of dollars betting against GameStop and AMC in the past. The billionaire investor told Business Insider he had "no interest" in Opendoor, Kohl's, American Eagle, and other stocks whose prices spiked as buzz on Reddit and other social media spurred retail traders to pile in. Day traders have Microsoft and Meta "to play with for now," Gross said. The tech titans are up 30% and 25% respectively this year because of AI excitement. Gross — known as the "Bond King" for growing fixed-income titan PIMCO's flagship Total Return Fund to $270 billion over nearly 30 years — said the stock that started it all, GameStop, is "not behaving like a meme" and is "much less volatile" than before. He added that he still viewed it as a "good candidate for option selling." Gross said the stock "seems to mimic bitcoin," the most valuable cryptocurrency, known for its volatility and passionate fanbase. Bitcoin's price fell by a quarter between early January and early April this year, but has rallied to record highs of above $110,000. GameStop announced its first bitcoin purchase in late May, securing 4,710 tokens worth around $537 million at current prices. Adjusted for a stock split in 2022, GameStop soared from around $1 in the summer of 2020 to a peak intraday price of $121 on January 28, 2021. It has traded within a much tighter range of around $20 to $35 over the past 12 months. It followed a similar trajectory to bitcoin by rising sharply in the fourth quarter of 2024, slumping this spring, and rebounding through early June. However, GameStop then fell after disappointing first-quarter earnings and dilutive share sales, whereas bitcoin kept climbing to fresh highs in July. Gross bet against GameStop by selling call options at the height of its meme-stock surge in January 2021. An options contract gives the buyer the right to purchase or sell a stock at an agreed price within a set period. Sellers wager these contracts will expire worthless, and they can simply keep the premium paid by the buyer. Gross was $15 million in the red, losing sleep at one point as GameStop kept climbing, but he doubled down. He later said he made between $15 million and $20 million betting against GameStop and AMC. "I knew I had an advantage over Reddit and the boys," Gross has said about his original meme-stock wagers, as he had access to real-time options and volatility data on his Bloomberg terminal. Gross has been a vocal skeptic of meme stocks for years, calling them "lottery tickets" and describing buyers of overpriced options as "fish at the poker table." He's also said that each buying frenzy ends with a "musical chair, me-first exit" from the stock. Besides GameStop and AMC, Gross also sold put and call options on Trump Media in the spring of 2024 to cash in on the craze around the president's stock.

The mission, titled 'The Harvest Goddess Thrives,' lifted off from Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand at 04:10 UTC on August 5. A single SAR imaging satellite, QPS-SAR-12 - nicknamed KUSHINADA-I after the Japanese harvest goddess - was deployed into a 575 km circular orbit. This was Rocket Lab's fourth iQPS mission this year and the fifth overall, reinforcing Electron's position as the primary vehicle for building out the constellation. "Every Electron launch is a demonstration of payload deployment precision for our customers - an especially critical element when scaling satellite constellations," said Rocket Lab CEO Sir Peter Beck. "Today's fifth and flawless deployment for iQPS once again underscores Electron's reliability and continues to prove that consistent tailored access to space is a reality on Electron for our customers." iQPS CEO Dr. Shunsuke Onishi added: "Building a satellite constellation requires both timely development and manufacturing, as well as highly precise launch execution. We are deeply grateful to both our team and the Rocket Lab team for their continued dedication in making this possible. As the number of satellites increases, so too does the frequency and value of the data we are able to provide. We will continue to accelerate our efforts to ensure that our satellite data can be leveraged in even more fields and applications." This mission was Rocket Lab's 11th Electron launch of the year, with four additional iQPS launches planned through the rest of 2025 and into 2026. Details of the next Electron mission are expected soon.

Title: DoorDash is worth $100 billion thanks to dominating U.S. restaurant delivery. A much larger opportunity is starting to come into view
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/08/06/doordash-food-delivery-acquisitions-business-expansion-tony-xu-earnings/
Time Published: 2025-08-06T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
Jason Del Rey is a technology correspondent at Fortune and a co-chair of the Fortune Brainstorm Tech and Fortune Brainstorm AI conferences. As DoorDash reports its latest financial results on Wednesday, it’s clear that the 12-year-old company has dominated the restaurant delivery wars in the U.S. over Uber Eats and Grubhub, owning somewhere around two-thirds of the market thanks in part to its prescient move into the suburbs that was supercharged by COVID-19 lockdowns. That market lead alone has encouraged investors to bid up its stock price to more than $250 a share and a market cap north of $108 billion as of Tuesday. All told, DoorDash shares have more than doubled over the past year. And considering that DoorDash finished 2024 with its first-ever annual profit, the San Francisco–based company led by cofounder Tony Xu appears well positioned to continue thriving in the U.S. food delivery business. But if you look at DoorDash’s investment and M&A activity this year, you’ll see signs of a company that has quietly laid the foundation for a much grander ambition beyond restaurant delivery in the U.S. And if it’s successful—still a big if—DoorDash will someday be known as much more central to the technological fabric of restaurants and other local retailers around the globe than it is today. In May, the company announced a double whammy of two proposed acquisitions: one, a nearly $4 billion deal for Deliveroo, which would give DoorDash a top three meal delivery business in the U.K., and a combined presence in more than 40 countries—with the intent of turning DoorDash’s core restaurant delivery operation into a truly global one. (DoorDash previously acquired Finland-based Wolt in 2022 for around $8 billion in an all-stock deal.) The other acquisition was a $1.2 billion deal for the hospitality software company SevenRooms, which makes software products aimed at helping restaurants, hotels, and other hospitality businesses manage bookings, reservations, and their customer relationships. The decision to buy SevenRooms was led by Parisa Sadrzadeh, a former rising star at Amazon whose mandate when hired at DoorDash last year was to expand the company’s suite of software tools, called DoorDash Commerce Platform, that helps brick-and-mortar restaurants and retailers grow and manage their businesses inside their physical locations in addition to any delivery operations. “While DoorDash solved a massive problem for merchants during the pandemic … introducing a delivery capability to many who had never considered doing it before,” Sadrzadeh told Fortune in May, “[another] challenge ended up being, ‘How do you grow my actual volume in my physical store, because those are my most profitable consumers?‘” Weeks after announcing the pair of May acquisitions, DoorDash continued the buying spree by announcing a $175 million acquisition of the advertising technology startup Symbiosys, which is designed to help brands and retailers who advertise on the DoorDash app also reach DoorDash customers on other platforms around the web. DoorDash said that its ad business crossed $1 billion in annualized revenue in 2024. Online advertising businesses have increasingly become key profit engines for online retailers and marketplaces. While DoorDash doesn’t break out financial results for its ad business, analysts have estimated that it carries a much larger profit margin than its core delivery business. In the background, DoorDash has continued to aggressively go after other types of consumer spending, too, signing delivery partnerships with retailers big and small across grocery, pharmacy, pet, sporting goods, and alcohol categories as well. Taken together, DoorDash is laying out an ambitious vision—it’ll take time to judge if it’s too ambitious and distracting or as prescient as its suburban delivery move—to become a much more comprehensive technology player for restaurants and other brick-and-mortar retailers across the globe. At the same time, even with a market cap of $100 billion–plus, the company still has potential for considerable growth within its core business of restaurant delivery in markets around the world. “If you took our oldest area of exploration, U.S. restaurants … we’re still single-digit percentages of the U.S. restaurant industry sales,” CEO Xu said on an earnings call earlier this year. “If you look at globally, that number would be even smaller.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Colleen DeCourcy retired from advertising once. She’s not doing it again
URL: https://www.thedrum.com/news/2025/08/06/colleen-decourcy-retired-advertising-once-she-s-not-doing-it-again
Time Published: 2025-08-06T10:58:00Z
Full Content:
Advertisement August 6, 2025 | 13 min read Listen to article 4 min Artificial intelligence is reshaping the ad industry at breakneck speed. In agencies around the world, creatives are contemplating an uncertain future, fearful that their job will be lost to a machine. If you’re fortunate to have enjoyed a 40-year career in advertising – to have worked on some of the most iconic campaigns for the biggest brands in the world and earned numerous accolades along the way – you might think it’s the perfect time to bow out. Why not enjoy the spoils and avoid the painful, challenging, frustrating (and, yes, perhaps exciting) process of adapting to a new reality? Well, just ask Colleen DeCourcy. She first announced her retirement from the industry in 2021, leaving Wieden+Kennedy a legend after almost a decade in leadership. Then, she was lured back into the industry for the top creative job at Snap. As she prepares to become a grandmother (“a nanna”), to twins no less, she decided to leave the tech giant. But she’s also decided that she isn’t ready to hang up her hat. The very thing that’s terrifying creative leaders might be the thing that keeps her in the industry. Sitting down with The Drum at the Cannes Lions Festival, she says: “Creative people, by their very nature, are worriers, and when you’re tasked with your core competency being to defend ideas in every situation possible, change is always frightening. But I do fundamentally believe that what’s at risk [with AI] is not creativity. What’s at risk is the size of the margins of the businesses that built things out to wrap around creativity. So I’m excited about what’s coming.” I had arranged to meet DeCourcy for a quick coffee at a nearby cafe after her appearance on the Palais main stage, where she interviewed Google DeepMind CEO Mustafa Suleyman – a divisive figure in creative circles. In front of a packed audience, she confronted the thorny subject of AI’s looming threat to the industry with unflinching honesty. Now, upon arriving for our rendezvous, a French waiter, comically irate just two days into the festival’s chaos, curtly tells us we can’t sit unless we eat. Seeing the panicked look in my eyes as I realize I won’t be able to scoff a croque monsieur before my next interview, DeCourcy winks and says she and her partner (Jason, joining her at Cannes for the first time) would gladly eat at what was a less-than-ideal spot when surrounded by endless gourmet options to allow us to finish the interview. “I’m not sure that I am going to retire this time,” she says mid-order, as if it’s just occurred to her. “I think it’s just about setting different boundaries. It’s very different to be – I’m going to say it because I think this industry can be ageist – 60 years old. I know who I am. I have the ability to set terms on how I want to work and look around to find things that are super exciting to me. Operationalizing an agency through Covid and a massive protraction of the industry… after all that, I said I was ready to retire as I couldn’t imagine [being at] an agency that wasn’t Wieden+Kennedy. And what’s happening for me now is that I can imagine applying my creativity to things that aren’t agency, right? Snap allowed me to figure that out.” DeCourcy is one of advertising’s most celebrated creatives, in large part because of her willingness and even comfort with working at the messy intersection of technology and creativity. She entered advertising in 1986 at Saffer Cravit & Freedman, briefly detoured into media and entertainment, and then returned in 1994. After stints at Spafax, Organic and JTW New York, she ended up at TBWA Worldwide as its first-ever chief digital officer, where she was at the sharp end of figuring out how clients should think about then-emerging platforms like MySpace, Facebook and Twitter. Those experiments in social media pushed her to start her own social media content and design shop, Socialisit, in 2011. But two years later, the big call came. Within 15 months of arriving at Wieden+Kennedy as creative director, DeCourcy had been made a partner, joining an exclusive club that included Dan Wieden, president Dave Luhr and Susan Hoffman. It was the fastest anyone had made partner at the agency, and she went on to become its co-president and chief creative officer, working on campaigns for clients ranging from Nike and McDonald’s to Airbnb and Meta along the way. She also launched its tech and innovation lab, The Lodge, in 2013, where she encouraged creatives to think about how VR, AR and artificial intelligence could be applied to client briefs. Under her steerage, the global agency enjoyed one of its most successful eras, amassing 149 Lions at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. Advertisement DeCourcy announced her retirement from advertising in 2021. But within a year, she was back to the grind as chief creative officer at Snap. This wasn’t in her plans. She has had conflicting feelings on Big Tech and the impact social platforms like Meta have on society. She “got in trouble”, she says, for an article in Time Magazine titled ‘Is it moral to have Facebook as a client?’ in which she admitted her fears about the giants’ influence. So how did she end up running the creative department at a billion-dollar platform? People she “really cares about” on the Snap board convinced her to meet with the CEO, Evan Spiegel, initially. “Ending up at Snapchat was directly related to [the Time Magazine article]. I spoke to him about his intentions. I looked at all the research on the impact of that platform. I don’t even want to go into all the details of why it’s different, but I will tell you, Snap is built to not do the specific things that I was so afraid of with social media. “When I joined, I felt I had an obligation to prove that. I can’t call something out and then go and wash my hands. People want to communicate through technology. Young people love social platforms. So the trick was to find one that’s not damaging and help it become essential. It wasn’t an incongruity. It was an intentional decision.” Unlike her tenure within agency walls, where she had been the instigator to embrace new tech, her role in a place already at the cutting edge was to prove the power of brand, storytelling and creativity. “There was no universe built around the sanctification of my creativity,” she says, reflecting on the three years she spent at the company. The big brand thinking, helping Snap work out its place and how it wanted to communicate that, was something she “could do in her sleep”. What was less easy was doing that at the “speed, the velocity” that Silicon Valley demands. Engineers wanted instant work promoting the latest update, Wall Street reacted to every launch, and the relentless news cycle influenced messaging daily. But the biggest culture shock from leaving the world of agencies, she says, was the removal of any friction. “Removing friction from agreement is how you move fast. And that’s not great for creative work. When I worked in an agency and we walked in to pitch ideas to a client, there were two bosses in the room, one on their side, one on our side. There was the CMO and me. And their team had to get me excited, and my team had to get the CMO excited. And we found a way to get there,” DeCourcy explains. “When you work in-house, the person paying you is also the person who wants this thing, and there’s very little allowance for friction. And it’s a tech company that moves at the speed of light. You can very easily start to make anodyne work that makes a lot of sense, but doesn’t break through, that isn’t scary.” She adds: “But I’m grateful it was Snap, and Evan, as there was some allowance, some space, for that.” Take its first Oscars TV spot, which ran in 2022. She tied the campaign to Best Picture winner Coda, the first film to star a predominantly deaf cast in leading roles, and worked with SignAll to develop Lenses that could help Snapchat users learn ASL. Its most recent ‘Less Social Media, More Snapchat’ campaign was the culmination of her efforts to assert Snap’s position, highlighting the fundamental differences between it and other social media platforms. Users had steadily grown during her time with the company, but as ever, the question of how to monetize them arrived. Internally, it became “a dead heat” on whether to continue to grow users or ad sales. And as the pendulum began to swing back to a focus on product and performance marketing, she knew her time at Snap had come to an end. “I knew it the second I reached the moment when it was time for a real marketer, not a creative director,” she says. “They’ll need someone like me again in the future. But that’s not what excites me. And Evan was gracious enough to hear that and be kind.” So, where does she go from here if she’s not ready to retire? Well, no one knows yet. Not even DeCourcy. The challenge facing agencies as they grapple with AI and how it will upend the business model is something we talk about at length. She has little sympathy for holding companies under the cosh as they face ever-tightening margins after decades of putting an expensive wrapper around their creatives. They brought in a “vast number” of people and charged for services layered on services, and that’s “what’s going away.” “What we do in defense is say it’s coming for creativity,” she says. “And I look at most of those places and think, as a creative, I was often one-third of the workforce, right? And it’s not coming for me. It’s not coming for us.” Advertisement DeCourcy believes the solution is to follow the lead of Jean Marie Dru and Lee Clow, who have long advocated for agencies to adopt a model that charges for big, share-price-moving ideas. Ideas like those she orchestrated for long-term client Nike while she was at W+K. The ‘Dream Crazy’ campaign was credited by some as driving a 5% increase in the retailer’s stock price. That’s the kind of big-picture, culture-defining work no AI model could conceive. “I have not been one who has ever been fearful of tech,” she says. “Now is a really interesting moment. We’ve seen it come for the industries around us, and if you sit in meetings at a sales level, and you listen to the kinds of things that are being said about what will happen with ads, it could be alarming for an agency. But then you realize what the long-term gainer of this thing is [for creatives]. And it really is exciting to me as a creative person, playing with the tools, to get ready for this.” As the surly waiter returns with her lunch, I leave with one final question. As someone who relishes making sense of the complex world of tech and creativity, who loves the “friction” in solving seemingly impossible problems, could she not be tempted back to an ad agency? To be at the coal-face in this new era as they experiment with new ways of working? “You always like to say, ‘I don’t know, maybe’ [I’ll go back to an agency]. But no, I need to make room for other people in that space. I had a glorious career. I loved it. I loved the era in which I did it. And I’m excited about the other things that I’m finding in the world.” Catch up on the most important stories of the day, curated by our editorial team.

Business FILE PHOTO: The Uber logo is seen on the rear window of a taxi, in Dublin, Ireland, June 29, 2025. REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne/File Photo Uber unveiled a $20 billion stock buyback program and forecast its third-quarter bookings above Wall Street estimates on Wednesday, as the ride-hailing and delivery services company benefits from growing adoption of its paid loyalty program. The company said members for its $9.99 "Uber One" program jumped 60 per cent in June to more than 36 million from a year earlier, and more than one-third of its bookings were coming from them. These users are crucial for Uber as they engage with both its services, generating more than three times the profit compared to that from users who use just one service. To draw more people to the loyalty program, Uber held a week-long event in May that offered discounts and deals across rides, food delivery and groceries. The company added half a million users over the course of the week, Uber said on Wednesday.

Title: Investor Alert: Robbins LLP Informs Investors of the Novo Nordisk A/S Class Action Lawsuit

August 05, 2025 22:07 ET | Source: Robbins LLP Robbins LLP SAN DIEGO, Aug. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Robbins LLP informs stockholders that a class action was filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) securities between May 7, 2025 and July 28 2025. Novo Nordisk is a healthcare company, focused on the research, development, manufacturing, and distribution of pharmaceutical productions globally. For more information, submit a form, email attorney Aaron Dumas, Jr., or give us a call at (800) 350-6003. The Allegations: Robbins LLP is Investigating Allegations that Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Misled the Market About its 2025 Revenue and Profit Growth Potential According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants failed to disclose that: (1) Novo Nordisk's representations regarding its growth potential were overstated and failed to account for the impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion; (2) defendants misrepresented the likelihood that patients using compounded GLP-1s would transition to Novo Nordisk's branded alternatives; and (3) Novo Nordisk significantly overstated both the size of the GLP-1 market and its ability to penetrate that market to sustain growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo Nordisk announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on "lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025" for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to "the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expectations and competition." On this news, the price of Novo Nordisk's common stock declined from $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025. What Now: You may be eligible to participate in the class action against Novo Nordisk A/S. Shareholders who want to serve as lead plaintiff for the class must submit their papers with the court by September 30, 2025. The lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. You do not have to participate in the case to be eligible for a recovery. If you choose to take no action, you can remain an absent class member. For more information, click here. All representation is on a contingency fee basis. Shareholders pay no fees or expenses. About Robbins LLP: A recognized leader in shareholder rights litigation, the attorneys and staff of Robbins LLP have been dedicated to helping shareholders recover losses, improve corporate governance structures, and hold company executives accountable for their wrongdoing since 2002.
