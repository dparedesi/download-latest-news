Title: Intel Leaves Wall Street Unimpressed With Amazon Deal – JPMorgan, BofA Remain Skeptical Of Foundry Spinoff & AWS AI Chip

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Intel's blockbuster announcement of a partnership with Amazon yesterday that set its shares soaring by 8% in aftermarket has left Wall Street unimpressed as major investment banks believe any new benefits from the deal are well out in the future. Intel announced a multi billion dollar partnership with Amazon yesterday without delving into the specifics, and JPMorgan, Bank of America and Evercore all note that while the firm's latest decision to spin out Intel Foundry Services as a subsidiary is good for transparency, any revenue from its advanced 18A manufacturing process is well out in the future. BofA, with an Underperform rating and $21 price target for Intel's shares, believes that the firm's "AI fabric win on 18A likely won’t be significant until 2026, and it will face strong competition from Broadcom (AVGO) and others." Intel aims to enter production with 18A in 2025, and Wall Street banks and analysts believe that revenue from this process should materialize in the year after. BofA adds that Intel's $3 billion win from the US government and its Amazon deal "raised more questions than answers" and the "creation of Intel Foundry as an independent subsidiary and pauses in certain investments in Poland and Germany also lack clarity." With no new financial model provided, the bank is unimpressed by the decision to make Foundry a subsidiary as it doubts that the "move is anything beyond a reporting change." Potential updates from Intel on the 18A process might change BofA's mind as it also bemoans the manufacturing technology's absence in the latest announcements. JPMorgan concurs with BofA as far as being unimpressed by the AWS deal is concerned. With an Underweight rating on the stock and a share price target of $26, it views "Intel’s recent announcements as providing better clarification on previously disclosed actions rather than representing incremental changes." However, the bank does believe that the future of the foundry division might be brighter as Intel's order pipeline for the business is growing. JPMorgan expects a "meaningful revenue ramp from external foundry customers by 2027," and as the AWS deal only shows the growing confidence among semiconductor designers for Intel's foundry business, the bank finds it insufficient to change its metrics for an increase in Intel's share price target. Evercore also views Intel's Amazon deal and other announcements "as incremental positives." It is, however positive about the foundry subsidiary, noting that the decision is a positive step towards increased transparency and accountability in its manufacturing business." The firm adds that it will stay on the sidelines and stick with its share price target of $25 until "there is greater visibility into the success of its [INTEL] foundry business." The firm has an In-Line rating for Intel's shares. Subscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Title: Eating My Own Cooking: Navigating Buy, Hold And Sell Decisions - ORCL

Ringing the Register on a Portion of my ORCL At The Prudent Speculator, we believe in “eating our own cooking”—aligning our portfolio strategy with the very advice we give to readers. In a recent article, I explored three undervalued stocks recommended to readers of The Prudent Speculator that I added to my personal portfolio, demonstrating my putting my money where my mouth is conviction. Money Where My Mouth Is: 3 Undervalued Stocks For Buckingham Portfolio (forbes.com) This time, I want to expand on the strategy of not just buying undervalued stocks but knowing when to hold or even trim positions when necessary. While our philosophy encourages long-term investing, part of prudent portfolio management involves recognizing when a position has become overweight or when market conditions warrant a reassessment. We aren’t simply passive holders; we continuously evaluate the risk-reward ratio of every stock in our portfolio, ensuring it aligns with our overarching investment goals. Even as I am fond of the Mae West quip that "Too much of a good thing can be wonderful," a ballooning stock position can introduce unnecessary risk. This is why trimming positions—particularly in stocks that have outperformed and attracted more-growth-oriented investors—remains an essential part of our risk management process. Balancing conviction with discipline is key to successful long-term investing in stocks. Oracle (ORCL) is an excellent example of how I navigate the delicate balance between holding a high-performing stock and managing risk. Following Oracle’s 2024 Financial Analyst Day, the company continues to make significant strides, with leadership expressing confidence in exceeding the fiscal 2026 revenue target of $66 billion and suggesting that more than $100 billion in revenue is in the cards in fiscal 2029. With the cloud business growing at a rapid pace, contributing substantially to both top-line and bottom-line growth, it’s no surprise that shares have rallied over 50% this year. Oracle's ability to transition from a product-based model to a cloud-centric one is driving this performance, with gross profit from the cloud outpacing losses from legacy license and support revenue. As EVP Doug Kehring highlighted, Oracle’s impressive 5:1 ratio of cloud profit growth to license decline underscores the company’s lucrative shift to cloud services, positioning the company for strong long-term gains. However, despite our bullish outlook on Oracle’s long-term prospects, our risk management practices, not to mention our penchant for value-investing, dictate taking a little money off the table. After all, ORCL now trades for more than 25 times projected earnings and for more than 8 times sales. True, those numbers are not excessive, but I think they argue for a little caution. As I like to say, the hardest part about market timing is getting the timing right. So, we must be prepared for stocks to continue their upward trajectory once we have placed our sell orders, which has been the case since my ORCL trim. Still, we are reminded of similar occurrences following the trims of Broadcom (AVGO), Lam Research (LRCX) and Qualcomm (QCOM), as those stocks continued higher after our paring of our stake but are now trading well below our sale prices. Even after trimming our Oracle position, I maintain a modestly overweight allocation in both my personal account and for clients, so I would love to see the stock price move higher. My team and I continue to believe the company’s fundamentals remain strong, but caution is warranted in the current environment, where tech stocks have been subject to both quick near-term rallies as well as significant pullbacks. Through careful portfolio adjustments like these, I endeavor to stay aligned with both the long-term growth potential of our investments and the risk thresholds that protect our clients' wealth.

Title: Why These Analysts Are Still Nvidia Bulls Despite the Stock's Turbulent Summer

Nvidia (NVDA) stock dipped on Monday, giving back some of last week’s gains as the semiconductor giant’s stretch of volatility continued. Shares of Nvidia finished down about 2% Monday, retreating after surging nearly 16% last week amid encouraging comments from CEO Jensen Huang and analysts. Tech stocks trailed the broader market on Monday, led by Micron (MU), which slid more than 4% after Bank of America issued a warning about the memory-chip market, and Broadcom (AVGO), down 2%. Nvidia's stock has been plagued by turbulence for months as Wall Street's once boundless optimism about artificial intelligence has moderated. Its shares, pressured throughout July and early August by a shift in interest rate expectations, rebounded throughout August before tumbling again at the end of the month after the company's second-quarter earnings report disappointed investors despite exceeding expectations on paper. Amid that slump, the stock recorded the largest ever single-day loss of market value in history earlier this month when its shares tumbled nearly 10% amid a semiconductor sell-off. A recent rebound has been characterized by below-average volume, possibly a sign of limited participation from institutional investors in last week's dip-buying. Since the chipmaker's earnings, however, analysts have reiterated their bullish stance on the stock. Bank of America argued the post-earning slump presented an “enhanced buying opportunity” while Bernstein analysts recently called Nvidia the “best way to play AI.” Wedbush analysts in a note on Monday argued the Fed’s imminent pivot to rate cuts, which are widely expected to begin on Wednesday, should support tech sector stocks in the coming months. “We believe the stage is set for tech stocks to move higher into year-end and 2025 in our opinion as the Fed and Powell kick off its rate cutting cycle this week, macro soft landing remains the path, and tech spending on AI remains a generational spending cycle just starting to hit the shores of the tech sector,” the analysts wrote. Nvidia, they argue, is effectively the “only game in town” as far as AI chips are concerned, putting it in a prime position to capture much of the $1 trillion they estimate will be spent on AI infrastructure in the next few years.

Title: Forget Amazon, This Stock Has 85% Market Share And 2x Upside

06 February 2024, Rhineland-Palatinate, Mainz: A police commissioner holds a Taser on the sidelines ... [+] of the presentation of the new police law in the courtyard of the Ministry of the Interior. Photo: Arne Dedert/dpa (Photo by Arne Dedert/picture alliance via Getty Images) Axon Enterprise stock (NASDAQ: AXON) has had a solid run, rising by almost 3x over the past two years from levels of about $124 per share in September 2022 to about $380 presently. There is a high probability that this run is unlikely to lose steam anytime soon, for this run is backed by solid business performance. For context, Axon Enterprise is a tech company and it has 85% market share in one of its products viz. body cameras that the company sells to police departments in all the major American cities. While market share in only one product should not be the only focus, the fact that the company has witnessed surging demand across its services/product lines, right from cloud services, to solutions for drones and body cameras, indicates that the company must be doing something special. For context, Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) has that kind of market share in search, while Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) does not have that in e-commerce. Consequently, barring small fluctuations, Axon’s stock price movement has largely been one-sided since reaching a temporary low below $100 back in June 2022. The stock has gained a solid 48% YTD and has comfortably outperformed its peers in the aerospace and defense industry, viz. Textron (NYSE: TXT), up 8%, Huntington Ingalls Industries (NYSE: HII), down 1%, and Spirit AeroSystems (NYSE: SPR), up 10%, in this period. Has the peak been reached? At the current price level, Axon Enterprise stock trades at about 100x trailing earnings and 16x its trailing revenues. Is this a reasonable multiple? Possibly yes! Especially if you consider the fact that the company’s revenues have the potential to grow by more than 30% annually in the next few years. Over the last few years, the company has consistently reported strong revenue growth with an average growth of 30% in the last 5 years and the trend is not likely to reverse anytime soon. Moreover, the company’s net margin has witnessed a significant improvement in the last couple of years to reach over 10%. We outline a path for the stock to rise to levels of about $1000 per share in the next few years by looking at the company’s potential revenue growth, net margins, and its price-to-earnings multiple on the back of a strong sales pipeline, which has grown across product categories and customer verticals. AXON Has Done It In The Past AXON stock has generated better returns than the broader market in each of the last 3 years. Returns for the stock were 28% in 2021, 6% in 2022, and 56% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could AXON see a strong jump? Revenue growth coupled with margin expansion is the key Axon reports its revenues under two segments – TASER, which includes sales of its conducted energy devices (CEDs), batteries, accessories and extended warranties, and Software & Sensors – which includes integrated hardware and cloud-based software solutions for law enforcement. These segments accounted for 39% and 61% of the company’s total sales last year. While the TASER segment sales have risen 40% between 2021 and 2023, the Software & Sensors segment sales have surged over 2x over this period. Now, the company is focused on improving its recurring revenues from its cloud-based solutions. The recurring revenues have been rising at a fast pace from $327 million in 2021 to $732 million in 2023, and $850 million as of June 30, 2024. The overall increase in public safety spending clubbed with the increasing reliance on recurring revenues will likely propel the company to see meaningful growth in sales over the next few years. With an increasing scale of operations, AXON is also expected to steadily improve its business margins due to higher absorption of its fixed overheads, which in turn would result in net income increasing by a steady rate. Consequently, if AXON’s revenues grow by about 2.5x between FY’24 and FY’27, with margins expanding by about 1.5x over the same period, this would imply that earnings can grow by around 3.8x. Now if earnings grow 3.8x, the P/E multiple will shrink to less than a third of its current level, assuming the stock price stays the same. But that’s exactly what Axon Enterprise’s investors are betting will not happen! If earnings expand 3.8x over the next few years, instead of the P/E shrinking from around 100x presentl... (truncated)

Full Content:
Alliance Entertainment (AENT), a leader in direct-to-consumer and e-commerce in the entertainment sector, disclosed its financial outcomes for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024 on [date]. The company reported a decrease in net revenue for Q4 to $236.9 million from $247.1 million the previous year, with a gross profit of $26.9 million. Despite the revenue dip, they saw an improvement in net income and a significant reduction in operating expenses, debt, and inventory levels. Management remains optimistic about future growth, highlighting strategies for cost savings, operational efficiencies, and revenue expansion through acquisitions and exclusive distribution deals. Alliance Entertainment's earnings call revealed a mixed financial performance with declines in revenue but improvements in net income and operational efficiencies. The company's management is confident in their growth strategy, which includes leveraging exclusive distribution rights and pursuing strategic acquisitions to boost revenue. They also anticipate cost savings from operational consolidations and technological investments. With these measures, Alliance Entertainment is positioning itself for a stronger performance in the coming fiscal years. Alliance Entertainment, with a market capitalization of $103.91 million, has been navigating a challenging fiscal period, as reflected in its latest financial results. The company's revenue for the last twelve months as of Q3 2024 stands at $1.11 billion, marking a decline of 5.62% from the previous year. Despite the dip in revenue, the firm's gross profit margin has remained relatively stable at 11.9%. InvestingPro Tips suggest that Alliance Entertainment has had a significant return over the last week, with a 12.83% price total return, and even more impressively, a 44.53% return over the last month. This indicates a recent surge in investor confidence, which may be tied to the company's strategic growth initiatives such as acquisitions and exclusive distribution deals as outlined in their recent earnings call. Moreover, the company's valuation implies a strong free cash flow yield, which could be a sign of underlying financial health and potential for future profitability, as analysts predict the company will be profitable this year. Investors considering Alliance Entertainment should note that the stock generally trades with high price volatility, which could present opportunities for high-reward investments but also carries a greater risk. For those interested in a deeper analysis, there are 10 additional InvestingPro Tips available, offering further insights into the company's performance and investment potential. In summary, while Alliance Entertainment has faced revenue challenges, the company's recent price performance and the potential for improved profitability present an interesting case for investors. The company's strategic focus on cost savings and revenue expansion through acquisitions may well set the stage for a stronger financial standing in the near future.

The big picture: For decades, having a job in tech meant stability, regular raises, and lucrative perks. However, that has changed, perhaps permanently. The tech labor market is currently in upheaval, with firms letting go of employees by the thousands and tightening hiring requirements when they are looking to fill positions. The only safe space appears to be in AI. Since the start of the year, more than 137,500 employees have been laid off from 438 tech companies, according to Layoffs.fyi. Meanwhile, postings for software development jobs have declined by over 30 percent since February 2020, according to Indeed.com. Companies across the industry spectrum are cutting tech positions, including some of the largest names in the game. Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft have all downsized this year, along with eBay, Unity Software, SAP, Intel, PayPal, and Cisco. Furthermore, employees who still have jobs are experiencing stagnant wage growth, according to Pequity, a compensation-planning startup. Wages have increased by an average of just 0.95 percent in 2024 compared to last year. This is not new information for those in the industry seeking employment. Last year, over 260,000 workers across nearly 1,200 tech companies lost their jobs, making 2023 the second-largest year of layoffs on record in the technology sector, behind only the dot-com crash in 2001, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas. "The market isn't what it once was," Roger Lee, creator of Layoffs.fyi, told CNBC. "To secure a new position, many salespeople and recruiters are leaving tech entirely. Even engineers are compromising – accepting roles with less stability, a tougher work environment, or lower pay and benefits." The trend doesn't appear to be part of the typical cyclical fluctuations that characterize tech employment, either. The Wall Street Journal recently referred to it as a fundamental reset in an industry that is readjusting its labor needs. Instead of focusing on growth at all costs, companies are now zeroing in on revenue-generating products and services in their hiring strategies. This shift means that sectors that weren't very profitable, such as virtual reality and devices, are facing significant cuts. Tech firms are also scaling back on entry-level hires and eliminating recruiting teams. Companies that are hiring are now looking for engineers with a broader skill set, including collaboration abilities and a working knowledge of the company's AI strategy. Ryan Sutton, executive director of the technology practice group at staffing firm Robert Half, told The Wall Street Journal, "They want to see people who are more versatile." AI is one of the few areas experiencing growth, perhaps not surprisingly. Individuals who have worked on large language models can easily find jobs with salaries reaching $1 million a year. AI engineers are being offered two to four times the salary of a regular engineer, according to Pequity CEO Kaitlyn Knopp. "That's an extreme investment of an unknown technology," she said. "They cannot afford to invest in other talent because of that." Tech workers may understandably feel a sense of whiplash from these changes. During the pandemic, firms went on a hiring spree as much of everyday life moved online. Employees were offered generous salaries and significant flexibility as companies competed for talent. Then the economy cooled amid higher interest rates and inflation, leading to large-scale layoffs as companies jettisoned tens of thousands of jobs. However, the current hiring trends are not as closely correlated to the economy as one might think. Nela Richardson, head of ADP Research, told The Wall Street Journal that the past few years represent the natural trajectory of an industry grounded in innovation. "You're not breaking as much new ground in terms of the digital space as in earlier time periods," she said. TECHSPOT : Tech Enthusiasts, Power Users, Gamers TechSpot is a registered trademark.

Title: Amazon's return-to-office order bucks job flexibility trend

Getty Images/iStockphoto Amazon CEO Andy Jassy's recent return-to-office order might be more about staff reductions than improving watercooler brainstorming. His letter to employees talks about flattening the organization and having fewer managers. But that language raises suspicion among recruiting experts that the company wants to reduce headcount through attrition. If Amazon wants to reduce headcount, "this is an easy way to do it," said Julia Pollak, chief economist at online job marketplace ZipRecruiter, of the return-to-office mandate. It might cause natural attrition from workers unhappy with the order and help the company avoid mass layoffs, she said. "At the same time, you can always retain your superstar performers by negotiating exceptions for them on a one-on-one basis," Pollak said. But she also said it's possible Amazon had trouble running an effective remote work program. Despite Amazon's return-to-work order, flexible work arrangements have remained constant, according to ZipRecruiter's quarterly analysis of labor market changes. The current share of remote and hybrid job postings in the tech industry is above 20%, similar to 2021 data, Pollak said. "We don't see much pullback," she said. Kate Lister, president of Global Workplace Analytics, a telecommuting research and consulting firm, said she sees return-to-office mandates as being connected to staff reduction goals. "There's no doubt that AI will replace many of the types of jobs people do at places like Amazon," Lister said. "Even prior to the pandemic, hybrid work reversals were often a thinly disguised attempt to get people to quit, rather than having to lay them off." For employers, remote and hybrid work options will produce three times as many job applications compared with non-remote positions, Pollak said. When companies offer these options, attrition falls around 35%, she said. "Workers who work remotely are prepared to take an 8% pay cut because they value it so much," she said. There is little in job ad data that suggests Amazon's return-to-office order is a future of work trend. While there has been some pullback on fully remote jobs, at least in job listings, hybrid job ads are on the rise. Employer preference is shifting to hybrid work, according to data from WilsonHCG, a recruitment processing outsourcing provider. It has found that remote job postings account for 3.4% of all job postings in the U.S., or about 220,000 jobs, a decline ranging from 5% to 6% a year ago. But there has been a shift to hybrid ads, which is nearing 2% of all job postings, nearly double that from 18 to 24 months ago, according to the firm. What employers want is the ability to have workers on-site when needed, said Charles Faigle, executive vice president of talent solutions in the Americas at WilsonHCG. "It's all about flexibility within their workforce," he said. The workforce is also shifting in other ways. TalentNeuron, a labor market intelligence firm, said it is seeing a rise in the 40-hour, four-day workweek, according to an analysis of job postings. The job areas with the highest rise for this trend are medical and health, engineering, quality assurance, IT, administrative and clerical, and operations and logistics. "Many employees cite the four-day workweek as a primary incentive -- even over salary -- for the considerations around a role," said Erica Lee, a senior consultant at TalentNeuron. The firm identified, for instance, 103,000 job postings in the medical and health care field that explicitly mentioned a four-day workweek. These job ads represented less than 5% of the total current job ads, but the overall trend of the four-day workweek has increased more than 50% over the last several years. Dan Schwabel, managing partner at Workplace Intelligence, a research firm, said he sees a trend to tech employees losing remote work options, although it varies by companies. "Some tech companies continue to offer flexible or fully remote options to attract and retain talent," Schawbel said. "Smaller startups and certain tech roles may still provide more flexibility."

Title: Amazon’s RTO mandate likely to boomerang, other companies ‘should not follow suit’

Beginning with the new year, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wants his employees back in the office five days a week, returning to an office routine that was common before the COVID-19 pandemic upended the workplace. The backlash from employees was nearly instantaneous, as they berated Jassy — and the return-to-work policy — and vowed to quit. Others demanded raises in exchange for in-office work requirements. Industry analysts were not surprised by the reaction, and said back-to-office mandates more often than not have the exact opposite effect as intended. According to the employee memo released this week, Jassy believes being back in the office will help boost employee training, bolster collaboration, and strengthen culture. “If anything, the last 15 months we’ve been back in the office at least three days a week has strengthened our conviction about the benefits,” Jassy wrote. “We understand that some of our teammates may have set up their personal lives in such a way that returning to the office consistently five days per week will require some adjustments. To help ensure a smooth transition, we’re going to make this new expectation active on January 2, 2025.” In fact, a study performed in May indicated mandatory return-to-office (RTO) policies could lead to higher quit rates compared with companies that allow remote or hybrid work. The study by the University of Michigan and University of Chicago found that three large US tech companies — Microsoft, Apple and SpaceX — saw substantially increased attrition, particularly among more senior personnel, when they implemented strict return-to-work policies in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Forcing employees to quit, however, might be exactly what Amazon wants, according to J. P. Gownder, a vice president analyst with Forrester Research. “There is a chance that Amazon is hoping to induce a level of voluntary attrition with this move in lieu of layoffs. Unfortunately, the best talent often has choices, and most don’t want to work in an office five days a week,” Gownder said. In his memo, Jassy also outlined a plan to reduce managers, saying that “will remove layers and flatten organizations more than they are today. If we do this work well, it will increase our teammates’ ability to move fast, clarify and invigorate their sense of ownership,” he wrote. Amazon’s mandate puts the company in the minority, according to recent research. Among employees with jobs that can be done remotely, 43% work hybrid, 22% work fully remote, and 35% work in the office full time. “Amazon’s decision may just compromise its promise to be ‘Earth’s best employer,’” said Gownder. “The macro data shows that pre-pandemic nostalgia is not a post-pandemic reality. Other companies should not follow suit.” Abandoning hybrid work policies will negatively affect employee experience — particularly recruiting, retention, and diversity — impacting productivity and, potentially, the bottom line, according to Gownder. A Gartner Research study released this month showed 47% of HR leaders are concerned about employee resentment toward their organization. They see change fatigue (70%), return to office mandates (62%), and lack of career growth opportunities (58%) as the biggest drivers of employee unhappiness. Two other Gartner studies this year showed high-performing employees, women and millennials would be the greatest flight risks when strict RTO policies are implemented. (One in three executives handed a RTO mandate would quit, one of those studies showed.) “Mandated on-site requirements can carry very steep costs for talent attraction and retention. This is especially true for high-performers, women and millennials — three employee segments who greatly value flexibility,” said Caitlin Duffy, a director in the Gartner HR practice. “Often, these costs far outweigh the moderate benefits to employee engagement and effort.” Instead of office mandates, flexible hybrid work policies are the gold standard, research has shown. According to a Stanford University study, only 17.6% of employees who can work from home say they want to work in an office five days a week. A June study by McKinsey & Co. showed organizations where employees work in multiple locations (at home, in the office, or at client sites) are more likely to see 10% or greater revenue growth than companies where employees work from a single location. Another McKinsey study revealed that employees consistently point to greater productivity and reduced burnout as primary benefits of flexible work policies. Flexibility is especially important to women, who report having more focused time to work when working remotely, the study showed. William Hatcher, a professor of public administration and chair of social sciences at Augusta University in Georgia, said research is clear that “individuals are more productive at their jobs when they have more control over their schedules.” “Workplaces that empower employees with flexible scheduling policies and te...

Amazon's prestige push, China's slowdown and the rise of TikTok are all factors at play. Senior Editor, Beauty As the beauty landscape shape shifts around the world — Amazon ascendant, China decelerating, TikTok dominating and new consumers emerging — the beauty jobs market is evolving accordingly. Companies both established and emerging are reconfiguring their workforces to better meet the demands of these fast-changing times, whether reshaping certain departments, opting for more agility with a fractional model or restructuring. “The bottom line is simplify to amplify,” said Oliver Chen, an analyst at TD Cowen. “Part of that is managing for speed and agility.” Related Articles Beauty Features Literary Manicures? Meditative Manicures? Kure Bazaar Will Host Them in Its Paris 'Home' Beauty The 40 Best TikTok Beauty Products, Tested by Editors For many larger players, this changing landscape involves some component of restructuring, with layoffs in certain areas of the business even as others are enhanced. “The intention is to maximize profitability, given the China slowdown, and also even just a touch of overall slowdown in this market as well,” said Cassie Cowman, a cofounder of View From 32, a beauty consultancy that works with both founders and investors. “Companies are figuring out how to structure these teams to maximize that,” she added. “I have some clients that are still seeing decent traffic, for example, but the conversion is very low or maybe the dot-com channel is suffering. So, how are they investing more in the brick-and-mortar business to maximize that channel while it’s seeing strong momentum?” Unilever has unveiled a “comprehensive productivity program,” involving 7,500 office-based layoffs globally to achieve total cost savings of around 800 million euros over the next three years. British media outlets have reported that, as part of the layoff plan, it is set to cut a third of all office roles in Europe by the end of 2025, or around 3,200 roles. In February, The Estée Lauder Cos. revealed a restructuring plan, including layoffs, as it continues to tread water amid struggles in Asia and at home. It’s part of the wider Profit Recovery and Growth Plan, designed to make the company more agile. The owner of Clinique, Mac, Tom Ford and others will reduce its 62,000-strong global workforce by between 3 and 5 percent as part of the plan, the equivalent of as many as 3,100 jobs. This will be carried out over the next two-and-a-half years. That same month, Shiseido introduced a new business plan within which it is offering an early retirement plan to approximately 1,500 employees in Japan to help bolster group growth and profitability. The move is part of an overarching vision. “To achieve sustainable growth, Shiseido Japan will concentrate its activities on brands, products and touchpoints with high growth potential and profitability, strengthening brand and touchpoint strategy,” the company said. Dyson is also cutting around 1,000 jobs in the U.K., roughly one-third of its U.K. workforce, due to what the company has described as “fierce” global competition. At L’Oréal U.S., WWD understands that there has been some restructuring in the consumer products division, resulting in around 40 job losses. These are omni shopper roles, the link between the marketing and sales teams. Sales leads for brands are also being moved to retail leads. In a WARN notice filed in New York last month, No7 Beauty company said that 64 workers at its Manhattan office would be affected by an office closure. “To enhance our ability to invest in the growth of No7 Beauty Company in the U.S., we are restructuring our organization to work more closely within our own retail partners,” said a spokesman. “Moving forward, we will no longer occupy a small number of desks in a shared office space in New York, and most of our team members are being relocated.” Its parent company Walgreens Boots Alliance has made several rounds of layoffs. Most recently, LVMH-owed Sephora announced plans to cut its workforce in China by 3 percent, the equivalent to around 120 roles, “in response to the challenging market environment” there. As for what roles companies are hiring, Lisa Mare Ringus, executive vice president of global client strategy and growth at 24 Seven Inc, noted that there has been interest in specific sales roles such as supporting Amazon, social and content, finance and marketing. “We’ve seen more hiring in finance this year than ever before within beauty,” Ringus said. Others have seen a spike in searches for brand chief merchandising officers, as well as sales chiefs and chief commercial officers, also sometimes called chief revenue officers. And of course, those with knowledge of AI and TikTok are increasingly in demand. “It’s also about the new skill set,” said Chen. “When you hire someone they’re going to be much better at AI and use TikTok regularly. You need new people who can engage new customers.” In addition to the strateg... (truncated)

SAN FRANCISCO, CA - JUNE 26: In this handout photo provided by Intel, Tom Kilroy, vice president of ... [+] Intel?s Digital Enterprise Group, displays Intel's new Dual-Core Xeon Processor 5100 on June 26, 2006 at an event in San Francisco. Available for high-volume servers, workstation and communications markets, the 64-bit processor is based on the Intel Core Microarchitecture for increased performance with reduced energy consumption. (Photo by Court Mast/Intel via Getty Images) Intel stock (NASDAQ: INTC) rallied by close to 6% in Monday’s trading and gained by another 8% in after-hours trading, taking the stock to levels of about $22 per share. Intel stock still remains down by over 50% year-to-date. Now the recent surge comes following news that Intel has secured a manufacturing contract from Amazon for its foundry business, where it will design and produce custom AI chipsets for Amazon’s cloud division, AWS. Intel will produce the specialized “AI fabric chip” for Amazon, using its 18A manufacturing process, which is the company’s most advanced chip manufacturing technology. Intel also indicated that more chip designs from AWS could be coming, including versions that will leverage Intel’s upcoming 18AP and 14A processes. Separately, Bloomberg reported last Friday that Intel has received $3.5 billion in grants from the Pentagon to manufacture chips for the U.S. military, although Intel declined to comment on the Pentagon grants. The new wins present a big opportunity for Intel. If the company executes well on its foundry plans and delivers compelling new CPU and GPU chips, Intel could see almost 3x upside. On the other hand, if it fails to execute, Intel stock could see a downside to $10 Now INTC stock has declined over the last 3-year period and the fall has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 6% in 2021, -47% in 2022, and 95% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could INTC face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a recovery? For years, Intel has faced growing frustration from investors as it lost market share to AMD in the PC and server sectors. Adding to this, the industry has been shifting from CPUs to GPUs, particularly in the generative AI era, where GPUs are better suited for the intensive computational tasks that AI demands. The recent wins with Amazon and the Pentagon could mark a turning point for Intel, as generative artificial intelligence dominates the narrative in the computing and semiconductor markets. The Amazon deal, in particular, is seen as a strong vote of confidence in Intel’s improving chip-making capabilities given AWS’s position as the largest public cloud services provider. Intel’s foundry business which has been at the heart of the company’s struggles, has lagged behind competitors like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Samsung. Intel’s attempts to reclaim leadership in chip fabrication have been very capital-intensive and have been hampered by the company’s manufacturing and design missteps. In fact, Intel has had to outsource production of some of its latest CPUs to TSMC. In 2023, Intel’s foundry business reported a $7 billion operating loss on $18.9 billion in revenue, highlighting the scale of the challenges it has faced. Much of the future of Intel’s manufacturing roadmap hinges on the success of the new 18A process. While production on this process is expected to begin in 2025, Intel announced in early August that it had reached critical milestones, noting that the chips made with this process had powered on, booted Windows, and were operational within Intel. Once Intel transitions its latest server and PC chips to this process node, ending its outsourcing of chips to TSMC, we could see higher utilization rates, which would help reduce costs. Additionally, Intel indicated that the first external foundry customer was expected to tape out (move from design to foundry for manufacturing) on the 18A node in the first half of 2025. This could also boost Intel revenues to a certain extent. A key challenge for Intel will lie in meeting production yield expectations at a large scale. However, there have been encouraging signs here as well. Intel recently indicated that the production process was seeing a defect density of 0.4. Defect density refers to the number of defects present per unit area on a wafer and a metric of under 0.5 defects per square centimeter is considered favorable. Intel s... (truncated)

Amazon’s recent shift toward a strict return-to-office (RTO) policy has sparked heated debates across the tech industry. For some, the mandate represents a regression, particularly in a sector that largely embraced remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, according to a former AWS employee, John McBride, the driving force behind Amazon’s controversial policy shift is not about collaboration or innovation—it’s about something much simpler: economics and taxes. “Anyone who’s been paying attention saw this coming years ago,” McBride said in a series of posts on social media, pointing to a multi-phased strategy that Amazon has rolled out over time. According to McBride, the company’s approach was carefully designed, with the ultimate goal of reducing headcount while avoiding massive tax liabilities that could significantly affect profitability. Listen to a podcast conversation on the ‘real’ reasons for Amazon’s return to the office: McBride, who left AWS in 2023 during what he referred to as “Phase 3” of Amazon’s plan, outlined the following five phases: McBride explained that while Amazon executives publicly framed these moves as necessary for “innovation” and “customer obsession,” the reality, in his view, is far less inspirational. “It’s all about reducing headcount and avoiding tax liabilities,” he asserted. The most significant factor driving this return-to-office push appears to be the economics of headcount management. During the pandemic, Amazon—along with many other tech giants—dramatically expanded its workforce. “They didn’t really have any other option,” McBride noted, citing the unprecedented demand for AWS cloud services and the need to continue scaling as more companies embraced remote work. I’m a former AWS employee: most of the hot takes on Amazon's new strict return-to-office policy are wrong. Anyone who’s been paying attention saw this coming years ago. And ultimately, it comes down to taxes and economics. Here's their plan: Phase 1: layoff over 30k people.… — John McBride (@johncodezzz) September 18, 2024 However, that growth came with significant costs. As McBride explained, AWS operates on “razor-thin margins,” despite being one of Amazon’s most profitable arms. “AWS offers incredible services at excellent usage cost pricing,” he said, pointing to the platform’s ability to enable small disruptors to enter the cloud market. This model has worked well for AWS, but in times of economic uncertainty, even small disruptions in customer spending can have outsize effects on profit margins. Now, with the broader tech sector scaling back due to rising interest rates and shrinking corporate budgets, AWS’s profitability is being squeezed. “Anyone who leaves AWS or meaningfully reduces their cloud spend can impact AWS’s razor-thin profit margins,” McBride explained. This, he argued, has created intense pressure to cut costs, and for a company like Amazon, “the most expensive cost is headcount.” Yet headcount reduction is only one part of the equation. McBride pointed out that the return-to-office mandate is also deeply rooted in tax considerations. “Amazon gets massive tax breaks from cities and states where they have offices,” he said. These breaks are contingent on Amazon bringing jobs to specific locations, like Seattle or Denver. However, those incentives can disappear if offices remain underutilized. “If Amazon continued to enable a remote workforce,” McBride explained, “the tax man would come knocking, and they’d be liable for hundreds of millions of dollars.” In other words, for Amazon, filling physical offices is not just about fostering collaboration—it’s about protecting its bottom line. This aligns with the broader economic realities facing Amazon. In 2023, the company’s overall operating margin was a mere 4.7%, and while AWS’s margins are higher—recently reported as close to 40%—those numbers still reflect the company’s general approach of operating with very thin margins at scale. McBride pointed out that Amazon’s founder, Jeff Bezos, famously operated under the mantra “Your margin is my opportunity,” focusing on generating significant profits by operating with minimal margins across large-scale services. But as AWS faces increasing competition and clients seek ways to reduce cloud spending, maintaining profit margins becomes more difficult. “Amazon has to keep profit up by reducing headcount,” McBride summarized. The return-to-office policy is a strategic move to ensure that they maximize tax incentives while minimizing staffing costs. For many employees, however, the return-to-office policy feels more like a veiled attempt to force them out. “Phase 4: the Silent Sacking,” McBride described, is particularly brutal. Employees who resist relocation or fail to comply with the return-to-office directives often find themselves marginalized within the company. “You’d be left out of in-person meetings, stiff-armed by management, and wouldn’t be given meaningful work,” McBride said, add...

Title: Big Tech companies are getting flatter. Mark Zuckerberg explained why over a year ago.

Amazon is putting middle managers under the microscope as it seeks to thin out the layers of the sprawling company. The move furthers the Big Tech trend of flattening org charts that Mark Zuckerberg and others like Elon Musk have talked about in recent years while preaching the need for efficiency. CEO Andy Jassy announced the changes on Monday alongside an RTO mandate that will require Amazon employees to return to the office 5 days a week starting in January. The Amazon CEO wrote that he's also asking senior leadership teams "to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of Q1 2025." "Having fewer managers will remove layers and flatten organizations more than they are today," Jassy wrote in a memo to staff. "If we do this work well, it will increase our teammates' ability to move fast, clarify and invigorate their sense of ownership, drive decision-making closer to the front lines where it most impacts customers (and the business), decrease bureaucracy, and strengthen our organizations' ability to make customers' lives better and easier every day," Jassy added. You can bet that somewhere in Silicon Valley, Mark Zuckerberg nodded his head when he heard the news — after all, he's been speaking out in favor of flattening org charts both publicly and in private for a while now. "I don't think you want a management structure that's just managers managing managers, managing managers, managing managers, managing the people who are doing the work," the Meta CEO reportedly said in an internal meeting in January 2023. In an earnings call a month later, Zuckerberg said the company was "working on flattening our org structure and removing some layers of middle management to make decisions faster." Zuckerberg also proclaimed a "year of efficiency" at Meta last year, following two rounds of layoffs that cumulatively cost roughly 21,000 people their jobs. The Meta CEO said in a podcast interview that same year that he believed "a lot" in the need for managers, pointing to how managers help younger people "grow and learn in their career." But he said there was "a mathematical way" to think about the ratio of employees to managers. Before Meta's layoffs, Zuckerberg said he inquired about the average number of direct reports each manager had at Meta and learned it was around three to four. He felt it should be more like seven to eight. But, at the time, the lower numbers made sense as Meta was hiring a ton and helping newcomers ramp up. "So in a world where we're not adding so many people as quickly, is it as valuable to have a lot of managers who have extra capacity waiting for new people? No, right?" Zuckerberg said. "So, now we could sort of defragment the organization and get to a place where the average is closer to that seven or eight," he added. "It just ends up being a somewhat more kind of compact management structure, which, you know, decreases the latency on information going up and down the chain and I think empowers people more." Meta's emphasis on leanness paid off and was rewarded by Wall Street and investors: Meta hit a $1 trillion market cap earlier this year. The broader industry has followed suit in trimming management. Middle-managers made up 31.5% of layoffs in 2023, up from 19.7% in 2018, according to analysis. Shopify announced last year that it would flatten its organization by grouping employees into either individual contributors or managers and incentivizing more of them to become the former. Under pressure from activist investors to become more efficient, Salesforce last year aimed to reduce "layers of control" by giving managers a specific number of direct reports in order to trim management layers, people familiar with the matter previously told Business Insider. At Airbnb, CEO Brian Chesky has said the company "got rid of the classic product management function" and instead changed it into an "Apple-style product marketing function." As for Amazon, the company hasn't yet said publicly if layoffs are part of its strategy to increase the number of individual contributors to managers. But if Amazon is following Meta and other Big Tech companies' lead — don't be surprised if a middle-management culling is on the horizon. Just look at what Amazon's internal document said about potential job cuts, as first reported by Business Insider's Ashley Stewart. "It's possible that organizations may identify roles that are no longer required." Jump to

Title: It's a tough time to be a manager in tech

Managers may just have the toughest job in tech right now. In the latest blow to middle managers, Amazon announced it planned to reduce the number of supervisors within its organization. CEO Andy Jassy said in a message to employees posted to Amazon News that the company plans to flatten departments and ask senior leadership teams to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of the first quarter of 2025. Jassy said the move was part of an effort to get the company operating "like the world's largest startup," allowing employees to "move fast" and not waste time with "unnecessary processes." A copy of an internal document obtained by Business Insider indicates the new plan could result in role eliminations as "organizations may identify roles that are no longer required." It's the latest hit to tech's wearied middle managers amid a rough few years. Many have found themselves in the firing line of sweeping layoffs as Big Tech companies scramble to cut costs. Those who kept their jobs have complained of being left with more work amid hiring slowdowns. Lynda Gratton, a professor of management practice at London Business School, told BI that middle managers had steadily been asked to do more post-pandemic. "Manager overwork and burnout is a real issue," she said. "The pandemic meant that many are also managing complex hybrid teams." Amazon is not the first tech company to balk at its own corporate structure. At Meta, Mark Zuckerberg has been gradually eliminating layers of middle management. The tech boss said he doesn't like seeing "managers managing managers" and has been "flattening" his company ever since. The reorg has seen many Meta supervisors demoted with the aim of having more people on the ground doing things like coding, designing, or selling. Shopify has also been flattening its structure to have fewer managers. At X, Elon Musk has ordered engineering managers to get back into the coding trenches with their direct reports. The reduction of middle managers is, in part, a reaction to overhiring during the COVID-19 pandemic and a backlash against so-called "fake work" within the tech sector. But significantly reducing the number of managers could also backfire on companies. "Tech firms have worked out that the most productive technologists are well managed, feel secure, are mentored and supported, and feel listened to," Gratton said. "That's one of the reasons why they have invested more in managers — when management is done well — they are the golden thread." When asked to comment, representatives for Amazon referred BI back to Jassy's online statement. Jump to

Title: Amazon's strict new RTO rule creates an awkward situation for One Medical

One Medical may have been the first big exception to Amazon's strict new RTO mandate. One Medical told its employees earlier this month that they must come into the office three times a week starting in October 2025, according to people familiar with the matter. The company gave employees over a year before the in-office mandate kicks in so that they can adjust and relocate if needed, the people said. They asked not to be identified discussing sensitive topics, but their identities are known to Business Insider. Most One Medical employees were asked to be in one of four "hub" cities, Seattle, Austin, San Francisco, or Boston, the people said. Currently, almost 40% of One Medical employees are working outside these locations, one of the people added. While this was a big change for One Medical employees, it was softer approach than Amazon's new return-to-office policy. On Monday, CEO Andy Jassy announced that Amazon's corporate employees must work in an office five days a week starting in January. Many Amazon employees criticized the order in internal messages. Now, it looks like One Medical's new policy is mostly scrapped, after just a couple of weeks. "Starting in October 2025, all Amazon One Medical employees will be asked to come into the office five days a week in line with the rest of Amazon," an Amazon spokesperson told BI. One Medical staff have an extra 10 months to prepare. But otherwise, they must get on board with Jassy's full-time in-office approach. One Medical employees had been allowed to work remotely full time, even after Amazon acquired the company for $3.9 billion early last year. One Medical CEO Trent Green this year even highlighted remote work as a major perk as the company went through layoffs and a major reorganization. Even the brief existence of One Medical's three-day rule was causing uncertainty and frustration at the healthcare unit, some of the people said. Amazon has been more tightly integrating with One Medical lately, rolling out Amazon's own human-resources and benefits policy as well as compensation structure to the division. Amazon is also scrutinizing One Medical's financial performance, ordering drastic cost cuts to control losses. People on Amazon's side have been equally frustrated with One Medical, one of the people said. One Medical has struggled to adapt to Amazon's faster pace of work and rigid culture centered around its leadership principles. One Medical's staff, meanwhile, feels Amazon is disrupting a business that had performed well and grew faster before the acquisition, some of the people said. The messaging from One Medical's leadership earlier this month was that working in the same physical space could be more productive, echoing Jassy's thinking, these people said.

I got the job! America is currently experiencing a significant hiring slowdown. A noticeable change has occurred over the last six months, affecting people at all levels and in many industries. As a career counselor, I work with job hunters every day. I pay close attention to what they say and what they are experiencing in the job market. I notice what industries are hiring, which job titles more employers are advertising, and how many openings we see are the right fit for a candidate to apply for. I’ve been observing that many areas now offer fewer opportunities One group I’ve noticed that has had a struggle with landing a job is mature workers. Professionals over 55, especially those who have been hard hit with layoffs, report that there is little to apply for and a lot of competition. Most say their age is a problem hampering them from finding a job. Those over 60 have had a real struggle to find new employment. The technology industry has been hard hit with limited hiring and plenty of layoffs. New college grads face a tough search because entry-level roles have been harder to find. Some grads have been looking for a year, and they are getting very little employer attention, only rejections. Lacking an internship has been a real deficit for many grads, as employers want that experience Much to the disappointment of people insisting they want remote work; the tides have changed. Employers are now in the driver’s seat, insisting on hybrid in-office work. Amazon told employees that they are implementing a “5 days a week Return-to-Office” policy. Aside from the typical summer slowdown, hiring is not picking up now. A notable change in hiring has blanketed the country. Job hunters feel it, employers know it, and career counselors and HR people are acknowledging it. From our view of the world, those of us in the trenches dealing with hiring and job search, we see these key factors interacting together and impacting the job market. 1. The Election. Employers are pausing and waiting to see which way the country will go for the next four years. Democrats will head in a different direction than Republicans. So, many companies want to know the answer before they invest in new employees or promote existing employees. 2. Holidays. From mid-November through early January, hiring will be very slow as employers deal with holiday vacations, reassess their staffing needs, and try to do more with fewer people. 3. AI technology impacts. Most organizations are considering how AI might impact their company and employee productivity and are slowing down to determine their needs. They are questioning how using new AI technology in their office may change who they need to hire and the type of skills that a person needs to have. 4. Layoffs. These will continue. No one is immune. Many different roles have disappeared across the entire work spectrum. 5. Stay-put Employees. Layoffs have scared people into holding onto their positions. They worry about stability and aren’t moving on, which reduces the opportunities for someone else to take over their job. 6. Employers are cherry-picking. They are in no hurry to find—or hire—new staff. Even when a candidate’s background completely matches the job description, some report that they may be interviewing but aren’t getting a job offer. 7. Hybrid work. Nothing has reduced job opportunities as much as this change has. Job seekers must look for positions where they live, and most employers are not paying to relocate them. 8. Fewer recruiters. As the job market changed, recruiters were hard-hit, with heavy layoffs as employers responded to the new job market conditions. This means fewer HR recruiters are scouring LinkedIn looking for talent. People who often got “hit up” on LinkedIn to consider a new job have found that this has happened much less frequently or stopped altogether. Hannah Morgan, one of the country’s top job search strategists also agrees that job seekers are having more difficulty finding employment. Morgan said, “Some of these factors mentioned above are expected to tweak hiring, such as the election or holidays. Normally, they will have an impact. But with all eight things happening simultaneously, that is what has made job search so challenging.” But, in any economy, there are always good jobs to be found and landed.

Title: How CTOs Can Boost Company Health During Economic Downturns

Time Published: 2024-09-19T12:15:00Z

In recent years, there’s been a widespread drive to encourage companies to think of their technology teams and tools not as cost centers, but as revenue drivers. And with technology playing such a large role in today’s businesses, it’s time for leadership teams to think of CTOs as more than just experts in “keeping the lights on.” Companies are accustomed to trusting their CTOs to oversee the creation and acquisition of new technologies when business is humming. But on the flip side, CTOs can also be key players in finding ways to cut costs and/or boost revenues during economic downturns. Below, 20 members of Forbes Technology Council discuss practical, meaningful ways CTOs can positively impact organizational health during difficult times (and why they’re perfectly positioned to do so). CTOs can guide an organization in effectively using its resources, striking a balance between innovation and improvement. In the tech industry, there is always a tug-of-war between investing in new product features to attract new customer segments and improving existing offerings to increase upselling. CTOs can effectively align development goals to optimize returns. - Amrit Jassal, Egnyte Economic cycles continually fluctuate. Some useful questions for a CTO to answer are: How do we rigorously prioritize the existing demand funnel to optimize outcomes? Where can we double down on reusable services and architecture to maximize investments and velocity? What accelerators can we add so that when the cycle rebounds, we can outpace our competitors? This exercise helps a CTO balance “defense” with “offense.” - Micheline Casey, Siemens Energy Forbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives. Do I qualify? During an economic downturn, a CTO can positively impact the organization by addressing technical debt and strengthening infrastructure. This prepares the company for future growth and sudden demand increases when the market rebounds, ensuring resilience and agility in changing conditions. - Dzmitry Lubneuski, a1qa During an economic downturn, it’s typical to try to reduce costs by improving operational efficiency. For a CTO in the current market, it’s critical to see how your company can leverage artificial intelligence to do more with less. A couple of practical examples: Improve engineering productivity through introducing a coding assistant like Copilot, and enhance knowledge discovery by leveraging a finely tuned large language model to analyze organizational data. - Bhavdeep Sethi, Frec Markets, Inc. One practical and meaningful way for a CTO to help is to view an economic downturn as an opportunity for innovation. “Do more with less” is the mindset a CTO should drive. A CTO must work with the business to identify and solve challenges through innovation and collaboration. A design-thinking workshop or hackathons can help teams imagine new ways of operating in a new normal. Thus, the CTO becomes an agile change agent. - Alvaro Rozo, Arcus Power Corp. Perform an IT audit that looks for shadow IT, outdated or underutilized software, and gaps in cybersecurity risk mitigation—both for your organization and any key suppliers or vendors that have access to company or customer data. Audits can also trigger new policy and procedure development, potentially saving an organization from financial and regulatory headaches down the road. - Ogie Sheehy, ViClarity During an economic downturn, budgets are constrained and there’s a limited infusion of talent from external sources. A CTO’s blueprint for organizational success must focus on driving the efficiency and effectiveness of the core business processes, operating models and digital workflow capabilities that create competitive differentiation in the marketplace. Look toward leveraging digital transformation, artificial intelligence, machine learning and the cloud. - Hemant Ahire, Amazon Web Services A meaningful way a CTO can positively impact the health of their organization during an economic downturn is to help the business prioritize technology projects that have the best near-term return on investment. What can be done relatively quickly and for the least amount of money while still moving the needle on both cost and revenue? - Laura Merling CTOs must be honest with the team about the situation, looking for outside-the-box solutions, offering assurance and trying to avoid layoffs. People are the most important aspect of any organization and should always be treated as such. Find ways to cut costs beyond the obvious—automation, enabling new technologies and doing more with what is available are some aspects to consider. - Sameer Zaveri, Datamotive.io One practical and meaningful way a CTO can positively impact the health of their organization during an economic downturn is by prioritizing technology investments that drive operational efficiency and cost savings. This can include automating routine tasks, optimizing exi... (truncated)

Amazon announced Monday that it is ending remote work — much to the dismay of some of its employees. Online and in internal channels, employees sounded off on CEO Andy Jassy’s mandate that workers return to the office five days a week starting Jan 2, 2025. “Amazon (AMZN) has announced 5 day RTO, which is unfortunate because I’m interested in working for a living, not live-action role playing and virtue signaling,” CJ Felli, a system development engineer for Amazon Web Services, wrote on Linkedin. “If you have remote opportunities available, please message me. Nothing is off the table. I’d rather go back to school than work in an office again.” Tamia Reed, a data center technician at Amazon Web Services, wrote on LinkedIn that she was “disheartened” by the decision. “For many of us, remote work was not just a convenience but a necessary shift towards a more flexible and balanced professional life. This abrupt change undermines the progress we’ve made in embracing diverse work styles and accommodating different personal needs,” Reed wrote. “I hope Amazon will reconsider and find a way to support both their business needs and their employees’ diverse work preferences.” Others took to internal channels to express their frustration, especially that Jassy said the company was returning to its policy before the pandemic. One employee wrote that new policy is “significantly more strict and out of its mind than many teams operated under pre-covid. This is not ‘going back’ to how it was before. It’s just going backward,” according to Business Insider. “What ever happened to ‘Striving to be Earth’s Best Employer,” another employee, referencing Amazon’s principles, wrote in a message viewed by BI. “Can I negotiate my manager to PIP me,” a different employee said, referencing a performance improvement plan. “Take my money and leave?” Amazon also announced on Monday that it plans to increase the worker-to-manager ratio, which could lead to layoffs. Jassy, who was led the retail giant since 2021, said the move will “remove layers and flatten organizations more than they are today.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

What just happened? Amazon is ending the pandemic-era remote and hybrid work arrangements that many of its corporate employees have become accustomed to over the past few years. In a memo this week, CEO Andy Jassy made it clear that starting in 2025, employees will be required to work in the office five days a week, unless they have an approved exception. The new stance marks a significant shift from earlier this year, when Amazon required corporate employees to come into the office at least three days a week. However, Jassy believes being together full-time makes "collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing" easier and more effective. He also emphasized that it helps employees better learn, practice, and strengthen Amazon's "corporate culture" while staying connected as a team. "Our expectation is that people will be in the office outside of extenuating circumstances," Jassy wrote, noting that employees could still work remotely for things like sick days, family emergencies, business travel or just needing "a day or two to finish coding in a more isolated environment." However, the general expectation is regular attendance at the office. The transition to pre-pandemic norms won't happen immediately. Amazon is giving employees until January 2025 to begin adhering to the updated policy, acknowledging that some may need time to adjust. In addition to the office mandate, Jassy revealed that Amazon is also streamlining its corporate structure. The goal is to "remove layers and flatten organizations" by increasing the staff-to-manager ratio across teams by at least 15 percent by early 2025. He also called for the creation of a "bureaucracy mailbox" where employees can report excessive rules or processes. It's worth noting that Amazon rapidly expanded its workforce during the pandemic before Jassy took over as CEO in 2021. Since then, he has implemented significant cuts, including the largest layoffs in Amazon's 27-year history, starting in 2022. Jassy's stance reflects a broader trend of companies bringing employees back to the office full-time. Last month, London-based hardware company Nothing stated that remote work is "not compatible with a high ambition level plus high speed," demanding that employees return to the office five days a week or leave the company. Whether the shift will result in higher productivity remains to be seen. Research on the effects of working from home versus working from the office has been mixed. A study from August 2023 found that productivity among remote workers declined by 18 percent, while a survey from the same period showed that a majority of employees felt more productive working from home.

Title: Intel Developing AI Chips for Amazon in Multibillion-Dollar Deal

After a summer of mass layoffs and crashing chips, Intel is moving forward with a multiyear, multibillion-dollar chip deal with Amazon's cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services. As part of the deal announced Monday, Intel will design and produce at least two different AI-capable chips for AWS. One of the Intel AI chips will use its 18A process node, while the other will be a chip based on Intel's Xeon 6, built on Intel 3. The companies have already been working together for years, and plan to deepen their ties through the chip deal. Amazon and Intel are also continuing to pour money into their operations in Ohio, with Amazon making plans for a multibillion-dollar data center and Intel building two chip factories in the state's New Albany region. Intel alone hopes its Ohio plans will create over 3,000 jobs in the area. "This collaboration between Intel and AWS is a great development for US-based manufacturing and solidifying Ohio as a leader in AI," said Ohio Governor Mike DeWine in a statement. "Today’s announcement furthers Intel’s commitment to US manufacturing sites, like Ohio’s, as well as AWS’s commitment to its nearly decade-long investment in our state." Like much of big tech, Amazon has bet big on the promise of generative AI. It's invested in Anthropic, which makes the Claude chatbots, and has added generative AI features across Amazon's shopping site through AI-generated descriptions and its "Rufus" chatbot. AWS is also offering AI-as-a-service through its cloud computing division, including a coding assistant dubbed "Q" and an AI app generator. Intel, in turn, could stand to gain financially from the AI boom as one of the US's largest chip manufacturers. But Intel has faced some challenges this year, specifically with its 13th and 14th-generation core desktop chips.

Title: Intel Developing AI Chips for Amazon in Multibillion-Dollar Deal

After a summer of mass layoffs and crashing chips, Intel is moving forward with a multiyear, multibillion-dollar chip deal with Amazon's cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services. As part of the deal announced Monday, Intel will design and produce at least two different AI-capable chips for AWS. One of the Intel AI chips will use its 18A process node, while the other will be a chip based on Intel's Xeon 6, built on Intel 3. The companies have already been working together for years, and plan to deepen their ties through the chip deal. Amazon and Intel are also continuing to pour money into their operations in Ohio, with Amazon making plans for a multibillion-dollar data center and Intel building two chip factories in the state's New Albany region. Intel alone hopes its Ohio plans will create over 3,000 jobs in the area. "This collaboration between Intel and AWS is a great development for US-based manufacturing and solidifying Ohio as a leader in AI," said Ohio Governor Mike DeWine in a statement. "Today’s announcement furthers Intel’s commitment to US manufacturing sites, like Ohio’s, as well as AWS’s commitment to its nearly decade-long investment in our state." Like much of big tech, Amazon has bet big on the promise of generative AI. It's invested in Anthropic, which makes the Claude chatbots, and has added generative AI features across Amazon's shopping site through AI-generated descriptions and its "Rufus" chatbot. AWS is also offering AI-as-a-service through its cloud computing division, including a coding assistant dubbed "Q" and an AI app generator. Intel, in turn, could stand to gain financially from the AI boom as one of the US's largest chip manufacturers. But Intel has faced some challenges this year, specifically with its 13th and 14th-generation core desktop chips. The crashing chips have sparked legal investigations, and could lead to multiple class-action lawsuits, though Intel has said its laptop chips aren't impacted by the bug. Over the summer, Intel also confirmed it was making dramatic cuts to its workforce, laying off 15,000 employees, reportedly to improve its financial situation. Earlier this year, the Biden administration announced $8.5 billion for Intel to build more chip factories in the US through the 2022 Chips Act.

Title: Watch These Intel Price Levels as Stock Surges After CEO Provides Business Update

Time Published: 2024-09-17T02:18:00Z

Intel (INTC) shares surged in extended trading on Monday after the embattled chipmaker’s CEO Pat Gelsinger provided an update on the company’s plans to slash costs and turn around its business. Gelsinger said in a note to employees released after the closing bell that Intel has made progress in lowering costs through layoffs, trimming its real estate footprint, and selling part of its stake in its Altera programmable chip unit, among other steps. The company also plans to turn its chipmaking arm into a separate subsidiary and said it would produce chips for Amazon (AMZN), as well as the U.S. military. Intel shares rose 7.9% in after-hours trading to $22.56. The stock had risen more than 6% during regular trading hours following a report from Bloomberg on the contract to produce custom chips for the military. Even with Monday’s gains, the stock has shed more than half its value since the start of the year. Below, we’ll take a closer look at Intel’s monthly chart and use technical analysis to identify key historical price levels worth watching. After encountering significant selling pressure at the closely watched 50-day moving average (MA) in December last year, Intel shares have trended sharply lower, falling as much as 64% since that time. Importantly, trading volumes have increased during the stock’s sell-off, indicating conviction behind the move. Although the shares hit a new multi-year low this month, they have made a partial recovery to currently trade near their September high, potentially forming a hammer—a candlestick pattern that suggests a bullish reversal. Looking ahead, investors should monitor several key price levels on Intel’s chart that will likely gain close attention. Firstly, it’s worth keeping a close eye on the $20 area, a price level the stock reclaimed on Monday. This location on the chart finds a confluence of support from the psychological round number and a horizontal line that connects a range of historical trading levels in the chipmaker’s stock from 1997 to 2012. Confirmation of a September hammer pattern at this key level would register a significant win for the bulls. However, a continuation of Intel’s downtrend could see the shares fall to around $17, where they would likely find support from a period of consolidation in the stock between 1997 and 1998, an area that also closely aligns with troughs in 2006 and 2010. Longer-term weakness may bring the $14 region into play, an area on the chart where buy-and-hold investors would likely seek entry points near prominent swing lows that formed during the dotcom bubble correction of 2002 and great recession in 2009. If an upside reversal takes place in Intel shares, investors should initially keep an eye on the $25 level, a key overhead area where the stock could run into resistance from a horizontal line linking multiple peaks and troughs between 1997 and February last year. A move above this area could see the shares climb to $35, where they may encounter selling pressure near a trendline joining a series of price action from 1999 to October 2023 with the closely-aligned 200-day moving average.

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. CBA - which owns ASB - is experimenting with advanced AI chatbots running on a new Amazon and Nvidia-powered system. Image / 123RF Commonwealth Bank of Australia - owner of ASB - is exploring the possibility of replacing thousands of its call centre staff with AI, according to an AFR report. The bank, which has some 2400 local call centre staff, announced on Tuesday it’s conducting trials with a generative AI chatbot called “Hey CommBank”, testing the technology on employees of the bank who are also customers. Could it happen on this side of the ditch? “We believe it’s our people that set us apart at ASB and they’ll always be integral to our customer offering,” an ASB spokeswoman told the Herald. “We continue to explore how advancements in tech, including AI, can support our people to do their jobs efficiently but have no plans to replace a large number of roles any time soon. “We’re already using a range of technology, including AI, alongside our team, to enhance the experience we offer our customers. For example, our chatbot Josie has been supporting customers using our digital channels since 2018.” “There’s emerging evidence that AI-driven voice and chatbot interfaces, powered by frontier LLMs [large language models] such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Anthropic’s Claude are approaching human-level capability interacting with human callers and resolving customer service inquiries first time,” said Ben Reid, the founding executive director of AI Forum NZ, who’s now running his own future technology consultancy, Memia. “Clearly if this removes the need to wait on hold listening to muzak for hours then most people will welcome this as a positive development,” he says. “But in reality, as with all AI solutions, the reliability and accuracy of these AI voice solutions is still not quite good enough for prime-time.” “It is inevitable that AI will replace aspects of customer service,” Victoria University senior lecturer in artificial intelligence Andrew Lensen said. “And for some customers, that’s a positive thing. Many ‘digital natives’ would much prefer a high-quality chatbot than talking to a person. But we need to manage the transition fairly and justly.” CommBank’s announcement of its AI trial earlier this week drew fire from Australia’s Finance Sector Union, which said it was not consulted before the launch. Finance Sector Union assistant secretary Nicole McPherson told the AFR the rollout of the new technology was “disrespectful and tricky”. “I’ve been concerned about AI replacing jobs for a few years now – and it looks like it’s finally being publicly acknowledged. Salaries are some of the biggest costs to businesses, so I am not surprised to see a bank moving forward with replacing customer service with AI,” Lensen said. “We can be sure that if the Aussie banks are exploring this, then it will affect Kiwis as well. After all, our banks are nearly all Australian-owned. “What is the plan for workers who are being made redundant by AI? Will the banks help them to re/upskill? Are the Australian and New Zealand Governments prepared for what could be significant layoffs in the workforce (on top of the existing government cuts)? I don’t see anyone answering these questions – we need to take this very seriously as a society and the coalition Government needs to show leadership in addressing these real issues, rather than just promoting AI as being good for productivity and economic growth.” Technology Minister Judith Collins sent a strategy paper to Cabinet centred on light policing of AI, saying new rules would stifle innovation at a time when New Zealand needed to catch up with other countries. Lensen said that by “all but ruling out AI regulation”, Collins was taking a different path to most of our trading partners. He wanted to see the Government at the very least map the lay of the land, surveying which industries and jobs would be affected by AI - and when and how. “Beyond job losses, we should also be concerned about the automation of financial advice and services. Even the very best-designed chatbots can fail – for example, we saw Air Canada in the news a few months ago when their AI chatbot hallucinated a new bereavement policy,” Lensen said. “Air Canada had to pay out in court – so there’s a risk for businesses, too. What happens when a bank AI chatbot gives somebody the wrong advice on their mortgage? Will the bank put aside some of its profits to self-insurance against these mistakes?” AI is already being used to augment helpdesk operations. One NZ’s Jason Paris recently noted that’s been the case for years, well before ChatGPT’s public release threw artificial intelligence into the mainstream. Paris has also been among those who have argued that many customers prefer a smooth, quick digital experience to talking to a human for the likes of simple queries and account changes. CBA is ramping up its artificial intelligence efforts. On T... (truncated)

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Intel’s struggling chip-making business got a boost Monday from a high-profile client: Amazon. The announcement came after Intel said earlier in the day it would receive up to $3 billion in funding under the CHIPS and Science Act to manufacture chips for the military. Intel Foundry and Amazon Web Services will coinvest in a custom chip design for the latter and “announced a multi-year, multi-billion-dollar framework,” according to a release. “Specifically, Intel Foundry will produce an AI fabric chip for AWS on Intel 18A,” Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said in the statement Monday. Intel, once the world’s most dominant chipmaker, with a stranglehold on PCs and Macs, has struggled to keep up with the mobile computing wave and has been surpassed in market value by Qualcomm and Texas Instruments, both leaders in mobile chips. And, of course, there’s Nvidia, which rode the subsequent AI boom to become one of the most valuable public companies in the world. Intel’s partnership with AWS is part of the chipmaker’s attempt to play catch-up. The new deal, along with a $3 billion grant from the US government to boost domestic chip making and make chips for the US military, “demonstrates the continued progress we are making to build a world-class foundry business,” Intel said in the statement. Intel is continuing to build plants in US states Arizona, Oregon, New Mexico and Ohio but is pausing its production in Germany and Poland for about two years. Intel shares jumped 6% in after-hours trading after the announcement. Gelsinger also provided updates on the company’s goal to cut $10 billion by 2025. Intel has changed its business model to try to become a global chip manufacturer to rival Taiwan’s TSMC. The note said the company is more than halfway through its goal to cut 15,000 employees by the end of the year and will notify more employees of layoffs in mid-October. It’s also planning to slash its global real estate footprint by about two-thirds by the end of 2024. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Local news: Amazon’s move to rope corporate workers back into the office five days a week from January could lead some staff to quit the company, according to one Australian-based expert who believes the e-commerce giant has failed to properly justify the decision. Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy announced in a note to staff the company is taking a major step away from its pandemic-era arrangements, with workers required “in the office the way we were before the onset of COVID”. Jassy said it is a move that will “strengthen our culture and teams” and help staff “deliver the absolute best for customers and the business”. Know the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today Its white-collar workers have been required to swipe into the office at least three days a week for the past 15 months. That will move to five days from January 2. Jassy, who took over from founder Jeff Bezos in 2021, said: “We continue to believe the advantages of being together in the office are significant. “It’s easier for our teammates to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture; collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective; teaching and learning from one another are more seamless; and, teams tend to be better connected to one another.” The company said there would be exceptions — including for emergencies and parents who need to take care of a sick child — and there will be flexibility for those who were not in the office full-time prior to COVID-19, but conceded the shift will “require some adjustments”. “Before the pandemic, it was not a given that folks could work remotely two days a week and that will also be true moving forward,” Jassy said. “Our expectation is that people will be in the office outside of extenuating circumstances.” Amazon has a global workforce of more than 1.5 million and employs about 7000 staff in Australia. Hundreds of Amazon staff staged a walkout in 2023 to protest return-to-office mandates and layoffs. University of Sydney Business School professor of management Angela Knox, who specialises in work and employment, said one size no longer fits all. “I would expect a lot of workers at Amazon will be dissatisfied — the reaction from workers (during the previous return-to-office mandate) was dissatisfaction,” Knox told 7NEWS.com.au. “It’s not unexpected that a bigger request to return to the office five days a week will lead to high levels of dissatisfaction among some workers. “Some workers prefer working from the office, others from home, and others both. There’s not a one-size-fits-all solution.” Knox flagged some staff could quit in favour of a job that is better catered to how they want to work and live. “If workers don’t want to go into the office they will look for employment that satisfies that,” Knox said “Things have changed so fundamentally. Employees want options and flexibility and will go where they can get that.” Thirty-seven per cent of Australians were regularly working from home in late 2023, according to ABS data. It was down from about 40 per cent in 2021 but still higher than pre-pandemic levels. Close to two-thirds of Australian managers and professionals, like those Amazon is returning to the office, were working from home. “Interestingly, while the pandemic has seen a large shift in people working from home, there haven’t been similarly large changes in other arrangements like working flexible hours,” ABS head of labour statistics Bjorn Jarvis said when the data was released. “Apart from working from home, most other arrangements have generally followed pre-pandemic trends.” One thing that Knox said stood out in the messaging to Amazon staff was a lack of data to justify the decision. “Workers would appreciate a stronger rationale for the decision including data on productivity and performance, (comparing) working in the office against working from home,” Knox said. “It’s not unreasonable to expect staff to come into the office for some activities and meetings but there is insufficient justification for a full return to the office.” Knox said working from home did require management, ensuring staff remain productive, but argued working in the office could potentially be less productive, considering time spent chatting with colleagues and attending meetings that could be handled in an email. “Being visible does not mean being productive,” she said. Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox said the current trend is “very much” with employees wanting staff to return to the office because of concerns over productivity, collaboration, culture and accountability. “We’re more than five years on from COVID and the labor market is changing,” he told 7NEWS.com.au. “Employers are in a position to seek more in terms of everyone turning up (to the office).” He said not all will choose a five-day in-office policy, adding flexible and hybrid workplaces will remain. “There’s no hard or fast rule. We’re kind of in unknown territory and it will vary f... (truncated)

Working from home is over, Amazon told its corporate employees on Monday—at least on weekdays. The most recent guidance was that staff members needed to show up at least three days a week. That minimum has gone the way of social distancing, CNBC reports. "Before the pandemic, it was not a given that folks could work remotely two days a week, and that will also be true moving forward," CEO Andy Jassy wrote in a company memo, adding that "our expectation is that people will be in the office outside of extenuating circumstances." The policy takes effect Jan. 2. Jassy has told employees before that having them in the same place improves the company culture, per CNN, and he told them he realized teams needed time to figure out how that will work best for them. On Monday, Jassy said being in the office will help help staff members "invent, collaborate, and be connected enough to each other and our culture to deliver the absolute best for customers and the business." He also said Amazon is simplifying its corporate structure. The company will have fewer managers, Jassy said, to "remove layers and flatten organizations." Corporate organizations are to increase the ratio of "individual contributors"—employees who typically don't manage other employees—to managers by at least 15%. It wasn't made clear whether positions will be cut, per CNBC, and a company spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company had added employees during the pandemic, until Jassy ordered thousands of layoffs. (More Amazon stories.)

We recently compiled a list of Morgan Stanley's Best Stock Picks: 15 Stocks To Own For 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against Morgan Stanley's other stock picks. The tail end of 2024 is seeing a market shift in the stock market as the Federal Reserve has finally signaled that interest rate cuts are on the horizon. This means that cheaper capital might be on the horizon, with the rate cuts coming just as the labor market starts to feel the pinch through lower growth. It also means that consumer spending can pick up if economic output remains robust. For investors, it creates an opportunity to gain an early foothold into stocks that could benefit from the new environment. On this front, investment banks have been analyzing the situation diligently for quite some time. One bank that's out with regular reports is Morgan Stanley. It releases monthly reports that cover the latest trends in the economy and the stock market. The bank's August report covered some recent trends. It shared that the labor market was one of its most closely watched economic indicators as it was "vulnerable to a further deceleration in economic activity." To explain why, the bank shared that US excess labor supply, that is the demand minus supply, was at pre pandemic levels that had sustained since 2018. This implies that employers no longer have the incentive to offer lucrative pay packages to attract workers, which in turn leads to less money flowing into the economy to contribute to inflation. MS added that the three month national unemployment average was 0.5% above the 12 month average, which is a warning bell for the economy. This is because according to one of the most widely used recession indicators, the Sahm Rule, a recession has started once the rate is 0.5% or higher than the 12 month average. MS is not the only one that is ringing warning bells on this front, as JPM also confirmed in early August that the rule was triggered when the unemployment rate jumped to 4.3%. However, it did add that we "do not think a recession is imminent" and "remain constructive on U.S. equities despite increased volatility, and see opportunity to lock in rates before they fall." SEE ALSO 15 Best European AI Stocks According to Morgan Stanley and Best Humanoid Robot Stocks According to Morgan Stanley Returning to MS, it also sees an opportunity in the battered commercial real estate market. It cites the commercial real estate cap rate, which is the rate of return based on its income generation capability, to argue that commercial real estate valuations are currently depressed enough to warrant an investment. The office real estate market had a cap rate of 9% in March 2024 as per MS, for a two percentage point and three percentage point lead over retail and residential real estate, respectively. As for the stock market, the bank shared in August that it still prefers large cap stocks (an important point as you'll find out when you check out the stocks in this piece). The bank believes that small caps "are lower in quality, more volatile and carry greater exposure to cyclical sectors relative to large cap," meaning that their outperformance "requires economic growth acceleration with lower interest rates." MS warned that "softer economic data may constrain" small cap performance. In terms of data, it argues that small cap performance is dependent on bond yields. This data set shows that when we assume an index value of 100 for US small caps had led benchmark S&P stocks except the Magnificent 7 at a time when 10 year US bond yields were around 1.5% in July 2021, the indexed returns dropped to 90 in July 2023 when the yields were approximately 4.3%. August's final week was pivotal for the stock market as Fed Chair Jerome Powell finally signaled that the time for interest rates had come. "The time has come for policy to adjust," stated Powell at Jackson Hole, Wyoming. "The direction of travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks," he added. Following the Fed Chair's remarks, MS was out with its September report. Commenting on the economy, the bank shared that it does not "believe the economy is set to accelerate over the next few months, which makes the S&P 500 around 5650 our near-term upper bound. At the same time, the economy is not collapsing, which makes 5200 attractive and 5350 seem fair. We plan to trade around the ranges." MS also shares key details for the unemployment rate, which are important when analyzed in tandem with the Sahm Rule. It comments that higher immigration "may be supporting a higher labor force participation rate, which in turn would contribute to a higher reported unemployment rate. From this perspective, a higher unemployment rate is not signaling weakness but rather an increase in the labor supply that would help bring inflation down without affecting growth." Subsequen...

Title: Amazon Plans to Have Fewer Managers, More Days in Office

Amazon plans to reduce the number of managers in each of its organizations and to require employees to work primarily in an office. The company is making these changes as part of its efforts to “operate like the world’s largest startup,” Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote in a message shared with the company’s employees and posted online Monday (Sept. 16). In the case of managers, Amazon aims to flatten organizations by asking each of its S-teams, or senior leadership teams, to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of the first quarter of 2025, according to the message. As the company grew its teams over the last several years, it also added managers and more layers than it had before, per the message. This has led to more meetings and more managers reviewing topics before they move forward. “If we do this work well,” Jassy said of the move to have having fewer managers, “it will increase our teammates’ ability to move fast, clarify and invigorate their sense of ownership, drive decision-making closer to the front lines where it most impacts customers (and the business), decrease bureaucracy, and strengthen our organizations’ ability to make customers’ lives better and easier every day,” Jassy wrote. Amazon began a series of layoffs in November 2022, with Jassy saying at the time that the company had hired rapidly over the previous several years. In January 2023, he said the number of layoffs would amount to more than 18,000. On the issue of working from an office, Amazon is going to return to the practices it had before the pandemic, according to the message. That means employees being in the office except in “extenuating circumstances” like when their child is sick, there’s an emergency at home, they’re visiting customers or partners, or they need a day or two to finish coding in a more isolated environment, Jassy wrote. Over the last 15 months, employees have been back in the office at least three days a week, per the message. But now it will no longer be “a given” that they can work remotely two days a week. This change will take effect Jan. 2. Jassy wrote in the message that working from an office will make Amazon’s teams “better set up to invent, collaborate, and be connected enough to each other and our culture to deliver the absolute best for customers and the business.” It was reported in July 2023 that Amazon was ramping up its return-to-the-office mandate by requiring employees working remotely or in smaller remote offices to return to the company’s “main hub” locations. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Amazon is asking workers to return to the office five days a week starting in January, marking the first of the Big Tech companies to require a full week in-office. Chief executive Andy Jassy announced the news in a message to employees Monday, telling them they will be expected to follow the new policy beginning Jan. 2. Before the change, Amazon employees were required to be in the office three days a week. “When we look back over the last five years, we continue to believe that the advantages of being together in the office are significant,” Jassy’s note to staff said. “We’ve observed that it’s easier for our teammates to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture; collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective; teaching and learning from one another are more seamless; and, teams tend to be better connected to one another.” Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post. The news at Amazon comes as more companies pull back on remote work and crack down on enforcing return-to-office policies. Though Amazon is the first Big Tech company requiring a full week in the office, other tech companies have slowly been tweaking their policies over the past couple of years and taking some hard-line stances. SAP, AT&T and Dell are among those that have rolled back more flexible policies. As a result, some workers have pushed back with threats and protests, or even quit over the new policies. That was then. Jassy said Amazon’s new policy would be similar to the pre-pandemic era: Employees may still have some exceptions to the rule if their child is sick, they have an emergency or they need to work in an isolated environment, for example. But they will no longer be able to work from home two days a week without a reason, unless they have a remote work exception approved by their supervisor. The company did not comment on how it intends to enforce the rule. And while Jassy recognizes that some employees “may have set up their personal lives in such a way that returning to the office consistently five days per week will require some adjustments,” he expects everyone to be compliant by Jan. 2. Jassy also said he plans to increase the ratio of employees to managers to flatten the organization and allow teams to move faster and decrease bureaucracy. Moves such as Amazon’s come with consequences, said Prithwiraj Choudhury, a Harvard Business School professor who studies remote work. Choudhury said that research has shown that when companies roll back flexible work policies, they often lose top performers, diverse workers and job candidates. It is also often a way for companies to lower their head count without layoffs. “This seems to be a step back in time,” he said. “It’s regressive leadership.” Choudhury doesn’t believe the tide is turning on hybrid work. About 41 percent of people did their jobs with hybrid arrangements as of Sept. 1, according to data from the Survey of Working Arrangements and Attitudes conducted by WFH Research, a group of researchers from the University of Chicago, MIT, Stanford University and Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México. That number has hovered between 40 and 50 percent since January. “We are squarely in the hybrid world,” Choudhury said. “The challenge is how to figure out hybrid.” The best way is to leave it up to teams to determine how often, when and where they should be meeting, Choudhury said. While Amazon is rolling flexibility back, other companies like job review service Glassdoor are doubling down. The company closed its last remaining two offices in the U.S. as it continues to be remote-first. -Washington Post Take your Radio, Podcasts and Music with you Get more of the radio, music and podcasts you love with the FREE iHeartRadio app. Scan the QR code to download now.

Title: Intel’s big turnaround plan includes spinning off its chipmaking business

By Emma Roth, a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more. Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO. Intel is spinning off its chipmaking business as part of its plans to reverse billions in losses and a tumbling stock price. In an announcement on Monday, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said the Intel Foundry will become an independent subsidiary with “clearer separation and independence” from Intel. With the change, the Intel Foundry will have its own operating board and report its financial earnings separately from Intel. Intel will also stop work on the factories it’s building in Poland and Germany for two years “based on anticipated market demand.” The company is still moving forward with its plants in Arizona, Oregon, New Mexico, and Ohio, however. Additionally, Intel plans on selling part of its stake in Altera, the programmable chip company it acquired in 2015. It will also cut around two-thirds of its global real estate footprint. As part of this announcement, Intel revealed that the Biden administration awarded the company up to $3 billion in funding to make chips for the US military. These changes will likely be crucial in getting Intel back on track as a leading chipmaker. On top of widespread issues affecting 13th and 14th Gen CPUs, the company reported $1.6 billion in the first quarter of 2024, with its chipmaking business alone racking up $7 billion in operating losses in 2023. In August, Intel announced layoffs affecting 15,000 workers, and now it says it is “more than halfway” to this goal. “As I’ve said before, this is the most significant transformation of Intel in over four decades. Not since the memory to microprocessor transition have we attempted something so essential,” Gelsinger says. “We succeeded then — and we will meet this moment and build a stronger Intel for decades to come.” Even though Intel is betting that its new 18A chipmaking process will help stem some of its losses, a recent report from Reuters suggests that early tests have failed when creating Broadcom’s silicon wafers. Starting next year, Intel is planning to produce chips with the 18A process for partners like Microsoft — and now Amazon. / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

Title: Amazon mandates five days a week in office starting next year

Business The Amazon logo is seen outside its JFK8 distribution centre in Staten Island, New York, US, Nov 25, 2020. (File photo: REUTERS/Brendan McDermid) Tech giant Amazon will require employees to return to working at company offices five days per week beginning next year, toughening a prior three-day mandate. "When we look back over the last five years, we continue to believe that the advantages of being together in the office are significant," CEO Andy Jassy wrote in a letter to employees globally on Monday (Sep 16). He said the experience of a three-day mandate "strengthened our conviction about the benefits" of in-office work. "We've observed that it's easier for our teammates to learn, model, practice and strengthen our culture; collaborating, brainstorming and inventing are simpler and more effective; teaching and learning from one another are more seamless; and teams tend to be better connected to one another," he added. Companies have been allowing many employees to work from home since the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving downtown offices nearly empty in a number of US cities such as San Francisco and Seattle. However, some tech firms are beginning to mandate employees to return to their offices two or three days per week. Amazon has taken a tougher stance than many of its rivals as the pandemic has become less of a daily threat. Employees have described to Reuters how Amazon has required them to report to, in some cases, distant offices or move to Seattle to keep their jobs. And some employees who were consistently out of compliance with the existing three-day mandate were told they were "voluntarily resigning", and were locked out of Amazon's systems. A spokesperson for Amazon did not immediately respond to say whether the new mandate will be as stringent, nor did an employee Q&A shared with Reuters on Monday make it clear. The mandate has been deeply unpopular among a vocal group of employees who have said working from home is both effective and spares time and money for commuting. In May last year, workers at Amazon's Seattle headquarters staged a walkout protesting changes to the e-commerce giant's climate policy, layoffs and a return-to-office mandate. As part of an organisational restructuring, Amazon is looking to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15 per cent by the end of the first quarter of 2025. In the Q&A, Amazon said "some organisations may identify roles that are no longer required" without giving additional details. Amazon also is eliminating a prior programme that allowed workers the option to work from anywhere for four months per year, according to the Q&A. Jassy said that to accommodate the lifestyle changes necessary, the new policy would start on Jan 2, 2025. After a wave of layoffs, in 2023 Amazon was reported to have 300,000 to 350,000 corporate employees globally. This number is separate from their warehouse and delivery workers, who make up a much larger portion of Amazon's total workforce of about 1.5 million.

Intel (INTC) shares surged in extended trading Monday after CEO Pat Gelsinger offered an update on the chipmaker's plans to cut costs and bolster its business, with investors awaiting signs of a turnaround for its stock. Shares were up over 8% shortly after the closing bell, after gaining 6% during the regular trading session. Even with those gains, though, Intel's shares have lost more than half their value since the start of the year. Gelsinger said Intel has made progress in lowering expenses through layoffs, trimming its real estate footprint, and selling part of its stake in its Altera programmable chip unit, among other steps to cut costs. The company also said it plans to turn Intel Foundry, which makes chips for other companies, into a separate subsidiary, a move that Intel said will give it greater independence, allow it to seek financing independently, and help Intel “optimize the capital structure of each business.” Recent reports had suggested that Intel might sell the operation. Intel also announced multibillion-dollar agreements to produce custom chips for Amazon (AMZN), as well as the U.S. military. The Pentagon news was first reported by Bloomberg. "This news, combined with our [Amazon Web Services] announcement, demonstrates the continued progress we are making to build a world-class foundry business," Gelsinger said in a release. Gelsinger added the chipmaker will still be moving forward with projects in Arizona, Oregon, New Mexico and Ohio, adding that Intel remains “well-positioned to scale up production around the world based on market demand.”

Title: The Subprime AI Crisis

Time Published: 2024-09-16T20:31:07Z
Full Content:
None of what I write in this newsletter is about sowing doubt or "hating," but a sober evaluation of where we are today and where we may end up on the current path. I believe that the artificial intelligence boom — which would be better described as a generative AI boom — is (as I've said before) unsustainable, and will ultimately collapse. I also fear that said collapse could be ruinous to big tech, deeply damaging to the startup ecosystem, and will further sour public support for the tech industry. The reason I'm writing this today is that it feels like the tides are rapidly turning, and multiple pale horses of the AI apocalypse have emerged: “a big, stupid magic trick” in the form of OpenAI's (rushed) launch of its "o1 (codenamed: strawberry") model, rumored price increases for future OpenAI models (and elsewhere), layoffs at Scale AI, and leaders fleeing OpenAI. These are all signs that things are beginning to collapse. As a result, I think it’s important to explain how precarious things are, and why we are in a trough of magical thinking. I want to express my concerns about the fragility of this movement and the obsessiveness and directionlessness that brought us here, and I want some of us to do better. I also — and this, perhaps, is something I haven’t focused on as much as I should have — want to highlight the potential human cost of an AI bubble implosion. Whether Microsoft and Google (and the other big generative AI backers) slowly wind down their positions, or cannibalize their companies to keep OpenAI and Anthropic (as well as their own generative AI efforts) alive, I’m convinced that the end result will be the same. I fear tens of thousands of people will lose their jobs, and much of the tech industry will suffer as they realize that the only thing that can grow forever is cancer. There won’t be much levity in this piece. I’m going to paint you a bleak picture — not just for the big AI players, but for tech more widely, and for the people who work at tech companies — and tell you why I think the conclusion to this sordid saga, as brutal and damaging as it will be, is coming sooner than you think. Let's begin. As we speak, OpenAI — the ostensible non-profit that may soon become a for-profit — is currently raising a funding round at a valuation of at least $150 billion, and is expected to raise at least $6.5 billion — but potentially as much as $7 billion — led by Josh Kushner's Thrive Capital, with rumored participation from both NVIDIA and Apple. As I've explained in agonizing detail in the past, OpenAI will have to continue to raise more money than any startup has ever raised in history, in perpetuity, to survive. Worse still, OpenAI also is trying to raise $5 billion in debt from banks “in the form of a revolving credit facility” according to Bloomberg, and the terms on revolving credit facilities tend to have higher rates of interest. The Information also reports that OpenAI is in talks with MGX, a $100 billion investment fund backed by the United Arab Emirates to invest primarily in AI and semiconductor companies, as well as potentially raising from the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. This should be the biggest warning sign that things are going poorly, because absolutely nobody raises from the UAE or Saudis because they want to. They’re the place you go if you need a lot of money and you’re not confident anybody else will give it to you. Sidenote: as CNBC points out, one of the foundational partners of MGX, Mubadala, owns around $500m in Anthropic equity, which it acquired from the bankruptcy of FTX’s assets. I’m sure Amazon and Google are thrilled about that conflict of interest! As I discussed at the end of July, OpenAI needs to raise at least $3 billion — but more like $10 billion to survive, as it is on course to lose $5 billion in 2024, a number that's likely to increase as more complex models demand more compute and more training data, with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei predicting that future models may cost as much as $100 billion to train. OpenAI has already tried to raise at a $100 billion valuation earlier in the year, with some investors balking at the price tag, in part because (and I paraphrase The Information's Kate Clark and Natasha Mascarenhas) of a growing concern over the overvaluation of generative AI companies. To get the round done, OpenAI may also convert from a non-profit to a for-profit entity, but the most confusing part of this story appears to be what investors are actually getting. Kate Clark of The Information reports that investors in the round are being told, and I quote, that they "don't get traditional equity for their cash...instead, they receive units that promise a slice of the company's profits — once it starts to generate them." It's unclear whether a conversion to a for-profit entity would fix this problem, as OpenAI's bizarre non-profit-with-a-for-profit-arm corporate structure means that Microsoft has the rights to 75% of OpenAI's profits as part of it...

Earlier this year, Intel announced its current financial situation was not looking good. Among other things, the company announced mass layoffs of 15,000 team members in early August. Today, as previously rumored, Intel announced more details of its plan to make major change to get things back on track. In a blog post, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger announced it would be making changes to its foundry business. That division will now become an independent subsidiary of the company. Gelsinger stated: A subsidiary structure will unlock important benefits. It provides our external foundry customers and suppliers with clearer separation and independence from the rest of Intel. Importantly, it also gives us future flexibility to evaluate independent sources of funding and optimize the capital structure of each business to maximize growth and shareholder value creation. Intel will also put the construction of two foundry plants, one in Poland and one in Germany, on hold for at least two years. It still plans to complete the construction of its packaging plant in Malaysia but added that it will "align the startup with market conditions and increased utilization of our existing capacity." Intel also announced a new collaboration with Amazon Web Services. That will include Intel making an "AI fabric chip" for AWS. The company said it will put its focus on its own x86 chip portfolio. It added: Our top priority is to maximize the value of our x86 franchise across client, edge and data center markets, including with a broader range of custom chiplets and other customized offerings that meet emerging customer needs, as demonstrated by today’s AWS announcement. Intel said that it is currently over halfway through the process of cutting its previously announced 15,000 workers, either through layoffs or early retirement. The rest of the job cuts will happen before the end of October.

Amazon is requiring its workers to return to the office full time. In a note published Monday by the e-commerce giant, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, who took over from founder Jeff Bezos in 2020, said the move to end the company's hybrid model was designed toward "being better set up to invent, collaborate, and be connected enough to each other and our culture to deliver the absolute best for customers and the business." He noted that the company's three-day-a-week policy, instituted in 2023, had only reinforced the view that a full return was necessary. "When we look back over the last five years, we continue to believe that the advantages of being together in the office are significant," Jassy said. The change will take effect starting in January 2025. The company will still respect extenuating circumstances, like caring for a sick child, and pre-approved work-from-home or hybrid arrangements. Amazon joins a growing list of major U.S. firms returning to a five-days-a-week office policy, including Boeing, JP Morgan Chase and UPS. However, according to data from FlexIndex, a firm that tracks company office policies, a majority of U.S. firms still offer hybrid arrangements. The data does show bigger companies leading the way in pushing for more in-office full-time policies. But notably, Jassy said he wants Amazon to operate as if it were "the world's largest startup" — a sentiment Bezos, Amazon's founder, often stressed. “That means having a passion for constantly inventing for customers," Jassy said, "strong urgency (for most big opportunities, it’s a race!), high ownership, fast decision-making, scrappiness and frugality, deeply-connected collaboration (you need to be joined at the hip with your teammates when inventing and solving hard problems), and a shared commitment to each other.” Jassy also announced a move to reduce "bureaucracy" within the firm, hinting at unintended consequences from Amazon's aggressive hiring following pandemic reopenings — and possibly opening the door for layoffs. Jassy asked employee units to "increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers" by at least 15% by the end of Q1 2025. "As we have grown our teams as quickly and substantially as we have the last many years, we have understandably added a lot of managers," Jassy said. "In that process, we have also added more layers than we had before. It’s created artifacts that we’d like to change." An Amazon spokesperson did not respond to a follow-up request for comment. This article was originally published on NBCNews.com Amazon CEO Andy Jassy is calling for a full return to office at the start of 2025. For the last 15 months, employees have been expected to work in the office three days per week. Now employees will be expected to be in the office five days a week, with work from home being OK only in extenuating circumstances.

As part of CEO Pat Gelsinger's effort to turn around the struggling chipmaker, Intel said in a memo to employees that it will also sell off part of its stake in Altera. Gelsinger said the restructuring would allow the foundry business to "evaluate independent sources of funding," and comes days after Intel's board met to assess the direction and future of the company. The foundry business, which Intel plans to use to manufacture chips for other customers, has been a big drag on its bottom line, with the company spending roughly $25 billion on it in each of the last two years. Beyond just considering outside funding, Intel is weighing whether to spin off the foundry business, possibly into a separate publicly traded company, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who declined to be named in order to discuss confidential information. With a standalone "operating board" and a cleaner corporate structure, the mechanics of a separation become far easier than trying to turn a fully integrated unit into a separate company. Prior to the postmarket pop, Intel had lost almost 60% of its value this year. The company has given up market share in its core PC and data center business and watched Nvidia run away with the market for chips that power artificial intelligence workloads. In August, Intel reported disappointing quarterly results, sparking the sharpest sell-off in 50 years, and said it would lay off more than 15% of its workforce as part of a $10 billion cost-reduction plan. Gelsinger said the company is about halfway through the layoffs. Intel will also pause its fabrication efforts in Poland and Germany "by approximately two years based on anticipated market demand," Gelsinger said, and pull back on its plans for its Malaysian factory. U.S. manufacturing projects will remain unaffected, the company said. Earlier on Monday, Intel was awarded up to $3 billion from the Biden administration and the CHIPS and Science Act, an effort to bring chipmaking to the U.S. The funding is for the "Secure Enclave" program, which furthers a project between Intel and the Department of Defense. The U.S. government is bolstering its investment in s... (truncated)

Amazon joins a growing list of major U.S. firms returning to a five-days-a-week office policy, including Boeing, JP Morgan Chase and UPS. However, according to data from FlexIndex, a firm that tracks company office policies, a majority of U.S. firms still offer hybrid arrangements. The data does show bigger companies leading the way in pushing for more in-office full-time policies. But notably, Jassy said he wants Amazon to operate as if it were "the world's largest startup" — a sentiment Bezos, Amazon's founder, often stressed. “That means having a passion for constantly inventing for customers," Jassy said, "strong urgency (for most big opportunities, it’s a race!), high ownership, fast decision-making, scrappiness and frugality, deeply-connected collaboration (you need to be joined at the hip with your teammates when inventing and solving hard problems), and a shared commitment to each other.” Jassy also announced a move to reduce "bureaucracy" within the firm, hinting at unintended consequences from Amazon's aggressive hiring following pandemic reopenings — and possibly opening the door for layoffs. Jassy asked employee units to "increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers" by at least 15% by the end of Q1 2025. "As we have grown our teams as quickly and substantially as we have the last many years, we have understandably added a lot of managers," Jassy said. "In that process, we have also added more layers than we had before. It’s created artifacts that we’d like to change." An Amazon spokesperson did not respond to a follow-up request for comment.

Title: Amazon CEO vows leaner teams amid bloat, ends work from home

SEATTLE - Amazon.com chief executive officer Andy Jassy is moving to streamline the world’s largest online retailer and cloud-computing company, cutting management layers and ordering employees to return to the office five days a week beginning in January. The shake-up, announced in a memo to employees on Sept 16, echoed what some company veterans have been whispering for years: It’s become harder to get things done at Amazon. Stories of endless deliberation, unnecessary meetings and layers of approval have become commonplace at a company that fashions itself as a collection of teams charged with operating like start-ups. Mr Jassy called out some of those phenomena in his note, citing “pre-meetings for the pre-meetings for the decision meetings, a longer line of managers feeling like they need to review a topic before it moves forward, owners of initiatives feeling less like they should make recommendations because the decision will be made elsewhere.” Each major organisation within Amazon will be required to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by 15 per cent by the end of March 2025, Mr Jassy said. He also announced a bureaucracy tipline for employees to raise concerns about unnecessary processes. “We want to operate like the world’s largest startup,” he said in the message, which was also posted on Amazon’s corporate blog. “That means having a passion for constantly inventing for customers, strong urgency (for most big opportunities, it’s a race!), high ownership, fast decision-making, scrappiness and frugality, deeply-connected collaboration (you need to be joined at the hip with your teammates when inventing and solving hard problems), and a shared commitment to each other.” It also means an end to Amazon’s relative flexibility on where office workers do their jobs. Previously, Amazon had required employees to badge in at least three days a week, depending on the requirements of their team. Amazon’s new return to office plans will make exceptions for extenuating circumstances or cases where managers had already approved a fully remote position, and employees have a few months to prepare, Jassy said. “We understand that some of our teammates may have set up their personal lives in such a way that returning to the office consistently five days per week will require some adjustments,” Mr Jassy wrote. Most of Amazon’s roughly 1.5 million employees around the world are hourly employees who retrieve items and ship packages, people for whom remote work was never an option. But the company employs hundreds of thousands of office workers – it had roughly 350,000 of them on the eve of its largest-ever layoffs, which began in late 2022. The news will likely mean a boost in downtown foot traffic in the cities where Amazon operates. That includes Seattle, where the company is by far the largest corporate tenant; suburban Bellevue, Washington; as well as places like Arlington, Virginia; the San Francisco Bay Area; Austin; Boston; and Nashville. The company’s prior efforts to get workers back in the office were met with resistance by some employees who charged that the company was inflexible and failed to provide data showing in-person work achieved better results. “Keeping your culture strong is not a birthright,” Mr Jassy wrote. “You have to work at it all the time.” BLOOMBERG Join ST's Telegram channel and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

Amazon is ordering workers back to the office five days a week and wants corporate managers to oversee more employees in a move it says will improve the company’s culture. CEO Andy Jassy said in a memo to staff, “We’ve decided that we’re going to return to being in the office the way we were before the onset of COVID.” Jassy said he believes the move will better set up Amazon “to invent, collaborate, and be connected enough to each other and our culture to deliver the absolute best for customers and the business.” The policy will go into effect on Jan 2, 2025. The CEO of the retail giant did carve out some exceptions to the new policy, saying, “Before the pandemic, not everybody was in the office five days a week, every week. If you or your child were sick, if you had some sort of house emergency, if you were on the road seeing customers or partners, if you needed a day or two to finish coding in a more isolated environment, people worked remotely.” That policy will remain, but people will no longer be able to voluntarily work remotely two days a week, as is the current policy. Jassy also said that the company wants each s-team organization to “to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of Q1 2025.” It wasn’t clear if this meant the company would hire more people, conduct layoffs, or do both to achieve this new ratio. He said the move will “remove layers and flatten organizations more than they are today.” “If we do this work well, it will increase our teammates’ ability to move fast, clarify and invigorate their sense of ownership, drive decision-making closer to the front lines where it most impacts customers (and the business), decrease bureaucracy, and strengthen our organizations’ ability to make customers’ lives better and easier every day,” he said. Jassy also said Amazon (AMZN) will return to having assigned desk arrangements at its U.S. headquarters in Puget Sound, Washington and Arlington, Virginia. Previous reports showed that Amazon was keeping tabs on how much its employees were coming into the office and sending messages to delinquent employees. It also wanted to make sure employees weren’t clocking into the office and then leaving soon after, telling workers they needed to be in for at least two hours to get credit for a day in the office.

Title: Amazon orders employees to return to office 5 days a week, warns of corporate restructuring

Amazon is mandating that corporate workers return to the office five days a week, CEO Andy Jassy said in a note on Monday. The return-to-office mandate is a sharp change from its current hybrid policy, which requires employees to work from the office at least three days a week. Amazon employees will have until Jan. 2 to switch to the new policy. Amazon will also be streamlining its corporate structure — management positions in particular — to “remove layers and flatten organizations,” Jassy said. The Seattle, Wash.-based company rapidly expanded during the pandemic before Jassy took the helm in 2021 and implemented cost-cutting measures and widespread layoffs. During his tenure, Jassy orchestrated the largest layoffs in Amazon’s 27 years as a public company. As a result of growing the company so quickly, Amazon hired a lot of managers and “added more layers than we had before,” Jassy said. Those layers clogged up the food chain — creating pre-meetings for meetings and a more convoluted chain of command. “So, we’re asking each s-team organization to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of Q1 2025,” Jassy wrote. The company has created a “bureaucracy mailbox,” or email alias, dedicated to rooting out unnecessary steps in the company, Jassy said. In addition to tweaking the company’s structure, Jassy said a main focus of the return-to-office mandate was making sure employees are set up with the ability to interact. “We want to operate like the world’s largest startup,” Jassy said. “That means having a passion for constantly inventing for customers, strong urgency (for most big opportunities, it’s a race!), high ownership, fast decision-making, scrappiness and frugality, deeply-connected collaboration (you need to be joined at the hip with your teammates when inventing and solving hard problems), and a shared commitment to each other.” So the five-day-a-week mandate is an effort to foster collaboration seen pre-pandemic, making it easier for teammates to “learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture,” Jassy said. Jassy said the new mandate will operate like most office environments prior to the pandemic. It will be “understood” if an employee has an exceptional circumstance, like a child who is home sick, a house emergency or time spent on the road meeting with clients or partners. Amazon directed further inquiries to review Jassy’s note. Advertisement

FedEx (FDX) shares plunged 15% Friday, a day after the package delivery giant missed quarterly estimates and reduced its forecast as it faced what Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Rajesh Subramaniam called a "challenging Q1 demand environment," especially in the U.S. Subramaniam told analysts that weakness in the industrial economy dragged down business-to-business (B2B) volumes. Chief Customer Officer Brie Carere added that the drop in B2B sales led to a 3% volume decline in U.S. domestic express services. Chief Financial Officer (CFO) John Dietrich noted that the results "were negatively affected by soft revenue trends, with a global decline in priority volume and growth in deferred volume." Deitrich said in light of the first-quarter performance, FedEx was cutting the top end of its full-year adjusted earnings per share (EPS) outlook to $21 from $22. FedEx also sees revenue growth to be in a low-single-digit percentage, down from its earlier forecast of a low- to mid-single-digit percentage. Following the report, Jefferies reduced its price target to $275 from $300. The analysts argued that with the current quarter expected to be pressured and its first-half EPS estimates down 20%, "we do not think the company can achieve the low end of its EPS guide." Shares of FedEx plunged more than 15% in late-morning trading Friday to $254.30, less than 1% above where they began the year.

Not only did FedEx report a downbeat quarter, it cut its full-year outlook, weighing on its stock. Overall, the performance of FDX stock with respect to the index has been quite volatile in recent years. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could FDX face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a strong jump? We now estimate FedEx’s Valuation to be $285 per share, reflecting just 9% upside from its levels of around $260. Our forecast is based on a 14x forward expected adjusted earnings of $20.85, broadly aligning with the stock’s average P/E ratio over the last five years. FedEx’s Revenue fell 0.5% y-o-y to $21.6 billion in Q1, due to lower express and freight segment sales. The average daily volume was flat y-o-y for the express segment, but the average daily shipments were down 3% for the freight segment. FedEx also saw its adjusted operating margin contract by 170 bps to 5.6% in Q1’25. This resulted in its bottom line of $3.60 on an adjusted basis, down 21% y-o-y. This dismal performance by FedEx can be attributed to continued weakness in shipping demand. With continued price increases, consumers have become more cautious and are opting for lower priced services. FedEx will also lose the U.S. Postal Service as its client, likely resulting in around a $500 million headwind for the company. Looking forward, FedEx expects a low single-digit rise in total revenues for fiscal 2025, slightly more cautious than its prior outlook of a low to mid-single-digit rise. Although, its focus on cost-cutting initiatives should bode well for the bottom-line growth. FedEx is in the midst of its $4 billion cost-saving efforts by the end of fiscal 2025. Still, it lowered its earnings outlook to now be in the range of $20 and $21 per share, versus $20 and $22 per share earlier. We now forecast the 2025 revenue to be around $89.7 billion, reflecting a 2% y-o-y rise, and adjusted earnings to be $20.85, versus $17.80 in fiscal 2024. While FedEx will likely benefit from its focus on improving margins, the company faces headwinds amid soft demand, which may continue to weigh on its stock performance in the near term. While FDX stock posted a downbeat Q1, it is helpful to see how FedEx’s Peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons.

Title: Pick FedEx Stock Ahead Of Q1?

A FedEx Express plane prepares for landing at the Beijing Capital International airport in Beijing ... [+] on September 6, 2024. (Photo by ADEK BERRY / AFP) (Photo by ADEK BERRY/AFP via Getty Images) FedEx (NYSE: FDX) is scheduled to report its fiscal Q1 2025 results on Thursday, September 19 (FedEx’s fiscal year ends in May). We expect the company to post an upbeat quarter, driven by an overall improvement in volumes. Furthermore, its cost reduction actions are expected to bolster its bottom-line growth. Although we think FedEx navigated well in Q1, its stock appears to have little room for growth from its current levels of around $300. Our interactive dashboard analysis of FedEx’s Earnings Preview has more details on the company’s revenues and earnings for the quarter. So, what are some trends likely to drive FedEx’s results? Firstly, let us look at FedEx’s performance in the previous quarter. FedEx’s Revenue rose 1% y-o-y to $22.1 billion, primarily due to slightly higher yields for both Express and Ground segments. The average daily volume was down 1% for Express but up 1% for the Ground segment. FedEx also saw its adjusted operating margin expand by 40 bps to 8.5% in Q4’24. This clubbed with a 2% decline in average shares outstanding, amid share repurchases, resulted in a 10% rise in the bottom line to $5.41 on an adjusted basis. Coming to the latest quarter, we expect revenues to be around $22.1 billion, reflecting a roughly 2% y-o-y rise - slightly ahead of the consensus estimate of a little under $22 billion. FedEx has had a tough few quarters amid falling delivery volumes. The weakening consumer demand in the wake of high inflation has weighed on overall volumes. However, the company has seen market share gains lately and this should aid overall sales growth. Average daily volumes are also expected to now improve after seeing weaker demand over last year. Additionally, FedEx’s Q1 results should benefit from its ongoing cost-cutting initiatives that aim to reduce $4 billion in costs by the end of fiscal 2025. We estimate the bottom line to be $4.90 on an adjusted basis, reflecting 8% y-o-y growth. With the U.S. Fed expected to announce a rate cut now, consumer sentiment is expected to improve over the coming quarters. However, the broader markets will react to the quantum of the rate cut. A lower-than-expected rate cut will likely result in a correction. Curious about the impact of a market crash on FDX stock? Our dashboard How Low Can FedEx Stock Go In A Market Crash? has a detailed analysis of how the stock performed during and after previous market crashes. Looking at FDX stock now, we think it has little room for growth. We estimate FedEx’s Valuation to be $318 per share, reflecting an upside of less than 10% from its current levels of around $300. FDX stock is already trading at 14x forward expected adjusted earnings of $21.00 per share, which is aligned with the stock’s average P/E ratio seen over the last five years. Even if we look at a slightly longer term, FDX stock, with 15% gains since early 2021, has underperformed the broader markets. Its annual returns are considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Overall, we think FedEx will post an upbeat Q1, and it will likely have more positives to look forward to on the back of improving volumes and margin expansion. While much of this appears to be priced in, the stock could still see higher levels if the company were to raise its full-year outlook and the overall volume shows further signs of improvement. While FDX stock will react to its Q1 results, it is helpful to see how FedEx’s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

Title: FedEx stock target cut, retains hold rating on 1Q results
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/fedex-stock-target-cut-retains-hold-rating-on-1q-results-93CH-3625468

On Friday, Jefferies made an adjustment to its outlook on FedEx (NYSE:FDX) shares, reducing the price target on the company's shares to $275 from the previous $300, while keeping a Hold rating on the stock. The adjustment follows FedEx's recent earnings report, which revealed first-quarter earnings per share (EPS) for fiscal year 2025 that fell more than 25% below market expectations. This shortfall was attributed to weaker than anticipated margins in both the Federal Express and Freight segments. According to the financial firm, FedEx's adjusted operating profit saw a year-over-year decline of $380 million, or 24%. This significant drop was noted even though FedEx had realized $1.8 billion in cost savings last year from its DRIVE initiative. The DRIVE program was designed to increase efficiency and reduce operational costs across the company's various business units. The analysis further highlighted that the margin for the Federal Express segment was at its lowest since the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. The anticipated pressure on the second quarter's performance and a 20% downward revision of first-half EPS estimates have led to skepticism about FedEx's ability to meet the lower end of its EPS guidance for the year. The report from Jefferies suggests caution, indicating that the upcoming second quarter could present additional challenges for FedEx. The company's financial performance in the first half of the fiscal year has prompted a reassessment of its earnings potential, leading to the revised price target. Despite the cost-saving measures implemented by FedEx, the current financial results have not met the expectations set by previous forecasts. In other recent news, FedEx's financial performance has been the subject of various adjustments by financial firms. Susquehanna cut its price target for FedEx to $330, while maintaining a positive rating, following the company's first-quarter results for fiscal year 2025, which missed expectations with an adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $3.60. Similarly, Stifel revised its price target for FedEx to $321 from $327, maintaining a buy rating despite the company's underperformance. Baird also adjusted its price target for FedEx, reducing it to $320 from $340, but retained an outperform rating. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley downgraded FedEx stock from Equalweight to Underweight, reducing the price target to $200, citing FedEx's forecasted EPS for fiscal year 2025 as significantly below the guidance provided by FedEx's management. FedEx's first-quarter results showed a shift in the types of shipments it handled, impacting the company's blended yield and leading to higher costs associated with purchased transportation. However, the company's management indicated that cost savings are expected to increase sequentially throughout the year, with revenue management initiatives in place to mitigate the pressure on yields. FedEx is implementing the 'DRIVE' initiative as part of its restructuring plan, aimed at reducing costs and enhancing operational efficiency. These are all recent developments for FedEx, providing insights into the company's performance and strategic initiatives. Following Jefferies' revision of FedEx's price target, it's pertinent to consider additional insights from InvestingPro to gauge the company's financial health and market position. According to InvestingPro data, FedEx's market capitalization stands at $73.58 billion, with a P/E ratio of 17.26, indicating investor sentiment on its earnings potential. The company has experienced a revenue decline over the last twelve months as of Q4 2024, with a -2.73% change, yet it maintains a strong gross profit margin of 27.32%. InvestingPro Tips highlight that FedEx has consistently raised its dividend for the last three years and has maintained dividend payments for 23 consecutive years, showcasing its commitment to returning value to shareholders. Moreover, FedEx has shown a strong return over the last three months, with a price total return of 19.31%, and analysts predict the company will remain profitable this year. These factors underscore FedEx's resilience and the potential for long-term investor confidence. For those seeking further insights, there are additional InvestingPro Tips available, which provide deeper analysis into FedEx's performance and future outlook (https://www.investing.com/pro/FDX). These tips may offer valuable perspectives for investors considering FedEx's stock amidst the current market conditions. This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Title: What You Need To Know Ahead of FedEx's Earnings Thursday

UPDATE—Sept. 19, 2024: This article has been updated to reflect more recent analyst estimates and share price information. FedEx (FDX) is set to report fiscal 2025 first-quarter earnings after the bell Thursday, with analysts expecting the shipping giant to post year-over-year revenue and profit gains. Analysts polled by Visible Alpha expect net income of $1.16 billion on revenue of $21.95 billion, up from $1.08 billion and $21.68 billion, respectively, in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Analysts are largely optimistic about FedEx's stock, with 11 "buy" ratings and just "hold" and one "sell" rating apiece, according to Visible Alpha's database, with an average price target of $323.50, about 6% above Thursday's intraday price of $303.97. In its fourth-quarter report in June, FedEx introduced its projections for fiscal 2025. It guided low- to mid-single-digit revenue growth, while analysts expect growth of just over 2% from last year's $87.69 billion. The company also saw earnings per share (EPS) between $18.25 and $20.25, 6% to 18% better than the $17.21 generated in fiscal 2024, while analysts expect $19.87. FedEx will be losing out on one source of revenue later this month, when its contract with the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) officially ends and shipping rival UPS (UPS) takes over as the USPS' official air freight carrier. In April, FedEx said it was unable to reach "mutually agreeable terms" with the USPS, and said it planned to "implement adjustments" to its shipping network to adjust for the lost volume and further improve profitability. In April 2023, FedEx announced plans to restructure and cut an estimated $4 billion in costs by 2025. The plan largely has paid off, with FedEx mostly posting substantial profit improvements despite revenue declines or slight gains in recent quarters. FedEx looked to cut costs after shipping demand fell from its pandemic-fueled peak, with UPS also reporting revenue declines amid lower volumes. Last quarter, FedEx said it expected to cut about $2.2 billion in costs over fiscal 2025, up from $1.8 billion in fiscal 2024. FedEx Chief Customer Officer Brie Carere said in its June earnings call that the company expects "the demand environment to moderately improve as we move through the year." FedEx shares were up close to 2% in intraday trading Thursday, ahead of the company's earnings report after the bell. They've gained about 20% since the start of the year.

Title: The 75 Greatest Horror Movies of All Time

In Wes Craven’s “Scream” — not quite the definitive horror movie but certainly the definitive account of horror fandom — final girl Sidney famously responds to the question of whether she likes scary movies with a resounding no. “What’s the point? They’re all the same,” she says through the phone to the movie’s slasher. “Some stupid killer stalking some big-breasted girl who can’t act who is always running up the stairs when she should be running out the front door.” Her complaint acts as a clever joke about the stale state of the mainstream slasher genre that Craven was riffing on (and unintentionally revived) through his tongue-in-cheek meta spin. But it’s also a nod toward the less-than-flattering viewpoint that gatekeepers and non-horror aficionados have toward the genre, as a playground for cheap and easy B-movies and formulaic jump scares. Related Stories Carrie Coon on ‘His Three Daughters,’ the ‘Delicious’ Swagger of ‘Gilded Age,’ and Stamina-Testing ‘White Lotus’ ‘Apartment 7A’ Review: Julia Garner Channels Mia Farrow in a Classy ‘Rosemary’s Baby’ Prequel from the Director of ‘Relic’ Anyone who dives into the history of horror will know that that’s certainly not the case. Rooted in silent cinema classics like “The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari” and “The Phantom Carriage,” the horror genre encompasses campy creature features, exploitative shock fests, cerebral psychological terror, vomit-inducing flesh-and-spine-bursting Cronenberg creations, mournful ghost stories, modern “elevated horror,” and a dozen other microcategories beyond films about a stalker with a knife and a grudge. And that’s not to discount the slasher films that offer something rivetingly new and original. What makes a horror film a part of the genre thus has relatively little to do with its actual content and everything to do with what it provokes within its audience. Making a truly scary movie — one that burrows into your mind and delivers a sense of unease that can’t be forgotten — is a task that requires much more skill behind the camera than it is often given credit for, and the best horror movies have a craft to them that stands up to any auteur project or Oscar Best Picture winner. It’s no surprise that the genre has such a passionate, devoted following of film geeks that regularly turn out for new releases — when a horror movie is great, there’s no experience quite like it. In building IndieWire’s new list of the greatest horror movies ever made, we opted to omit some films that straddle the nebulous line between the horror and thriller genres (so you won’t find “The Silence of the Lambs” here, to get a particularly major example out of the way), at least for now. We paid attention to films that paved the way for the genre and for filmmaking as a whole, as well as to modern classics that bring something new and brilliant to the canon today. What every film on this list has in common is that their horrors are more than just boogeymen and spirits projected upon a silver screen, but a conduit into which deeper real-life fears are made manifest. From social discontent to primal fear of the unknown, horror is a genre that reflects on humanity’s most potent paranoia, and the eternal darkness that rests within us. Read on for our list of the 75 greatest horror movies ever made. With editorial contributions from Christian Blauvelt, Alison Foreman, Sarah Shachat, Ryan Lattanzio, Christian Zilko, Marcus Jones, Mark Peikert, Jim Hemphill, Marya Gates, Tambay Obenson, and Noel Murray. Ah, yes, it’s the anaphylactic skull “thwack” heard ‘round the world! Like a car wrapped around a telephone poll, “Hereditary” was so widely celebrated upon its release that the film’s sterling reputation has since become something of a cliché. For studio A24 and scads of so-called “elevated horror” fans — born out of the genre renaissance this film helped create — there’s Before Ari Aster and After Ari Aster. The filmmaker’s algebraic feature debut in 2018 was indeed a key turning point in horror’s reputation across Hollywood. It’s also an exquisite, stand-alone display of artistry that deserves to be assessed outside the history it inherited… pun intended. The unflappable Toni Collette deserved an Oscar for her “Hereditary” performance as Annie Graham, a miniatures artist grappling with complicated grief brought on by the death of her difficult mother, Ellen (Kathleen Chalfant). Her children, the oddball Charlie (Milly Shapiro) and her older brother Peter (Alex Wolff), have lived in the shadow of Annie and Ellen’s maternalistic trauma bond for as long as they can remember. With dad Steve (Gabriel Byrne) doing his best in the background, the family’s visible tension serves as an ideal startin... (truncated)

Title: China Is Rapidly Becoming a Leading Innovator in Advanced Industries

Time Published: 2024-09-16T23:29:18Z
Full Content:
There may be no more important question for the West’s competitive position in advanced industries than whether China is becoming a rival innovator. While the evidence suggests it hasn’t yet taken the overall lead, it has pulled ahead in certain areas, and in many others Chinese firms will likely equal or surpass Western firms within a decade or so. Contents Key Takeaways 1 Introduction. 2 Why This Matters 3 The Nature of Innovation Industries and Competitive Positioning 8 What Is Innovation? 12 The Asian Tiger Path. 13 Can China innovate? 16 Innovation Analysis 21 The Contrasting Western and Chinese Economic Models 65 How China Might Stall 110 How the United States Might Not Lose More. 111 What To Do? 112 Conclusion. 113 Endnotes 116 Perhaps the most critical question for the United States vis-à-vis China’s economic and technology challenge is whether China can become a real innovator. If China has difficulty becoming an innovator and remains largely a copier, then the threat to the United States and other allied technology economies is less. In this case, as long as the United States (and allies) can innovate at a robust-enough rate, they can likely maintain the lead on advanced technologies, even if China quickly copies foreign innovations. But if China can develop new-to-the-world innovations ahead of, or at the nearly the same time as, the United States and allied nations, its potential to displace U.S. (and allied) technology-based companies and capabilities becomes much more likely, especially because China benefits from significant economies of scale and a government laser focused on global best-in-class science and technology policy for competitiveness. To date, this issue has been widely discussed, but, with the exception of analysis of a variety of innovation input indicators (e.g., research article citations, research and development (R&D) personnel, patents, etc.), it has not been rigorously examined. To remedy that, the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF), with the support of the Smith Richardson Foundation, has conducted an analysis of the extent to which Chinese companies are innovating and already possess the capabilities to be global innovation leaders. Overall, we find that, for the most part, while Chinese firms and industries are not as innovative as the global leaders in Western nations (defined as developed, democratic nations), they are catching up, in many cases at an extremely rapid pace—and the scale of their efforts is massive.[1] As the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations wrote somewhat modestly in 2021, “China still has a not insignificant gap to close with the United States in the fields of science and technology, but the [Chinese] growth rate is rapid and there is potential for development.”[2] To use an analogy, it’s as if we were to look out at the ocean and see calm waves, but over the horizon is a tsunami of hundreds of strong, innovative, and lower-cost Chinese firms in dozens of industries seeking to grab global market share from established leaders. For the most part, while Chinese firms and industries are not as innovative as the global leaders in Western nations, they are catching up, in many cases at an extremely rapid pace—and the scale of their efforts is massive. These research findings suggest that it’s time to reject the often ideologically based view that “China can’t innovate.” While China is ruled by a communist party, China is not the Soviet Union, and its firms have considerable degrees of freedom to act, as long as they are working to achieve the goal of making China the world innovation leader. The reality is that China is much more akin to where the Asian Tigers (Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan) were 20 years ago, only in this case, China is not a tiger, but rather a fire-breathing dragon on government-provided steroids. China became the world’s manufacturing workshop on the basis of a combination of low costs, a large and rapidly growing domestic market, and aggressive efforts to recruit foreign manufacturers. While that process led to considerable manufacturing decline in the United States, most of it (with the exception of consumer electronics) was in more traditional industries such as plastics, metals, textiles and apparel, toys, and furniture.[3] While this was hard on the U.S. workers and communities that lost to China, it did not mean a significant weakening of U.S. techno-economic strength and dual-use (civilian and military) capabilities, particularly in U.S.-headquartered firms. And it certainly did not mean a high level of strategic dependency on China. If a conflict came, the worst that could happen would be no more McDonald’s Happy Meal toys. China is much more akin to where the Asian Tigers were 20 years ago, only in this case, China is not a tiger, but rather a fire-breathing dragon on government-provided steroids. However, the last decade has shown that China can be a globally compe... (truncated)

Time Published: 2024-09-16T07:56:21Z
Full Content:
NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The EstÃ©e Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE: EL) (the Company) today announced that it has received notice that TRC Capital Investment Corporation (TRC) commenced an unsolicited mini-tender offer to purchase up to 1,500,000 shares of the Company's Class A common stock, which represents approximately 0.64% of the outstanding Class A common stock, at a price of $83.65 per share in cash. The Company does not endorse TRC's unsolicited mini-tender offer and recommends that stockholders do not tender their shares because TRC's offer is at a price below the current market price for Class A common stock and is subject to numerous conditions. The Company is in no way associated with TRC, its mini-tender offer, or the mini-tender offer documents. Mini-tender offers seek to acquire less than 5% of a company's shares outstanding. Consequently, they can avoid many of the disclosure and procedural requirements of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules intended for the protection of stockholders, which would apply to offers for more than 5% of a company's shares. The SEC has cautioned investors that some bidders make mini-tender offers at below-market prices, hoping that they will catch investors off guard if the investors do not compare the offer price to the current market price and that investors may end up selling their securities at below-market prices. The SEC's guidance to investors on mini-tender offers is available at http://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/minitend.htm. TRC has made many similar unsolicited mini-tender offers for shares of other public companies at below market prices. Stockholders should obtain current market quotations for their shares, consult with their broker or financial advisor, and exercise caution with respect to TRC's mini-tender offer, including monitoring for any amendment by TRC of its offer. The Company recommends that stockholders who have not responded to TRC's offer take no action. According to TRC's offer documents, stockholders who have already tendered their shares may withdraw them by providing the notice described in the documents prior to the expiration of the offer, which is currently scheduled to occur on October 9, 2024. TRC may extend the offering period at its discretion. The Company encourages brokers and dealers, as well as other market participants, to review the SEC's letter regarding broker-dealer mini-tender offer dissemination and disclosure at http://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/minitenders/sia072401.htm. The Company requests that a copy of this press release be included with all distributions of materials relating to TRC's mini-tender offer related to shares of the Company's Class A common stock. About The EstÃ©e Lauder Companies The EstÃ©e Lauder Companies Inc. is one of the world's leading manufacturers, marketers and sellers of quality skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products, and is a steward of luxury and prestige brands globally.

Hoka sneakers are comfortable and supportive, but they come at a premium price. While many of the brand’s designs retail for $150 or more, you can get them for less by shopping some of our favorite Hoka deals below. Right now, you can score discounts on five women’s styles and six men’s styles, including 19% off our gear team’s pick for the best trail running shoe overall, the Hoka Speedgoat 5. You can save as much as 50% on a fresh pair of sneakers with this week's best Hoka deals. In addition to landing a spot on our list of the best trail running shoes, we also named a Hoka style one of the best shoes for standing all day. Whether you’re a walker, runner or simply looking for a colorful pair of sneakers to complement your athleisure, these are the best Hoka deals available right now. Hoka This sneaker is our gear team’s pick for the best trail running shoe overall. It’s comfortable with tons of cushion and lighter than the previous iteration. This discount is only available in three colorways, but a solid range of sizes. Hoka If you’re not sold on the Speedgoat 5, check out the Torrent 3, on sale for 20% off. The style is also designed for trail running, featuring a durable outsole, low-profile cushioning and neutral support. You can shop three colors at the moment, but sizing is limited. REI Avid hikers will appreciate this boot’s ample cushioning and Hubble heel design (for smoother heel-to-toe movement). The shoe is also waterproof and has a more streamlined aesthetic than your classic hiking boot. This discount is currently available in the color pictured above. Hoka We named the Hoka Arahi 7, which is designed to keep your feet from overpronating, the best cushioned sneaker for arch support (as well as the best stability running shoe for men). This discount is only available in the pictured colorway, but most sizes are still in stock. Dick's Sporting Goods Designed to balance cushion with a streamlined silhouette, this lightweight shoe is great for racing and daily runs. Four colors are currently on sale—some for even less—but the pictured colorway has the widest range of sizes available. Nordstrom You can find two colorways of the Mach 5 on sale for an impressive 44% off right now. (More colors are on sale for $112, if you don’t mind spending a bit more.) The lightweight shoe has a breathable mesh upper and low-profile cushion that gives it a snappy push-off that runners love. Hoka This streamlined sneaker is made for serious trail runners. It has a breathable, fitted upper that keeps debris out and a grippy sole that’s firm and low to the ground for better push-off. This discount is available directly from Hoka in six colors. Hoka As we mentioned in the women’s section above, this grippy and well-cushioned sneaker is our pick for the best trail running shoe overall. You can score the men’s version for 19% off in two colorways at the moment. Nordstrom Rack Designed for walking and running, this sneaker is breathable and super supportive without feeling overly heavy. The men’s Hoka Arahi 6 is currently on sale in three colorways, though the pictured combination has the widest selection of sizes. Dick's Sporting Goods The sneaker has a thick lug sole that’s extra grippy on the pavement and great for trail running. If you like the blue-and-yellow colorway above, it’s currently on sale for 25% off when you add the shoe to your cart. (This style is also on sale in two other colorways directly from Hoka for a slightly lesser discount. ) Nordstrom Rack Designed for racers, the Carbon X 3 has a meta-rocker sole for extra propulsion and a neutral, streamlined fit. This deal is currently available in two colors, both with a solid array of sizes to choose from. Hoka rarely offers sitewide sales. That said, its sale section is often stocked with older designs for as much as 40% off. You can also typically find deals on Hoka sneakers from third-party retailers like REI and Dick’s Sporting Goods. Yes, select Hoka styles have been awarded the podiatric APMA Seal of Acceptance. This means podiatrists have reviewed the shoes and agreed that a number of Hoka’s cushioned designs are beneficial to overall foot health. Our editors named the Hoka Clifton 9 sneaker the best cushioned walking shoe for women and the best men’s walking shoe for flat feet. The style is plush and supportive without feeling overly bulky. But they won’t work for everyone—the best walking shoe for you depends on a variety of factors, including how high your arches are and how you walk. For instance, we recommend skipping the Hoka Clifton 9 if you have especially narrow feet. The brand recommends replacing your Hokas between 250 and 500 miles, depending on individual wear. Pay attention to signs like increased muscle fatigue, uneven wear patterns and discomfort to identify when it’s time to trade in an older pair. Hokas have been popularized online for their outstanding comfort and support. They have a super-plush midsole that helps with shock ab... (truncated)

The Wall Street Journal noted last week that American shareholders will lose tens of billions of dollars in investment income from their stock holdings in Silicon Valley companies like Google and Apple if several European Union sham lawsuits prevail.The EU’s courts outrageously ruled this week that Apple shareholders owe Europe 13.5 billion euros in back taxes because the company took advantage of Ireland’s low 12.5% tax rate. The EU “competition chief” declared that this sham court decision “is a big win for European citizens and tax justice.” No, it’s a big win for big government.Google shareholders are now forced to pay the EU $2.7 billion because its search engine has become dominant in the European market. The European search engines are so inferior that nobody wants to use them. So, sue American companies.Let’s be clear here: The EU laggards are simply green with envy. The Eurozone has been crushed by American tech dominance. No company in socialist Europe has found a way to compete with American innovation at Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta and so on. Since they can’t compete, they invent sore-loser lawsuits.The bigger issue is why the Biden administration isn’t defending American companies from European extortion. These tech lawsuits are a tax on American knowhow and innovation. Instead of defending American shareholders from the EU predators, the Biden regulators give legitimacy to the foreign courts. How can the U.S. government complain against specious antitrust attacks against Google and Apple when our own regulators at the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department are bringing copycat lawsuits against our tech giants in U.S. courts?The capricious fine against Google is a result of an American company shopping around the globe to find the lowest tax climate (Ireland) for doing business. This is illegal? Our corporate tax rate thanks to the Trump tax cut is now 21%, down from 35% under former President Barack Obama. But President Joe Biden and now presidential candidate Kamala Harris want to raise it back up to 28% or more. That only encourages more jobs and investment to move offshore. Did I mention that Ireland’s rate is just 12.5%?Instead of lowering the rates here, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen wants to force Ireland and other low-tax countries to raise their rates to a global minimum tax of 15% or more.Similarly, antitrust lawsuits from Europe and Washington aimed at American tech companies are spurious because nearly every price for tech services — from cellphones to drone deliveries to internet searches to fiber optic hookups — has been falling. How are consumers getting gouged if they keep paying less? I often don’t like the politics of Big Tech. But the end result of what Washington is doing to penalize American tech giants for building a better mousetrap is to move the high-tech hubs of the world — from Silicon Valley to Austin to Boston to Miami — to competitor nations. That’s a good way to lose jobs and put America last.Stephen Moore is a cofounder of Unleash Prosperity. He is also an economic advisor to the Trump campaign. The EU’s courts outrageously ruled this week that Apple shareholders owe Europe 13.5 billion euros in back taxes because the company took advantage of Ireland’s low 12.5% tax rate.

Title: LVMH's Bernard Arnault has gone from the world's richest person to flirting with 5th place after a $54 billion wipeout
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/lvmh-bernard-arnault-wealth-rich-list-billionaires-luxury-musk-bezos-2024-9
Time Published: 2024-09-19T11:51:59Z
Full Content:
Bernard Arnault was the richest person on the planet six months ago; now he's flirting with fifth place. Arnault is the founder and CEO of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the French luxury-goods behemoth. In late March, he was worth an estimated $231 billion, ranking him ahead of Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos at the top of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The fashion tycoon's fortune has shrunk by $54 billion since then to $177 billion at Wednesday's close. That places him fourth and only $1 billion ahead of the Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison. Arnault's net worth has tanked by $30 billion this year, making him the biggest wealth loser among the 500 individuals on Bloomberg's list. He's also the only person among the 18 richest people who's in the red for 2024; the others have all gained at least $14 billion and as much as $63 billion. Forbes' wealth rankings tell a similar story: Arnault has dropped from first place, with a $233 billion net worth on March 8, to fifth, with a $175 billion fortune, behind Musk, Bezos, Ellison, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The wealth hit for the "Wolf in Cashmere" reflects a 16% slump in LVMH's stock price to its lowest level in two years. Arnault owns about 48% of the luxury conglomerate, which houses around 75 brands, including Tiffany & Co., Louis Vuitton, Dom Perignon, and Sephora. LVMH shares have been hit by the company's troubles. It struggled in the first half of this year with underlying revenues inching up only 2% and income from recurring operations sliding 8%. Underlying profits tanked 26% in the wines and spirits business, 19% in watches and jewelry, and 6% in the key fashion and leather goods segment. Arnault also warned of a "climate of economic and geopolitical uncertainty" in the earnings release. Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported last month that Sephora was slashing its 4,000-person workforce in China by 10% to weather a challenging local market. The luxury industry boomed after the pandemic as travel resumed and pent-up shopping demand was released. But it has struggled more recently as historic inflation, steeper interest rates, and recession fears have tempered demand even among wealthy consumers. Jump to

Title: Are Europe’s Too-Big-To-Fail Banks About to Get Even Bigger?
URL: https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2024/09/are-europes-too-big-to-fail-banks-about-to-get-even-bigger.html
Time Published: 2024-09-20T10:45:44Z
Full Content:
As two potential big bank mergers — both hostile, one cross-border — hang in the balance, Mario Draghi and the editorial boards of the FT and Bloomberg call for a fresh round of European bank consolidation. The last time two large banks merged in Europe was in March 2023, when a reluctant UBS took over its failing domestic rival, Credit Suisse. The fast-moving fallout from the bank collapses in the US had tipped the chronically mismanaged Credit Suisse over the edge. The resulting shotgun merger was Europe’s first ever tie-up between two officially Too-Big-to-Fail lenders, and while it may have steadied the ship, for now, it also served as a timely reminder that, to quote Satyajit Das, strong capital and liquidity ratios count for little when panicked depositors take flight. Fast forward to today, two proposed bank mergers — both hostile, one cross-border — hang in the balance. In the first, Italy’s second largest bank, Unicredit, is looking to take over Germany’s second largest, Commerzbank. Both lenders were in dire straits just a few years ago, with Unicredit even losing its status as a global systemically important bank (G-SIB), but appear to have more or less stabilised since then. In the second, Spain’s second largest bank, BBVA, seeks to buy out its domestic rival, Banco Sabadell. Thinning the Herd Both mergers have been tried before, with no success, but that doesn’t prevent them from being tried again. In the case of BBVA’s proposed takeover of Sabadell, it faces strong opposition from the national government in Madrid, but it has received the blessing of the European Central Bank, which has long favoured thinning the herd of banking players in the Euro Area. For its part, Unicredit has solicited ECB approval to own up to 30% of Commerzbank, potentially triggering a full buyout deal. The answer from the ECB is likely to be “yes”. Senior ECB representatives have persistently sought to reduce the number of small and mid-sized banks in the Euro Area. In September 2017, Daniele Nouy, the then-Chair of the ECB’s Supervisory Board, partly blamed the low profitability of large lenders on the fierce competition from smaller banks. Rather than lots of competition between domestic banks, what Europe needs, Nouy said, are “brave banks” that are willing to traverse borders and conquer new territory. Current ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos recently reiterated this position: “We are looking for an integrated European market, we lack the single deposit guarantee fund, which we are in favour of. And I think that the less cracked and fragmented the system is, in terms of national barriers, the more economies of scale can increase, boosting competition. Having large European banks is a fundamental part of this. European integration is stagnant and I think this would help spur it along.” It may just do that, but the consequences are likely to be dire for Europe’s sclerotic economies. As the German economist and small bank activist Richard Werner warns, economies with fewer and bigger banks will lend less and less to small firms, which tends to mean that productive credit creation that produces jobs, prosperity and no inflation, also declines, and credit creation for asset purchases, causing asset bubbles, or credit creation for consumption, causing inflation, become more dominant.” In other words, more financialisation, less productive activity. In the eurozone, more than 5,000 banks have already disappeared since the ECB started business a little over two decades ago, according to Werner. And the central bank is determined to continue, if not intensify, this process. In his recent report for the Commission on the state of EU competitiveness, former ECB Governor Mario Draghi blames European banks’ lower profitability and lending capacity vis-a-vis their US counterparts on their lack of scale. And the main reason for that lack of scale, he says, is “the [EU’s] incomplete Banking Union.” The document argues that “a minimal step towards completing the Banking Union would be to create a separate jurisdiction for European banks with substantial cross-border operations that would be ‘country blind’ from the regulatory, supervisory and crisis management viewpoints.” In other words, a partial banking union for the EU’s largest cross-border lenders. According to Bloomberg columnist Paul j Davies, “It’s a minimal reform that would need single, EU-level deposit insurance and resolution schemes for just the top 20 or so lenders”. The idea already enjoys the full-throated support of Bloomberg and the FT. In an op-ed on Wednesday, Bloomberg‘s editorial board averred that “UniCredit’s Takeover Bid Should Be Welcomed by Europe.” Such a merger, they claim, could pave the way to “the financial union both Germany and Europe desperately need,” creating a bank that will be among the largest on the continent, with a bigger balance sheet and domestic revenues than Deutsche bank. Faced with such a threat, Deutsche Bank has threatened to ... (truncated)

The Dividend Guy Blog Unconventional Lifestyle and Dividend Growth Strategy Blog, Dividend Income Report / September 19, 2024 by DivGuy / Leave a Comment In 2016, I made a life-changing decision: I took a sabbatical, put my family in a small RV, and drove to Costa Rica. Upon my return in 2017, I officially quit my job as a private banker at National Bank and started working full-time on my baby: Dividend Stocks Rock. I also decided to manage my pension account held at the National Bank. I’ve built this portfolio publicly since 2017 to make a real-life case study. I decided to invest 100% of this money in dividend growth stocks. In August 2017, I received $108,760.02 in a locked retirement account. This means I can’t add capital to the account, and growth is only generated through capital gains and dividends. I don’t report this portfolio’s results to brag about my returns or to tell you to follow my lead. I just want to share how I manage my portfolio monthly with all the good and the bad. I hope you can learn from my experience. This month, I couldn’t help discussing BCE. Let’s start with the numbers as of September 5th 2024 (before the bell): Original amount invested in September 2017 (no additional capital added): $108,760.02. Total return since inception (Sep 2017 – August 2024): 150.27% Annualized return (since September 2017 – 83 months): 14.18% SPDR® S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) annualized return (since Sept 2017): 13.62% (total return 141.80%) iShares S&P/TSX 60 ETF (XIU.TO) annualized return (since Sept 2017): 9.27% (total return 84.60%) I’m sorry for the strong title. I had to make it crystal clear and get your attention: I’ve never been a fan of BCE, which I always saw as a deluxe bond: a stock that pays a good yield with a good dividend growth policy, but where I don’t expect much stock price appreciation over time. That’s how BCE compares advantageously to a bond: capital stability with better income growth expectations. So, what do we do when the capital isn’t that stable and the dividend growth policy is reduced from 5% to 3%? We do a deep dive into the financials. I’m often asked by members to bring you all with me on this journey into financial statements. In general, I don’t read financial statements from cover to cover. I only do a deep dive when I have questions that don’t have self evident answers. I’m doing this analysis of BCE to find out what will happen with the dividend in 2025. I have summarized my thoughts in the video below, but strongly encourage you to read the complete article. So, let’s start the journey with the elephant in the room… Telcos are capital-intensive. It means they must spend considerable amounts of money to maintain and improve their networks. They will go through periods where they borrow more money than they generate because those investments will generate profit in the future. That’s like obtaining a large mortgage in your 20s with the anticipation that you will increase your salary over time. You take the loan now, and you bank on your ability to generate stronger cash flow in the future. Let’s take a look at what the long-term debt looks like in BCE’s 2023 annual statement first: This chart tells us two things. What the chart doesn’t tell us is what is going on this year so far (we have 2 more quarters to know where this story is going). Let’s take a look at the most recent numbers. I’ll start by looking at the total long-term debt trend for the past 10 years to see where we were, and where we are going. As you can see, we are not going in the right direction. Since 2017, BCE has been on a streak of securing more and more debt. As I’ve discussed this topic before, the point was to obtain inexpensive debt and invest massively in BCE’s network. The good old adage of “you need to spend money to make money”. That’s true… until it isn’t. It all depends on the cost of your debt and the quality of your investments. We will initially focus on the cost of the debt, and we will discuss the results of those investments (cash flow generation) later on. I’ve pulled the latest quarterly update for BCE’s debt. My focus on the next chart is how much of that debt will come to maturity in the next 12 months. It is true that interest rates are a bit lower now than they were 6 months ago. However, Moody’s (a credit rating agency) recently downgraded BCE to one notch above the level of junk bonds (to Baa3 from Baa2). This will not help BCE secure better borrowing rates in the coming months. I’d like to draw your attention to the amount of debt up for renewal in the next 12 months (between June 30th 2024 and June 30th 2025). That’s 17% of BCE’s debt that will cost more than it was before. Speaking of interest charges, it’s also out of control. From its latest quarterly earnings report, BCE shows interest expense up by 19% Q2 2024 vs Q2 2023 and up 20% ytd 2024 vs ytd 2023. So, over the past 12 months, the interest expenses increased by roughly 20%. I was curious to know which portio... (truncated)

Title: Oracle’s Larry Ellison Is Now the World’s 3rd Richest Person Thanks to the A.I. Boom

Larry Ellison, the founder and chairman of software giant Oracle, is the latest tech entrepreneur to reap the rewards of the A.I. boom. The billionaire is currently the world’s third wealthiest person and briefly surpassed Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos as the second richest person this week (behind Elon Musk). A recent Oracle stock surge has sent Ellison’s net worth soaring to an estimated $203.5 billion. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. Fueling Ellison’s good fortune is an unprecedented demand for data centers, which power the A.I. models underpinning products like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Oracle beat Wall Street’s expectations earlier this month when it reported a 7 percent year-over-year increase in quarterly revenue to $13.3 billion, with the company’s cloud services revenue skyrocketing by 21 percent to $5.6 billion. The news has been a booster for Oracle’s share price, which has soared more than 47 percent in the past 12 months and almost doubled since the beginning of 2023. Oracle currently has 162 data centers in operation and under construction globally, Ellison told analysts during a recent earnings call, adding that he expects the company to eventually have 1,000 to 2,000 of these facilities. The company’s largest data center is 800 megawatts and will contain “acres” of Nvidia (NVDA)’s graphics processing units (GPUs) to train A.I. models, he said. Nvidia’s GPUs have been in high demand as Big Tech races to deploy A.I. products. During an Oracle financial analyst meeting on Sept. 12, Ellison described a dinner with Elon Musk and Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, where the Oracle head and Musk were “begging” Jensen for more A.I. chips. “Please take our money. No, take more of it. You’re not taking enough, we need you to take more of it,” recalled Ellison, who said the strategy worked. Oracle also recently bolstered its database power by partnering up with Amazon’s cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS). The deal, which will allow customers to access Oracle’s database offerings within AWS, follows a slew of similar cloud partnerships the company has struck with the likes of Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOGL). “We believe our cloud partnerships with AWS and Microsoft and Google will turbocharge the growth of our database business for years to come,” said Ellison during the earnings call. Ellison, 80, co-founded Oracle in 1977 and helmed the company as CEO until 2014. He also recently made headlines for his financial backing of the acquisition of Paramount (PARA) by Skydance, a media company founded by his son David Ellison. He reportedly is set to have an influential role in the takeover as a major shareholder. But for the time being, the billionaire appears to be firmly stationed on A.I.—and he has grand ambitions for the new technology. In addition to generative A.I.’s potential to help spot forest fires and identify agricultural output needs via drones, he lauded the ability of A.I.-enabled cameras to enhance surveillance while speaking at Oracle’s financial analyst meeting. “Citizens will be on their best behavior because we’re constantly recording and reporting everything that’s going on,” he noted. Police officers, meanwhile, will be supervised at all times, with body cameras prepared to alert the appropriate authorities of any misconduct. “The world is going to be a better place as we exploit these opportunities and take advantage of this great technology,” he added. But who will take advantage first remains up in the air. “There’s really one winner. Someone’s going to be better at this than anyone else, and multiple people are trying,” said Ellison of the A.I. boom, likening the technology arms race to “Formula 1.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: The 3 Best Big Closed-End Funds Of 2024

Businessman analyzes the graph of trend market growth in 2024 Sometimes as income investors we face a situation that sounds like a good problem to have: We have to pick among a group of very impressive investments! That’s obviously much tougher than, say, picking between a stock or fund with a winning record and another with a losing one. But when you think about the investment choices you’ve made over the years, I think you’ll find that picking between options that seem equally good is actually what you’ve had to do most of the time. To get into how to make a call when you face this situation, we’re going to use my favorite high-income plays: closed-end funds (CEFs), which routinely yield 8%+. That way I can show you what I do to come to that perfect (or as close to perfect as possible!) mix of high, safe dividends, potential upside and overall investment quality. On the surface, the three funds we’ll look at below will all look great to many income investors. Here’s why: Granted, these features all sound perfect, so you could be forgiven if your first instinct is to just buy all three of these funds. But if we dig into the details, we find that there is, in fact, a clear winner here. Our three CEFs boast the strongest performance in the space this year. They are: the Kayne Anderson Energy Infrastructure Fund (KYN), Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Diversified Equity Fund (ETY) and General American Investors Co. (GAM). As you can see below, they’ve absolutely soared since January 1: 3 CEFs Soar 2024 And when we dig into their stats, we see they have what it takes to back up that run: 3 CEFs As you can see, each fund offers a big yield and a steep discount (except ETY, though its 3.8% discount is still pretty respectable). And look at the “yield on NAV” column. That’s the yield as calculated on the fund’s NAV, not the discounted market price. That’s part of the magic of CEFs: The yield on NAV is lower than the yield on market price (or the yield we get, in other words), making the payout easier for management to cover. All right, this all sounds good so far. But we’re no closer to making our choice. Well, maybe we are, actually, because if we zoom out to the past decade, we see that one fund of these three is a clear winner on the performance side of things. KYN Lags While ETY and GAM have posted strong total returns, up 184% and 166%, respectively, KYN is down a lot. So despite the strong return KYN posted this year, this fund is not a long-term hold. That makes sense: KYN holds oil and energy-related infrastructure firms, and energy is a cyclical industry that rises and falls with volatile oil and gas prices. So KYN makes sense if you’re bullish on oil, which was a good place to be at the start of 2024, with oil rising throughout the year, defying expectations. But the trick with this fund is that you’ll need to sell (and likely quickly) when expectations for oil get too hot. That makes KYN a good short-term play that gets you a nice 8.2% dividend yield as you wait for oil to reach the price you expect it to get to. At my CEF Insider service, however, we focus on holding funds for the long term, so we can collect their income over years instead of weeks or months. And that’s why ETY and GAM, despite the former’s smaller discount and the latter’s smaller yield, make more sense for us. So we’re down to two funds. But which is worth buying now? Again, going by a quick glance, GAM’s bigger discount makes it look more appealing. But look at this chart: GAM Big Discount We see that GAM’s 14.9% discount (the orange line) is actually smaller than the 16.3% it’s averaged over the last decade, so it isn’t as much of a deal as it appears to be. In fact, GAM could see price declines as its discount reverts to the average. What’s more, as you can see in the purple line above, ETY trades at premiums every so often, making its relatively humble 3.8% discount look better. That’s especially true since ETY has slightly outperformed GAM over the last decade, with that 184% to 166% total return we saw earlier. Plus, ETY yields more! With an 8.4% yield on market price, it’s actually the most generous of these three funds. However, there is one thing we need to keep in mind: ETY invests in a lot of household-name large-cap stocks like Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Walmart (WMT), then writes call options on those stocks to generate income it uses to help fund its payout. That strategy does tend to slow overall returns, as a fund’s best performers get sold or “called away.” But management has successfully navigated that, throttling its call-option sales in a timely way to minimize that drag. The result: that 184% total return over the last decade—and that superior 8.4% dividend, too. Taken together, ETY has a well-rounded collection of strengths that put it above GAM and KYN. And there are plenty of other CEFs out there that do, too, paying outsized dividends—the average yield across CEFs is 8.2%—and even paying us every month inst... (truncated)

Microsoft (MSFT) shares logged their seventh consecutive higher close on Tuesday, with the latest gains coming after the company hiked its quarterly dividend by 10% and approved a $60 billion stock buyback. Bullish sentiment may carry into Wednesday after the tech giant and the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, announced plans late Tuesday to launch a $30 billion artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure fund to build data centers and energy projects aimed at meeting the growing demands for the technology’s computing power. The fund, which will mobilize up to $100 billion in total investment potential when including debt financing, includes Abu Dhabi-backed investment company MGX as a partner, while AI heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) plans to contribute expertise. Below, we’ll take a closer look at Microsoft’s chart and turn to technical analysis to identify important price levels to watch out for. Since bottoming just below the closely watched 200-day moving average (MA) in early August, Microsoft shares traded mostly sideways before resuming another move higher earlier this month. However, it’s worth noting the stock’s recent advance has occurred on declining trading volume, indicating a lack of participation from larger market participants. Moreover, the price may potentially be carving out a head and shoulders top, a chart formation that predicts a bullish-to-bearish trend reversal. Microsoft shares gained 0.9% on Tuesday to close at $435.15. Looking ahead, it’s worth keeping an eye on four key price levels that investors will likely be watching. If the shares continue rising, they could initially meet overhead resistance around $448, where traders who bought earlier this month may look for exit points near a trendline that connects a period of narrow consolidation in June with a minor countertrend peak in July. A move above this level could see the shares retest the $468 area, where they would likely encounter selling pressure around their all-time high (ATH) set in early July. A breakout though this area would invalidate a head and shoulders formation. Amid share price weakness, investors should keep a close eye on the $410 area, a location on the chart just below the rising 200-day MA where the price finds support from a horizontal line linking a series of comparable trading levels from late January through to this month. Ongoing selling could trigger a decline to around $385, a region where bulls may look for buying opportunities near the November swing high and August swing low. A breakdown below this levels would confirm a head and shoulders formation on Microsoft’s chart. The comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

BEIJING, CHINA - SEPTEMBER 16, 2024 - Visitors visit the booth of Tesla at the 2024 China Beijing ... [+] International Fair for Trade in Services (CIFTIS) in Beijing, China, September 16, 2024. (Photo credit should read CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images) China has emerged as the biggest growth market for electric vehicles (EVs), with nearly a third of all vehicles sold in the country being electric, compared to less than 10% in the U.S. However, EV bellwether Tesla faces considerable challenges from Chinese EV makers who are rapidly gaining ground. Although China remains Tesla’s largest market outside the U.S., Tesla’s recent performance in the country has been underwhelming. From January to August, Tesla delivered about 388,000 vehicles in China, largely flat compared to the previous year. This contrasts sharply with the broader Chinese EV market, which is expected to grow by close to 30% this year, suggesting that Tesla is losing market share. Tesla’s share of the Chinese New Energy Vehicles market—which includes plug-in hybrids, fuel cell vehicles, and battery electric vehicles—fell from 9% to 6.5% in the first seven months of this year, according to Shanghai-based consultancy Automobility. More broadly, the rise of Chinese EV makers threatens Tesla’s position not only in China but globally. With a mixed performance in China and the overall slowdown in the global EV market, the performance of TSLA stock with respect to the index over the last 3-year period has been quite volatile. Returns for the stock were 50% in 2021, -65% in 2022, and 102% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. There are over 100 EV brands in China that cover a broad range of the EV spectrum. Several premium models from the likes of Nio and Li Auto - which offer high-tech interiors and range extender generators - go head to head with Tesla’s offerings such as the Model Y and 3. Moreover, Chinese automakers have also been able to churn out compelling vehicles priced at as low as $10,000 to 15,000. In essence, they’ve done what Musk and Tesla have only dreamed about but have been unable to deliver. China has the advantage of having a massive EV ecosystem- that spans from motors and drivetrains to battery manufacturing and increasingly compelling software engineering and semiconductor competence. Given the rising competitive pressures in the EV market, should you Drop Tesla and pick these AI and auto component stocks As Chinese competitors strengthen, another question arises: Could they not only surpass Tesla in EV sales but also dominate the future of autonomous driving? Tesla has thus far been viewed as a leader in developing self-driving technology. The company’s vehicles have logged a total of 1.6 billion miles with its full-self driving software engaged, giving its machine-learning algorithms considerable strength. However, this may not be enough given that Tesla is losing out in the Chinese autonomous driving market. Tesla is facing delays in rolling out its Full Self-Driving software in China as local regulators have not authorized the technology yet, citing worries about accidents involving Tesla’s software in the U.S. and also due to potential data security issues. Separately, Tesla hasn’t been permitted to transfer driving data from China to the U.S. to train its self-driving models. Chinese carmakers, on the other hand, have government approval and offer more advanced driver-assistance features compared to what Tesla is presently allowed to equip its vehicles within the Chinese market. This could put the company at a handicap. On the other hand, with their low prices, innovative designs, and luxury features, the Chinese could put more cars on the road and potentially improve their competence in the autonomous vehicle space where data is king. More cars on the road means more self-driving miles, more data, and more learning - could that help Chinese EV makers open an insurmountable lead in driverless cars that would mean they’d gain even more share over the auto industry much as the Japanese - Toyota, and Honda - did 40 years ago. In addition, more scale will mean even more economies of scale and that is just how the automotive industry has been. Did you know that Tesla has a fast-growing Clean Energy business. Could It help derisk the company’s auto business? Despite the growing dominance of Chinese EV makers, Tesla has a couple of advantages that could help it navigate these challenges. Tesla continues to benefit from its manufacturing footprint in China. Tesla’s Shanghai is the largest, boasting the capacity to produce over 950,000 Model 3 and Model Y cars annually. By comparison, Tes... (truncated)

© 2024 Bloomberg Finance LP Charles Schwab ranks among the top 10 in the largest fund families for total net assets. The financial services firm has more than 50 years of history and presents ample opportunity for all investors to gain exposure to the markets. Of the 22 years I spent in my former life as an investment advisor, nearly all of it was with Schwab as my firm’s custodian. And while that is a separate (institutional) division versus the one we are talking about in this article, I did get a good sense of how this major player across the wealth spectrum operates. And, while the usual disclaimer applies, that “top” is a subjective term when investment products are the topic, I sorted through the range of index funds offered by Schwab and identified a few that I personally am most comfortable with. Each investor ultimately decides that for themselves, of course. Through simple, and cost-effective index funds, investors have plenty of outlets and information to seek the right fit when allocating their capital. Let’s take a deeper dive deeper into a few of this firm’s index fund offerings, and explain my rationale for choosing them for this short list. While I generally believe that the “cost” of investing is over-emphasized in a lot of ETF and mutual fund research, when it comes to funds that track a broad, liquid market index like the S&P 500, I get it. The main difference between otherwise identical funds is how much the fund company extracts for themselves. My opinion is that once we get outside of that investment area to funds that have other purposes, such as hedging risk and diversification beyond traditional stock and investments, expense ratios are less of a concern than finding a fund that can get that job done. The biggest “cost” to investors over time, unless they live through a lifetime of bull markets, is suffering steep losses in bad markets that take years to recover from. But these are the former type of investment, so costs are key. Schwab is known for its low fees and commissions. Many of its investment products, such as ETFs and mutual funds, have no transaction fees, and they were among the first large brokerages to eliminate standard commissions on stocks and ETFs. They also often offer lower expense ratios compared to other firms. But before anyone thinks that Schwab, Vanguard and their index peers are non-profit organizations, understand that there are other sources of revenue that allow them to offer some funds at zero or near zero expense ratio and “no commissions.” Schwab is the fifth-largest ETF provider in the U.S., with more than $342 billion in assets under management (AUM). They offer a wide array of investment products. In the index fund realm, they can accommodate many levels of diversification, and access many corners of the globe. Charles Schwab is well regarded for its user friendly platforms and extensive educational and research tools to help investors make informed decisions. Much more than breaking news, our diverse reporting digs deeper with unparalleled insights that empower you to make better informed decisions. Become a Forbes member and unlock unlimited access to cutting-edge strategies, actionable insights, and updated analysis from our network of leading finance experts. My objective here was to go beyond the usual with the Schwab universe. I stuck with ETFs, as I feel that for investors who are cost-sensitive, ETFs structurally are designed to keep taxes and other investment management inefficiencies to a minimum versus index mutual funds. Here is a quick table showing a few key statistics on the three ETFs I am highlighting. Below I offer more detail on each of them. Data source: YCharts Recent Share Price: $84.15 Sector/Industry: Diversified across sectors, with high dividend emphasis Weighted Average Market Cap: $130 billion P/E Ratio: 17.1 Total Holdings: 103 I follow dividend ETFs quite closely in my research, and am a dividend investor at heart. So while SCHD is a solid peer among others in the dividend ETF space, I am quite surprised that it has blown through the $50 billion mark in assets. I see it as competitive within that peer group, but not the best. This is the power of a big firm like Schwab at work. SCHD seeks to track the performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index, which includes 100 high dividend yielding U.S. stocks with a history of consistent dividend payments. The goal is to provide investors with exposure to dividend-paying equities while aiming for long-term capital appreciation. Uncertainty with interest rates, big company earnings, elections and geopolitical turmoil all contribute to the relative attractiveness of dividend stocks versus higher growth stocks. SCHD has had 12 consecutive years of dividend growth, which can act as a decent cushion in tough phases of the market cycle. While involving nearly every sector, SCHD focuses on high quality U.S companies that are typically larger in size. The stocks in this fund hav... (truncated)

Title: Rates to plunge to 2.75pc next year, says HSBC
URL: https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/rates-plunge-2-75pc-next-172625383.html
Time Published: 2024-09-20T17:26:25Z

The Bank of England could cut interest rates to 2.75pc next year, analysts have suggested, amid growing confidence that the worst of Britain’s inflationary crisis is over. Policymakers are likely to cut interest rates at November’s meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) and then again at every meeting next year from February, according to analysts from HSBC. It follows a decision by the Bank of England’s MPC earlier this week to keep rates on hold at 5pc. The Bank Rate had surged as high as 5.25pc following a series of rises over the past few years to try keep a lid on inflation. Last month, the Bank of England cut interest rates for the first time in four years. The analysts at HSBC said: “Part of the slightly better medium-term growth outlook reflects monetary policy. “With most indicators pointing to a cooling in the labour market, we and BoE have become more confident that the worst of the inflation pressures - and the risk of them becoming entrenched - is behind us. Given this, the current policy rate looks some way above neutral.” They said the latest statement from the Monetary Policy Committee suggested that rate setters were not in “the mood to move quickly”. However, the analysts said: “Given our own forecast that CPI inflation will rise back to 2.9pc by January next year (perhaps a touch above the Bank of England’s expectation), it might be February before the MPC has sufficient confidence for back-to-back rate cuts taking Bank Rate to 2.75pc in December next year.” HSBC suggested rates would then remain on hold throughout 2026.

You go to Sweden or to the Netherlands and you can hardly pay with a banknote - they send you off, bring your phone, don’t you have another way to pay?” The ECB President is looking into creating a central bank digital currency, but said citizens are worried about the privacy of the system. “The main concern people have is privacy - Big Brother is going to see where I spend my money,” she told an audience at the International Monetary Fund in Washington. “You know what, there are a few Big Brothers when you use your bank account or when you use other devices who know where you are spending your money, know what you are interested in and will send you instantly all those ads and nice proposals. “But the concern about the state - the assumption is the central bank will communicate all information collected to the state - will be privy to how you spend your money is something that is very very critical for citizens.” In her lecture to the IMF, Ms Lagarde warned that the inflation shock may not be a one-off. “If we enter an era where inflation is more volatile and monetary policy transmission more uncertain, maintaining this deep anchor for price formation will be essential,” she said, referring to the expectation among households and businesses that central banks will always raise interest rates to crush inflation. She also compared the 2020s to the 1920s, citing similarities including pandemics, a reversal of globalisation, and rapid technological progress. But she also raised the hope that central banks have learned their lesson from that era and should be able to avoid the “series of wrong turns” which tipped much of the world into the Great Depression. The Federal Reserve’s big interest rate cut this week is not a sign that the US economy is “falling behind,” Fed governor Christopher Waller said in an interview this afternoon. He told CNBC: It’s not about reacting to, or falling behind or anything like that. I do not believe we’re behind. Mr Waller was responding to arguments that the central bank should not do a half percentage point rate cut - instead opting for a smaller reduction - as this would be a sign of economic weakness. Citing a speech he made earlier this year, Mr Waller stressed that the Fed could cut rates even if the economy was doing fine. “And that’s the position we’re in,” he said, noting that inflation is cooling while the labour market remains solid. Central banks face a “difficult balancing act” as they start lowering interest rates around the world in the face of falling inflation, the head of the IMF said at an event this afternoon. Central banks on both sides of the Atlantic have cut rates this year, with the US Federal Reserve reducing its key lending rate by half a percentage point earlier this week in a bid to boost demand, following in the footsteps of the European Ce...

Tech stocks pulled back in early trading Friday, hitting the brakes on the market’s rally in the wake of the Federal Reserve’s supersized rate cut this week. The S&P 500 was down about 0.4% Friday after hitting record highs Thursday, with the energy and industrials sectors leading broad-based declines and its tech sector down about 0.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 0.6%. Semiconductor stocks including Onsemi (ON), ASML (ASML), and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), were among the stocks leading losses on the major indexes, pulling the PHLX Semiconductor Index down 2%. The Magnificent 7 stocks were mixed. AI darling Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) lost ground, while Meta Platforms (META) and Alphabet (GOOGL) were slightly higher. Apple (AAPL) advanced as its iPhone 16 hit stores. Some analysts have suggested this week’s cut could set the stage for tech stocks to gain over the last few months of the year and into next year, with Wedbush analysts writing yesterday that “the green light is back on for the tech growth trade.” While the Fed cautioned this week against assuming more jumbo cuts lie ahead, markets are largely expecting the central bank to continue aggressively cutting rates this year, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool based on fed funds market data.

Last week was quite an important week for tech and AI investors, with Goldman Sachs hosting its Communacopia and Technology Conference featuring executives from the largest tech and semiconductor companies. Rarely have so many tech CEOs gathered to discuss their thoughts on AI, where the industry currently stands, and what lies ahead. To have the CEOs of trillion-dollar companies speaking in unison on AI’s potential and investing in AI is either a staggering coincidence — or they have important insights pointing to the same conclusion, which is that AI’s primary risk is for companies who are not early enough to capture it. SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA - MARCH 18: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivers a keynote address during the ... [+] Nvidia GTC Artificial Intelligence Conference at SAP Center on March 18, 2024 in San Jose, California. The developer conference is expected to highlight new chip, software, and AI processor technology. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) We’re still in the early innings of AI, but the pace of transformation that AI is driving is unlike any other technology seen before, and that was evident at Communacopia. Below, I dig in to the four things that investors must know about AI. The AI revolution has arrived, sparked in full-scale by Nvidia’s Hopper series GPUs and OpenAI’s release of ChatGPT in late 2022. Not even two years later, Nvidia continues to sell GPUs at an unbelievable clip, with Big Tech unable to procure enough GPUs to meet internal project needs and external enterprise demand in the cloud. AWS CEO Matt Garman explained that he truly believes AI “is a technology that over time is going to completely change almost every single industry that all of us focus on and think about and work on every single day to some level.” Garman added that the early AI use cases we’re seeing proliferate at the moment are just scratching the surface. ServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott agrees, stating that he also believes “AI is the well spring of opportunity in the global economy.” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang echoed this, saying that “we're now in this computer revolution. … Generative AI is not just a tool, it is a skill. And so this is the interesting thing. This is why a new industry has been created. And the reason for that is, if you look at the whole IT industry, up until now, we've been making instruments and tools that people use. For the very first time, we're going to create skills that augment people. And so that's why people think that AI is going to expand beyond the trillion dollars of data centers and IT, and into the world of skills.” Despite the immense potential AI holds, in the present, the AI industry is only just at the nascent stages of this revolution. Snowflake CFO Mike Scarpelli explained that he thinks “it's still in the very early innings,” but “the reality is that very few are using it en masse today.” Bringing AI to the masses, when adoption of AI is commonplace, is when the industry will unlock things previously seen as impossible or extremely costly, according to Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott. Scott believes we could be 5 to 10 years out from seeing what developers are capable of and what applications can be created. By heralding in a new wave of innovation and unlocking endless possibilities to advance technology currently available today, AI is expected to have a multi-trillion-dollar impact on the global economy in the coming decades. ServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott discussed AI’s profound potential at Communacopia: “There are researchers that independently have said it will have an $11 trillion impact on the economy in the next handful of years. I believe that may be true. Maybe it's [$10 trillion], maybe it's [$9 trillion], maybe it's [$8 trillion], but it's going to be big. And the reason for that is there is so much inefficiency. There is so much waste. There is so much human potential that can be activated by taking the soul crushing work away from people and unleashing them to do things that really matter that can help companies grow and prosper. And that has never been factored into the equation as people think about technology on a day-to-day basis, that's why we're working so hard to tell them the story.” For context, the mobile economy, which delivered a handful of the trillion-dollar tech behemoths of today, added approximately $5.7 trillion to the global economy in 2023, up from $5.2 trillion in 2022, according to GSMA. McDermott sees AI having up to double the economic potential of mobile, though other industry forecasts point to a much larger long-term impact from AI. According to McKinsey, generative AI is estimated to add up to $7.9 trillion to the global economy annually when combining new generative AI use cases and gen-AI related productivity gains, according to research from McKinsey, Overall, McKinsey estimates the AI economy could add $25.6 trillion to global GDP over the next couple of decades. Generative AI is estimated to add up to $7.9 trillion to the... (truncated)

Bittensor gaining traction after over 12% returns, showing potential for higher prices soon. BitTensor [TAO], a leading AI coin, is gaining significant traction in the cryptocurrency market as web3 continues to evolve on blockchain technology. In the last 24 hours, TAO has recorded over 12% gains, making it the top-performing coin among the top 50 by market cap at press time, according to CoinMarketCap. TAO is well-positioned to surpass Fetch.AI (FET) as the top AI coin, depending on broader market conditions. Source: CoinMarketCap Major companies like Nvidia (NVDA) recently posted better-than-expected earnings, influencing the market with their collective views. This has sparked a bullish sentiment toward AI coins, as Nvidia plays a significant role in the AI industry. In the past 24 hours as at press time, TAO’s price spiked to $440 on Kucoin Exchange but faced immediate rejection, suggesting strong selling pressure at that level. This creates a significant resistance zone moving forward. Typically, wicks are viewed as gaps that markets tend to fill, meaning BitTensor needs to climb higher to fill this gap. Whether TAO/USDT will rally to fill this gap remains uncertain, as the price rejection could indicate that sellers still hold control. However, TAO briefly wicked above $356, where there’s liquidity due to equal highs at this level. Source: TradingView Additionally, the bullish close of the August 5th candle, a hammer with a long tail, suggests increasing buying pressure. TAO/USDT’s consolidation, while in a range, is marked by higher lows, which is typically a bullish signal. The Chaikin Money Flow, currently negative, hints at a possible reversal that could drive TAO’s price higher. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 14-day moving average has also flipped bullish, further supporting the case for potential gains in the near future. The open interest for BitTensor across popular exchanges is nearing its all-time high, with a current total of $68.88 million at a price of $322 as of press time. Binance leads the pack with $29M in TAO open interest, followed by Bybit with $18.6M. Bitget and BingX follow with $13.19 million and $5.54 million, respectively. Other exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, HTX, and CoinEx show notable, but lower, open interest. Source: Coinglass This strong open interest is a bullish sign for TAO. Now could be a good time to accumulate TAO tokens. Lastly, examining the liquidation heatmap, several liquidation levels suggest potential price movements. There’s a significant cluster of $482.17K in liquidation leverage above the $366 price level, likely held by traders who are bearish on BitTensor following its rejection. Is your portfolio green? Check the TAO Profit Calculator Below $280, there’s $1.11 million in liquidation leverage, and another $1.92M is resting below $275. Source: Coinglass If TAO’s price captures liquidity above its current level, it could boost bullish activity and push TAO/USDT higher.

As China advances its artificial intelligence industry — much to the frustration of the U.S. — competition is brewing between its homegrown AI developers. Now, one is reportedly working on its own chips with a major chipmaker. ByteDance has designed two chips with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) that it plans to mass produce by 2026, The Information reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. By producing its own chips, the company could become less dependent on Nvidia’s (NVDA) pricey graphics processing units, or GPUs, which are subject to U.S. export controls, people told The Information. Neither ByteDance nor TSMC immediately responded to Quartz’s request for comment. Last August, ByteDance released its AI-powered chatbot, Doubao, which has proven to be a tough rival to Baidu’s (BIDU) Ernie Bot — considered China’s version of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which is not allowed in the country. In China, Doubao passed Ernie Bot in downloads last year, and had more active monthly users on iOS, Bloomberg reported. ByteDance launched a series of Doubao large language models (LLMs) for enterprises in May, which cost less than models from rivals who have had to cut prices by up to 97% amid rising competition, according to The Information. The TikTok owner has reportedly placed orders for over 200,000 of Nvidia’s H20 chips — one of three specifically designed to comply with U.S. export controls. The company is still waiting for the over $2 billion order, The Information reported. However, ByteDance now plans to order chips for training and inferencing from TSMC, which would save it billions of dollars, The Information estimated, adding that the chips are still being designed and plans are not finalized. Meanwhile, Baidu has reportedly designed its own AI chip, the Kunlun 3, which will soon start manufacturing at TSMC, a person told The Information. Earlier this month the U.S. released its latest set of export controls on critical technologies as it steps up its efforts to curb China’s technological advances. Chinese companies’ ability to work with TSMC depends on compliance with the controls, which are updated annually.

Title: What the Chips Act is missing 2 years later
URL: https://qz.com/chips-science-act-biden-administration-semiconductor-us-1851645948
Time Published: 2024-09-16T09:00:00Z
Full Content:
Two years after the Biden-Harris administration signed the Chips and Science Act into law, more than half of the $52 billion in subsidies designated for semiconductor manufacturing has been earmarked for 15 chipmakers. While companies including Intel (INTC), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), and Samsung have plans to use the proposed funding to build facilities for manufacturing, research and development, and other chipmaking infrastructure, experts say the Chips Act is missing key components that are crucial to supporting a robust chipmaking industry in the U.S. Meanwhile, the Biden administration has announced new export controls on critical technologies, including semiconductors and quantum computers, as it steps up efforts to curb China’s technological advances. The rules cover sectors which “warrant export controls because of national security concerns,” the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security said. Here’s what tech and policy experts say is missing in the Chips Act, two years in. While the Chips Act aims to bring manufacturing of logic chips, memory chips, and other parts of silicon infrastructure back to the U.S., “What they’ve neglected to do is actually understand the technical stack necessary to build chips,” Steve Blank, co-founder of the Gordian Knot Center for National Security Innovation at Stanford, said. Advanced chip manufacturing requires wafer fab equipment, which comes from only five companies in the world — three of which are in the U.S., Blank said. ASML (ASML), based in the Netherlands, is perhaps the most well-known manufacturer of advanced chipmaking equipment for patterning, he said, but U.S.-based Applied Materials (AMAT), KLA (KLAC), and LAM (LRCX) dominate the space. “The problem is that the Chips Act gave $0 to any of those companies,” Blank said. However, “while we were doing the Chips Act, we put export controls on the three U.S. companies to stop selling their advanced equipment to China.” And the export controls did not apply to Japan-based Tokyo Electron, Blank said. “So while we’ve strangled U.S. companies, Tokyo Electron sales have doubled mostly to China,” Blank said. “We’ve built a dam across half the river.” While the Biden-Harris administration has focused on toughening trade restrictions to prevent China from buying advanced chipmaking equipment, “the other piece of the puzzle is, ‘What have we done to support the three U.S. companies that make the machines?’” “Yes, it’s about time the U.S. puts those export controls on, but still, the Chips Act has been doling out billions of dollars to the people who make the factories, not the people who make the critical machinery,” Blank said. The Chips Act is also about creating new U.S. jobs, said Chris Mills Rodrigo, managing editor of Inequality.org at the Institute for Policy Studies, a political think tank. However, there hasn’t been a lot of focus on potential workplace issues. “We spoke with semiconductor workers and also did analysis of available data on wages, and our takeaway was that there is a pretty sizable portion of the industry where the jobs aren’t great,” said Mills Rodrigo, the lead author of the IPS’s “Leveraging the CHIPS Program to Create Good Jobs for All Semiconductor Workers” report. The report found semiconductor workers are mostly concerned about low wages, grueling work schedules, and exposure to harmful and toxic chemicals. For example, most workers on the production line in chip fabs are paid hourly, and often don’t have full 40-hour weeks due to inconsistent scheduling and frequent work stoppages, Mills Rodrigo said. And while the industry has previously addressed the possible harms of exposure to toxic chemicals involved in semiconductor manufacturing, those “concerns are still popping up in foreign facilities, and there’s no real guarantee that they’re not being used here because all the companies say that the mix of chemicals they use is proprietary,” Mills Rodrigo said. Concerns around toxic chemicals were raised in the 1990s after industry-backed studies found links to increased rates of certain types of cancer and miscarriages. Meanwhile, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which sets standards for toxic chemicals, has acknowledged it hasn’t updated the standards in 50 years, rendering them “outdated and inadequate,” Mills Rodrigo said. The Biden administration should try to guarantee that the jobs being created by the Chips Act are good jobs before releasing proposed funds to recipients, Mills Rodrigo said. One way could be by using the “Good Jobs Principles” doctrine set by the Labor and Commerce Departments in 2022, Mills Rodrigo said, which addresses basic demands about wages, hiring, benefits, and bargaining rights. “I think they should be putting teeth into the contracts to actually enforce those provisions,” Mills Rodrigo said, adding that there should also be enforceable commitments for workforce development, including trainin...

Title: Novo Nordisk stock tumbled over the latest results for its experimental weight loss pill
URL: https://qz.com/novo-nordisk-stock-monlunabant-weight-loss-trial-1851653608
Time Published: 2024-09-20T14:59:00Z
Full Content:
Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk (NVO) announced mixed results today for a phase 2 trial of an experimental weight loss pill that works differently than its already-popular weight loss drug Wegovy. Novo Nordisk stock fell nearly 6% during Friday morning trading after it posted the results. The Danish pharma giant tested monlunabant, a drug it acquired in 2023 with its $1 billion purchase of Inversago Pharma, in a phase 2 trial involving 243 participants with obesity and other related health complications. Monlunabant works by blocking CB1 receptors, which are found in the brain and nervous system and have an effect on appetite. Conversely, Wegovy works by mimicking a gut hormone that regulates blood sugar levels and reduces appetite. The new drug was tested in once-daily doses of 10mg, 20mg, and 50mg. Starting from an average weight of 110.1 kg (242.7 lbs), participants taking any dose of monlunabant lost significantly more weight than those on a placebo. After 16 weeks, people taking a daily 10 mg dose of monlunabant lost an average of 7.1 kg (15.6 lbs), or about 6% of their weight, while the placebo group only lost about 0.7 kg (1.5 lbs). Higher doses didn’t result in much more weight loss beyond that. In the trial, the most common side effects were digestive issues, which were generally mild to moderate and depended on the dose. People taking monlunabant also reported more mild-to-moderate mood-related side effects, including anxiety, irritability, and sleep problems, compared to those on a placebo. However, Novo Nordisk reported no severe neuropsychiatric side effects. “The phase 2a results indicate the weight-lowering potential of monlunabant and that further work is needed to determine the optimal dosing to balance safety and efficacy,” said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president and head of development at Novo Nordisk, in a statement. “Obesity is a complex disease with a significant unmet need, and as an oral small molecule having a new mechanism of action, monlunabant is one of the novel projects in our pipeline with the potential of treating obesity.” Novo Nordisk said it is plans to start a larger phase 2 trial of the drug in 2025.

Title: Bernie Sanders says drugmakers could sell generic Ozempic for less than $100

Time Published: 2024-09-17T20:35:00Z

Sen. Bernie Sanders said on Tuesday that CEOs at major generic pharma companies have told him that they are willing to sell a generic version of Ozempic for hundreds of dollars cheaper than the popular diabetes drug’s current list price. “They have studied the math, and they tell me that they can sell a generic version of Ozempic, the exact same drug that Novo Nordisk (NVO) is manufacturing, to Americans for less than $100 a month,” Sanders said at an expert roundtable event he hosted in Capitol Hill. Sanders, who serves as the chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee (HELP), made the comments just a week before Novo Nordisk CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen is set to testify before the committee to address the pharma giant’s high U.S. prices. In April, the HELP committee launched an investigation into the high prices the company charges for its blockbuster diabetes and weight loss drugs. The committee’s investigation found that the net cost of Ozempic in the U.S. is about $600 a month (its retail price is $968.52), well above the drug’s price in other countries. In Germany, for example, Ozempic costs just $59 for a month’s supply. “We appreciate that it is frustrating that each country has its own healthcare system but making isolated and limited comparisons ignores this fundamental fact,” a Novo Nordisk spokesperson told Quartz in an emailed statement. “We have and will continue to cooperate with policymakers on real solutions and are proud of the benefit our discoveries have brought to treat and defeat chronic diseases like diabetes and obesity.” The company spokesperson added that the net price of Ozempic has fallen 40% since launching in the U.S. and that over 80% of Americans with insurance only pay $25 or less per month for the drug.

Title: Ozempic will likely get cheaper for millions on Medicare, Novo exec says

Ozempic, the blockbuster diabetes treatment by Novo Nordisk (NVO), is ‘very likely’ to see its price cut as part of the second round of Medicare drug price negotiation in 2025, an executive from the Danish pharma giant said on Tuesday. Bloomberg reported that Ulrich Otte, Novo Nordisk senior vice president of finance & operations, made the comment at the Cantor Global Healthcare Conference in New York. “It is very likely that Ozempic will be part of negotiations in the coming round, and we’re ready for that,” Otte said, according to the outlet. The company’s stock dipped over 3% during midday trading on Tuesday. “We can’t speculate on which Novo Nordisk medicines will be selected for future negotiations with [the] Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS),” a Novo Nordisk spokesperson told Quartz in an emailed statement. “We have opposed government price setting through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and have serious concerns about how the law is being implemented.” The IRA, which was passed by Congress in 2022, allowed for CMS to negotiate the price for brand name drugs that make up the most of Medicare’s prescription drug spending. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced in August the lowered prices of the first 10 prescription drugs that underwent Medicare negotiations. The selected drugs accounted for $56.2 billion in total Medicare spending in 2023, according to HHS. The negotiations resulted in price discounts ranging from 38% to 79%. CMS is set to select 15 more drugs for price negotiations by February 2025. Otte’s comments come as several prominent government officials have already called for price cuts of the popular diabetes medication. In a July op-ed, President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders criticized the high prices Novo Nordisk and other pharmaceutical companies charge Americans for weight loss and diabetes drugs known as GLP-1 treatments. Novo Nordisk produces the the popular Ozempic and Wegovy brands, and Eli Lilly (LLY) is the maker of Mounjaro and Zepbound. Novo Nordisk CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen agreed to testify in September before the Senate’s health committee to address the pharma giant’s high U.S. prices. Jørgensen agreed to testify just days after after Sanders, chairman of Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), called a vote to subpoena a Novo Nordisk executive. In April, the HELP committee launched an investigation into the high prices the company charges for its blockbuster drugs. At the time, the senator also warned that the drugs could potentially bankrupt Medicare and Medicaid. He cited researchers from Vanderbilt University and the University of Chicago that said it could cost more than $150 billion a year for Medicare to cover Wegovy and other weight loss drugs. In June, the committee’s investigation found that the net cost of Ozempic in the U.S. is about $600 a month (its retail price is $968.52), well above the drug’s price in other countries. Ozempic in Germany costs just $59 for a month’s supply. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Novo Nordisk A/S: Monlunabant phase 2a trial in obesity successfully completed

September 20, 2024 08:43 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 20 September 2024 – Novo Nordisk today announced headline results from a phase 2a clinical trial with monlunabant, a small molecule oral cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) inverse agonist. Monlunabant, formerly INV-202, was part of the acquisition of Inversago Pharmaceuticals Inc. announced in August 2023 [Link]. The trial investigated the efficacy and safety of a once-daily 10 mg, 20 mg and 50 mg dose of monlunabant compared to placebo on body weight after 16 weeks in 243 people with obesity and metabolic syndrome1. People were equally randomised among the four treatment arms. From a baseline body weight of 110.1 kg, all doses of monlunabant achieved a statistically significant weight loss compared to placebo. After 16 weeks of treatment, people treated with a once-daily 10 mg dose of monlunabant achieved a weight loss of 7.1 kg compared to a reduction of 0.7 kg with placebo2. Limited additional weight loss was seen at higher doses of monlunabant. In the trial, the most common adverse events were gastrointestinal, with the vast majority being mild to moderate and dose dependent. Reporting of mild to moderate neuropsychiatric side effects, primarily anxiety, irritability, and sleep disturbances, was more frequent and dose dependent with monlunabant compared to placebo. No serious adverse events were reported in relation to neuropsychiatric side effects. “The phase 2a results indicate the weight-lowering potential of monlunabant and that further work is needed to determine the optimal dosing to balance safety and efficacy,” said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president and head of Development at Novo Nordisk. “Obesity is a complex disease with a significant unmet need, and as an oral small molecule having a new mechanism of action, monlunabant is one of the novel projects in our pipeline with the potential of treating obesity.” Based on the results, Novo Nordisk expects to initiate a larger phase 2b trial in obesity to further investigate dosing and the safety profile of monlunabant over a longer duration in a global population. The phase 2b trial is expected to be initiated in 2025. About monlunabant and CB1Monlunabant is an inverse agonist of the CB1 receptor which plays an important role in metabolism and appetite regulation in the central nervous system as well as in peripheral tissues such as adipose tissues, the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, liver, pancreas, muscles and lungs. CB1 plays an important role in appetite regulation and cardiometabolic pathways. About Novo NordiskNovo Nordisk is a leading global healthcare company, founded in 1923 and headquartered in Denmark.

On Thursday, BofA Securities expressed a continued positive outlook on CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) stock, maintaining a Buy rating and a price target of $365.00. The firm highlighted CrowdStrike's strategic initiatives aimed at accelerating growth, including the Falcon Flex (NASDAQ:FLEX) program and newly introduced vendor financing options. The company's efforts to drive growth through product and go-to-market strategies were acknowledged, with the expectation that these would sustain the company's growth momentum. Despite potential short-term impacts, such as pressure on Net-new Annual Recurring Revenue (nnARR) growth and cash flow due to incentives like discounting and extended contract terms, BofA Securities anticipates these measures to foster broader platform adoption and enhance customer retention over time. The analyst noted that the impact of vendor financing on free cash flow (FCF) is anticipated to diminish as the financing programs reach their one-year mark. The firm's endorsement of the Buy rating is rooted in CrowdStrike's product leadership, attractive growth prospects, and the potential for total addressable market (TAM) expansion. CrowdStrike's strategic actions, including discounting and contract elongation, are seen as incentives that could potentially affect nnARR growth and cash flow in the near term. However, these initiatives are also viewed as catalysts for long-term platform adoption and customer loyalty. In summary, BofA Securities reaffirms its confidence in CrowdStrike's market position and future prospects, emphasizing the company's strong product offerings and the opportunities for market growth. The firm's maintained Buy rating and price target reflect a steady belief in CrowdStrike's continued success in its sector. In other recent news, CrowdStrike Holdings has been making notable strides in its operational and financial performance. The cybersecurity firm exceeded expectations in its second fiscal quarter with annual recurring revenue, revenue, and non-GAAP earnings per share. However, guidance for the third fiscal quarter and fiscal year 2025 fell short of consensus estimates, leading to adjustments from various analyst firms including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, and Deutsche Bank. CrowdStrike has also announced several strategic initiatives, such as the launch of a new Financial Services arm to facilitate easier terms and access to its Falcon platform. Additionally, it has established partnerships with Dazz and 1Password to enhance cloud security measures and simplify security for small and midsize businesses. The company also appointed Kartik Shahani as the Vice President of India and SAARC to expand its reach in the region. Mizuho Securities, DA Davidson, and Citi have all maintained positive ratings on CrowdStrike, citing the company's unique cloud security platform, superior go-to-market strategy, and success in expanding beyond traditional endpoint security markets. These recent developments reflect CrowdStrike's commitment to maintaining healthy financials and robust security offerings. In light of BofA Securities' optimistic stance on CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD), recent data from InvestingPro shows that the company holds a substantial market capitalization of $65.48 billion, signaling strong investor confidence. This is further bolstered by a significant revenue growth rate over the last twelve months, coming in at 33.07%, which underscores the company's robust growth trajectory as highlighted by BofA Securities. While the company's P/E ratio stands at a high 382.02, indicating a premium valuation, this is reflective of CrowdStrike's strong market position and growth potential. The high price/book ratio of 22.95 also suggests that investors are willing to pay a premium for the company's assets and future growth prospects. An InvestingPro Tip to note is that CrowdStrike is expected to be profitable this year, aligning with the positive outlook presented by BofA Securities. For investors seeking a deeper analysis, InvestingPro offers additional insights, including 39 analysts having revised their earnings downwards for the upcoming period, potentially providing a more conservative outlook on the company's near-term performance.

CrowdStrike has also launched several strategic initiatives, including CrowdStrike Financial Services, a subsidiary designed to provide financing solutions for customers. The company has established partnerships with Dazz and 1Password to enhance cloud security measures and simplify security for small and midsize businesses. In light of Mizuho Securities' reaffirmed confidence in CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD), current InvestingPro data provides additional context. The company's market capitalization stands at a robust $65.48 billion, underscoring its significant presence in the cloud security space.

Full Content:
On Wednesday, Citi expressed continued confidence in CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD), maintaining a Buy rating and a price target of $300.00. The firm anticipates gathering firsthand accounts and evidence at the fully booked Fal.Con conference, which will shed light on various aspects of CrowdStrike's operations and market position. The insights sought to include the level of competition, particularly from a key competitor identified only as 'S', and customer and partner feedback on pricing and discounting strategies. Additionally, Citi is interested in the reception of CrowdStrike's post-outage customer commitment packages and initial reactions to the newly announced CRWD Financial Services. Citi analysts are also looking forward to the investor briefing scheduled for September 18, 2024, where they expect CrowdStrike to reaffirm its goal of reaching a $10 billion annual recurring revenue (ARR). This comes amid considerations of discounting, pricing power, and the financial implications of CRWD Financial Services. Moreover, Citi is seeking detailed updates on the uptake of customer commitment packages two months following an outage, as well as specific information on profitability and free cash flow. These factors are crucial to short-term model estimates, with investors potentially unprepared for discussions on net retention rate compression and the recalibration of costs associated with doing business. While Citi maintains its Buy rating on CrowdStrike, it anticipates that the shares may experience volatility as the market digests new information and adjusts to the evolving competitive landscape and financial metrics. In other recent news, CrowdStrike, a leader in cloud-delivered cybersecurity, has been making significant strides in both operational and financial aspects. The company recently announced a strategic partnership with Dazz to enhance cloud security measures. Additionally, CrowdStrike unveiled a fully-owned subsidiary, CrowdStrike Financial Services, aiming to simplify procurement and accelerate the consolidation of cybersecurity technologies for organizations. CrowdStrike also expanded its collaboration with 1Password to bolster cybersecurity for small and midsize businesses. The company appointed Kartik Shahani as the Vice President of India and SAARC, to boost the adoption of the CrowdStrike Falcon cybersecurity platform in the region. Financially, CrowdStrike's second fiscal quarter results surpassed expectations in terms of annual recurring revenue, revenue, and non-GAAP earnings per share. However, the guidance for the third fiscal quarter and fiscal year 2025 fell short of consensus estimates, leading to various adjustments from analyst firms. Goldman Sachs reaffirmed its Buy rating on CrowdStrike's shares, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan maintained their Overweight ratings, and Deutsche Bank increased its price target due to revised revenue forecasts for FY25 and FY26. As CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) continues to capture the attention of investors and analysts alike, recent data from InvestingPro underscores some of the key financial metrics and trends that may influence investment decisions. CrowdStrike's market capitalization stands robust at approximately $65.87 billion, reflecting the market's valuation of the company. Despite trading at a high earnings multiple with a P/E ratio of 384.18, which suggests a premium on its earnings, the company's revenue growth remains strong. Over the last twelve months leading up to Q2 2025, CrowdStrike has experienced a significant revenue growth of 33.07%, underscoring its expanding market presence and business scale. Furthermore, the gross profit margin is notably high at 75.37%, indicating the company's efficiency in maintaining profitability while scaling its operations. An interesting point to consider is that CrowdStrike has been trading at a high Price / Book multiple of 23.09, which can be indicative of investor confidence in the company's future growth prospects. Additionally, the company's liquid assets exceed its short-term obligations, as highlighted by one of the InvestingPro Tips, providing a cushion for operational flexibility. With 39 analysts having revised their earnings downwards for the upcoming period, it suggests a cautious outlook on the company's immediate earnings potential. For investors seeking a deeper analysis, there are more than 15 additional InvestingPro Tips available, which can provide further insights into CrowdStrike's financial health and market position.

September 19, 2024 12:43 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On September 12, 2024, SEMAFOR reported that software engineers at cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike “complained about rushed deadlines, excessive workloads, and increasing technical problems to higher-ups for more than a year before a catastrophic failure of its software paralyzed airlines and knocked banking and other services offline for hours.” Hagens Berman urges CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD) investors who suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge who may be able to assist in the investigation to contact its attorneys.

(CRWD): According to the September 12, 2024 reporting by SEMAFOR, in the wake of CrowdStrike’s disastrous update to its flagship Falcon Sensor security product that contained a bug that caused a massive overnight outage affecting 8.5 million Windows computers around the world, a certain former employee said “‘[s]peed was the most important thing’” and “‘[q]uality control was not really part of our process or conversation.’” The SEMAFOR article, “CrowdStrike ex employees: ‘Quality control was not part of our process,’” states “[a]lmost two dozen former software engineers, managers, managers and other staff described a workplace where executives prioritized speed over quality, workers weren’t always sufficiently trained, and mistakes around coding and other tasks were rising.” SEMAFOR also reported that “[o]ne former senior manager said they sat in multiple meetings where staff warned company leaders that CrowdStrike would ‘fail’ its customers by releasing products that couldn’t be supported.” The pending litigation focuses on the propriety of CrowdStrike’s representations concerning the efficacy of its AI-native CrowdStrike Falcon platform, including assurances that its technology was “validated, certified, and tested.” The complaint alleges that CrowdStrike’s assurances were false and misleading because the company failed to disclose that: (1) it instituted deficient controls in its procedures for updating Falcon and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (2) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of CrowdStrike customers; and (3) such outages could pose, and ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to the company. The company’s assurances came into question beginning on July 19, 2024, when CrowdStrike issued an automatic update for its flagship Falcon Sensor security product which contained a bug and caused a massive overnight outage that affected 8.5 million Windows computers around the world, disrupting businesses, airports, train stations, banks, broadcasters, and the healthcare sector. Many affected machines were unable to restart, instead showing a blue error screen sometimes called “the blue screen of death.” The news was accompanied by several analyst downgrades with one at Guggenheim downgrading CrowdStrike from buy to neutral, reportedly writing that “[t]he restoration of its reputation may take more time and will likely affect new business signings at least in the near-term.” Then, on July 29, 2024, news outlets reported that one of CrowdStrike’s customers (Delta Airlines) which suffered more than 6,000 flight cancellations hired a prominent attorney to seek damages caused by the faulty update. These events have driven the price of CrowdStrike shares down $84.24 (-24%) since July 18, 2024.

(NASDAQ: CRWD), DXC Technology Company (NYSE:DXC), and Five Below, Inc. (NASDAQ: FIVE). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Indivior PLC (NASDAQ: INDV) Class Period: February 22, 2024 - July 8, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 1, 2024 The Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants (1) grossly overstated their ability to forecast the negative impact of certain legislation on the financial prospects of Indivior products, which forecasting ability was far less capable and effective than Defendants had led investors and analysts to believe; (2) overstated the financial prospects of SUBLOCADE, PERSERIS and OPVEE, and thus overstated the Company's anticipated revenue and other financial metrics; (3) knew or recklessly disregarded that because of the negative impact of certain legislation on the financial prospects of Indivior's products, Indivior was unlikely to meet its own previously issued and repeatedly reaffirmed FY 2024 net revenue guidance, including its FY 2024 net revenue guidance for SUBLOCADE, PERSERIS and OPVEE; (4) knew or recklessly disregarded that Indivior was at a significant risk of, and/or was likely to, cease all sales and marketing activities related to PERSERIS; and (5) knew or recklessly disregarded that, as a result of the foregoing, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

(NASDAQ: CRWD) Class Period: November 29, 2023 - July 29, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 30, 2024 CrowdStrike is a global cybersecurity company that provides software that helps prevent data breaches. According to the complaint, CrowdStrike’s main product is the Falcon software platform, which purportedly uses artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to detect, prevent, and respond to security breach threats. The CrowdStrike class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) CrowdStrike had instituted deficient controls in its procedure for updating Falcon and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (ii) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of CrowdStrike’s customers; and (iii) such outages could pose, and in fact ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to CrowdStrike. The CrowdStrike class action lawsuit further alleges that on July 19, 2024, news broke that a flawed Falcon content update caused major worldwide technology outages for millions of devices running Microsoft Windows. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell more than 11%, according to the complaint. Then, on July 22, 2024, the CrowdStrike class action lawsuit further alleges that Congress called on CrowdStrike CEO, defendant George Kurtz, to testify regarding the crisis and CrowdStrike’s stock rating was downgraded by analysts such as Guggenheim and BTIG. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell more than 13%, according to the complaint. Finally, on July 29, 2024, news outlets reported that Delta Air Lines had hired prominent attorney David Boies to seek damages from CrowdStrike following the software outage, according to the complaint. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell nearly 10%, according to the CrowdStrike class action lawsuit. For more information on the CrowdStrike class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/CRWD DXC Technology Company (NYSE:DXC) Class Period: May 26, 2021 - May 16, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 1, 2024 According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants misrepresented its ongoing “transformation journey” and the Company’s ability to integrate previously acquired companies and business systems. While touting its ongoing success in implementing that integration, DXC repeatedly stressed its commitment to reducing the Company’s restructuring and transaction, separation, and integration (“TSI”) costs in order to increase its free cashflow and “unleash [its] true earnings power.” In truth, Defendants knew or recklessly disregarded that the Company was only able to reduce its restructuring and TSI costs by limit...

September 16, 2024 18:25 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 16, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On September 12, 2024, SEMAFOR reported that software engineers at cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike “complained about rushed deadlines, excessive workloads, and increasing technical problems to higher-ups for more than a year before a catastrophic failure of its software paralyzed airlines and knocked banking and other services offline for hours.” Hagens Berman urges CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD) investors who suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge who may be able to assist in the investigation to contact its attorneys. Class Period: Nov. 29, 2023 – July 29, 2024Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Sept. 30, 2024Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/CRWD Contact the Firm Now: CRWD@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Securities Class Action Against CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (CRWD): According to the September 12, 2024 reporting by SEMAFOR, in the wake of CrowdStrike’s disastrous update to its flagship Falcon Sensor security product that contained a bug that caused a massive overnight outage affecting 8.5 million Windows computers around the world, a certain former employee said “‘[s]peed was the most important thing’” and “‘[q]uality control was not really part of our process or conversation.’” The SEMAFOR article, “CrowdStrike ex employees: ‘Quality control was not part of our process,’” states “[a]lmost two dozen former software engineers, managers, managers and other staff described a workplace where executives prioritized speed over quality, workers weren’t always sufficiently trained, and mistakes around coding and other tasks were rising.” SEMAFOR also reported that “[o]ne former senior manager said they sat in multiple meetings where staff warned company leaders that CrowdStrike would ‘fail’ its customers by releasing products that couldn’t be supported.” The pending litigation focuses on the propriety of CrowdStrike’s representations concerning the efficacy of its AI-native CrowdStrike Falcon platform, including assurances that its technology was “validated, certified, and tested.” The complaint alleges that CrowdStrike’s assurances were false and misleading because the company failed to disclose that: (1) it instituted deficient controls in its procedures for updating Falcon and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (2) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of CrowdStrike customers; and (3) such outages could pose, and ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to the company. The company’s assurances came into question beginning on July 19, 2024, when CrowdStrike issued an automatic update for its flagship Falcon Sensor security product which contained a bug and caused a massive overnight outage that affected 8.5 million Windows computers around the world, disrupting businesses, airports, train stations, banks, broadcasters, and the healthcare sector. Many affected machines were unable to restart, instead showing a blue error screen sometimes called “the blue screen of death.” The news was accompanied by several analyst downgrades with one at Guggenheim downgrading CrowdStrike from buy to neutral, reportedly writing that “[t]he restoration of its reputation may take more time and will likely affect new business signings at least in the near-term.” Then, on July 29, 2024, news outlets reported that one of CrowdStrike’s customers (Delta Airlines) which suffered more than 6,000 flight cancellations hired a prominent attorney to seek damages caused by the faulty update. These events have driven the price of CrowdStrike shares down $84.24 (-24%) since July 18, 2024.

(NASDAQ: CRWD) between November 29, 2023 and July 29, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important September 30, 2024 lead plaintiff deadline.

WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the CrowdStrike class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=27534 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2024. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) CrowdStrike had instituted deficient controls in its procedures for updating its Falcon software platform, and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (2) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of the CrowdStrike’s customers; and (3) such outages could pose, and in fact ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to CrowdStrike. As a result of these materially false and misleading statements and omissions, CrowdStrike stock traded at artificially high prices during the Class Period. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the CrowdStrike class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=27534 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

The alarming rise in cyberattacks shows the urgent need for robust cybersecurity measures. Globally, the frequency of cyberattacks is on the rise, impacting individuals, enterprises, and governments, leading to substantial financial losses. Cybercriminals target endpoints, networks, and data, with motives ranging from political rivalry and financial gain to damaging reputation and furthering radical religious group interests. Prominent ransomware such as WannaCry, Petya, NotPetya, and BadRabbit have significantly affected large-scale enterprises and government organizations. The CISCO cybersecurity threat trends report for 2021 reveals alarming statistics, including a high percentage of organizations facing phishing attempts, malicious browser ads, crypto mining, and ransomware-related activities. The escalating sophistication of cyber threats, particularly ransomware, is compelling organizations globally to prioritize cybersecurity solutions and services for safeguarding critical IT infrastructure and sensitive data. According to Microsoft, the US was the primary target of 46% of cyberattacks in 2020, emphasizing the urgent need for robust cybersecurity measures worldwide. A report from MarketsAndMarkets projected that the global Artificial Intelligence in Cybersecurity Market size, which was valued at USD 22.4 billion in 2023, is expected to grow at a CAGR of 21.9% from 2023 to 2028.

September 17, 2024 14:00 ET | Source: Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC NEW YORK, Sept. 17, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Attorney Advertising--Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC, a nationally recognized law firm, notifies investors that a class action lawsuit has been filed against CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (“CrowdStrike” or “the Company”) (NASDAQ: CRWD) and certain of its officers. Class Definition This lawsuit seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the federal securities laws on behalf of all persons and entities that purchased or otherwise acquired CrowdStrike securities between November 29, 2023, and July 29, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”). Such investors are encouraged to join this case by visiting the firm’s site: bgandg.com/CRWD. Case Details The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants repeatedly touted the efficacy of the Falcon platform while assuring investors that CrowdStrike’s technology was “validated, tested, and certified.” The Complaint alleges that these statements were false and misleading because Defendants had failed to disclose that: (1) CrowdStrike had instituted deficient controls in its procedure for updating Falcon and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (2) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of the Company’s customers; and (3) such outages could pose, and in fact ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to CrowdStrike. The Complaint further alleges that as a result of these materially false and misleading statements and omissions, CrowdStrike stock traded at artificially high prices during the Class Period. What's Next? A class action lawsuit has already been filed.
