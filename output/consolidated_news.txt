SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Meta has prevailed over an existential challenge to its business that could have forced the tech giant to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp after a judge ruled that the company does not hold a monopoly in social networking. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued his ruling Tuesday after the historic antitrust trial wrapped up in late May. His decision follows two separate rulings that branded Google an illegal monopoly in both search and online advertising, dealing yet another regulatory blow to the tech industry that for years enjoyed nearly unbridled growth. The Federal Trade Commission “continues to insist that Meta competes with the same old rivals it has for the last decade, that the company holds a monopoly among that small set, and that it maintained that monopoly through anticompetitive acquisitions,” Boasberg wrote in his ruling. “Whether or not Meta enjoyed monopoly power in the past, though, the agency must show that it continues to hold such power now. The Court’s verdict today determines that the FTC has not done so.” Meta, the FTC had argued, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s strategy, “expressed in 2008: ‘It is better to buy than compete.’ True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats.” During his April testimony, Zuckerberg pushed back against the FTC’s contention that Facebook bought Instagram to neutralize a threat. In his line of questioning, FTC attorney Daniel Matheson repeatedly brought up emails — many of them more than a decade old — written by Zuckerberg and his associates before and after the acquisition of Instagram. While acknowledging the documents, Zuckerberg has often sought to downplay the contents, saying he wrote them in the early stages of considering the acquisition and that what he wrote at the time didn’t capture the full scope of his interest in the company. The FTC’s complaint said Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and “neutralize perceived competitive threats,” just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers. The social media landscape has changed so much since the FTC filed its lawsuit in 2020, Boasberg wrote, that each time the court examined Meta’s apps and competition, they changed. Two opinions to dismiss the case — filed in 2021 and 2022 — didn’t even mention popular social video platform TikTok. Today, it “holds center stage as Meta’s fiercest rival.” Quoting the Greek philosopher Heraclitus, “that no man can ever step into the same river twice,” Boasberg said the same is true for the online world of social media as well. “The landscape that existed only five years ago when the Federal Trade Commission brought this antitrust suit has changed markedly. While it once might have made sense to partition apps into separate markets of social networking and social media, that wall has since broken down,” he wrote. Facebook bought Instagram — then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following — in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal’s value fell to $750 million after Facebook’s stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012. Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller “acqui-hires” — a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion. WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta’s competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple’s messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp. Meta did not immediately respond to a message for comment.

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Meta has prevailed over an existential challenge to its business that could have forced the tech giant to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp after a judge ruled that the company does not hold a monopoly in social networking. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued his ruling Tuesday after the historic antitrust trial wrapped up in late May. His decision runs in sharp contrast to two separate rulings that branded Google an illegal monopoly in both search and online advertising, dealing regulatory blows to the tech industry that for years enjoyed nearly unbridled growth. The Federal Trade Commission “continues to insist that Meta competes with the same old rivals it has for the last decade, that the company holds a monopoly among that small set, and that it maintained that monopoly through anticompetitive acquisitions,” Boasberg wrote in his ruling. “Whether or not Meta enjoyed monopoly power in the past, though, the agency must show that it continues to hold such power now.

In his line of questioning, FTC attorney Daniel Matheson repeatedly brought up emails — many of them more than a decade old — written by Zuckerberg and his associates before and after the acquisition of Instagram. While acknowledging the documents, Zuckerberg has often sought to downplay the contents, saying he wrote the emails early in the acquisition process and that the notes did not fully capture the scope of his interest in the company. But the case was not about the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp more than a decade ago, which the FTC approved at the time, but about whether Meta holds a monopoly now. Prosecutors, Boasberg wrote in the ruling, could only win if they proved “current or imminent legal violation.” The FTC’s complaint said Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and “neutralize perceived competitive threats,” just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers. Meta said Tuesday’s decision “recognizes that Meta faces fierce competition.” “Our products are beneficial for people and businesses and exemplify American innovation and economic growth. We look forward to continuing to partner with the Administration and to invest in America,” said Jennifer Newstead, chief legal officer, in a statement. The social media landscape has changed so much since the FTC filed its lawsuit in 2020, Boasberg wrote, that each time the court examined Meta’s apps and competition, they changed. Two opinions to dismiss the case — filed in 2021 and 2022 — didn’t even mention popular social video platform TikTok. Today, it “holds center stage as Meta’s fiercest rival.” Quoting the Greek philosopher Heraclitus, “that no man can ever step into the same river twice,” Boasberg said the same is true for the online world of social media as well. “The landscape that existed only five years ago when the Federal Trade Commission brought this antitrust suit has changed markedly. While it once might have made sense to partition apps into separate markets of social networking and social media, that wall has since broken down,” he wrote. Emarketer analyst Minda Smiley said Meta’s win “is not necessarily surprising considering the lengths it’s gone to in recent years to keep up with TikTok.” “But from a regulatory standpoint, Meta is far from out of the woods: next year, major social networks will face landmark trials in the US regarding children’s mental health,” she added. “Still, today’s win is surely a boost for the company as it battles criticism and questions over how its massive AI spending will ultimately benefit Meta in the long run.” Facebook bought Instagram — then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following — in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal’s value fell to $750 million after Facebook’s stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012.

Title: Dow plunges 500 points on fears of AI bubble, waning hope for Fed rate cut

The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged nearly 500 points, or 1.1%, Tuesday as fears over an AI bubble shook the market and traders fretted that rate cuts from the Federal Reserve aren’t a sure thing. It was fourth straight decline for the blue-chip index and the S&P 500, which dipped 0.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq slid 1.2% as investors panicked over whether AI firms have been overvalued – extending a rocky tech rout into its third week. Shares in Nvidia fell nearly 3%. The chipmaker is reporting its third-quarter results on Wednesday, toward the end of an especially upbeat earnings season. But “Magnificent 7” tech stocks have dropped amid fears that AI enthusiasm is reminiscent of the “dot-com bubble” of the 1990s and early 2000s. Amazon, Microsoft and Meta also fell. “All technology revolutions create bubble-like stock price performance – but this bubble is still inflating at a healthy pace with no signs of popping anytime soon,” James Denmert, chief investment officer at Main Street Research, said in a note Tuesday. “Valuations, while expensive, still trade at discounts to earnings growth rates and overall AI market sentiment is mildly bullish and not euphoric.” Sign up to receive On The Money by Charlie Gasparino in your inbox every Thursday.

Odds of a quarter-point cut at the Fed’s December meeting plunged to just over 50% – down from more than 90% this time last month, according to CME FedWatch, which tracks Fed Funds futures prices. Investors are looking ahead to the release of Fed minutes on Wednesday. The September jobs report, which was delayed by the government shutdown, is due out Thursday. Despite the upcoming data releases, which are key to the Fed’s decision-making process, several officials have continued to advocate for a slower rate-cutting pace. That has spooked investors who are eager for low interest rates – sending gold futures down 0.3% to $4,062 for its fourth straight day of declines. Meanwhile, Anthropic on Tuesday announced plans to buy $30 billion of Azure compute capacity from Microsoft as part of a new strategic deal. Microsoft will invest $5 billion into Anthropic, and Nvidia will give $10 billion to the startup as part of the deal. While massive AI partnerships would usually send stocks soaring, both Microsoft and Nvidia saw big losses. Anthropic is a private company. Further adding to fears of an AI bubble, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai told BBC on Tuesday that there is some “irrationality” in the current AI boom. In the case of an AI bubble bursting, “I think no company is going to be immune, including us,” Pichai said. Bitcoin dropped briefly below $90,000 on Tuesday. Many tech investors with substantial AI holdings also own cryptocurrency. By about 12:52 p.m., the cryptocurrency jumped 1.3% to $93,249.46. Shares in Home Depot plummeted 6% after the company cut its full-year profit forecast and missed earnings estimates as inflation-battered consumers hold off on renovations. While a November pullback is unusual, it could set up the stock market for a strong December and end to the year, Denmert said in his note. In the previous trading session, the 30-stock Dow fell more than 550 points, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq each dropped about 0.9%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq appears on track to break its seven-month streak of gains. Advertisement

Title: Wall Street analysts are still bullish on Nvidia heading into Q3 earnings, even as investors turn skittish

The Super Bowl of tech earnings is nearly upon us, and the AI trade is about to get a crucial update that will either confirm or dispel a lot of investors' fears from the last few weeks. Nvidia will report earnings for the third quarter after the closing bell, and the stakes are high. Any sign of waning demand for chips from companies developing AI models will likely further derail this year's rally. Nvidia stock is down 10% month-to-date, but it's still up 35% for the year. Wall Street analysts are mostly upbeat about what to expect from the chip giant's earnings, despite some of the recent jitters around the AI trade. They say that the results should reveal a continuation of strong demand that's carried Nvidia stock and the broader AI-fueled market higher this year. Nvidia will publish its results after the 4 p.m. ET closing bell, and a call with analysts is scheduled for 5 p.m. ET. GPU depreciation is a part of the AI bubble debate that has been brought to the fore by prominent investors recently, including Michael Burry and Jim Chanos. But Business Insider's Ali Barr argues that their arguments are flawed. The author of the Tech Memo newsletter writes: GPU depreciation is a part of the AI bubble debate that has been brought to the fore by prominent investors recently, including Michael Burry and Jim Chanos. But Business Insider's Ali Barr argues that their arguments are flawed. The author of the Tech Memo newsletter writes: "Investors have begun to worry that GPUs only have useful lives of one or two years, while cloud providers depreciate the value of these assets over five or six years. An accounting mismatch like this could set the AI industry up for a nasty earnings hit in a few years. This view has become almost a consensus on Wall Street now. It's one of the main pieces of evidence for the argument that we're in a huge AI bubble. The problem is that it's wrong: Even as Nvidia rolls out new GPU architectures every 18 months or less, GPUs aren't aging out nearly as fast as some investors fear." Read his full argument here. The AI-bubble debate is raging ahead of Nvidia's earnings report, but there's nuance to be aware of if you're going to make the argument either way, Business Insider's Joe Ciolli writes in today's First Trade. As Joe puts it: The AI-bubble debate is raging ahead of Nvidia's earnings report, but there's nuance to be aware of if you're going to make the argument either way, Business Insider's Joe Ciolli writes in today's First Trade. As Joe puts it: "No matter where you come out on the AI bubble debate, your next move will boil down to one thing: how long you're willing to wait. If you're an AI bull that believes in the productivity gains that will be unlocked, you might be OK with waiting a long time for that to materialize. Or maybe it's the opposite. You want tangible results now, and that's impacting your investment decisions. AI bears also face a time conundrum: Do they dump positions now and wait for any inevitable storm to pass? That can be risky. As investing legend Jeremy Grantham once told me, on a returns basis, it's just as damaging to sell too early than it is to hit eject too late. So do these bears wait longer and try to time the market more precisely? That can be a stressful and high-risk situation as well. Suddenly, the companies pouring tens of billions into AI — and getting the benefit of the doubt for their efforts — are feeling the heat. The group, which felt unassailable mere weeks ago, is now facing questions from investors: When is this going to start paying off? And do I want to wait around that long?" CFRA Research also expects Nvidia to beat estimates and point to further progress in 2026. In its earnings preview, CFRA forecasts 18% year-over-year growth and 18% quarterly acceleration, the highest since early 2024. It maintains that Nvidia will need to post revenue of $61 billion and EPS of $1.42 for the January quarter, which its analysts think is achievable.

"We believe consensus long-term projections remain reasonable, while NVDA's valuation at about 22x CY 27 basis is enticing given growth prospects and management's blue sky TAM vision of $3T-$4T by decade's end," stated equity analyst Angelo Zino. CFRA reiterates its strong buy rating for Nvidia and maintains its bullish $270 price target. DA Davidson's Gill Luria says his team doesn't think AI demand is set to slow in the coming year. He said that despite negative speculation and jitters around valuations, the firm believes Nvidia will maintain its dominance, even if competition rises and trade tensions with China persist. DA Davidson's Gill Luria says his team doesn't think AI demand is set to slow in the coming year. He said that despite negative speculation and jitters around valuations, the firm believes Nvidia will maintain its dominance, even if competition rises and trade tensions with China persist. "We would point towards recent guidance given by management during NVIDIA GTC D.C. that has Blackwell/Rubin generations amounting to $500B of revenue off of 20M GPUs sold with 30% of that already being shipped," Luria stated. Davidson has a $250 price target for Nvidia, valuing the stock at 42 times estimated 2026 earnings and implying a jump of about 39%. UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri predicts that Nvidia's revenue will come in slightly above Wall Street estimates at $56 billion. His team predicts Nvidia's calendar EPS will reach $7.75 per share in 2026 and could go as high as $9.50 per share in 2027. "A big focus of the call will clearly be how quickly all of this AI infrastructure can be installed and any customer concentration risks that may develop."

The analyst urged investors to "stay the course" with Nvidia stock, maintaining a price target of $230, 28% higher than current levels. Bank of America believes Nvidia remains undervalued, given its dominance in the AI hardware space. Analyst Vivek Arya reaffirmed a buy rating and updated the bank's per-share estimates for the coming fiscal year to $4.56, $7.02, and $9.15 per share. While Arya notes that Nvidia may flick at a complicated macro outlook in the earnings call, he expects the micro outlook to remain solid. Additionally, his team is optimistic that Nvidia's product pipeline, the Blackwell, Blackwell Ultra, and Vera Rubin chips, will help drive growth in 2026.

Title: Snapped: Indie Festival Phenom Off the Grid Campout’s 10th Anniversary (A Photo Essay)

Written by Danny Klein | November 18, 2025 - 1:29 pm Off the Grid Campout founder, visionary and DJ Mikey Made has been on a mission to foster community in the SoCal dance music scene for over a decade. In the past few years, he’s expanded OTG’s footprint from Austin to Mexico City and many points in between. He’s acquired his own remote festival getaway – a sacred outdoor space dotted with Joshua Trees, only 2.5 hours from LA, as well as a new rave-ready warehouse in Santa Ana. Made has also brought The Scarab and The Cloud art cars to the likes of Burning Man, Lightning in a Bottle, Desert Hearts, and more. Each production is ideated and built by Made’s True Crew, a group of live event creatives (many of whom are also DJ’s) that come together for each unique build, whether it’s on home turf or under the often crazy conditions in Blackrock City. OTG events are not about VIP lists or hierarchy. There’s a palpable sense of equality and open access, which isn’t always found at today’s festivals. “This is all for you.” – Mikey Made From early roots throwing remote renegade desert raves with a few dozen friends, to celebrating 10 years in the game with a flagship 4-day festival, the journey has not always been easy. Maintaining harmony in an ecosystem of countless collectives, artists and promoters is always a challenge, but at the end of the day, the unforgettable sets, new friendships, and endless good vibes till the sun comes up make it all worth-while. From international touring legends, to today’s hottest trailblazers, to platforming rising talent that might otherwise not get a shot at the big stage, Made takes great care in curating his lineups, covering a wide range of house, techno, and drum and bass subgenres. Keep an eye out for upcoming events on their site and socials. Special thanks to volterock_media and @that.cameradude for the images.

November 18, 2025 13:12 ET | Source: Rocket Lab Corporation Rocket Lab Corporation Long Beach, CA Long Beach, CA LONG BEACH, Calif., Nov. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced it successfully launched a suborbital mission with its HASTE launch vehicle for the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) and Missile Defense Agency (MDA) - advancing national interests in safeguarding the homeland through the testing of advanced technologies for missile defense. The launch on HASTE – Rocket Lab’s commercial launch vehicle for regular and reliable hypersonic test flights – took place from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 2 on Wallops Island, Virginia, at 13:00 UTC/08:00 a.m. ET on November 18, 2025. Led by MDA, the mission deployed a government-provided primary payload developed by the John Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, and multiple secondary payloads by federal and industry partners, which tested key technologies for missile defense applications. The mission was contracted to Rocket Lab through the DIU’s Hypersonic and High-Cadence Airborne Testing Capabilities (HyCAT) program, an initiative supporting test and evaluation of new and emerging hypersonic technologies through low cost, responsive and long endurance flight testing. The mission launched within 14 months of contract signing, demonstrating streamlined operational benefits for government customers through Rocket Lab’s commercial speed, innovation, and efficiency. The mission also exemplified the cost and schedule savings that commercial liquid launch vehicles can bring to the MDA test community for developmental testing, non-traditional targets testing, and risk-reduction payload testing activities. Rocket Lab’s Vice President Global Launch Services, Brian Rogers, says: “HASTE is an important platform for accelerating hypersonic technology readiness for the nation, and we’re proud to be delivering this mission for DIU and MDA.” LtCol Nicholas Estep, Director of DIU’s Emerging Technology Portfolio, says: “Accessing the commercial and non-traditional ecosystem is a key enabler to accelerating progress in the hypersonics community of interest, particularly for closing mission timelines and driving towards mass and affordability. Working with MDA to demonstrate commercially-focused sub-orbital launch services is a great example of that axiom.” The mission was Rocket Lab’s sixth launch of its HASTE rocket since the launch vehicle’s debut in 2023. A suborbital variant of Electron - the world’s most frequently launched small orbital rocket - HASTE includes much of the same innovative technology as Electron, including carbon fiber composite structures and 3D printed rocket engines, but has a modified upper Kick Stage tailored for hypersonic technology tests and a larger payload capacity. HASTE can deploy technologies at speeds of more than 7.5km per second to test air-breathing, glide, and ballistic payloads, as well as technologies to re-enter Earth’s atmosphere from space. Combined, the HASTE and Electron launch vehicles have deployed 200+ payloads for government and commercial customers to date.

Title: NY Gov. Kathy Hochul enlists Wall Street execs to talk Trump out of sending National Guard to NYC: report

Time Published: 2025-11-18T17:18:09Z
Full Content:
New York Gov. Kathy Hochul is reportedly teaming up with Wall Street executives in an effort to talk President Trump out of sending National Guard troops to New York City in the wake of socialist Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s victory earlier this month. A top aide to Hochul, a Dem, has reached out to leaders of the Big Apple’s finance industry in hopes of convincing the Republican Trump administration to refrain from deploying federal troops to the city — arguing that doing so would harm the economy, according to The Wall Street Journal. Jackie Bray, Hochul’s director of homeland security and emergency services, is spearheading the effort and has reportedly met one-on-one with top executives in New York to get their buy-in. According to The Journal, Bray shared data with executives showing that National Guard troop deployments would harm local businesses, as well as tourism. Hochul’s team has yet to ask business leaders to convey the concerns directly to Trump since there is no immediate threat of a federal takeover, the publication reported. Along with sending the National Guard to the city, Trump has reportedly weighed funding cuts in response to Mamdani’s shocking victory. The mayor-elect has promised to stop all cooperation with federal authorities on combating illegal immigration — restoring New York’s status to what he called the “strongest sanctuary city” in the country. The Post has sought comment from the White House and Hochul. New York State officials are trying to follow the example of San Francisco, where Democratic Mayor Daniel Luri enlisted the helpf of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce boss Marc Benioff. The billionaire tech moguls reportedly managed to persuade Trump to stand down from his original plan to send National Guard troops into the city earlier this year. Trump recently hosted some of finance’s most powerful figures — including JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, hedge fund mogul Bill Ackman and BlackRock chief Larry Fink — at the White House. The Post was the first to report that Trump picked their brains for ideas on how to make things more affordable for everyday Americans. Among the corporate leaders who took part in the meeting were Morgan Stanley’s Ted Pick, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon and Blackstone boss Steve Schwarzman. Since his return to the White House earlier this year, Trump has ordered deployments of National Guard units and federal law enforcement to several major US cities — mostly Dem-led. He’s said the moves are needed to address violent crime, homelessness, illegal immigration and protests. The deployments in Los Angeles, Washington, DC, Chicago, Portland and Memphis have triggered legal challenges and sharp criticism from state and local officials who argue the moves overstep presidential authority.

Title: Layoff notices flared in October across much of U.S., Fed report shows
URL: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/layoffs-warn-notices-october-employment-economy-federal-reserve-report/
Time Published: 2025-11-18T17:16:30Z
Full Content:
Watch CBS News November 18, 2025 / 12:16 PM EST / CBS News Impending layoff notices across much of the U.S. surged in October, highlighting signs of stress in the job market. Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland shows that 39,006 Americans last month in 21 states received a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, or WARN, notice informing them of an upcoming layoff. U.S. labor law requires employers to provide these written warnings 60 days ahead of plant closings or mass layoffs. It represents one of the highest numbers of WARN notices since Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland researchers started tracking the data in January 2006, although the tally remains below the spikes recorded during the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 pandemic. Layoff notices across the 21 states tracked by the Cleveland Fed reached a peak of more than 550,000 in March 2020. Major companies including Target, Amazon and UPS have announced rounds of job cuts in recent weeks, with some economists noting that the labor market appears to be weakening. The record-long government shutdown has also delayed two months' worth of federal jobs data, creating a blind spot in assessing U.S. employment conditions. Despite the lack of official government data, some other measures point to a cooling U.S. labor market. For example, outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas recently said that layoffs last month soared to their highest October level in 22 years, while ADP data released Tuesday shows U.S. companies shed an average of 2,500 jobs per week in the four weeks ending Nov. 1. Some experts warn that the latest layoffs may be only an early sign of broader cutbacks yet to come. Pantheon Macroeconomics economists Samuel Tombs and Oliver Allen said in a Monday email that they expect layoffs to pick up next year amid wider AI adoption, while noting that the technology has had a "net positive impact" on the labor market so far this year. The delayed September employment report, which will be released Thursday, will provide another barometer on the health of the U.S. labor market. Economists polled by financial data provider FactSet predict payroll gains of 50,000. Edited by Aimee Picchi © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Google Says New Gemini 3 AI Model Will Better Understand Your Requests
URL: https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/google-says-new-gemini-3-ai-model-will-better-understand-your-requests/
Time Published: 2025-11-18T16:03:00Z

Gemini 3 is available to all users in the Gemini app, along with powering AI Mode in Google Search. Google Gemini 3 Gemini 3, the latest AI model from Google, is the company's most intelligent model to date, with more advanced multimodal and vibe coding capabilities, the company said in a blog post on Tuesday. It's available now. Google says Gemini 3 is "built to grasp depth and nuance" and is better at understanding the intent behind a user's request. The company also touted Gemini 3's multimodal capabilities, such as its ability to turn a long video lecture into interactive flash cards or to analyze a person's pickleball match and find areas for improvement. Gemini 3 isn't limited to the app. It'll also be available in AI Mode in Search and, for Pro and Ultra subscribers, in AI Overviews. In AI Overviews, Gemini 3 can generate interactive elements. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source. Google DeepMind's Demis Hassabis and Koray Kavukcuoglu said in a blog post that Gemini 3 Pro is less sycophantic, a problem that's been plaguing AIs and leading to AI psychosis in some. It's also more secure against prompt injection attacks, in which bad actors try to make an AI ignore its original instructions and perform unintended actions. The company also unveiled Google Antigravity, a new agentic development platform. Google says Antigravity is like having an active partner while making tools or working on projects, autonomously planning and executing complex software tasks while validating its own code. It works in tandem with Gemini 2.5's Computer Use model for browser control and works with nano banana, Gemini 2.5's image model. Gemini 3's new, more powerful, agentic capabilities will only be available to $250/month Google AI Ultra subscribers at first. This will allow the Gemini Agent to do multi-step workflows, like planning a travel itinerary. Read more: AI Essentials: 29 Ways You Can Make Gen AI Work for You, According to Our Experts Google's release of Gemini 3 comes as an AI war is heating up between it, OpenAI, Anthropic and xAI. Google's consistently been leading AI leaderboards, although other AI models haven't been far behind, sometimes trading spots at the top. With the release of Gemini 3, Google seems to be trying to solve for some of AI's more annoying problems, like hallucinations or sycophancy. It's also trying to prove that AIs can be truly agentic, being able to accomplish tasks on the user's behalf. Other agentic models have proven to be problematic in real-world usage and run into various security concerns, especially in web browsers. The latest AI release from Google also comes at a time when there are fears of an AI bubble forming in the stock market. AI companies, including Nvidia, Google, Meta and Microsoft, account for 30% of the S&P 500. Google currently has a valuation of $3.4 trillion. Even Google CEO Sundar Pichai says the trillion-dollar AI investment boom has "elements of irrationality" and that a burst would affect every AI company, he said in an interview with the BBC. Still, if Google is to keep its stock price moving upward, it needs to demonstrate that its AI models beat the competition. AI exists in Google Search currently in two ways: via AI Overviews and through AI Mode. AI Overviews is the window that appears under your search query in which a smaller AI model tries to quickly answer your questions. AI Overviews is a separate tab in Search, alongside Images, Shopping, News and Videos that runs a more advanced model allowing users to converse with it. It's like using Gemini, but without having to go to main Gemini website. As of now, Gemini 3 is in AI Mode, but only for those that pay for a Google AI Pro or Ultra subscription. Gemini 3 enhancements are also available in AI Overviews, but only for subscribers. Gemini 3 Pro is available in AI Mode for subscribers as well. In AI Mode, Google is touting Gemini's ability to take existing information and create bespoke UI elements. This magazine style view will incorporate interactable widgets, images and videos. For example, if researching mortgages, Gemini can create a custom calculator to help you compare terms and savings options. Google Search uses a "fan-out" technique to pull information from across the web. With Gemini 3's advanced reasoning, Google says Search can uncover more information on the web and intelligently understand your intent.

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. A train of SpaceX's Starlink satellites caught on camera above Auckland. Photo / Sky Photography Ltd Should we be thinking more broadly about sustainability, rather than just how it relates to climate emissions? Fran O’Sullivan introduces the Sustainable Business and Finance Report. Billionaire Elon Musk plans to use Starlink technology to create AI data centres in space. Writing on X (formerly Twitter) Musk said Starship could deliver 100GW/year to high Earth orbit within 4 to 5 years “if we can solve the other parts of the equation”. “100TW/year is possible from a lunar base producing solar-powered AI satellites locally and accelerating them to escape velocity with a mass driver.” It all sounds a bit “sci-fi”, right from the playbook of space visionary Gerard K. O’Neill, author of The High Frontier, perhaps? But Musk and SpaceX plan to connect data centres in orbit by scaling up next-generation Starlink V3 satellites connected through high-speed laser links to form a decentralised computing network. What’s driving this is the need to power the increasing computational demands of the disruptive artificial intelligence technologies fast transforming business and economies. AI data centres suck up a great deal of electrical power. This is one reason why nuclear power is back in vogue to reduce the need for more fossil-fuelled electricity grids. But nuclear comes with a very large price tag. The beauty of putting AI data centres in orbit is that they are powered by continuous sunlight and cooled by radiating their heat into deep space. Their protagonists predict space-based data centres would use less energy, zero fresh water, and far lower emissions than their terrestrial counterparts. Others have joined the race. Starcloud co-founders Philip Johnston, Ezra Feilden, and Adi Oltean built a working prototype in just 15 months, making history by launching a satellite with an NVIDIA H100 into orbit — the first time a GPU that powerful has ever operated in space. It all sounds so simple - and perhaps it is. CarbonBrief reports data centres are very geographically concentrated, both in terms of their global distribution and within leading countries. Today, nearly half of their electricity consumption takes place in the US, 25% in China and 15% in Europe, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). It’s still a first-world problem. Data centres are now responsible for just over 1% of global electricity demand and 0.5% of CO2 emissions, according to IEA data. The world is entering what the IEA describes as a “new age of electricity”, in which the electrification of transport, buildings and industry drives a surge in demand for power. It’s only in recent decades that solar-powered grids have become run of the mill along with electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles — so this is very possible. Problem is, this is all at a margin. Microsoft founder Bill Gates now says that while climate change will cause serious harm, it will not lead to ‘humanity’s demise’. We’re now in a world where the very idea of national sustainability is an issue. Indigenous people rioting at COP30 in Brazil are at the sharp end. As we report today, significant New Zealand businesses are wedded to doing their part to address the climate challenge. But the Government is now under fire for taking its foot off the pedal when it comes to prosecuting the need to make deeper inroads towards “net zero” carbon emissions. Climate Change Minister Simon Watts has the unenviable challenge of fronting the Government’s position against charges of back-pedalling by his Labour opponent Deborah Russell and incisive academic analysis on that score. The emissions trading scheme is not a busted flush but it is increasingly looking more logical to have a simple carbon tax. Sustainability is a relatively simple concept in the business world. Perhaps we should be thinking more broadly than how it relates to climate emissions. In a thought-provoking article, Alex Worker raises the question of the sustainability of farmers’ incomes in a Kiwi food-producing industry increasingly subject to foreign takeover. If our farmers become price-takers and miss out on substantial profits accruing to international owners where does that leave the economy longer-term? Fonterra remains a New Zealand-owned co-operative. But other firms are increasingly passing to 100% outside control or into mixed ownership. There are other vulnerabilities. The management of New Zealand’s freshwater resource is critical and that has yet to play out so all interests are taken into account. Energy security is another area where confidence has eroded. Escalating electricity prices have sparked the closure of a number of manufacturing plants in Nelson and the Central North Island. Natural gas supplies are running down. The Government has yet to comprehensively address this. Overshadowing these domestic concerns are the challenges to ESG (environment, social, governance) norms in a world where national security has been challenged by the invasion of Ukraine. European stock exchanges have kicked the traditional definition of ESG investing to the curb, rebranding it as “energy, security and geostrategy”. That’s the upshot of the determined political push under way to boost European defence companies and reduce Nato’s reliance on US armaments after the Trump administration savaged the region for not spending enough on its own security. What’s at stake is not small bikkies. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen believes the EU could mobilise up to €800 billion ($1.55 trillion) to strengthen its defence industry. There are also opportunities for Kiwi companies like Dawn Aerospace, with its dual base in the Netherlands and New Zealand. Some key climate influencers are now recalcitrants. Microsoft founder Bill Gates now says that while climate change will cause serious harm, it will not lead to “humanity’s demise”, and the global strategy should shift its focus to other areas like disease control. Formerly a leading proponent for carbon emissions reductions, Gates now argues climate change is not going to wipe out humanity and past efforts that strive for achieving zero carbon emissions have made little real progress. In the United States, BlackRock founder and CEO Larry Fink has also shifted emphasis. BlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager with US$12.5 trillion assets under management as of 2025. In his latest letter, Fink’s prior focuses on sustainability, climate change, and diversity, equity and inclusion were notably absent as he pushed for more energy production and the expansion of nuclear power. Fink’s new themes are all about energy pragmatism and stakeholder capitalism. Tell that to the COP30 protesters. Click here for more Sustainable Business & Finance stories.

Time Published: 2025-11-18T15:30:11Z

Crypto exchange Binance has announced that BlackRock’s tokenized fund, BUIDL, will now be accepted as collateral on the platform. This comes as the tokenized fund expands to the BNB chain, a move welcomed by the exchange’s former CEO, Changpeng Zhao. Binance has partnered with BlackRock’s BUIDL to expand its collateral offerings for institutional off-exchange settlement services, Binance Banking Triparty, and MirrorRSV. The exchange has now added support for BUIDL, which is a tokenized short-term U.S. Treasury fund. The exchange explained that its Banking Triparty is a custodial solution designed for institutions that separates asset custody from trading execution. With this, users can trade on the crypto platform by pledging fiat or fiat-equivalent collateral such as BlackRock’s BUIDL, which a regulated third-party banking partner will hold. Meanwhile, the crypto exchange also explained that MirrorRSV is an off-exchange custody solution provided by Ceffu, its institutional crypto custody partner. MirrorRSV allows users to trade on Binance while the assets remain in segregated cold wallets and can be verified on-chain. The exchange noted that this gives institutions enhanced transparency and auditability while retaining access to the exchange’s liquidity. This move is expected to boost institutional crypto adoption, as these options are meant to provide easy access to the crypto space. Binance also announced that BlackRock’s BUIDL will launch on the BNB Chain, further enhancing access and interoperability across on-chain applications. The tokenized fund is already supported on the Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and Aptos networks. The fund is also available on Ethereum layer-2 networks such as Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism. Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao commented on BlackRock BUIDL’s partnership with Binance and its launch on BNB. He welcomed BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, to the crypto platform and the BNB Chain, noting that BlackRock manages $13 trillion in assets under management (AUM), making the deal a major one for crypto. Notably, Franklin Templeton, which has $1.53 trillion in AUM, also recently launched its tokenization platform, BENJI, on BNB. Binance stated that through the BlackRock BUIDL integration, its institutional users can now hold the tokenized fund off-exchange with Ceffu and Binance’s regulated, third-party banking partners. That way, they will be able to earn yield on their collateral while also trading on the crypto exchange. The crypto exchange added that this move will effectively address user needs, enable confident scaling of allocations, and ensure regulatory compliance. BlackRock’s BUIDL joins other supported yield-bearing assets on Binance, which include USYC and cUSDO, which were integrated earlier this year. Crypto pundit Coachty noted that the partnership is TradFi-crypto convergence in real time. He added that BUIDL is becoming the go-to institutional asset in the tokenization boom and that the flow of capital into on-chain RWAs is only getting started.

Title: Will the price be right? What shoppers can expect for the holiday season
URL: https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/11/18/shoppers-prices-holiday-season/
Time Published: 2025-11-18T15:00:20Z
Full Content:
By Candice Williams and Myesha Johnson, The Detroit News FERNDALE, Michigan — Concerned about this year’s holiday season, the owners of Modern Natural Baby and Kids planned ahead. In addition to mailing out 10,000 Christmas catalogs for the first time, the store opened a warehouse to house more inventory, including stuffed animals and books. “We bought a lot of this stuff in March and April when we were worried about tariffs and not having stuff available for Christmas,” said Emily Murray, who co-owns the Ferndale store with her husband, John. “We’ve been buying this stuff for a long time this year, and we have a warehouse that we’ve never had before, so primarily that was a result of tariffs.” Retailers are preparing for a holiday season clouded by tariffs, inflation and economic uncertainty. Consumers will see higher prices, fewer deep discounts and tighter inventory in some categories. As a result, they are expected to be more selective with their purchases, trading down on everyday items like groceries to afford higher-priced gifts. Deloitte projects that overall holiday spending will decline about 10% this year as consumers spend less due to economic concerns, while Adobe Analytics expects online holiday sales to rise about 5%, pointing to the strength of e-commerce even among increasingly budget-conscious households. Despite these mixed forecasts, retailers remain optimistic that holiday sales will improve over slower traffic earlier this year. “We’ve had such a long season of decline,” said Vic Veda, vice president of communications for the Michigan Retailers Association. “We’re continually hoping that we’re going to turn that corner. Seeing our retail index as high as it is for the outlook at the end of the year really tells us that retailers are very much looking forward to this holiday shopping season and hoping that the holidays will get folks back a little more compared to what they were this summer.” According to the Michigan Retailers Association, about 63% of retailers surveyed expect sales to increase through the end of the year, one of the highest outlooks in recent months. Of those surveyed, 31% said they anticipate their sales will decline, while 6% expect no change. Veda said robust Halloween spending could point to a stronger-than-expected holiday season; the National Retail Federation projected sales would total a record $13.1 billion. She said that while inventory levels are generally stable, smaller stores face greater uncertainty due to tariffs and limited funds to buy ahead. Overall, prices of goods are expected to keep increasing due to the tariffs and inflation, said Juan Mundel, associate professor of advertising and public relations at Michigan State University. “Prices are expected to be higher this season, and while retailers are going to introduce discounts … consumers should not expect the same prices as last year,” he said. Then there’s the issue of leaner supply. Stanley Lim, assistant professor of supply chain management at Michigan State, advises shoppers to buy early if they see something they want. This year’s retail challenges stem mostly from economic pressures, particularly rising logistics costs and tariffs. “The supply chain isn’t broken … but it’s definitely running a lot leaner and more compact than before,” he said. “And so retailers will not feel the tinge of not having the stock or missing the containers, but (instead) maybe longer replenishment cycles and tighter margins. So they may be more selective in terms of what items they want to make available on the shelf this holiday season.” Lim said many retailers are launching promotions at the beginning of November to get ahead of Black Friday, and even offering price guarantees to assure customers that early purchases will match any later markdowns. Some retailers have already announced Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals. For example, Walmart offered a sneak peek last week of its first Black Friday Deals event that begins Nov. 14 online and in-store. The retailer is promoting what it calls its biggest lineup of deals, including “thousands of deals under $20,” John Furner, president and CEO of Walmart U.S., said in a statement. Earlier this month, Meijer announced an early promotion of double mPerks savings on toys through Nov. 4, as well as the return of its Santa Bucks during select weeks in November and December. The retailer said it has hundreds of toys and gifts priced under $10, $20 and $30. Mundel said Black Friday sales are ideal for consumers shopping for items like TVs and sportswear, while Cyber Monday will offer the best overall deals of the season. “After Cyber Monday, prices will continue to increase, leading to the holiday season,” he said. Consumers will likely trade down on everyday goods like groceries and cosmetics to free up money for higher-priced gifts such as electronics and video games. According to Deloitte, consumers are expected to spend an average of $1,595 this holiday season, down 10% from $1,778 in 2024. A majority of shoppers, 70%, plan to shop during the Thanksgiving week, up slightly from 68% in 2024. Traffic is expected to peak between late November and early December, including shopping events on Thanksgiving Day, Black Friday, Small Business Saturday and Cyber Monday. One recent weekend at Modern Natural Baby and Kids, shoppers including Marisa Vinsky, 31, and Jon Young, 34, took advantage of the store’s free gift wrapping service. The Lansing, Michigan, couple bought a pop-up book that says “Hello” in seven languages as well as a sensory, weighted stuffed octopus for a 10-month-old baby girl. Vinsky said she’d be shopping again online and at big-box stores like Costco and Home Depot around Black Friday in search of the best deals for an electric meat smoker for Young. “The way the economy is right now … I typically shop online,” she said. “I don’t really go to stores, and that’s how I find things. One year, I got him a KitchenAid, and that was really easy to find online. I can imagine that with the economy and how much everything is being raised with tariffs, I can imagine the prices are going to be higher than average.” At Twelve Oaks Mall in Novi, Michigan, last week, holiday decorations were already on display amid preparations for Santa’s visit this week. General Manager Scott Lofton said he expects the mall to be busy during the holiday shopping season, especially on Black Friday. Sisters Constance Laderoot and Chibwe Powell, both in their 40s, brought their mother to the mall to walk around. They weren’t holiday shopping just yet — instead, they picked up some clothing for themselves. Laderoot said she thinks Black Friday shopping habits have changed, with fewer people lining up before dawn for deals. She said she’d like to see retailers offer more in-person deals and increase the number of items available at discount prices. “I think most of us have scaled back a little, right?” she said. “So most people are doing online shopping, and then there’s some in-person shopping.” Powell said she plans to start holiday shopping right after Thanksgiving, adding that because she also has some birthday gifts to buy: “I start shopping early.” She’s looking forward to Macy’s perfume deals during the holidays. “Macy’s perfume situation, when it happens, it’s impressive,” she said. Black Friday is still relevant, Powell said. “It’s just been a tradition. You don’t want to always go away from the tradition. I remember being nine months pregnant and shopping.” Elle Dare, owner of Genuine Toys in Plymouth, Michigan, said preparing for this year’s holiday season has been especially challenging because tariffs have disrupted toy production and driven up prices. “The toys that are produced for Christmas are made in the summer, and they stopped production because of tariffs,” she said. “So it’s spotty getting things in. Some things we know aren’t going to come in until January. One company, we get a box every other day of just one item. It’s hard.” Dare said she hopes to have the store fully stocked by mid-November, ahead of Black Friday and Small Business Saturday. Vendors can’t guarantee delivery dates since overseas shipments take about eight weeks and face customs and tariff delays once they reach U.S. ports. “I would tell people, if you see it now, get it,” she said. “If it does sell out, there’s no way we’re ever going to get another shipment before the holidays.” Prices have increased due to tariffs. For example, an item that used to sell for $50 is now going to be $65. “At $50, it was a good deal, but will our customers be willing to pay $65 for it?” she said. “This is such an odd situation.” MSU’s Lim said price increases due to tariffs are based on factors such as the product category and country of origin. “Some (retailers) may be willing to absorb the cost, the additional cost to gain demand and loyalty, but others may not have sufficient margins to absorb, and so they will have to then pass down to the customers,” he said. Some shoppers have already finished their holiday buying, Dare said, anticipating further price increases, while others are waiting to see what happens. She said some families may focus on one main gift for their children and supplement with a few less-expensive gifts. “Even if the tariffs ended today, the tariffs have still been paid on the toys that are in the warehouses, so that cost still has to be passed on,” she said. “They wouldn’t immediately come down.” Among the most popular products are Calico Critters and Smiskis, small collectible figurines sold at a handful of stores in Michigan. Genuine Toys limits purchases to two per customer due to high demand, Dare said. Modern Natural Baby and Kids has already seen an influx of customers for the holiday season, said John Murray. The store carries brands including Jellycat and Sam & Julia. “It’s insane already,” he said. “People have already started shopping. That’s the crazy part about it. Everybody’s kind of afraid that there’s not going to be inventory. … Everybody’s worried not that there’s not going to be toys, but will the best toys be available.” The store employs 10 people, adding three staff members for the holiday season. “It’s going to help us out for the holiday season having the extra help,” said Emily Murray. Larger retailers are also hiring seasonal workers to handle an increase in shoppers. For example, Target is offering additional hours to current employees and hiring seasonal team members across its nearly 2,000 stores and more than 60 supply chain facilities. Amazon said it is creating 250,000 seasonal positions nationwide, including 6,500 jobs in Michigan. At Genuine Toys, Dare said she’s adding two workers to a staff of five. Catching Fireflies plans to add three to five part-time workers at each of its locations in Berkley, Rochester and Ann Arborm, Michigan, to meet expected holiday demand. The store sells whimsical gifts, including novelty socks, kitchen gadgets and specialty cookbooks. “Twenty percent of our sales happen in the month of December alone,” said owner April McCrumb. “Hanukkah and Christmas definitely play a huge part in our retail success. Once the holidays kick in, that’s when a lot of profit from being in the gift business comes.” ©2025 www.detroitnews.com. Visit at detroitnews.com. Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

Title: A Decade In The Making, HaptX Team Debuts Full Body VR Haptics

ByCharlie Fink, Contributor. In 2017 I visited a small VR startup called AxonVR in Seattle. Founder Jake Rubin showed me concept art for a full body suspension system. A user hung in mid air inside a frame, held in place by a network of supports that allowed the arms and legs to move freely. The idea was simple to state and difficult to build. They wanted to create total immersion by capturing every motion and returning physical feedback across the user’s entire body. It looked like something from a futurist exhibit. It also captured the ambition of a team that believed VR needed more than visuals and audio to be useful. The suspension system never shipped. AxonVR changed its name to HaptX and shifted its focus to haptic gloves powered by microfluidics. The team found immediate demand for precise tactile feedback in robotics, training, and design. Gloves became the company’s core product. Enterprise customers used them to train medical staff, evaluate automotive prototypes, and operate remote manipulators. Defense agencies incorporated them into medic training modules. Robotics groups relied on them for fine motor teleoperation. That focus eventually reshaped the company. HaptX began working closely with a manufacturing group called Advanced Input Systems. The partnership deepened over the years and expanded again in 2024. The gloves became a supported product line inside the broader organization. The combined entity adopted the name 1HMX. Rubin and members of his team became part of the larger company. The resources available to them changed. The manufacturing footprint now spans several continents. The gloves matured into a stable commercial product with a large global customer base. Last week Rubin reached out again. The note contained a link to a new system called Nexus NX1. It launches next week under the 1HMX brand. Rubin told me it is the closest thing the company has ever built to the suspended full body concept they sketched ten years ago. The visual form is different. The purpose is the same. The Nexus NX1 joins three mature products in one turnkey system. The HaptX Gloves G1 provide detailed tactile and force feedback. The Virtuix Omni One provides a platform that enables a user to walk in any direction while remaining stationary in physical space. Freeaim robotic shoes add natural stride and foot movement. The system tracks seventy two degrees of freedom across the hands and body. It captures posture, limb rotation, foot placement, center of mass, and soft tissue movement. It returns real time tactile information from hundreds of points on the fingers and palms. The result is a body scale interface that can control both virtual characters and physical robots. Users can walk, reach, grasp, and lift with realistic feedback. Developers can collect data describing how skilled workers move through complex tasks. Robotics teams can link the system to a humanoid robot and observe how a trained operator performs precise motions. Training groups can use it to rehearse procedures inside simulated environments. The introduction video shows the intended use. A person walks inside the Omni platform. The shoes move with the surface. Every gesture and shift in balance flows through the system. A humanoid robot mirrors the movements. The user receives touch and pressure information through the gloves. It is not a suspended rig. It is grounded. The experience is shaped by the strengths of the components. I asked Rubin how closely Nexus NX1 matches the vision he described in 2017. He said it aligns with the goal the team set when they were still called AxonVR. Full body input, full body output, and real physical response. The form changed. The intention remained. Preorders for Nexus NX1 open November 18 with shipments expected in second quarter 2026. It marks a return to the idea that started the company. AxonVR imagined a full body system before the industry had a way to build it. The version arriving now comes from a far larger organization with the scale to produce it.

Title: Defiance ETFs Launches RKLZ: the First 2X Short ETF of Rocket Lab Corporation

November 18, 2025 08:44 ET | Source: Defiance ETFs Defiance ETFs MIAMI, Nov. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Defiance ETFs proudly announces the launch of the Defiance Daily Target 2X Short RKLB ETF (Ticker: RKLZ), expanding its family of single-stock leveraged ETFs designed for sophisticated traders seeking tactical exposure to high-growth innovation companies. RKLZ seeks to deliver -200% of the daily percentage change in the share price of Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB), offering investors an instrument to express short-term bearish views on a leading player in the space launch and aerospace manufacturing industry. Investment Objective The Fund seeks daily inverse investment results, before fees and expenses, of -2 times (-200%) the daily percentage change in the share price of Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB). The Fund does not seek to achieve its stated investment objective for a period other than a single trading day. Underlying Stock: Rocket Lab Corporation Rocket Lab Corporation is an end-to-end space company delivering reliable launch services, spacecraft components, and on-orbit management solutions. As one of the leading providers of small satellite launch services, Rocket Lab develops and operates its Electron and Neutron launch vehicles, as well as the Photon spacecraft platform. The company’s mission is to open access to space to improve life on Earth, supporting a wide range of applications across defense, research, and commercial communications sectors. An investment in RKLZ is not an investment in Rocket Lab Corporation The Fund is not suitable for all investors. The Fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged inverse (–2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage, and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. The Fund is not intended to be used by, and is not appropriate for, investors who do not intend to actively monitor and manage their portfolios. The Fund pursues daily leveraged inverse investment objectives, which means it is riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage. The Fund magnifies the inverse performance of the Underlying Security and is designed strictly for short-term use. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund’s performance will be the result of compounded daily returns, which is very likely to differ from –200% of the return of RKLB over the same period. It is possible investors could lose their entire principal within a single trading day. IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES Defiance ETFs LLC is the ETF sponsor. The Fund’s investment adviser is Tidal Investments, LLC (“Tidal” or the “Adviser”). The Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses must be considered carefully before investing. The prospectus and summary prospectus contain this and other important information about the investment company. Please read the prospectus and/or summary prospectus carefully before investing. Hard copies can be requested by calling 833.333.9383. Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. As an ETF, the Fund may trade at a premium or discount to NAV. Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. A portfolio concentrated in a single issuer or sector may be subject to a higher degree of risk. There is no guarantee the Fund’s strategy will be properly implemented, and an investor may lose some or all of their investment. RKLB Price Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s inverse investment strategy, the Fund enters into swap contracts and options contracts based on the share price of Rocket Lab Corporation (“RKLB”) common stock (the “Underlying Security”). This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted shares of the Underlying Security, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect -2X exposure to changes in the share price of the Underlying Security, the Fund is subject to the risk that the Underlying Security’s share price increases. If the share price of the Underlying Security increases, the Fund will likely lose value and may suffer significant losses. The Fund may also be subject to the following risks: Indirect Investment in RKLB Risk. Rocket Lab Corporation is not affiliated with the Trust, the Fund, the Adviser, or their respective affiliates, and is not involved with this offering in any way. RKLB has no obligation to consider the Fund or its shareholders in taking any corporate actions that might affect the value of Fund shares. RKLB Good Performance Risk. The market value of Rocket Lab Corporation may increase if the company achieves or exceeds its business goals, expands its partnerships with government or commercial clients, or benefits from favorable policy, funding, or market sentiment toward the aerospace and satellite sectors. Innovations in propulsion and launch vehicle technology, successful missions, or heightened investor enthusiasm could further contribute to stock price appreciation, adversely impacting the Fund’s inverse exposure. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific factors may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than diversified investments. The Fund focuses on a single equity security and may fluctuate sharply compared to the broader market. Compounding and Market Volatility Risk. The Fund’s performance for periods greater than a trading day will result from each day’s returns compounded over time, likely differing from -200% of the Underlying Security’s performance before fees and expenses. Compounding effects are magnified during volatile markets and extended holding periods. Daily Correlation/Tracking Risk. There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve a high degree of inverse correlation to RKLB’s share performance. Market disruptions or high volatility may cause the Fund’s exposure to exceed or fall short of its target -200% objective. Leverage Risk. The Fund will seek -2X inverse exposure through financial instruments such as swaps and options, which can amplify both gains and losses. Leverage increases volatility, and losses may exceed the Underlying Security’s gains on any given day. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to the risk that counterparties to its derivative positions may default, experience insolvency, or fail to perform obligations. The Fund may be unable to recover its investment or experience delays in recovery. Derivatives and Options Risk. The Fund’s investments in swaps and options involve heightened risks including market volatility, imperfect correlation with underlying securities, and liquidity or valuation challenges. Option contracts, in particular, are influenced by actual and anticipated volatility and can rapidly change in value. Fixed Income Securities Risk. When the Fund invests in fixed income securities, their value will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Rising rates typically cause declines in fixed income prices, particularly for longer-duration instruments. Other factors such as credit, extension, and prepayment risks may also negatively affect the Fund’s NAV. Rebalancing Risk. If the Fund cannot rebalance its portfolio or rebalances incorrectly, its exposure may deviate materially from its -2X investment objective, increasing risk and reducing performance accuracy. Non-Diversification Risk. As a non-diversified fund, the Fund may invest a greater percentage of assets in a single issuer or small number of issuers, resulting in greater potential loss. Liquidity Risk. Derivative positions or certain underlying securities may become illiquid during periods of market stress, impeding the Fund’s ability to meet its investment objective. New Fund Risk. The Fund is newly organized and has a limited operating history, which may increase uncertainty in achieving its investment goals. Diversification does not ensure a profit nor protect against loss in a declining market. Brokerage commissions may apply.

Title: Man (25) continues to be questioned over killing of woman near Cork home
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/crime-law/2025/11/18/man-25-continues-to-be-questioned-over-killing-of-woman-near-cork-home/

Full Content:
Gardaí are continuing to question a 25-year-old man about the killing of a woman and a knife attack on her husband near their Co Cork home on Monday night. Stella Gallagher (59) was fatally injured and her husband, Brian (63), seriously injured when they were attacked by a man armed with a knife at their detached two-storey home in Shrewsbury Downs in Ballinlough at about 9pm. It is understood the couple fled their home, Ms Gallagher going in to a neighbour’s house to escape the attacker while Mr Gallagher tried to distract the man, who picked up a flowerpot and smashed a window in the neighbour’s house to try to gain entry. Ms Gallagher fled the neighbour’s house and Mr Gallagher again tried to divert the attacker away from his wife. However, he was attacked by the man and suffered a number of knife wounds to the upper body, including a very serious slash wound to his neck. It is understood the attacker then pursued Ms Gallagher to a green area about 45m (50 yards) from their home where he caught up with her and stabbed her a number of times, resulting in her suffering a number of catastrophic injuries. Neighbours had raised the alarm and members of the Garda Armed Support Unit (ASU) were first on the scene. Some of the ASU officers detained the man, who had discarded the knife, as other officers began performing CPR on the injured couple. HSE advanced paramedics quickly arrived and took over the care of the couple before they rushed them by ambulance to Cork University Hospital (CUH) where both underwent surgery. However, Ms Gallagher succumbed to her injuries and died some time before midnight. Mr Gallagher was described on Tuesday as being in a stable but serious condition. Gardaí hope to be given permission by CUH doctors to speak to him over the coming days as they try to piece together the sequence of events leading up to the attack. Both the Gallaghers were chemical engineers who had retired in recent years. Mr Gallagher had retired from PM Group, where he was a company director, and Ms Gallagher from pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly, where she worked under her maiden name, Stella Griffin. It is understood that Ms Gallagher had taken a five-year career break from Eli Lilly some years back for family reasons and then returned to work for around two years before her retirement from the company two years ago. The couple have one daughter and three sons in their 20s. The eldest, Ciara, is a doctor in Australia and she and the youngest, Mark, a student in Amsterdam, are on their way home while their middle sons, David and Conor, were both in Cork when the tragedy happened. Mr Gallagher is a native of Blackrock in Co Louth and Ms Gallagher is from Ballinspittle in west Cork. In the 1980s she attended what was then the Cork Institute of Technology (now the Munster Technological University) where she obtained a BSc in chemical engineering. Gardaí arrested a 25-year-old suspect, who was known to the Gallaghers, at the scene and he was conveyed to the Bridewell Garda station for questioning. He was detained under Section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act which allows gardaí to detain suspects for up to 24 hours. Assistant State Pathologist Dr Margot Bolster carried out a postmortem on the body of Ms Gallagher at CUH and while the Garda has not released the results for operational reasons, it confirmed she had been the victim of a violent knife attack. Garda technical experts spent much of the day examining the Gallaghers’ home, the home of their neighbour and the green area where Ms Gallagher was attacked. They also recovered a kitchen knife which they believe was used in the fatal assault.

Title: Tom Lee Ascribes Ethereum’s Pain to Market-Makers, Not the Fed | US Crypto News

Written & Edited byLockridge Okoth Welcome to the US Crypto News Morning Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead. Grab a coffee and settle in, because the latest crypto pullback may not be what it seems, at least according to BitMine chair Tom Lee. Beneath the headlines and market jitters, a far more unexpected force may be driving Ethereum’s slump, one that has little to do with the Fed, and everything to do with crypto’s own plumbing. Ethereum may be suffering from one of its sharpest drawdowns of the year, but Fundstrat’s Tom Lee argues the real culprit is not the Federal Reserve (Fed). Rather, it is a sudden liquidity shock inside crypto itself. Speaking in a new interview, Lee said the October 10 washout unleashed the largest liquidation event in crypto history, wiping out players and potentially crippling key market-makers, creating what he calls a form of “crypto QT.” According to the BitMine chair, the market’s weakness stems from a combination of macro fear and internal structural stress. “There was this big liquidation event on October 10. One that really was a larger liquidation event than anything seen in history,” he explained. At the same time, crypto’s sensitivity to the interest-rate outlook has kept traders skittish. “If you end up with a hawkish Fed, it gets crypto investors very nervous.” However, for Ethereum specifically, Lee believes the more important factor is the quiet disappearance of crucial liquidity providers following the wipeout. “It does have the signs of that maybe a market maker or two actually is unable to provide market liquidity, and as you know, as liquidity contracts, it’s the same thing as the central bank tightening. So it’s almost like Crypto Qt,” he said. This internal liquidity drought, Lee argues, is why prices have lagged. “It does take a few weeks for the industry to sort of find its footing, and I think that’s why crypto prices have lagged here.” Despite the stress, Lee remains adamant that Ethereum is in the early stages of a long-term Supercycle. Perhaps this is why BitMine continues to accumulate, as reported in a recent US Crypto News publication. He points to surging activity across stablecoins, RWA tokenization, prediction markets, and emerging digital identity rails, most of which depend on Ethereum or its Layer 2 ecosystems. “Ethereum is a smart contract platform… It’s really the rails where I think a lot of things are going to be built,” he said. “Stablecoins… prediction markets… and now talk about tokenizing more than just dollars, but equities, real estate, and alternative assets… these are all rising.” To Lee, those data points reinforce the thesis that it is a story that is still in the earliest stages and one of the reasons why BitMine considers it a super cycle. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan echoed that view, calling the current environment a rare entry point. “I think regardless of what happens on the economy in the next year, stable coins will grow tremendously… tokenization will maybe 10x in the next few years… prediction markets are going to be huge… decentralized identity and digital identity are going to be huge,” he said. For investors looking long-term, he added, “it really is almost a gift.” One open question remains whether Bitcoin has already peaked for the cycle. Lee said the answer will shape how investors interpret the next year. “If Bitcoin makes a new high this year, then it really obviates the fact that there is a four-year cycle.” He expects broader market strength to carry into year-end, helping push Bitcoin back to all-time highs. In other words, the pain may be real, but the cycle is far from over.

Title: UK’s Pulse Films to end TV content production as parent company Vice Studios makes redundancies

Pulse Films was behind Gangs of London for Sky and AMC Gangs of London maker Pulse Films is to stop production of TV and film content after parent company Vice Studios Group made a number of layoffs in the UK. The celebrated scripted prodco, which this year celebrates its 20th anniversary and has made shows such as Netflix factual hit The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann and Sky action series Atomic, will now make only branded content, music videos and commercials. According to reports by Deadline, Vice has made layoffs in Pulse’s London headquarters, with all future scripted projects – such as a fourth season of Sky/AMC gangster series Gangs of London – to now be taken over by Vice Studios in LA. Vice Studios Group co-president Jamie Hall last week was named the new scripted MD for BBC Studios Productions, with the former Pulse Films chief operating officer and president of scripted TV set to take up his new role in January 2026. Vice Studios is led by former Amazon and Paramount executive Amy Powell, who was named president in May. In August, Vice raised US$75m via a new credit facility led by Western Alliance Bank, with plans to use the funds to support content investment through Vice Studios. The company said the credit facility was part of a larger five-year, US$500m investment in developing and producing scripted and unscripted content for TV, streaming and digital. Pulse was impacted in 2022 by the departures of founders and CEOs Thomas Benski and Marisa Clifford, who stepped down after 16 years at the prodco. Their departure came six years after the pair, who founded Pulse Films in 2005, sold a controlling interest to Vice Media Group. Benski subsequently joined forces with French actor Omar Sy (Lupin) and Hollywood director Louis Leterrier to launch scripted outfit Carrousel Studios in 2024, as well as rolling out talent- and IP-led media group and venture capital firm Lumina late last year. In September, Lumina made a seven-figure investment in creator-first UK management group Arcade, which represents YouTube collective The Sidemen.

Title: Fidelity, Canary ignite Solana’s ETF race – So why is retail pulling back?

Could this be the perfect setup for the next bull run? With the launch of FSOL and SOLC, there will be five active spot Solana ETFs in the market. Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas confirmed the news and called it a major milestone for Solana. The race to dominate the Solana [SOL] ETF market is heating up once again. This time, it’s Fidelity and Canary Capital stepping into the spotlight with the upcoming launch of the Fidelity Solana ETF (FSOL) and Canary Marinade Solana ETF (SOLC), both set to debut on the 18th of November. Once these funds go live, the crypto market will boast five active Spot Solana ETFs. Bloomberg’s Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted the launch as another milestone moment in Solana’s rapid ascent within the regulated investment landscape. Taking to X, Balchunas noted, “Fidelity recently rolled out *direct* spot solana trading…Tomorrow they’ll launch spot sol ETF.So both direct sol access & spot ETFs. World’s *third* largest asset manager. Welcome to the future.” However, he also expressed his disappointment and mentioned, “Still surprised BlackRock is sitting this one out.” While anticipation had been building that BlackRock might join the Solana ETF wave, the firm seemed content sticking to its established Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] offerings. In fact, in a recent interview, Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock’s Head of Digital Assets, dismissed the broader altcoin market, bluntly stating that “most of the altcoins are worthless.” He said, “One has to be very wary going far down the table with hundreds of thousands of crypto assets today. The vast majority of those are or will be totally worthless.” Meanwhile, Bloomberg’s James Seyffart also confirmed the Canary ETF listing, adding that issuers were competing aggressively for Solana dominance. Source: James Seyffart/X Yet, despite the wave of ETF launches and institutional excitement, SOL market performance told a different story. At press time, the token was trading at $136.80, down 3.24% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap, reflecting fading market enthusiasm. This showed that investor sentiment around the altcoin has cooled sharply. Data from Polymarket showed that traders assigned just 7% probability of SOL reaching a new all-time high before 2026, a steep fall from 60% odds in September at the height of ETF optimism. This downturn coincided with the debut of VanEck’s Solana ETF (VSOL) on the 17th of November, which officially began trading on Nasdaq after receiving regulatory clearance under the SEC’s updated ETF framework. Farside Investors data showed Solana ETF recording $8.2 million inflows at the same time, with Bitwise’s BSOL recording $7.3 million inflows and Grayscale’s GSOL recording $0.9 million inflows.

Stratechery Plus Learn MoreMember Forum Stratechery Plus Learn MoreMember Forum Latest Podcast Listen to Podcast Listen to this post: It was difficult in the beginning to answer the question I got from everyone: what’s it like living in America again? After all, I had been coming back to Wisconsin in the summer for years, and my move back happened in the summer; things mostly felt like more of the same. Then, the leaves started turning colors, the air became chillier, and, as daylight grew shorter I came to relish one decision in particular: living in the suburbs. There is much to be said for urban life, and I was certainly spoiled in that regard living in Taipei. It always seemed odd to answer the question “What is the best part about living in Taiwan?” with the word “Convenient”, but that’s the honest truth: everything you needed was within walking distance, the subway was extensive, clean, and reliable, and, once you understood that traffic was governed by the rule of rivers (the bigger you are the more right of way you have), driving really wasn’t that bad either. When my parents first moved away from Wisconsin I needed a new place to stay for the summers and, concerned about upkeep of an empty house in the harsh winter, I opted for a downtown condo; it helped that downtown Madison was a beehive of activity with the university and state government, and I liked the idea of walking everywhere. Then came COVID and the summer of 2020, and suddenly downtown wasn’t so busy anymore; I found myself driving more than I expected, and feeling rather sick of condos, which I had lived in my entire adult life. And so, when a house opened up near an old friend, I snapped it up, remodeled it to my liking and then, this past year, decided to live there full time. It’s fashionable to hate on the suburbs, particularly for millenials just a bit younger than I am; I was born at the tail-end of Generation X, and my experience in small town Wisconsin was one of leaving the house in the morning on my bike and not coming home until dinner, hopefully in one piece. It was, all things considered, pretty idyllic, but I can imagine that the clampdown on youth freedom that happened over the last few decades, along with the rise of indoor activities like video games and smartphones, made the suburbs feel increasingly alienating and isolating. What a relief to move to the big city, particularly in the 2010’s when Uber came along. There were, in the 2010s, few companies more contentious than Uber, and not just because of the scandals and willingness to operate in the gray area of the law. There was a massive debate over whether or not the company was even a viable business. Hubert Horan, in his seemingly never-ending series insisting that Uber would never be profitable, twice attacked me personally (and dishonestly) for believing that Uber would scale into profitability: One does not have to immediately accept all of those conclusions to see that Thompson’s various claims suggesting that Uber might someday have a viable welfare enhancing business are not backed by any hard evidence about efficiency advantages or sustainable profitability. All of Uber’s growth has required massive investor subsidies — $2 billion in 2015 and $3 billion in 2016. All of these subsidies have been destroying competitors who are more efficient but can’t withstand years of subsidies from Silicon Valley billionaires. Thompson argues that Uber has grown total market demand and offered greater service options at night. True, but all due to unsustainable predatory subsidies. Thompson says that Uber’s app gives it the great competitive advantage of controlling its customers. False — people don’t like Uber because the app has a neat user interface, people like Uber because the app shows more cabs at lower prices than competitors can offer. All of those cabs and low prices are due to unsustainable, predatory subsidies. Thompson insists “the fact remains that both Uber riders and drivers continue to vote with their feet” justifies his belief that Uber’s approach to regulation is right, but again ignores that they are not voting for the more efficient producer, but for massive service subsidies. Thompson is falsely claiming that Uber’s growth reflects the free choice of consumers in a competitive market. Uber’s predatory subsidies are designed to undermine the processes by which competitive markets help allocate resources, and then to eliminate competition altogether. If these benefits were created by legitimate efficiencies, as Thompson imagines, there would be evidence showing how they made Uber more cost competitive, or how they similarly transformed competition in other markets. To refute the points here about Uber’s predatory, market-distorting subsidies, Thompson would need evidence that Uber has scale economies powerful enough to quickly convert $3 billion operating losses into sustainable profits, and evidence that Uber has competitive advantages overwhelming enough to explain driving everyone else out of the industry. Since Thompson does not have any of this evidence, he can’t claim Uber has produced benefits for anyone but itself. Well, here we are in 2025, and over the last 12 months Uber has made $4.5 billion in operating profit, and that number is trending upwards (and doesn’t include the significant profits Uber makes from its non-controlling interests in other mobility companies that it gained thanks to its aggressive expansion); no, I didn’t have evidence of that profit in 2017, but I did understand how scale works to transform money-losing software-based Aggregators into profitable behemoths in the long-run. Another classic of the Uber bear genre was this 2014 post by NYU finance professor Aswath Damodaran attempting to determine Uber’s true value; the startup had just raised $1.2 billion at a $17 billion valuation, and according to Damodaran’s calculations, “it is difficult to justify a price greater than $10 billion” (his actual valuation was $5.9 billion). Investor Bill Gurley — before his dramatic powerplay that led to the ouster of founder Travis Kalanick — explained what Damodaran got wrong in How to Miss By a Mile: An Alternative Look at Uber’s Potential Market Size: The funny thing about “hard numbers” is that they can give a false sense of security. Young math students are warned about the critical difference between precision and accuracy. Financial models, especially valuation models, are interesting in that they can be particularly precise. A discounted cash flow model can lead to a result with two numbers right of the decimal for price-per-share. But what is the true accuracy of most of these financial models? While it may seem like a tough question to answer, I would argue that most practitioners of valuation analysis would state “not very high.” It is simply not an accurate science (the way physics is), and seemingly innocuous assumptions can have a major impact on the output. As a result, most models are used as a rough guide to see if you are “in the ball park,” or to see if a particular stock is either wildly under-valued or over-valued… Damodaran uses two primary assumptions that drive the core of his analysis. The first is TAM, and the second is Uber’s market share within that market. For the market size, he states, “For my base case valuation, I’m going to assume that the primary market Uber is targeting is the global taxi and car-service market.” He then goes on to calculate a global estimate for the historical taxi and limousine market. The number he uses for this TAM estimate is $100 billion. He then guesses at a market share limit for Uber – basically a maximum in terms of market share the company could potentially achieve. For this he settles on 10%. The rest of his model is rather straightforward and typical. In my view, there is a critical error in both of these two core assumptions. Gurley argued — correctly in retrospect, given that Uber’s gross bookings over the last 12 months were $93 billion in rides and $86 billion in deliveries — that Damodaran failed to consider how a radically better experience could dramatically expand the addressable market, and completely missed the potential for network effects leading to an outsized share of that expanded market. I do feel Uber’s effects even out here in the suburbs: when I lived in Madison decades ago, there only seemed to be about five taxis in the whole city, and they were only ever at the airport; now a ride is six minutes away, and I’m sure it would be even shorter if I were more centrally located. That’s particularly appreciated in a place like Wisconsin, not only because of the cold, but also the culture of drinking; the reduction in drunk driving alone has long placed Uber solidly on the “societal good” side of the ledger, at least in my book. Of course I rarely take Ubers: if you’re in the suburbs you drive, and fortunately, I like driving. That’s not the case for everyone, however: while my wife has driven in Taiwan for years, she’s always been nervous about doing the same in America, with its higher speeds, longer distances, and more uncertain directions. That’s why I got her a Tesla: instead of her driving the car, her car drives her. I’ve actually dawdled in writing this Article because I wanted to try out v14 of Full Self-Driving (Supervised) first, but it’s been over a month since its release and I still don’t have the Update, so my experience is based on v13. That’s ok, though, because Full Self-Driving (Supervised) is actually pretty amazing. It really does go from origin to destination without intervention pretty much all-of-the-time (v14 reportedly addresses the actually leaving the driveway and parking part of things), although I take over more than my wife does. My issue with Full Self-Driving (Supervised) is two-fold: the first is that it is the absolute best worst driver in the world. What I mean is that Full Self-Driving (Supervised) always handles the situation in front of it with aplomb, including tricky merges, construction, etc. I’m particularly impressed at how it stays with traffic, including speeding when appropriate. That’s the best part. The worst part is that Full Self-Driving (Supervised) seems to have zero planning: it will change lanes even though a turn or an exit is half a mile away, which is particularly galling when an exit lane is backed up; if you don’t take over that leads to an embarrassing attempt to merge back in a quarter mile down the road. In other words, Full Self-Driving (Supervised) gets in more messes than it should because of a lack of foresight, but it handles those messes perfectly. As someone who thinks well ahead of my route in an endless pursuit of efficiency this drives me crazy, but honestly, I would take best worst driver over the vast majority of drivers I encounter on the road. My second issue is related to why I keep writing out the whole name: the “Supervised” part drives me absolutely batty. Yes, yes, I shouldn’t look at my phone, but is it better to be forced to exit a perfectly competent — more than competent — driving mode to manually steer while sending a text? More galling is when I am looking ahead at a turn — which necessitates turning my head — and get yelled at by my own car to pay attention. I am paying attention, by actually trying to plan more than two steps ahead! Regardless, I absolutely do believe that Full Self-Driving (Supervised) is good enough to be Unsupervised, at least in good weather; it’s a bummer to realize that that still may not happen for a long time, and even when it does, the price may be things like actually flowing with traffic, even if it’s a few miles over the speed limit. Even then, however, what exists today — and make no mistake, Full Self-Driving (Supervised), with its ability to follow a route, is a step-change from lane-following adaptive cruise control — is enough to make a meaningful difference to someone like my wife. It’s a lot easier to enjoy the big house and yard when you have the capability to go somewhere else. One challenge I didn’t anticipate was that while trash pickup comes once a week, recycling pick-up is only every other week; that’s a problem given the number of cardboard boxes we go through, mostly from Amazon. In all seriousness, Amazon has transformed suburban living. It was always the case that the idea of dashing off to the nearby store was more theory than reality, even when I lived downtown; at a minimum I usually still drove. Next day delivery, however, completely changes the mental calculus: the likelihood I will run out of time to go to the store tips the balance towards just ordering what you need the moment you need it; the next day — and sometimes sooner — it’s on your porch (Walmart deserves a callout here: their delivery is usually even faster if you order something in store). Of course it’s nice to not have to worry about your delivery disappearing, or have to cart it up the stairs or in the elevator; you also have the suburban advantage of having places to store supplies, so you don’t run out in the first place. That was always true though — it’s why big box retailers were very much a product of the suburbs — but marrying that advantage to maximum convenience is a big win. Food delivery definitely isn’t as good, particularly for the Asian food I sometimes crave; our family has always been one to cook our own food, however, which is of course easier with a big kitchen (and three different types of grills). The better restaurant options are also all downtown, so that’s a minus, but hey, you can always Uber. The broader takeaway is that while there are still certain conveniences that come from a central location, the convenience delta — thanks first and foremost to Amazon — has been dramatically reduced. There is a point to this diary, and it comes back to Uber. Not only was I a bull during Uber’s rise, I’ve also been fairly optimistic about the company’s fortunes when it comes to robotaxis. From an Update late last year: Robotaxis are a technology, not a market — a means, not an end, if you will. Markets are defined by demand, and the demand to be tapped is transportation. And, in this market, the dominant player is Uber; no they don’t have their own robotaxis, but from a consumer perspective, they might as well: the rider doesn’t own the vehicle they ride in, they summon it from an app, and they just walk away when the ride is done. The experience — if not the novelty — is the same with a human driver or a robotaxi. Moreover, the human drivers come with some big advantages from Uber’s perspective: they bear their own depreciation costs, and can make individual decisions about the marginal rate necessary to provide supply, which is another way of saying that Uber can more easily scale up and down to meet demand by using price as a signal. It is an open question as to whether robotaxis can ever economically scale to meet demand: having enough capacity for peak demand means a lot of robotaxis sitting idle a lot of the time, while maximizing utilization means insufficient supply during peak periods. This last point is why my assumption is that Uber will very much be relevant in the robotaxi era: their supply network will be essential for scaling up-and-down within cities, and serving all of the areas that the centralized fleets do not. What is less clear is their long-term profitability, which may be somewhat out of their control. That last sentence was about Uber’s diminished bargaining vis-à-vis a centralized robotaxi operator versus individual drivers, and it’s an important one in terms of Uber’s long-term valuation. However, as robotaxis continue to expand — Waymo is now in five cities (three via their own service, two via Uber), Tesla (with human supervisors in the car) in two, and Amazon’s Zoox in one — I do wonder if I am making a similar mistake to Horan and Damodaran. First, like Horan, am I too caught up in the current economics of robotaxis? As an apostle of zero marginal costs I am intrinsically allergic to the depreciation inherent in the cars themselves, along with the significant marginal costs in terms of energy and insurance; Uber side-stepped this by offloading those costs to the drivers. Can scale solve this? At some point — Cybercab already points to this future — vehicles will be purpose-built at scale to be robotaxis, and my experience with Full Self-Driving (Supervised) has me convinced that insurance costs will be manageable, not just because of scale, but because there will be fewer accidents. Second, like Damodaran, am I limiting my thinking by focusing on the current market — even if that market is already massively larger than the taxi & limo market ever was? The experience of a Waymo is certainly magical; it’s also peaceful, and by removing the human from the equation, provides a sense of safety and security that Uber has always struggled with. This last point could address a major suburban point point, which is kids: the lockdown in kids’ freedom corresponded with a dramatic rise in organized activities, the sheer volume of which leaves lots of parents feeling like unpaid Uber drivers themselves. Some may rely on Uber to solve this problem; it seems likely to me far more would be willing to entrust their children to a Waymo. That does still leave the peak demand question: even if kids become a major market, what do all of these rapidly depreciating cars do during the day? And thus we arrive at why Amazon acquire Zoox: the obvious answer is delivery. The only thing better than next day delivery is same day delivery; the only thing better than same day delivery is same hour delivery. The best way to make that happen in a cost-effective way is to have a huge number of robotaxis on the road that actually aren’t making the decision that prices aren’t high enough, at least as long as those prices cover the marginal cost of a trip, which, in the case of a robotaxi, includes energy but not a human. Of course you still have to get the package to the doorstep, which is where robots come in; Tesla is explicitly going in this directions. From The Information: Optimus is Tesla’s biggest long-term bet. Musk has said there will eventually be more humanoid robots than cars in the world, and that Optimus will one day be responsible for about 80% of Tesla’s market capitalization. Inside Tesla, he’s pushed the Optimus team to find ways to use the robot in tandem with another big, nearer-term bet: the Cybercab, according to a person with direct knowledge. That includes Musk’s desire to have the Optimus robot sit in the Cybercab so it can deliver packages. That should be possible: newer versions of the Optimus robot are capable of consistently lifting and moving around with roughly 25-pound objects for three to four hours on a 30 minute charge, another person with direct knowledge said. But the connection between the robot’s torso and legs isn’t flexible enough to allow it to seamlessly get in and out of a Cybercab, according to the first person. Tesla would need to redesign the robot to change that or use a different vehicle for deliveries more tailored for Optimus’ shape, that person said. This is obviously all still a ways out, but it all feels a lot more possible today than it did even a year ago; relatedly, it feels a lot more uncertain that Uber will have a long-term role to play — and the company may agree! I thought this announcement from Nvidia at GTC Washington D.C. was a bearish indicator for the company: Nvidia today announced it is partnering with Uber to scale the world’s largest level 4-ready mobility network, using the company’s next-generation robotaxi and autonomous delivery fleets, the new Nvidia Drive AGX Hyperion 10 autonomous vehicle (AV) development platform and Nvidia Drive AV software purpose-built for L4 autonomy. By enabling faster growth across the level 4 ecosystem, Nvidia can support Uber in scaling its global autonomous fleet to 100,000 vehicles over time, starting in 2027. These vehicles will be developed in collaboration with Nvidia and other Uber ecosystem partners, using Nvidia Drive. Nvidia and Uber are also working together to develop a data factory accelerated by the Nvidia Cosmos world foundation model development platform to curate and process data needed for autonomous vehicle development. Nvidia Drive AGX Hyperion 10 is a reference production computer and sensor set architecture that makes any vehicle L4-ready. It enables automakers to build cars, trucks and vans equipped with validated hardware and sensors that can host any compatible autonomous-driving software, providing a unified foundation for safe, scalable and AI-defined mobility. Uber is bringing together human drivers and autonomous vehicles into a single operating network — a unified ride-hailing service including both human and robot drivers. This network, powered by Nvidia Drive AGX Hyperion-ready vehicles and the surrounding AI ecosystem, enables Uber to seamlessly bridge today’s human-driven mobility with the autonomous fleets of tomorrow. The thing about Uber the first time around is that it wasn’t simply providing a fancy app for the taxi & limo market; it was providing an entirely new experience for both drivers and riders that was orthogonal to that market, which let it create a far larger one. This deal with Nvidia envisions a different sort of evolution, where Uber’s existing market slowly becomes autonomous; that’s possible, even if it means significantly higher capital costs for Uber (and cars that cost more, since they are retrofitted instead of purpose-built). What is also possible, however, is that Uber gets Uber-ed: a completely new experience for both drivers (as in they don’t exist) and riders (including kids and packages delivered at the marginal cost of energy) ends up being orthogonal to the Uber market, and far larger. Moreover, this market will, for specific qualitative reasons around safety and security, be inaccessible to Uber’s core business, meaning the entire vision of “bringing together human drivers and autonomous vehicles into a single operating network” ends up being a liability instead of an asset. There are larger sociological and political questions around things like urban versus suburban living, just as there were when suburbs were built out in the first place. I do believe that the suburbs are very much back, and not just because I’m back in the suburbs; what will be a fascinating question for historians is the chicken-and-egg one between technology driving this shift, versus benefiting from it. What is worth considering, however, is if the last wave of urbanism, which started in the 1990s and peaked in the 2010s, might be the last, at least in the United States (Asia and its massive metropolises are another story). The potential physical transformation in transportation and delivery I am talking about is simply completing the story that started with entertainment and television in the first wave of suburbia, and then information and interactivity via the Internet, particularly since COVID. There are real benefits to being in person, just like there are to living in the city, but the relative delta to working remote or living in the suburbs has decreased dramatically; meanwhile, offices and urban living can never match the advantages inherent to working from a big home with a big yard. Whether or not this is good thing is a separate discussion; I will say it has been good for me, and it’s poised to get even better.

Title: BlackRock Sidesteps the Solana ETF Showdown — Is It a Miss or Masterplan?

Written & Edited byLockridge Okoth Fidelity’s Solana ETF, launching on November 19, 2025, with a 25-basis-point fee, marks the entry of traditional asset managers into the Solana ETF market. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is notably not participating in this competition. As major financial institutions move swiftly to capture market share in the growing Solana ETF sector, BlackRock’s decision to focus solely on Bitcoin and Ethereum products raises questions about the future of altcoin-based funds. The Solana ETF market is expanding quickly as several firms announce new products. Bitwise’s BSOL debuted with around $450 million in assets, while VanEck’s VSOL launched on November 18, 2025. Fidelity’s FSOL, set for release on November 19, is a milestone as it brings the largest traditional asset manager into this growing sector. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted the competition, noting Fidelity’s position as the largest asset manager in the Solana ETF category. The 25 basis point fee positions FSOL to compete closely with other leading products as firms strive for market leadership in this new area. Fidelity Solana ETF $FSOL is slated to launch TOMORROW. Fee is 25bps. Easily the biggest asset manager in this category with BlackRock sitting out. $BSOL got out first, has $450m, $VSOL launched today, Grayscale is in mix. Game on. pic.twitter.com/iCXMkAH9qe Canary Capital is also entering the field with its Solana ETF, ticker SOLC, which features on-chain staking through a partnership with Marinade Finance. ALSO. @CanaryFunds will be launching their Solana ETF — $SOLC — tomorrow too. It’s in partnership with @MarinadeFinance who will be doing the staking. https://t.co/DKsDY3xymg According to Nasdaq’s official listing announcement, the Canary Marinade Solana ETF began trading on November 18, 2025. Grayscale has added further competition in this forming segment. Solana’s market activity demonstrates the growing attention. Open interest in SOL futures is rising as November 19 approaches, indicating increased trader participation and engagement. This recent activity signals rising institutional interest in Solana exposure, even as the price consolidates. Meanwhile, BlackRock has made its position clear, to concentrate exclusively on Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, not expanding into altcoins. Robert Mitchnick, the firm’s digital assets head, expressed at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville that assets beyond BTC and ETH lack the maturity, liquidity, and market capitalization necessary for ETF products. According to BlackRock’s leadership, the next-largest cryptocurrency after Ethereum accounts for approximately 3% of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization, which is well below the firm’s product launch thresholds. “I don’t think we’re going to see a long list of crypto ETFs. If you think of Bitcoin, today it represents about 55% of the market cap. Ethereum is at 18%. The next plausible investible asset is at, like, 3%. It’s just not close to being at that threshold or track record of maturity, liquidity, etc.,” Mitchnick said. Jay Jacobs and Robert Mitchnick have stressed that only a minority of BlackRock’s clients currently own IBIT or ETHA, hence their pivot. “We’re really just at the tip of the iceberg with Bitcoin and especially ethereum. Just a tiny fraction of our clients own ($IBIT and $ETHA) so that’s what we’re focused on (vs launching new alt coin ETFs)” – Jay Jacobs of BlackRock at ETFs in Depth. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, has delivered strong results since its January 2024 debut. Similarly, BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF, ETHA, reached over $1 billion in assets under management within two months of launch. However, the financial instruments have been recording outflows over the past few weeks, which could move the firm to consider joining the Solana ETF frenzy. Meanwhile, analysts have dissected theories that TradFi players like BlackRock foraying into the Bitcoin ETF market is a demonstration of bullishness. According to BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, their move is a calculated basis trade, with this hidden institutional strategy now distorting ETF inflows.

Title: Here's How Much Traders Expect Nvidia Stock To Move After Wednesday's Earnings

Nvidia is set to report its latest quarterly results after the closing bell Wednesday, with traders expecting a big move in the AI chipmaker's stock. Options pricing suggests traders expect Nvidia (NVDA) shares could move nearly 7% in either direction by the end of the week. A move of that size from Monday's close near $187 could help the shares recover some of their recent losses to return to last week's levels around $199, or pull them down to about $174, a level not seen since September. In recent quarters, Nvidia's earnings have tended to be a sell-the-news event, despite a string of record-breaking results. In all but one of the most-recent four quarters, the chipmaker's stock finished the week lower than its levels heading into the event. With expectations riding high ahead of the earnings, and results from rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and other AI favorites indicating investors may be harder to impress this season, Nvidia could face an increasingly difficult bar to clear. This year's big rally in AI stocks, which made Nvidia the world's most valuable public company by market capitalization, has fueled worries about an AI bubble, and investors will be watching closely whether the chipmaker can deliver on its ambitious growth targets. Nvidia's earnings release is the most highly anticipated event of the earnings season, and it's likely to have a big impact on the broader stock market. Nvidia is seen reporting adjusted third-quarter earnings per share of $1.26 on a nearly 60% year-over-year jump in revenue to a record $55.4 billion, according to estimates collected by Visible Alpha. Whisper numbers could be even higher, with analysts from Jefferies and Wedbush telling clients recently that they expect the AI darling to "beat and raise," or top analysts' quarterly projections as well as lift its full-year outlook. Still, Wall Street analysts are widely bullish Nvidia's stock has room to rise after a nearly 40% gain in 2025 so far. All but one of the 13 analysts with current ratings compiled by Visible Alpha call it a "buy," with their mean target near $219 suggesting roughly 17% upside from Monday's close. Shares of Nvidia slid about 2% Monday amid broader tech sector losses.

Title: Record $1.26B Outflow Hits BlackRock Bitcoin ETF as Bearish Options Cost Soars
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/11/18/record-usd1-26b-outflow-hits-blackrock-bitcoin-etf-as-bearish-options-cost-soars
Time Published: 2025-11-18T09:22:25Z
Full Content:
BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF, IBIT, has registered record outflows this month amid a price slide and a sharp rise in the cost of bearish options used to hedge against further market declines. The Nasdaq-listed BlackRock Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, has recorded a net outflow of $1.26 billion so far this month, marking the largest monthly redemption since its launch in January 2024, according to data from SoSoValue. This outflow is part of a broader trend affecting the market, with 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively experiencing withdrawals totaling $2.59 billion. IBIT's price has collapsed 16% to $52, the level last seen on April 22, data from TradingView show. The price crash has traders aggressively chasing put options as a form of protection against further declines. This is reflected in the 250-day put-call skew tracked by MarketChameleon, which measures the relative cost of puts compared to calls. The 250-day put-call skew has surged to a seven-month high of 3.1%, indicating that put options, used to hedge downside risks, are currently at their most expensive relative to calls since April.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs bleed $2.6B – Why Arthur Hayes says ‘investors don’t like BTC’
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-etfs-bleed-2-6b-why-arthur-hayes-says-investors-dont-like-btc/
Time Published: 2025-11-18T09:00:58Z

Hayes dumped his atltcoin bags for ZEC amid the ongoing weakness. Per Hayes, hedge funds are liquidating their BTC positions as the basis trade declines. According to him, an improvement in the liquidity conditions in early December could juice risk assets and drive BTC to $200k. Bitcoin’s [BTC] institutional flows have remained negative for the fourth week in a row, further accelerating the ongoing sell-off. So far in November, $2.59 billion has left the U.S. spot BTC ETFs, with half of the outflows ($1.26 billion) driven by BlackRock’s IBIT investors. Source: SoSo Value According to Arthur Hayes, founder of BitMEX, the BlackRock bleed-out was primarily from hedge funds, such as Goldman Sachs, which have been seeking extra yield above Fed rates via BTC basis trade. It involves buying spot BTC ETFs and shorting on the asset on CME to capture the spread (basis trade). However, now that the basis trade is no longer attractive, they have hedge funds with spot BTC ETFs that have exited their positions, noted Hayes. Source: Glassnode Since October, the yield has shrunk from about 14% to below 5%. And with it, the hedge fund-led ETF outflows intensified, further spooking retail investors, added Hayes. “Now retail believes these same investors don’t like Bitcoin and creates a negative feedback loop that influences them to sell, which decreases the basis, finally causing more institutional investors to sell the ETF.” Additionally, the demand from BTC treasuries has also faded, further reinforcing the short-term concern that major players are taking a wait-and-see approach. Hayes highlighted that the dollar liquidity has also been withdrawn and could be re-injected by December when the Fed ends Quantitative Tightening (QT). Source: Bloomberg/Arthur Hayes (Treasury General Account, TGA balance) The Treasury General Balance (TGA) is the U.S government’s primary operating account and directly affects market liquidity. A TGA balance increase leads to liquidity drains as the Treasury collects more money from the market, while a decrease boosts liquidity. According to the chart shared by Hayes, there was an uptick in TGA in late October that further deepened the market rout, particularly for risk assets. Hayes projected that BTC could slip toward $80k–$85k in the short term before surging toward $200k by year-end, contingent on liquidity easing. In the meantime, Hayes expected the privacy narrative, led by Zcash [ZEC], to remain strong despite broader weakening. In fact, he dumped most of the altcoins for ZEC.

Title: Targeting Palantir and Nvidia: Profits, Prophets and Overvalued AI Stocks
URL: https://www.counterpunch.org/2025/11/18/targeting-palantir-and-nvidia-profits-prophets-and-overvalued-ai-stocks/
Time Published: 2025-11-18T06:52:28Z

Photograph Source: Coolcaesar – CC BY-SA 4.0 In an industry of seedy soothsayers, cocksure charlatans and resourceful rogues, honest and accurate appraisals are exquisitely rare. When it comes to economics, investments and finance, this is particularly so. Certitude, however, tends to be in abundance for those predicting the next financial crash, the sort that will singe earnings and strafe savings. Take, for instance, hedge fund investor Michael Burry, a man of sufficient notoriety to warrant a celluloid depiction of himself by Christian Bale in the 2015 film The Big Short. On that occasion, Burry’s hunch, albeit an educated one, was that the US housing bubble would implode in what became the Great Recession of 2007-9. The buccaneering investor shorted mortgage-backed securities ahead of the collapse, raking in profits as the subprime mortgage sundered. But his record is by no means immaculate, seeing falls when they have not eventuated, especially on tech stocks. For him, the language of catastrophe is never far away. An April 7 post on X this year is fabulously bleak: “Millennials going through 9/11, two economic recessions, a pandemic, the looming threat of WW3, AI job automation, and now facing the ‘biggest crash in history’.” Towards the end of October, he felt in an oracular mood: “Sometimes we see bubbles,” he wrote in another post. “Sometimes, there is something to do about it. Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play.” His Scion Asset Management hedge fund subsequently moved 80% of its US$1.1 billion portfolio to place options against Palantir (PTLR) and Nvidia (NVDA). These will pay handsomely should shares in these AI-linked companies fall. Burry remains convinced that technology stocks, certainly when it comes to artificial intelligence, are overvalued and set for the precipitous plummet. Whether this is due to growing scepticism about the herd-like rush to adopt AI, the debate about necessary regulation, or that broader sensibility that what rises or swells so rapidly must fall or puncture, is impossible to know. Certainly, the incestuous circular financing tech companies have been engaging in is crying out for a stinging correction. But it is precisely moves of this nature by Scion Asset Management that send jitters through the market, turning preaching prophets into market saboteurs. Surely enough, Palantir’s shares fell by 8% on November 4 despite exceeding Wall Street estimates of returns for the third quarter. The stocks had risen to skyscraper levels – 173% for the year heading into trading that day. Nvidia’s fell by 4% after having improved by 50% this year. “It seems fatigue over AI and the current earnings run has investors questioning the sustainability of the AI hype,” reasoned financial analyst Farhan Badami. “That’s dragged down AI companies overnight in markets.” Sympathy for such companies is bound to be in short supply. Palantir is the sort of data analytics company any half-decent minded individual would wish to fail. In April this year, 404 Media revealed that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had paid the company millions of dollars to modify the ICE database to enable it to “complete target analysis of known populations” and spruce up the targeting of that tool and enforcement priorities. The database gives ICM agents the means to sort individuals using hundreds of specific categories covering physical attributes, administrative background and mobility. ICE Director Todd Lyons has fantasies of running the agency’s crude, clumsy deportation policy “like [Amazon] Prime, but with human beings” in an effort to treat the matter “like a business”. This charming dystopian thought is a good pairing with the sinister propaganda Palantir enjoys promoting, including a campaign on college campuses that echoes the stirrings of a Nuremberg rally cry: “Our culture has fallen into shallow consumerism while abandoning national purpose. Too few in Silicon Valley have asked what ought to be built – and why.” Palantir, to that end, was built to conquer such flabby complacency. “On the factory floor, in the operating room, across the battlefield – we build to dominate.” The company CEO, Alex Karp, has been less than impressed by Burry’s short selling efforts. “The two companies he’s shorting are the ones making all the money, which is super weird,” he told CNBC’s Squawk Box in sheer bafflement. “The idea that chips and ontology is what you want to short is batshit crazy.” He is confident that any damage will be minimal. “I do think this behaviour is egregious and I’m going to be dancing around when it’s proven wrong.” The latest fall is being taken with a grain of salt among some investors, though you can hardly trust them. Take the tepid assessment from equity trading strategist at Citi, Vishal Vivek. “A little bit of risk is not going to take the sheen off what’s been a pretty remarkable year, in fact, a pretty remarkable three-year stretch,” he tells Reuters on whether AI stocks were proving less attractive. “If anything, there’s a reasonable chance that you’re going to pause your buying maybe, but you’re not going to necessarily sell your big positions into year-end because you’re worried about one or two companies that have underperformed.” Leaving aside such babble and bloviation, if there is a crash in overvalued AI stocks likely to rival the market falls that took place in the Great Recession, a similar government program used for the banks and banksters will be sought by Karp and company. In the private sector, foolish losses and unscrupulous conduct regarding investments often turns its members into temporary socialists. Profit, on the hand, is the sort of thing that rests firmly and assuredly in the clasping hands of the corporate sector, the result of purported intelligence and industry. That’s private enterprise for you. Binoy Kampmark was a Commonwealth Scholar at Selwyn College, Cambridge. He lectures at RMIT University, Melbourne. Email: bkampmark@gmail.com

Good luck getting a seat on weekend mornings at this ever popular Westport, Co Mayo cafe and shop. All-day brunch dishes come with unlimited pour-over coffee at this award-winning Kilkenny bakery and cafe. It might be tiny, but this unique Dublin 2 spot is pound for pound an all-out champion. There’s no doubt about it: the Wednesday-Friday lunchtime menu at Coppinger is the smartest money in Dublin city centre. Even a fire can’t stop this Cork powerhouse, which is now serving a shorter Bites menu while repairs are carried out. Dubliners and wine lovers in the know all nod sagely when Fish Shop is mentioned. We don’t gatekeep here. There’s nothing quite like the cheeky feeling of delicious food eaten among groaning shelves of wine in Terenure, Dublin 6W. Good luck to you if you can secure a booking at this Ranelagh spot, but if you do, you’re in for some of the best small plates, pasta and grilled meats in Dublin. Maggie Roche’s daytime cafe in Baltinglass, Co Wicklow, is the business. And it even has a dedicated menu section for Coolattin cheddar. Over 30 years old, Cork’s Paradiso still leads the way for vegetarian cooking and natural wines. A Dublin institution celebrating 15 years in business in Powerscourt Town Centre; the pear and bacon sandwich is an icon.

Title: Aave Labs Announces App Release On Apple’s Platform: Features And Expectations

Aave Labs, the developer behind the decentralized cryptocurrency lending platform Aave (AAVE), announced on Monday its intentions to launch a new app on Apple’s App Store. According to a report from Fortune, this new product is designed to function similarly to a traditional savings account, but with higher yields than those offered by traditional finance banks. Users can earn a minimum interest rate of 5% on their deposits, which can be funded through bank accounts or debit cards. The app will utilize stablecoins alongside the Aave protocol to offer these financial services. Aave has established itself as a key player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and crypto lending sectors, boasting over $3.23 trillion in cumulative deposits, nearly $1 trillion in total originated loan volume and $ billion in total interest paid, according to the platform’s website. While DeFi protocols often provide users with higher interest rates compared to conventional banking, they also carry heightened risks, such as the potential for hacks and the absence of government backing. However, Stani Kulechov, the founder and CEO of Aave Labs, assured users of the protocol’s safety. He pointed out that Aave has never encountered an exploit in its five-year history, emphasizing the dual layers of security related to both the market economics and the software code, which has been audited by multiple companies. The forthcoming launch of the Aave app arrives at a time when the gap between traditional financial institutions and crypto-native firms is closing. Major players like BlackRock are adopting Bitcoin (BTC) through the exchange-traded fund (ETF) sector. Stripe has integrated stablecoins into its offerings, and JPMorgan Chase has been actively developing blockchain solutions. In response, crypto firms are increasingly focusing on attracting mainstream customers. The US crypto exchange Kraken, for example, has newly introduced its own payments app, while various others are working to create bank-like products using stablecoins. Kulechov remarked, “Typically, DeFi has been accessible to very savvy, professional users. The next step for DeFi is to bring more direct access for consumers.” Kulechov, a figure in the DeFi movement since launching the protocol in 2020, has expanded the company’s offerings to include a crypto wallet, a decentralized stablecoin, and a protocol for social media. In October, the firm made headlines by acquiring the stablecoin company Stable Finance for an undisclosed amount. Kulechov noted that the acquisition also enhanced their consumer-focused experience, allowing the team to move more swiftly and improve their product offerings. While the broader crypto market continues its downtrend, the price of AAVE saw a 2% uptick following the announcement. At the time of writing, it was trading at $171.87 per token.

Now, he is bringing his management skills to an artificial intelligence (AI) start-up with fewer than 100 employees. Project Prometheus, which Mr Bezos co-founded with scientist Vik Bajaj, will use AI to accelerate engineering and manufacturing in fields like aerospace and cars, The New York Times reported. The start-up has US$6.2 billion (S$8 billion) in funding, sourced in part from Mr Bezos himself, and employees counted in the dozens, some of whom were poached from leading AI labs like OpenAI and Google DeepMind. As co-CEO with Mr Bajaj, Mr Bezos is back in a formal executive post for the first time since stepping down from Amazon in 2021. The billionaire has since devoted time to his aerospace company, Blue Origin, and made headlines for his personal life, including a star-studded wedding in Venice in 2025. Mr Bezos has also more closely aligned himself with President Donald Trump’s administration, attending his inauguration in January and ordering a pro-business revamp of the opinion page at the Washington Post, the news media outlet he owns. Project Prometheus enters a crowded AI market dominated by tech giants Google, Meta and Microsoft, alongside pioneering firms OpenAI and Anthropic. The venture is part of a broader trend towards applying AI to physical tasks, often using robotics. Unlike the generative AI technology behind ChatGPT, it aims to develop systems that learn from real-world experimentation, rather than just digital text, with the goal of accelerating scientific discovery in physics, chemistry and engineering. Another dramatic shift since Mr Bezos founded Amazon in 1994 is the rise of AI-native start-ups built around ultra-lean teams – a reversal of the old playbook that equated headcount expansion with business growth. When Mr Bezos left the CEO seat at Amazon, he oversaw more than 1.6 million employees. On the company’s most recent earnings call, current CEO Andy Jassy attributed thousands of recent layoffs to ongoing efforts to eliminate layers of bureaucracy after years of over-hiring. Some parts of Mr Bezos’ philosophies may require a reboot for the AI era. His preference for lengthy memos with narratives indicating deep thinking by the author may be outdated now that workers can use generative AI tools to do the writing for them. But his Darwinian approach to work culture jibes with what is expected now at many of the hottest AI start-ups. And some of his management ideals, like keeping teams lean and fast and making them exceptionally talent-dense, will arguably never go out of style. When Mr Bezos stepped down after 27 years of running Amazon, he was widely lauded as one of the best CEOs in tech history. If his new start-up succeeds, it will likely come down in part to how relevant his management philosophy still is – or how much it has evolved.

The flood of crypto ETFs has begun, with VanEck’s Solana ETF launching on Monday, and many more ETFs expected to go live over the next week. VanEck has launched the US’s third exchange-traded fund (ETF) featuring Solana staking, as more altcoin-tied funds are set to enter the market soon. The VanEck Solana ETF (VSOL) launched on Monday, joining similar funds from Bitwise and Grayscale that debuted late in October and have jointly seen over $380 million in inflows. Like Bitwise and Grayscale’s ETFs, VSOL offers staking yields, where Solana (SOL) is locked up on the blockchain to earn rewards. It has also waived its 0.3% fee until Feb. 17 or until it reaches $1 billion in assets in a bid to compete. Asset managers have been flooding the market with crypto ETFs after the Securities and Exchange Commission changed its listing standards in September, allowing for faster approvals that don’t require an assessment of each fund. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said on Monday that the Fidelity Solana ETF (FSOL) is set to launch on Tuesday, competing with three existing similar funds that charge a 0.25% fee. “Easily the biggest asset manager in this category with BlackRock sitting out,” he added. Balchunas said he expects a Dogecoin (DOGE) ETF from Grayscale to launch on Nov. 24, based on an amended regulatory filing earlier this month kicking off a 20-day period where it can launch if the SEC doesn’t respond. The Grayscale Dogecoin Trust (DOGE) is a conversion from its existing fund and would trade on the New York Stock Exchange, which must still file to list the ETF. “We’ll see, won’t be 100% till exchange notice, but based on SEC guidance, it looks good,” Balchunas added. Related: XRP traders hope fresh wave of ETF launches will restore the bull trend If Grayscale’s fund launches next week, it’ll be the first Dogecoin ETF in the US that will be able to directly hold the memecoin. Asset issuers REX Shares and Osprey Funds jointly launched a DOGE ETF in mid-September, registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which limits its investment to a wholly owned offshore subsidiary that holds the cryptocurrency. Bitwise could also see its spot Dogecoin ETF launch late next week, after a change in its regulatory filing for the product on Nov. 6 triggered a 20-day launch timer, unless the SEC intervenes.

NEXT | Get in the Thanksgiving spirit with these super cute Turkeys! Unless you were paying attention when you logged into World of Warcraft yesterday, you may have easily been able to miss that it’s anniversary time again — which means the return of a lot of the things from the 20th anniversary celebration is back for a second run. The biggest difference is that now the game is 21 years old! Congratulations to World of Warcraft on being old enough to drink in bars in the United States. Frankly, the idea I’ve been playing that long makes me need a drink, but instead, let’s run down what you’ll find as part of the anniversary! Once again, the big open area outside of the Caverns of Time has been turned into an activity-filled celebration area. You’ll find a similar setup to last year, including the experience and reputation buff — you get 10% to both just for logging in, and an additional 10% for completing various activities around the celebration. (Shouldn’t that be 11% at this point?) Interestingly, Legion Remix characters are also getting the default 10% bonus, enabling fully maxed out Timerunners to have 410% bonus experience during the anniversary. Why not make it a tiny bit more ridiculous? Many of the same activities from last year are present, as well — Mount Mania, Storytime with Lorewalker Cho, the transmog contest, world bosses ravaging Tanaris, that thing in Silithus with Chromie, it’s all here. If you missed out on any of the Secrets of Azeroth event, that seems to be back again with no timegating at all, so you can just zoom right through it. You’ll also find that the Blackrock Depths raid is back — in LFR difficulty, at least. A lot of the rewards from last year are back, as well as ways to earn the Bronze Celebration Tokens you’ll need to buy them, so if you missed out on any rewards like the high-definition Tier 2 sets and you’ve been kicking yourself about it for a year, now’s your chance! Also, it was a late addition to the party, but the Trader’s Gilded Brutosaur and its $90 USD price tag has returned to the cash shop. While it was originally tied to the 20th Anniversary, now it appears it’s come back for this one, so don’t let FOMO trick you into buying it — we may have years of Brutosaurs to come. There are also a couple of new things to pick up for anniversary aficionados. Traeya, who sells the high-definition Tier 2 armor sets, now also sells a Loyal Watchman cosmetic gear set that will make you look like the guard you’ve always dreamed about being, for a grand total of 230 Timewarped Badges for the entire set. Additionally, Notary Grably — the goblin who had a whole array of expansion-themed titles for purchase — has added Khaz Algar Enthusiast for 100 Timewarped Badges. And… that’s it! There are only a couple things missing entirely this year, and some of them are not entirely a surprise. One is Storekeeper Reginald, who sells you items from prior anniversary events; his dialogue last year hinted that he’d only return every five years, and he’s true to his word, apparently. Also not present is Bobadormu, who you may have already noticed sells the same exact goods (such as scaling classic gear and Season of Discovery class exclusive item replicas) during Classic Timewalking — since he’s tied to that event, and not the anniversary, he’s missing this year. One surprising thing missing, however, is any version of the Blackrock Depths raid that isn’t LFR. Moira is present, but does not offer to send players into Normal and Heroic Blackrock Depths, and the vendors you would normally exchange Timewarped Relic Coffer Keys with after the raid are also missing. It may be that the harder version was meant to be exclusive to the 20th anniversary, but it’s slightly disappointing to not see this return — it was hard as nails last time on Heroic, and I’m sure some players would love to take another swing at the higher difficulty of this raid. For now, we’ll just have to wait and see if Blizzard switches it back on! Blizzard Watch is a safe space for all readers.

November 17, 2025 17:30 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA News Summary: ST. LOUIS, Nov. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SC25 -- NVIDIA today announced that the world’s leading scientific computing centers are adopting NVIDIA® NVQLink™, a first-of-its-kind, universal interconnect for linking quantum processors with state-of-the-art accelerated computing. Tapping the low-latency, high-throughput interconnect, more than a dozen supercomputing centers and national research institutions across Asia and Europe are joining U.S. facilities in advancing their ability to research, develop and harness the integration of quantum and classical hardware. “In the future, supercomputers will be quantum-GPU systems — combining the unique strengths of each: the quantum computer’s ability to simulate nature and the GPU’s programmability and massive parallelism,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “NVQLink with CUDA-Q is the gateway to that future — uniting quantum and GPU computing into a single, coherent system to push the frontier of what’s computable and unlocking new scientific discoveries.” By uniting quantum processors with NVIDIA accelerated computing, NVQLink’s open system architecture overcomes control and error-correction challenges and enables the development of hybrid quantum-classical applications. It delivers 40 petaflops of AI performance at FP4 precision with a GPU-QPU throughput of 400 Gb/s and a latency of less than four microseconds. NVQLink allows the coupling of quantum processors and GPUs via tight integration with quantum control systems and GPU supercomputing within the NVIDIA CUDA-Q™ software platform. NVQLink was designed in collaboration with quantum processor and controller builders, as well as supercomputing centers across the world, including in Asia, such as: Europe and the Middle East are also embracing quantum computing research with supercomputing and quantum technology centers supporting NVQLink, including: They join the U.S. national laboratories that recently announced integration with NVQLink technology for cutting-edge research, including: Real-World Hybrid Quantum-Classical ApplicationsQuantinuum recently announced that its latest Helios QPU, and future generations of its quantum processors, will be integrated with NVIDIA GPUs through NVQLink and will draw on the power of NVIDIA CUDA-Q to orchestrate quantum error correction. NVQLink and CUDA-Q allowed the deployment of quantum error-correction techniques to successfully protect the delicate quantum information within the Helios QPU from noise, or unwanted disturbances that cause errors in quantum systems. This demonstration is the world’s first real-time use of a scalable decoder for a class of quantum error-correction codes known as qLDPC codes. The Quantinuum team demonstrated active error correction and decoding with a decoder implementation that achieved a reaction time of 67 microseconds, exceeding Helios’ two-millisecond requirement by 32x. Key to achieving this result was NVQLink’s ability to provide a flexible and configurable decoder capable of massive parallelism. The microsecond latencies and extremely high throughput provided by NVQLink are made accessible to developers through real-time application programming interfaces in NVIDIA CUDA-Q. This lets scientists and developers easily build and test approaches to quantum error correction and quantum-GPU applications within a single programming environment. In addition, NVQLink’s use of Ethernet allows researchers to easily scale the classical compute they draw on as quantum processors and applications expand.

November 17, 2025 17:30 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA News Summary: ST. LOUIS, Nov. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SC25—NVIDIA today announced that RIKEN, Japan’s leading national research institute, is integrating NVIDIA GB200 NVL4 systems with two new supercomputers in Japan — one built for AI for science and the other for quantum computing. The first system will deploy 1,600 NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, using the GB200 NVL4 platform and interconnected by NVIDIA Quantum-X800 InfiniBand networking, as part of RIKEN’s AI for science initiative. The system will advance research in areas such as life sciences, materials science, climate and weather forecasting, manufacturing and laboratory automations. The second system, dedicated to quantum computing, will feature 540 NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs — also using the GB200 NVL4 platform and interconnected by NVIDIA Quantum-X800 InfiniBand networking — to accelerate research in quantum algorithms, hybrid simulation and quantum-classical computing methods. “RIKEN has long been one of the world’s great scientific institutions, and today it stands at the forefront of a new era in computing,” said Ian Buck, vice president of hyperscale and high-performance computing (HPC) at NVIDIA. “Together, we’re helping Japan build the foundation for sovereign innovation that will drive breakthroughs to solve the world’s most complex scientific and industrial challenges.” “Integrating the NVIDIA GB200 NVL4 accelerated computing platform with our next-generation supercomputers represents a pivotal advancement for Japan’s science infrastructure,” said Satoshi Matsuoka, director of the RIKEN Center for Computational Science. “Our partnership will create one of the world’s leading unified platforms for AI, quantum and high-performance computing, allowing researchers to unlock and accelerate discoveries in fields ranging from basic sciences to industrial applications for businesses and society.” Expanding Partnership With RIKENThe two new RIKEN systems follow the announcement in August that launched a collaboration between Fujitsu and NVIDIA to codesign a flagship supercomputer with the development code name FugakuNEXT, the successor to the world-renowned Fugaku supercomputer. The two new GPU-accelerated supercomputers will also be used as proxy machines — platforms for codesigning and developing various hardware, software and applications for FugakuNEXT. The FugakuNEXT system is planned to feature FUJITSU-MONAKA-X CPUs, which can be paired with NVIDIA technologies using NVIDIA NVLink™ Fusion, new silicon enabling high-bandwidth connections between Fujitsu’s CPUs and NVIDIA’s architecture. FugakuNEXT is expected to deliver 100x greater application performance compared with supercomputers based on CPUs or other existing systems — and will integrate production-level quantum computers in the future. By combining MONAKA-X and NVIDIA’s latest GPUs, FugakuNEXT will help shape the future of scientific discovery through innovation in HPC, AI, quantum and their combinations. This growing partnership with RIKEN reflects Japan’s commitment to innovation and NVIDIA’s support in bolstering the country’s computational infrastructure and capabilities in supercomputing and AI for science. Supercomputing Software Unlocks Scientific AdvancementsNVIDIA is already working with RIKEN to develop floating point emulation software that taps into NVIDIA Tensor Core GPU performance for accelerating traditional scientific computing. This technology will allow applications to harness the full power of GPUs for AI and HPC at RIKEN and supercomputing centers worldwide. RIKEN also plans to use NVIDIA CUDA-X™ — which provides 400+ highly optimized GPU-accelerated libraries, microservices and tools — to boost its cutting-edge HPC applications with GPU platforms, helping advance AI for science and quantum computing initiatives in Japan. The two new supercomputers will be operational in spring 2026, while FugakuNEXT is aimed for operation by 2030. About NVIDIANVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the world leader in AI and accelerated computing.

A PC manufacturer came under pressure Monday after an analyst warned of margin headwinds from rising memory chip prices. Meanwhile, shares of a large tech firm advanced after a high-profile investor disclosed a stake. Major U.S. equities indexes declined as the new trading week kicked off, ahead of earnings reports from artificial intelligence chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) and several major retailers due over the coming days. The Nasdaq fell 0.8%, the S&P 500 slid 0.9%, and the Dow dropped 1.2%. For more from Investopedia on the day's markets news, see here. Several computer hardware manufacturers faced pressure Monday after Morgan Stanley analysts said surging prices for memory components could weigh on gross margins. Dell Technologies (DELL) shares dropped over 8% after the investment firm double-downgraded the PC and server maker's stock to "underweight" from "overweight." Morgan Stanley also downgraded Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) stock to "underweight" from "equal weight," and shares of the computer and printer specialist sank 7%. The price of Bitcoin (BTCUSD) extended its recent losing streak, declining to its lowest level since April. Shares of Coinbase Global (COIN), owner of the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, lost about 7%. Shares of Generac Holdings (GNRC), a provider of standby power generation equipment, also declined around 7%. The stock has been trending lower since Oct. 29, when Generac posted weaker-than-expected results for the third quarter. The company noted that a decline in power outages weighed on sales of its residential generators during the period. Shares of Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) jumped 3% to lead gains on the S&P 500 after a regulatory filing revealed Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) snapped up a new stake in the tech giant. In addition, Alphabet's YouTube TV reached an agreement with Walt Disney Co. (DIS), bringing an end to a carriage dispute that had resulted in the removal of ESPN and other Disney properties from the streaming service for several weeks. Google also launched AI-enabled travel tools designed to help users build customized itineraries, integrating flight and hotel searches along with other services like event bookings and restaurant reservations. Operators of competing online travel booking platforms slid, with Expedia Group (EXPE) stock losing nearly 8%. Shares of Booking Holdings (BKNG) and Tripadvisor (TRIP) also moved lower.

Harvard is home to top intellectuals, famous alumni, and, more recently, a sizable hoard of Bitcoin. The university has more than $442 million dollars in the BlackRock-issued ETF called iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which provides exposure to the cryptocurrency in the form of stock, according to filings released on Friday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In 2025, major companies and institutions have lined up to invest in crypto, including those from Wall Street, Silicon Valley, and increasingly, the Ivy League. Brown University has also disclosed roughly $14 million in crypto ETF holdings. Harvard has more money in the Bitcoin ETF than it does in any other stock, including its stakes in mainstay companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Amazon. While half a billion dollars in IBIT is nothing to sneeze at, it accounts for less than 1% of the university’s nearly $57 billion endowment. Harvard did not respond to a request for comment about its decision to invest in Bitcoin. Eric Balchunas, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, posted on X on Friday that Harvard’s investment in IBIT was “as good a validation as an ETF can get.” The fund Harvard invested in is one of the first spot crypto ETFs to launch in the U.S. When it went public in January 2024, it marked the end of a more than decade-long battle between the crypto sector and the SEC. It was also the first time that U.S. investors could invest in Bitcoin through their brokerage accounts, rather than through crypto exchanges. Even with a recent slump in Bitcoin prices, IBIT’s total market cap is well over $70 billion. Although Harvard’s $442 million stake in BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF is yet another sign of crypto’s growing institutional acceptance, a year of wins for the industry hasn’t translated to a big price increase for Bitcoin. In the last year, Bitcoin has gone up less than 0.5%, a fraction of the S&P 500’s 13% rise during that time. Bitcoin shot up to its all-time high price of almost $126,000 last month but is down roughly 27% to less than $92,000.

Now granted, I'm no tech genius, but I don't see a cost/benefit payoff for AI. From what I read, the industry costs so much to maintain itself, it will never make an actual profit. Which means an inevitable bubble, right? Bubbles pop! But tech bros are so convinced of their own genius, they believe their pitches. They're not completely dazzled, though. Sarah Friar, OpenAI’s finance chief, says the company would support "federal measures" to make it easier to finance sizable investments in AI chips. We remember this same philosophy when Big Shitpile crashed in 2008. Capitalism means they keep all the profits and we pay for their losses! They can't afford the high costs of the AI data farms, AND NEITHER CAN WE. All that power. All that water! All that pollution! I see potential uses for text-based AI, and medical applications, but on the whole, it's got to be too expensive for something that's so buggy. The only way to fix it? They're hiring hundreds of writers and editors to... teach AI how to write, by inputting information that's already available by hiring said writers and editors! No, I don't want AI mass surveillance, or AI making battlefield decisions. (Israel admits to a 10% error rate in their bombings, which certainly sucks for all those dead Gazans who got killed by these little tech oopsies). AI is a classic example of the motto, "Ready, fire, aim!" Via Yahoo Finance: Billionaire Peter Thiel’s latest 13F didn’t show off a mere trim, but a full-blown exit from AI bellwether Nvidia (NVDA). It comes at a surprising point when Wall Street’s been busy declaring the chipmaker as virtually untouchable. Although Nvidia recently surpassed a $5 trillion valuation, Thiel walked away completely, shrinking his fund’s equity book by roughly two-thirds while building it around three megacap names. That’s far from being a rebalance and more of an emphatic statement. Thiel had previously warned about AI’s hype cycle running far ahead of its real economics, and his Q3 portfolio shakeup aligns with that view. UPDATE: Bernie puts it all so eloquently.

Title: I finally went for it and bought unsupported prescription lenses for my Oakley Meta HSTN and Vanguard smart glasses so you don't have to. From ordering installation, here's how my experience went

Turns out, Meta's AI glasses work just fine with high-strength prescription lenses. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Of all the emerging form factors for AI, smart glasses appear to be the most promising. Many of us already wear some form of glasses daily, whether those are prescription glasses, blue-light blocking glasses, or sunglasses. Embedding smart features and AI into a product that is already a huge part of our lives sounds like a recipe for success. There's just one problem — prescription glasses-wearers, despite being likely to benefit the most from having AI on their face, are usually left out. To me, Meta makes the best smart glasses on the market, and they're ready for primetime. So, I took a leap. I spent over $500 on third-party prescription lenses for my Oakley Meta HSTN and Vanguard. Here's what it was like customizing Oakley Meta smart glasses with unsupported prescription lenses. I've worn prescription Oakley glasses and sunglasses for half a decade now, and I was excited when Meta announced it was bringing its smart glasses to Oakley frames. Unfortunately, the Oakley Meta HSTN didn't officially support my prescription, and the Oakley Meta Vanguard is not offered with prescription lenses. I wasn't about to give up, so I searched for third-party companies willing to make prescription lenses for Oakley Meta glasses. After months of research, I placed my first order with Lensology, a U.K. lens crafter that specializes in "click and fit" service for Meta glasses. I ordered a pretty specific lens configuration due to my prescription strength, and the color matched my Meta HSTN frames in the "Warm Gray" colorway. The ordering process with Lensology was easy, and the company takes care of all import charges, so you aren't hit with a bill when they arrive. The wait, however, was a bit lengthy. It took approximately two weeks for Lensology to manufacture my lenses, as the configuration I chose was non-stock. Then, the U.S. FDA spot-checked my lenses during the import process, further delaying them. I was told this was Lensology's first-ever FDA spot check (what luck!), and the company's customer service was responsive and helpful. Really, the delay was out of Lensology's control, and my lenses arrived roughly within a month of placing my order despite the snag. To make things right, Lensology sent another set of lenses free of charge, which passed customs immediately, confirming that this was just a fluke. I then searched for a way to wear prescription lenses with the Oakley Meta Vanguard and stumbled upon SVED Optical. The company manufactures prescription inserts for various types of sports glasses and goggles, and indeed, they have one for Vanguard. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android The experience ordering from SVED was exceptional for a few reasons. The company is based in the U.S., which simply makes things easier for a stateside buyer. The Vanguard inserts were also significantly cheaper, costing only $164 (even less with an email discount). They slot in behind the Vanguard's built-in Oakley Prizm sunglass lenses, which makes them more affordable. SVED delivered my Oakley Meta Vanguard inserts 12 days after I placed my order. That turnaround time is good enough to rival official Meta/Oakley handling speeds, if it sold Vanguard prescription lenses. I try to order straight from LensCrafters, the EssilorLuxottica-owned company Meta partners with for smart glasses, whenever possible. It costs more, but the return policy and warranties are exceptional. I like being able to walk into a store and get my situation handled immediately, and not having that with Lensology or SVED was a risk. To their credit, both brands accept mail-in returns within 30 days. When each order arrived, the quality and insertion process left me with no complaints. Putting the SVED inserts into the Meta Vanguard is so simple that anyone can do it. You remove the stock Vanguard nose piece and slip the SVED inserts into place. The prescription lenses are attached to a new nosepiece, which secures them to the Vanguard frame. I was skeptical about the added weight and how my prescription Vanguard setup would feel on my face. Surely, the lenses would rattle and scratch against the stock sunglass lenses, right? Between daily use and a 5K run, I was pleased to find that none of these were noticeable issues. The process was trickier for the Meta HSTN glasses, because you have to physically remove the stock lenses and push the prescription ones in their place. It'll be a harder process the thicker the prescription lenses. Lensology has a great instructional video on YouTube, though, and the company even records a test fit from their factory that validates the lenses fit in HSTN frames. If you have any experience changing out prescription lenses, the process is easy. Even if you don't, you'll get the hang of it quickly. The secret is to push really hard — you might think the glasses will break, but it's a necessary part of the process. Meta's AI glasses are already pricey, but adding prescription lenses through a third-party company further increases the cost of entry. There's inherent risk, even with reputable companies. You might be left at a loss if you get buyer's remorse and need to pay to ship the custom lenses back through the return process. That's why, after months of indecision, I gave SVED and Lensology a shot so you don't have to take that risk. I recommend both SVED and Lensology, and I ordered lenses from each with my own cash. If you can only pick one, I'd go with the Vanguard inserts. The cheaper price means you won't be in trouble if your prescription changes and you need a new set. On the other hand, the SVED and Vanguard combo isn't feasible for use indoors or at night. If you need clear or Transitions lenses, the Lensology and HSTN setup is the way to go. Now that I've gone through the process of putting unsupported prescription lenses in Oakley Meta HSTN and Vanguard, I think anyone on the fence should do the same. It's worth it because Meta glasses are a game-changer, and everyone should get to experience them. The best AI glasses Oakley Meta Vanguard are the best smart glasses on the market with an IP67 durability rating, a louder speaker, and a central 3K video camera. Garmin and Strava integration are the icing on the cake for fitness buffs. The standard retail versions of the Oakley Meta glasses are not typically sold with prescription lenses installed by default. While you can purchase prescription lenses for the Meta HSTN glasses, they only fall within a certain range. The Vanguard glasses do not officially support prescription lenses. The Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses support a prescription range of -6.00 to +4.00, which is the same range offered by the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2. You'll first have to remove the original lenses by pushing them out from the back of the frame. You may have to push quite hard for them to pop out. Afterwards, you snap on the new lenses by pushing them into the from from the front. You must remove the nose piece from the Vanguard and replace it with the SVED nose piece insert with the lenses attached. The prescription lenses will be placed behind the Vanguard sunglass lenses.

Title: Dutta Dismantles the Fed's Rate-Hold Case
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2025/11/17/dutta-ends-the-fed/
Time Published: 2025-11-17T19:26:30Z

Renaissance Macro economist Neil Dutta says the Federal Reserve is on the verge of making a serious policy mistake as various officials drift toward keeping rates steady instead of cutting next month. Dutta argues in a client note published Monday that officials have misread the labor market, overstated inflation risks, and are now preparing to abandon proactive policy as conditions deteriorate. The inflation picture, Dutta writes, looks far less threatening than the hawks contend. Throughout 2025, the narrative around tariff pass-through has shifted repeatedly. First came predictions that firms would raise prices preemptively. Then the theory was that companies would draw down inventories first. Now officials are waiting for price increases to arrive next year. Yet inflation has consistently disappointed these predictions. “What’s clear is that since tariffs have been put on, inflation has generally come in weaker than expected,” Dutta writes. “This would imply less pass-through than expected.” Core PCE has moderated over six months. Used car prices, which lead consumer inflation by roughly three months, have plummeted. Rental inflation is weakening. Restaurants are holding prices to preserve market share. The disinflationary pressures are mounting, not receding. On the labor market, Dutta delivers an equally withering assessment. The problem isn’t tight labor supply from immigration enforcement, he argues. It’s flagging demand. Job vacancies are declining. Underemployment is rising. The payroll diffusion index—a gauge of whether job gains are concentrated in a few sectors or spread broadly across the economy—has stayed below 50 percent since April, meaning weakness is spreading across industries. Real wages are falling fastest for workers most likely to compete with undocumented immigrants, the opposite of what tight labor supply would produce. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has leaned heavily on low jobless claims as evidence of stability. Dutta says Powell is reading the data incorrectly. “Initial claims are less a leading indicator and more an indicator that just happens to come out every week,” he writes. Claims tend rise after hiring has already declined sharply, not before. Waiting for claims to rise when other indicators point to labor market softness risks putting the Fed behind the curve. “When companies like Verizon, Amazon, and Target are all announcing layoffs around the same time, one would expect at least some follow-through into measures like initial claims,” Dutta writes. The gravest risk, Dutta warns, isn’t what the Fed does in December. It’s what skipping December signals. “If the Fed does nothing next month, they won’t do anything in January. You don’t skip one month if you think you are going the next,” he writes. Skipping signals that the central bank has abandoned proactive policy and will wait for obvious damage before acting.

Title: Inside Commercial Observer’s 2025 Fall Finance Forum

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Some of the biggest names in commercial real estate finance discussed the state of capital markets during Commercial Observer’s National Finance Forum, as the conversation touched on an improved lending market, especially for securitized products, where opportunities are found in a highly competitive credit space, and how lenders can best protect themselves. The symposium, held Nov. 13 at The Metropolitan Club at 1 East 60th Street in Midtown Manhattan, opened with a keynote general discussion between Chad Tredway, managing director, global head of real estate at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, and Bonnie Neuman, partner and global head of real estate group at law firm Sidley Austin, one moderated by CO Executive Editor Cathy Cunningham. Tredway began by noting that since CRE capital markets hit bottom at the end of 2024, J.P. Morgan has seen each aspect of its entire $80 billion CRE portfolio appreciate every quarter since then and that investors are taking notice. “Real estate still has room to recover, but we’re finding people shift out of cash, shift out of equities, and shift out of fixed-income and they’re coming back into real estate, and we firmly believe 2026 should be a great vintage,” said Tredway. “The headline is real estate is coming back.” Neuman noted that while the year started off with lingering valuation issues due to high interest rates, the valuation disconnect has evaporated, interest rates have dropped, and the office market has seen sales finally gain some momentum, due to commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) financing aiding the repricing of risk as conditions have shifted. “In the securitized space, where I spent most of my time, it’s been a roaring year, with a huge amount of originations,” she said, noting the CMBS market will have at least $150 billion in originations in 2025. “It’s been a busy year in the syndicated and balance sheet securitized loan markets.” Neuman emphasized the transaction market for debt has become “highly competitive,” due to the re-emergence of commercial banks, as well as the growth of debt funds, private credit, bank-backed leverage, and bridge leverage gaps being closed by preferred equity, which she called “a bit of trend recently in some transactions.” Tredway closed his remarks by stating how J.P. Morgan is moving as quickly as it can to capture value in the market by buying assets below replacement cost, where cash yields should improve as interest rates come down in the months ahead. “For those that have equity, the time is now,” he said. “We strongly believe that we’re going into a massive tailwind here, and if rates continue to go down it gets even better.” The next panel, moderated by Jay Neveloff, chair of U.S. real estate at HSF Kramer, examined the state of the market in 2025 and what we should expect in 2026 and beyond with a diverse collection of lenders, brokers and investors. Kyle Jeffers, chief investment officer at Acore Capital, said his firm is “aggressively going back” into the market, with most lenders lending at a basis that’s been significantly reset below replacement cost, and that his firm recently financed an office deal that was 30 percent the previous owner’s basis. “You can’t predict the bottom, but it certainly feels like we bounced off the bottom and are on our way up,” said Jeffers. “So this is the time to be leaning into the market.” Nick Scribani, vice chairman at Newmark, noted that investment sale activity is up 20 percent compared to 2024, when the market had been muted due to the high cost of debt and most balance sheet lenders chose to remain on the sidelines. But the last 12 months has been “a proliferation of repressed energy,” Scribani said, concerning the deployment of capital, especially into the CMBS market. “There’s so much ability to access capital, particularly in the debt marketplace, where you can actually borrow with positive leverage,” he said. “People are coming off the sidelines as quickly as they can, because you’re going to miss the train if you’re still sidelined.” Karen Ramos, managing director and head of distribution and asset rotation Americas at Crédit Agricole CIB, agreed that commercial banks have returned from the sidelines, but the real liquidity story is debt funds and private credit increasing their activity to finance huge deals, mainly for data centers, with back leverage. “We’re seeing the debt funds and private credit come in such a huge way in terms of big commitments as much as $2 billion,” she said. “And that’s bringing a lot of the liquidity from a new source, in addition to the typical banks.” Aaron Kraus, managing director and head of market development and strategy at Nuveen Green Capital, spoke of what it’s like to finance C-PACE projects, which typically fill gaps in ground-up construction capital stacks, and how the underwriting among debt funds is often too high for those deals, but with spreads tightening in recent months, the entire financing space has become more competitive. “Spreads have come in so tightly in the last six months,” Kraus emphasized. “On the terms we’re seeing, from both debt funds and banks, it’s a much tighter rate environment,and everyone is competing.” Neveloff then asked the lenders how they remain competitive and find an advantage in a market awash in borrower friendly capital and filled with hundreds of new sources for CRE loans that are changing the game on debt service coverage ratios and loan-to-value ratios. Yorick Starr, managing director at Invesco, pointed to prioritizing quality sponsorship when underwriting and assessing deals. “We’re first and foremost all about the sponsor,” he said. “We’ve seen it time and time again, if you lend to the right people, structure aside, you typically get paid back or they have enough money that they’ll figure it out.” He also said that as a firm that primarily invests equity into deals, Invesco underwrites the quality of the real estate aggressively. “Is it real estate that we want to own? Is it a market that we currently own in? Do we understand the asset class?” he said. “Am I lending to the right person on the right asset in the right market?” Jeffers pointed to leaning in to relationships formed in the fires of COVID-19, the regional banking crisis of 2023, and the recent interest rate upheaval. “You compete on relationships,” he said. “What we’ve learned in the last couple of years is knowing your lender, knowing what your relationship is, and knowing how you work together in hard times makes a difference.” The third panel examined market volatility and was hosted by Michael Vines, partner at Fried Frank. Ironically, the discussion first examined how strong the market is right now and how little volatility there is relative to previous years in this decade. John Lippmann, head of U.S. real estate capital markets at Barings, pointed ot the strength of the CMBS market, where issuance stands at $106 billion, up 15 percent year-to-date, largely fueled by a surge of single-asset, single-borrower (SASB) financing up nearly 30 percent. He noted that commercial bank balance sheets right now hold more than $250 billion in capital available to loan as back leverage or note-on-note financings for debt funds. “That number may grow as we see continued regulatory benefits for banks to be the Senior lender of choice but maybe not the direct lender of choice to commercial real estate,” Lippmann said. The topic then turned to distress. Natalia Sosnina, head of acquisitions at Terra Strategies, said that it’s become harder for her firm to find deals during a time of distress due to the competition for opportunistic debt buys — with office buildings being the only asset class providing discounts. “Most of the time, even if the borrower is in distress and the situation of the building is bad, lenders are not really in distress — they all want close to par,” she said. “For us, it’s very difficult to assume that kind of risk to buy a distressed note and then pay a lender close to par.” Andrew Huggett, managing director of loan syndications at First Citizens Bank, said that the volatility amid a new, highly competitive lending landscape has made it necessary for banks to make large whole loan amounts and leave them on their books or use syndication agreements with other lenders to win large CRE deals. “You won’t win a deal unless you’re willing to either fully take it down, book and hold [the loan], or raise your hand and be willing to selectively syndicate,” he said. Shawn Katz, president of Silverstein Capital Partners, said that with so much liquidity in the market, especially in private credit, his firm is finding opportunities lending into broken capital stacks that need just a bit of equity to close a persistent gap, rather than riskier whole loans into big construction projects. “Our underwriting doesn’t change, it stays consistent, and when you look at risk-adjusted returns, where we lend, we’re seeing the most opportunity in the gap equity space,” he said. “And where we’re delivering whole loans in ground-up construction, or value-add, those risk-adjusted returns aren’t there.” When asked how lenders and investors are viewing risk in today’s market, David Friedman, chief credit officer and head of non-agency production and syndications at Arbor Realty Trust, said that it all comes down to who one is lending to or investing with, especially construction loans, bridge and mezzanine financings, or preferred equity. “We’re looking under the hood, not just at the asset, but who is the borrower, who is the sponsor, what is their equity contribution,” he said. “We lend on real estate, but we lend to people — you can see structure erode away or be totally structured up with the wrong sponsor.” The ensuing panel “The Role & Impact of Non-Bank Lenders in the Market Today” discussed the increased role of private credit over the past decade and a half as banks and insurance companies look to reduce their exposure to CRE risk. Michael Lavipour, senior managing director, head of lending at Affinius Capital, said private lenders have filled a void for providing necessary recap funding for 2021 vintage development loans issued when interest rates were at near zero borrowing levels. Lavipour also noted that non-bank lenders are also increasingly lending on behalf of insurance companies. Lavipour said he expects that the growth of private lenders will likely slow down in the couple years similar to what happened with the CMBS market 10 years ago. He stressed, however, that the last 90 days has seen more competition which has pushed leverage levels up about 5 percent. “When you find a deal that makes a good credit, you lean in on it. And when you find a deal that is being bid like crazy, and you are kind of wishy-washy on it, you take a step back, and if you can’t deploy you can’t deploy,” Lavipour said. “It’s not an easy market from that perspective, but there is still opportunity for sure with a large number of deals.” The non-bank lenders panel — moderated by Christine O’Connell, partner at King & Spalding — also featured Maxwell Wu, co-founder and CEO of Fulcrum Lending, and Robert Rothschild, managing director at InterVest Capital Partners. Rothschild said many private credit shops now also have an equity business which has proven to be advantageous in the marketplace because of the increased institutional knowledge about individual assets that require equity positions. “As we’ve grown and evolved into the space, the borrowers, the sponsors and developers have seen that the lenders are much more agile,” Rothschild said. “[Private credit lenders] understand the risks and they understand the real estate a lot more than maybe the bank lender might have five to 10 years ago, and that ultimately is the advantage for the underlying sponsor because they have a lender that really understands to underwrite different hypothetical situations.” The following panel, “Recaps & Filling the Capital Stack,” addressed how private credit has played a pivotal role in helping more deals pencil in an elevated interest rate environment with more common and preferred equity products. “The solutions that you see supporting the capital are pretty wide ranging and the depth of market is pretty strong because of the perceived relative value there,” said Brad Bitting, managing director at Post Brothers, speaking on sponsors’ preference for private credit. Ethan Elser, executive vice president of PACE Equity, said commercial property accessed clean energy (C-PACE) loans can also be an effective tool to reduce the cost of capital in an expensive debt deal. He noted that C-PACE is also for recaps often used in mid-construction, or up to three years post construction, that can help sponsors achieve more favorable terms with the senior lender if they need more time to achieve their business plan. Elser added that C-PACE continues to grow as a lending tool with originations on pace for $3.5 billion to $4 billion this year up from $2.5 billion in 2024. The panel — moderated by Mark Fawer, partner at Greenspoon Marder — also consisted of Morris Betesh, founder and managing partner at Arrow Real Estate Advisors, and Daniella Marca, executive director, real estate debt, at BlackRock. Betesh said the CRE debt markets are “very healthy” now, with insurance companies aggressively bidding for deals and banks also back lending on all CRE asset classes. He said regional banks including Flagstar Bank (formerly New York Community Bank) have returned to the CRE debt market and cleaned out their portfolios after getting saddled with some troubled New York City loans when interest rates soared in 2022. The day’s penultimate panel, “Old vs. New: Showcasing the Most Coveted Lending Opportunities,” stressed that the office market has made a comeback in certain markets. Keith Kurland, senior managing director and co-head of New York City capital markets at Walker & Dunlop, said the brokerage has arranged billions of loans for Manhattan office assets this year with banks showing particular interest in lending on the asset class from their balance sheets. Kurland said the bank appetite for New York City office hasn’t existed since pre-COVID. Zachary Cohn, managing partner at Brookfield, said with interest rates 150 basis points lower than a year ago, 2026 is shaping up to see a bounce back in the acquisitions market. He also stressed that the CRE industry is well positioned for a transition of CRE assets from banks to private credit since lenders are not overleveraged to levels they were during the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. “The capital space is stable,” Cohn said. “It’s a long-term theme that will drive our markets in a really impactful way.” The last panel — moderated by Joseph Lanzkron, partner at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton — also featured Dan Cooperman, head of investments at Mavik Capital Management; Jacob Weinstein, executive vice president, head of real estate and health care at BHI; and Annemarie DiCola, CEO at Trepp. DiCola said CMBS volume is on pace for a banner 2026, likely to reach $120 billion by year’s end, which would be the highest total since 2007. She noted that 75 percent of the CMBS volume has single-asset, single-borrower deals with most of the transactions for Class A office properties.

Title: BlackRock XRP ETF Speculation Hit New Highs As XRPC Performance Shocks Markets

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. The speculation surrounding a potential BlackRock XRP ETF has surged to new heights. This surge is a direct consequence of the astonishing market debut of the Canary XRPC ETF. Canary XRP ETF’s launch has painted a clear picture of robust institutional and retail demand for a regulated XRP investment product. As the speculation around a potential BlackRock XRP ETF is heating up again, the Canary XRPC ETF has delivered one of the strongest launches of the year. An analyst known as Skipper_xrp has noted on X that the newly listed fund stunned the market with over $58 million in first-day trading volume and $245 million in net inflows, outperforming hundreds of ETF debuts of 2025. Skipper_xrp mentioned that many supporters in the XRP community still believe that BlackRock might already be quietly experimenting with or even testing the idea of an XRP trust behind closed doors. The momentum has increased further after Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse made a statement at the company’s Swell event, highlighting that Ripple’s ongoing collaboration with major traditional financial firms will bring digital asset adoption into regulated global markets. However, with the ETF inflows accelerating and XRP gaining more visibility among institutions, many investors are now arguing that it’s only a matter of time before a heavyweight firm like BlackRock will consider stepping into the XRP space. Crypto trader Adam_Xrp has also offered some insight on why XRP didn’t moon when the first ETF was launched. According to the expert, the XRP ETF launch was never going to be a flip-the-switch moment. Even with the first XRP ETF going live, price action was building slowly, and the institutional money did not pour in all at once. Rather, it scales over time as confidence and liquidity grow. Furthermore, the altcoin is still early in the rollout, and more XRP ETFs are scheduled to begin trading. Each new product will increase exposure, volume, and demand. This is how true institutional adoption is slowly progressing. BlackRock has stated that the company is not launching an XRP ETF right now, but this isn’t something they would ignore forever. However, once the regulatory path is fully cleared and institutional demand strengthens, it’s only a matter of time before the biggest players, like BlackRock, will step into the arena. Adam_Xrp concluded that the altcoin wasn’t supposed to skyrocket overnight. This phase is a gradual process of foundation building as the ecosystem, liquidity expansion, and the institutional framework grow. The expert added that if you expect to get rich overnight, without understanding the long-term game plan, then XRP might not be the right investment for you.

I grew up with my three siblings who have always been my idols and mentors, helping me to grow and understand the way of life. My name is Godspower Owie, and I was born and brought up in Edo State, Nigeria. I grew up with my three siblings who have always been my idols and mentors, helping me to grow and understand the way of life. My parents are literally the backbone of my story. They’ve always supported me in good and bad times and never for once left my side whenever I feel lost in this world. Honestly, having such amazing parents makes you feel safe and secure, and I won’t trade them for anything else in this world. I was exposed to the cryptocurrency world 3 years ago and got so interested in knowing so much about it. It all started when a friend of mine invested in a crypto asset, which he yielded massive gains from his investments. When I confronted him about cryptocurrency he explained his journey so far in the field. It was impressive getting to know about his consistency and dedication in the space despite the risks involved, and these are the major reasons why I got so interested in cryptocurrency. Trust me, I’ve had my share of experience with the ups and downs in the market but I never for once lost the passion to grow in the field. This is because I believe growth leads to excellence and that’s my goal in the field. And today, I am an employee of Bitcoinnist and NewsBTC news outlets. My Bosses and co-workers are the best kinds of people I have ever worked with, in and outside the crypto landscape. I intend to give my all working alongside my amazing colleagues for the growth of these companies. Sometimes I like to picture myself as an explorer, this is because I like visiting new places, I like learning new things (useful things to be precise), I like meeting new people - people who make an impact in my life no matter how little it is. One of the things I love and enjoy doing the most is football. It will remain my favorite outdoor activity, probably because I'm so good at it. I am also very good at singing, dancing, acting, fashion and others. I cherish my time, work, family, and loved ones. I mean, those are probably the most important things in anyone's life. I don't chase illusions, I chase dreams. I know there is still a lot about myself that I need to figure out as I strive to become successful in life. I’m certain I will get there because I know I am not a quitter, and I will give my all till the very end to see myself at the top. I aspire to be a boss someday, having people work under me just as I’ve worked under great people. This is one of my biggest dreams professionally, and one I do not take lightly. Everyone knows the road ahead is not as easy as it looks, but with God Almighty, my family, and shared passion friends, there is no stopping me.

Peter Thiel has fully exited Nvidia in Q3. He sold all 537,742 shares worth nearly $100 million. The stake made up almost 40% of his fund. Thiel Macro cut its US equity holdings from $212 million to $74 million. SoftBank also dumped its entire $5.8 billion Nvidia stake. Michael Burry added pressure by taking put positions tied to Nvidia and Palantir. Nvidia remains the core of the AI trade, but these exits signal rising caution. Investors now fear valuations may have peaked as data-center spending shows early signs of slowing.

Ashes of Creation could be the next big MMO, if it ever releases in full. By Cameron Koch on November 17, 2025 at 9:32AM PST Indie MMORPG Ashes of Creation, first announced in 2016, is finally coming to Steam. While the game once it fully launches won't have an upfront box cost, developer Intrepid Studios announced it will begin selling access to the game's alpha and beta tests for $50. That's actually a discount, as alpha access currently costs $100 on the official Ashes of Creation website. Come December 11, however, that price will go down to $50 to coincide with the game's arrival on Steam. Intrepid makes clear it doesn't have a specific end date for early access, but that following alpha testing, the game will move into two beta periods before releasing in full. Following early access, Ashes of Creation will require a monthly subscription to play. Being in alpha, those who do pay $50 to test Ashes of Creation will experience "frequent updates and realm wipes, unstable builds, incomplete content, and ongoing balance adjustments," according to the game's Steam early-access FAQ. "Early-access participants should approach this phase as a testing experience, not a finished product," Intrepid states. Purchasing the early-access version of Ashes of Creation does come with a few other additions, including a cosmetic cloak and one month of game time for when the game does officially release. Intrepid is aiming for Ashes of Creation to be a "sandbox" MMORPG where the world will evolve and change alongside players, who will be able to build, defend, or destroy player-governed cities. In addition to large-scale PvP battles, Ashes of Creation will also feature dungeons and raids, as well as eight classes and nine races to choose from. "Early-access players are not just testers--they're pioneers of Verra, helping us refine mechanics, uncover bugs, and shape the world's political, economic, and social dynamics," Intrepid states. "Every test helps us get closer to delivering an MMORPG where the world truly reacts to its players." Ashes of Creation ran a Kickstarter campaign in 2017, where it raised over $3.2 million. Closed alpha testing began in 2021 for those who were willing to pay $500 for the privilege. That same year, Intrepid announced Ashes of Creation would move from Unreal Engine 4 to Unreal Engine 5. It's been a rough year for MMOs so far. NetEase just canceled two MMOs--one set in the Warhammer universe and another called project Ghost led by former World of Warcraft veteran Greg Street. Recent layoffs at Amazon have led to the end of active development on its MMO New World, which once had more than 900,000 concurrent players on Steam. At the same time, Amazon also announced it was canceling a new Lord of the Rings MMO. It was, strangely, not the first time that has happened. A similar story played out at Microsoft earlier this year, when layoffs at The Elder Scrolls Online developer ZeniMax Online Studios led to the cancelation of a new, unannounced sci-fi MMO.

Title: Ripple Exec Addresses Tax Issue On XRP Ledger, Where Does It Go?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. A debate over the XRP Ledger’s (XRPL) economy model has ignited after Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), David Schwartz, directly addressed questions about taxation on the blockchain. Critics have suggested that if XRP holders do not earn from the ecosystem, someone must be collecting a tax. Schwartz’s response challenges this assumption, framing the XRP Ledger as a public utility rather than a profit-generating mechanism for token holders. The debate has since sparked broader conversations about real-world use cases, passive income expectations, and the underlying purpose of the XRPL blockchain. In a post on X social media, Schwartz clarified that the XRP Ledger does not impose a tax on its users. He explained that the ledger allows holders to issue assets, trade, create NFTs, and make payments without central authority extracting value from these financial activities. He also stated that transaction fees and reserves exist solely as anti-spam measures, not as a mechanism for wealth extraction. The Ripple CTO emphasized that ownership of XRP does not give anyone the right to collect fees or profits from the ledger itself. He drew a comparison to Bitcoin’s blockchain, highlighting that the XRPL provides similar decentralized functionality while also supporting features such as Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs), stablecoins, and NFTs. These features work without XRP holders needing to profit from the system’s operations. Schwartz’s remarks on taxes on the XRPL blockchain come after Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, raised questions about who benefits if XRP holders do not earn anything from the ecosystem and the protocol itself does not generate value. In response, other members of the community, including XRPL dUNL validator Vet, emphasized that the absence of a tax encourages developers and users to focus on building meaningful, functional use cases rather than relying on passive income. The XRPL tax debate between Schwartz and Sigel also intersected with discussions about the blockchain’s real-world applications. In a much earlier post, Sigel questioned the blockchain’s relevance, subtly hinting that its supporters overstate its functionality. In response, an XRP community member pointed to the recent collaboration between Ondo Finance, Ripple, and BlackRock, in which the XRP Ledger will be utilized for stablecoin issuance, minting, Treasury asset redemption, and liquidity enhancement in financial markets. While Sigel acknowledged the innovative initiative, he reiterated that these applications do not directly generate revenue for XRP token holders, highlighting a gap between network activity and personal gain. Schwartz responded by explaining that the value of XRPL stems from enabling financial independence and reducing reliance on intermediaries, rather than providing passive income. He added that focusing on tax collection as a measure of success can overshadow the blockchain’s purpose of promoting open access and meaningful innovation.

Title: The Glassing of the Drones and the Future of those Regions

“How did you go bankrupt?” Bill asked. “Two ways,” Mike said. “Gradually and then suddenly.” -Ernest Hemingway, The Sun Also Rises. One of the crazy aspects of the collapse of Pandemic Horde as an alliance has been how suddenly everything fell to pieces for them. As with the Hemingway quote, they seemed to be failing slowly for quite a while… pulling back as we moved forward, giving up whole regions without a fight… and then everything fell apart. I have a post in mind to trace that path, to put a timeline and some structure around it. But that is something for another day. This past week saw the Imperium wrapped up in taking apart the Drone regions, one structure at a time. That started with the Keepstar in R-AG7W, which feels like it blew up ages ago, but it was just last week. The Keepstar finally boiling over into a wreck Then there was a brief respite or maybe a day or two when people moved back to Insmother after the big event when we were deploying back again to the Keepstar we dropped in the system, or to the Keepstar that Solyaris Chtonium sold us, to start setting timers on structures. I got out there on my main and my alt, each in a Kikimora, each loaded up with Occult, the high damage, short range ammo preferred for structure bashing, and then started going on structure shoot fleets. My Kikimora on its way For a few days it was almost bizarre out in the Drone regions it was so quiet. We had fleets moving all over, but there were almost no hostiles to be seen. We had temp blued Solyaris Chtonium as part of the Keepstar deal so they could move north to setup shop with Fraternity as WinterCo without us shooting them. Likewise, Northern Coalition, NCDot, also betrayed by Pandemic Horde, was focused on move ops out of the Drones and into the north. There were regular camps at a couple of the regional gates getting into the Drone regions, but within the regions itself it was often safe to simply move around on your own. That changed as the weekend arrived and other groups saw some opportunities to camp gates within the Drones and drop on unwary Imperium pilots lulled into a false sense of security after a few days of quiet. That led to a titan out shooting structures getting dropped on and destroyed. Pings went out to remind people not to randomly drive caps around in space where hostiles were hunting. I was in a fleet of Kikis shooting a Tatara that got hot dropped by Hard Knocks Citizens just as we were almost done. They blew up a couple of our ships as we warped off, then proceeded to finish off the structure for us, so we all got on that kill mail. Our job done, we moved on to the next target assigned. They didn’t follow, but they had a fax in tow, so they weren’t going to chase a bunch of destroyers around. Kikis moving on to the next target Target assignments were often a study in chaos management. There were a couplel hundred timers reports to be on the tracking board that our operational coordination group was using, and as new timers came up we often had to split our fleets or get a timer deep enough in so that we could run off to the next timer and let somebody else follow up and hopefully pick up where we left off before the structure self repair finished. This meme was posted during one of our fleets on Saturday morning my time. We were certainly in demand I have been in more system in the Drone regions in the last few days than I have probably been in the last decade. And we kept on rolling, gating to the next location and shooting to set the next structure timer. Kikis orbiting the FC in a Monitor Even in the chaos, a lot of structures went down. The Imperium killed five Keepstars on Friday the 14th.. The Keepstar Count for November 14 That is the most Keepstars killed in a single day that I can recall, something that seems confirmed by looking down the list of Keepstar losses over on zKillboard. I wrote about us blowing up three in a single day back in 2023. Now the benchmark is five, so it wasn’t as big of a deal when we blew up four more on the 15th I suppose. We did manage five more within a 24 hour period starting Sunday and ending today. I did not get on any of those kills. In fact, I spent so much time on Saturday setting timers that I was starting to think that “No killmails for Kikis” might be on the coord guidelines. But there was so much to be done that there was no way to keep up with all the timers and get everybody on the big kills. And I did end up getting on a few. All I need is a few explosions to be happy. Another fiery structure death Overall, a crazy amount of stuff has been destroyed. More than once we found ourselves shooting the wrong structure because there were so many possible timers. I burned through at least 15K rounds of Occult, the close range, high damage small Trig ammo. I saw somebody out in our fleets with a laser fit Gnosis and was jealous. Lasers are the way to go. We need a laser doctrine for bashing. Laser Gnosis shooting a fort As for the destruction, I haven’t seen a total count yet. There was a battle report put together for late Thursday to early Friday last week that showed 2.9 trillion ISK destroyed… and less than a billion of it was ours. Battle Report Header If you go to that link and scroll down the list, you will see a lot of dead structures. And that sort of thing carried on all through the weekend. Somebody will calculate a total at some point I am sure. Meanwhile, Pandemic Horde has been slimming down to become that smaller, elite PvP organization that was promised in past announcements from their leadership. Top Ten Alliances – October 15 vs. November 15 Fraternity, Insidious, and The Initiative seem to be the biggest recipients of PH refugees. I suspect that the outflow isn’t higher because the corps that could negotiate a move because they had a reputation or record to recommend them did. That left behind smaller and more casual corps, plus all the characters in the PH run corps like Pandemic Horde Inc, A Blessed Bean, and Horde Vanguard have to move on their own, and other alliances are busy with corporation moves and probably ignoring single players. Then there are the AFK players who are going to come back to a surprise. And then there is the future of the Drone regions. Asher posted an update to Reddit last night that said the following: Here is the path going forward: Sov: We intend to hold the ihub in G-QTSD and nowhere else. Please start attempting to take sov on Wednesday, we kindly ask if you are taking sov ignore the Imperium glassing fleets, they will do the same to you. The slower it goes for us the longer we’ll be in your future space. Structures: We have glassed many trillions of isk in structures, at one point our timerboard had 635 timers on it. The majority are dead but many still remain which we will be destroying over the next week. If you want to move in – any structure that begins anchoring Saturday the 22nd eve time 00:01 will be considered safe from glassing. We will not destroy any structure that begins anchoring after this time. We may still finish up previous timers after this date expires but we plan to undeploy from the dronelands by the end of this coming weekend. Freeports: Freeport keepstars are in LXQ2-T, 9WVY-F, and F9-FUV. These will contains markets but not jump clones. They will be freeports open to all alliances except Pandemic Horde. You may use them for logistics security, to stage out of, whatever you desire. We are intentionally not putting cloning in to make them less desirable than setting up your own citadel. We will not be holding sov in these freeport systems, you are free to take the sov, moons, etc but not cyno jam the system. We will defend the keepstars from refs – we will reset sov/destroy cyno jammers as needed, so that general logistics security is assured in the dronelands. Overall our hope is that you can find a space where you can grow and flourish. We have burnt down the old monoculture renting forest and we hope a thriving ecosystem will grow. We will not be enforcing byzantine agreements or trying to force people into a fake nullsec with rules meant to keep you from playing the game. Good luck in the dronelands! So we will continue burning things down until we’re done. Some groups have already started moving into the region. We actually hit Keepstar in a system that Brotherhood of Spacers, who used to live in Venal until WinterCo pushed them out in the B2 war, and they pulled out a titan and gave us a ride to our next destination. We were clearing out their future home after all. A B0SS titan waiting to give us a ride We did get a little frisky when Asher warped us over to one of their structures and some people started shooting it… I mean, it is what we had been doing for days, right? No harm no foul though, it was just the shield that took a few hits. Overall it has been a busy few days… week… however long it has been since we jumped into the region feet first. My participation count is up considerably from past months. What have I been up to? That number isn’t a brag… I’d get laughed out of any contest with just that number given how many ops some people are running. I went on fleets with Reageaan at opposite ends of the clock where I slept in between and I am pretty sure he did not. And we get credit for every account that goes along, so I dual-boxed some fleets. But that means that guy with 6 Catalysts in every op I went on was getting 3x to 6x the credit. The number is just an indicator of how much time I’ve spent playing relative to the past couple of months. (That number went up to 50 as I went on ops while writing this, but didn’t want to take a new screen shot. Also, coord gives us bonus credit occasionally for long or annoying ops, so that Woosi fleet where we were sent all over space got us triple credit.) Soon enough we’ll be done, the Drone regions will be clear and we’ll head home and see what develops in this new open section of null sec. Related: I’m very interested to see what becomes of the drone lands. Years ago I’ve written about my time in the Interstellar Starbase Syndicate and their take on a FFA nullsec (jeez…almost twenty years ago!). That didn’t go so well. Then again, we didn’t have a 60k pilot alliance to ensure its freedom, so… LikeLike I’m also hopeful but a little skeptical of its future. I know Asher has done his utmost to make the rules as simple as possible. But I’m afraid the chain reaction of batphones that may occur if/when there’s a big fight will drag him into the type of rules lawyering they’re trying to avoid. Mission creep will set in, unless every single group can avoid any appearance of being a proxy or connected to a bloc in any way. Will that happen? Maybe, who knows. But if a casino was offering even odds on the matter, I’d bet against it. LikeLike As always, we are fighting human nature, and the odds in that fight are never good.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © BING-JHEN HONG / iStock Editorial via Getty Images With AI bubble talk, markets are swimming in red. However, that’s not stopping analysts from pounding the table over stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) heading into earnings after the bell on Wednesday. Heading into earnings, analysts at Bank of America just reiterated a buy rating on NVDA. Analysts at Rothschild & Co. also reiterated a buy rating on NVDA, raising its target price to $245 from $211 a share. Oppenheimer reiterated an outperform rating with a price target of $265 a share. Citi reiterated a buy rating on the stock, with a price target of $220 from $210. The firm expects NVDA to post sales of $56.8 billion, as compared to analyst expectations for $54.6 billion. Analysts at Barclays just upgraded Gap (NYSE: GPS) to an overweight rating, noting that it sees a brand recovery. “We upgrade GAP shares following a disciplined leadership strategy under CEO Richard Dickson, focused on long-term sales and margin recovery across all brands through product innovation, customer targeting, and marketing excellence,” said the firm, as quoted by CNBC. Just last week, analysts at Jefferies upgraded Gap to a buy rating, with a price target of $30. The firm expects Gap to build on its strong momentum through brand revitalization, which could support both top and bottom-line growth. Analysts at Stifel just reiterated a buy rating on Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), with a price target of $508. “Following strong 3Q25 sales, we expect some headwinds for auto sales following the expiration of the U.S. EV tax credit. Importantly, we believe TSLA is making strong progress on FSD and Robotaxi, both of which we believe is critical to value creation,” said the firm, as also quoted by CNBC. In addition, Stifel pointed to updates to Tesla’s full self-driving system, with the company planning to add “reasoning capabilities” in newer versions. The firm was also impressed with Tesla’s strong earnings and revenue. In its most recent quarter, Tesla posted revenue of $28.1 billion, which was well above estimates of $26.37 billion.

Title: Michael Saylor’s Strategy Buys 8,178 Bitcoin, BTC Reversal Soon?

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Michael Saylor’s Strategy acquired 8,178 BTC for $835.6 million, bringing total holdings to 649,870 BTC, despite ongoing market volatility. Michael Saylor has kept his word, making yet another massive Bitcoin BTC $91 468 24h volatility: 0.1% Market cap: $1.83 T Vol. 24h: $76.38 B purchase of 8,178 BTC, adding it to the Strategy (NASDAQ: MSTR) portfolio. His purchase comes despite sharp volatility in BTC, which is currently trading around $93,500. The MSTR stock price has meanwhile slipped, falling 2.28 percent in Monday’s pre-market trading. Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor announced that the company has purchased an additional 8,178 BTC for roughly $835.6 million. This latest acquisition came at an average price of about $102,171 per Bitcoin. Strategy has acquired 8,178 BTC for ~$835.6 million at ~$102,171 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 27.8% YTD 2025. As of 11/16/2025, we hodl 649,870 $BTC acquired for ~$48.37 billion at ~$74,433 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRC $STRD $STRE $STRF $STRK https://t.co/HI1TeYOvQ9 — Michael Saylor (@saylor) November 17, 2025 The firm’s Bitcoin strategy has generated a year-to-date yield of 27.8% in 2025, as per the filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As of November 16, 2025, Strategy holds 649,870 BTC in its corporate treasury, accumulated at a total cost of roughly $48.37 billion, or an average of $74,433 per BTC. This puts to rest the rumors that Michael Saylor’s Strategy has been selling BTC during the recent price correction. Saylor rejected the claims and said they are firmly “HODLing with diamond hands.” Despite this, MSTR stock price has failed to see the upside, and has slipped further under $200. On Monday’s pre-market trading session, MSTR stock is down by another 2.28% and is currently trading at $195 levels. Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that the MSTR stock could further drop to $120 levels if bulls fail with a strong recovery. If this fractal continues to play out, Strategy $MSTR could soon rebound to $260 before rolling over toward $120. https://t.co/hwQ5zMu9BM pic.twitter.com/Vg4ZaPGHHP — Ali (@ali_charts) November 14, 2025 On the other hand, Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff called Strategy’s business model as fraud. MSTR’s entire business model is a fraud. Saylor and I will both be speaking at Binance Blockchain Week in Dubai in early December. I challenge @saylor to debate this proposition with me. Regardless of what happens to Bitcoin, I believe $MSTR will eventually go bankrupt. Let’s go! — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) November 16, 2025 Bitcoin price is showing extreme fragility, extending losses to over 10% during the past week, and currently flirting with $93,500. Crypto analyst Ted Pillows said Bitcoin remains in a Wyckoff distribution phase, signaling continued corrective pressure in the market. According to Pillows, the $88,000-$90,000 range represents a notable support zone that could serve as a potential local bottom if selling eases. $BTC Wyckoff distribution is still happening. There's some support around the $88K-$90K zone, which could act like a local bottom. What's your prediction for BTC bottom this time? pic.twitter.com/24ylurknBr — Ted (@TedPillows) November 17, 2025 While Michael Saylor’s Strategy remains firm on its Bitcoin purchase, big asset managers like BlackRock are selling big. BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) continues to bleed with another $450 million worth of sell-off recently. As per on-chain data, BlackRock transferred 4,880 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $467.16 million, and 54,730 Ether ETH $3 085 24h volatility: 0.8% Market cap: $372.47 B Vol. 24h: $32.15 B worth about $175.93 million to Coinbase Prime. BlackRock deposited 4,880 $BTC($467.16M) and 54,730 $ETH($175.93M) to #CoinbasePrime an hour ago.https://t.co/qmuDIrP9my pic.twitter.com/PrKKjkPw50 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) November 17, 2025 Disclaimer: Coinspeaker is committed to providing unbiased and transparent reporting.

Title: Capture the Rally With These Dividend Plus Growth ETFs

Dividend stocks are not traditionally known for their share price rallies. Companies making distributions to stockholders tend to be stable and well-established, with their biggest growth days long in the past. Similarly, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that hold baskets of dividend stocks tend to provide investors with a healthy passive income stream simply for owning shares rather than capital appreciation. Occasionally, though, investors can find the best of both worlds. Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF (NYSEARCA: VEA), iShares MSCI EAFE ETF (NYSEARCA: EFA), and SPDR S&P 500 Value ETF (NYSEARCA: SPYV) are three ETFs that pay noteworthy dividends and deliver notable capital appreciation. While not the highest of any ETF making distributions, the dividends are still enough to provide a compelling perk for shareholders—especially considering these ETFs are trading at or near year-to-date (YTD) highs after experiencing sizable rallies. VEA capitalizes on the strong performance of many international equity markets in 2025, some of which have outpaced the S&P 500's already robust 15% returns YTD. The fund can be a long-term investment option for investors seeking access to non-U.S. equities. Like many other broad-based Vanguard ETFs, it boasts a highly competitive expense ratio—just 0.03% per year. Comprised of nearly 4,000 total stocks, VEA offers a highly diversified group of stocks at a low cost. The fund's geographic and stock mandates are expansive, as it holds companies across the market capitalization spectrum from Canada, Europe, and parts of the Pacific, with European stocks comprising 52% of its holdings. Japan is the single largest country by portfolio allocation, accounting for approximately 21% of the portfolio. VEA pays out a dividend yield of 2.74%, which is quite high for a fund that doesn't specifically employ a dividend strategy. On top of that, the fund has rallied by close to 29% YTD, or about twice the return rate of the broader U.S. market during that period. Utilizing a similar approach to VEA, EFA distinguishes itself with its large-cap focus. Both funds are sizable and trade very actively, although EFA's trading volume tends to be higher than VEA's, making it a prime choice for traders looking to move in and out of positions more frequently. EFA's basket of stocks is not as extensive as VEA's, but with nearly 1,000 holdings, it still offers exceptional diversification. While the portfolio focuses on European names, Japanese stocks represent the largest portion of the portfolio, at approximately 22%. The fund also invests in a smaller percentage of Australian equities, which may appeal to investors seeking a specific geographic tilt. Where EFA falls short a bit is in its annual fee, which is substantially higher at 0.32%. Still, with an annual dividend yield of 2.7% and YTD returns of nearly 29%, there are plenty of benefits to considering this fund nonetheless. The SPYV adopts a different approach from the two above. Besides its exclusive focus on U.S. equities, SPYV also narrows the search further by tracking large-cap stocks with value characteristics such as price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratios. Although its portfolio comprises nearly 400 positions, SPYV prioritizes three major companies: Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) collectively represent approximately 20% of invested assets. At 1.83%, SPYV's dividend yield is slightly lower than that of the funds above, but it is still a nice bonus for investors interested in a value play. SPYV's momentum has been accelerating after an early-2025 dip, and the fund is up about 13% YTD. With an annual fee of 0.04%, SPYV may be a good buy-and-hold option for investors looking to capture undervalued stocks across sectors, with a bit of a passive income benefit thrown in for good measure.

Title: One Fed Governor Sees Half-Point Cut in December: Our Top 7% and 8% Dividend Stock Picks

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Drew Angerer / Getty Images Just as we grew accustomed to the likelihood of a third federal rate cut in December, some inflation data and a host of other factors led some on Wall Street to call for the Federal Reserve to hold off in December and perhaps wait until the first meeting in 2026. However, last week, we witnessed the most alarming piece of data we had seen in some time: a staggering 153,074 job cuts, the highest in over two decades, driven by the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and cost-cutting measures. Major tech and retail giants, including Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), UPS (NYSE: UPS), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), and Target (NYSE: TGT), have announced significant layoffs. This in turn sparked Federal Reserve Governor Steven Miran to make a forceful case for a half-percentage-point interest rate reduction at the Federal Open Market Committee’s December meeting, arguing that recent economic indicators justify more aggressive monetary easing. Governor Miran went on to add that core PCE inflation has declined substantially toward the Fed’s 2% target while unemployment has ticked upward in recent months. He emphasized that the central bank should move preemptively to support economic momentum rather than risk waiting too long and allowing conditions to deteriorate further, while acknowledging that some of his colleagues on the committee prefer a more cautious quarter-point approach. He also said this: “A 50 basis point reduction would still leave us in restrictive territory, but it would demonstrate our commitment to achieving both sides of our dual mandate.” One thing is sure: if the Fed were to implement a 50-basis-point increase, it would likely come as a shock to the market and could ignite an end-of-year Santa Claus rally. Now is the perfect time to buy our four favorite 7% dividend stocks, all of which are Buy-rated at top Wall Street firms we follow. relif / Getty Images Since 1926, dividends have contributed approximately 32% of the total return for the S&P 500, while capital appreciation has contributed 68%. Therefore, sustainable dividend income and capital appreciation potential are essential for total return expectations. A study by Hartford Funds, in collaboration with Ned Davis Research, found that dividend stocks have delivered an annualized return of 9.18% over the past 50 years (1973-2023). Over the same timeline, this was more than double the annualized return for non-payers (3.95%). Altria Group Inc. (NYSE: MO) is one of the world’s largest producers and marketers of cigarettes and other tobacco-related products.

Title: One Fed Governor Sees Half-Point Cut in December: Our Top 7% and 8% Dividend Stock Picks

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Drew Angerer / Getty Images Just as we grew accustomed to the likelihood of a third federal rate cut in December, some inflation data and a host of other factors led some on Wall Street to call for the Federal Reserve to hold off in December and perhaps wait until the first meeting in 2026. However, last week, we witnessed the most alarming piece of data we had seen in some time: a staggering 153,074 job cuts, the highest in over two decades, driven by the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and cost-cutting measures. Major tech and retail giants, including Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), UPS (NYSE: UPS), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), and Target (NYSE: TGT), have announced significant layoffs. This in turn sparked Federal Reserve Governor Steven Miran to make a forceful case for a half-percentage-point interest rate reduction at the Federal Open Market Committee’s December meeting, arguing that recent economic indicators justify more aggressive monetary easing. Governor Miran went on to add that core PCE inflation has declined substantially toward the Fed’s 2% target while unemployment has ticked upward in recent months. He emphasized that the central bank should move preemptively to support economic momentum rather than risk waiting too long and allowing conditions to deteriorate further, while acknowledging that some of his colleagues on the committee prefer a more cautious quarter-point approach. He also said this: “A 50 basis point reduction would still leave us in restrictive territory, but it would demonstrate our commitment to achieving both sides of our dual mandate.” One thing is sure: if the Fed were to implement a 50-basis-point increase, it would likely come as a shock to the market and could ignite an end-of-year Santa Claus rally. Now is the perfect time to buy our four favorite 7% dividend stocks, all of which are Buy-rated at top Wall Street firms we follow. relif / Getty Images Since 1926, dividends have contributed approximately 32% of the total return for the S&P 500, while capital appreciation has contributed 68%. Therefore, sustainable dividend income and capital appreciation potential are essential for total return expectations. A study by Hartford Funds, in collaboration with Ned Davis Research, found that dividend stocks have delivered an annualized return of 9.18% over the past 50 years (1973-2023). Over the same timeline, this was more than double the annualized return for non-payers (3.95%). Altria Group Inc.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs’ 100% Rally Raises More Questions Than Answers | US Crypto News

Written & Edited byLockridge Okoth Welcome to the US Crypto News Morning Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead. Grab a coffee and settle in—this one might make you rethink what you thought you knew about crypto. In the past year, Bitcoin has surged dramatically, posting returns that rival traditional safe-haven assets. Yet, while some see a story of stability, others see lingering questions about risk, reward, and where cryptocurrencies really belong in a portfolio. Since January 2024, Bitcoin ETFs have surged roughly 100%, mirroring the returns of physical gold ETFs, while the S&P 500 returned just 45%. This performance has sparked a fresh debate over Bitcoin’s role in investor portfolios: is it a “risk-on” asset like stocks, or a “store of value” like gold? Since spot btc ETFs launched in Jan 2024, they’ve returned same % as physical gold ETFs…Approx 100%.S&P 500 has returned nearly 45%.So is btc a “risk on” asset like stocks or “store of value” like gold? Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, highlighted the surprising parity, with the striking similarity to gold returns prompting investors to reassess Bitcoin’s traditional narrative. While Bitcoin is widely viewed as a volatile, high-risk asset, its ETF performance over the past year has aligned with one of the most stable investment vehicles in history. Against this backdrop, investors weigh whether the risk is worth the return. “I think the question for cripto is… especially ETH. Do you want to hold a high-volatility asset for that kind of return? ETH flat or down for the past 4/5 years,” one user chimed. This remark highlights the challenge for investors, who see Bitcoin’s rally offering gold-like gains, but but the risks due to volatility remain a persistent threat for crypto as an asset class. Risk-adjusted returns remain a key factor when evaluating crypto’s place in a diversified portfolio. Risks notwithstanding, BlackRock’s recent People & Money report reveals the growing retail appetite for ETFs, especially among younger investors. According to Nate Geraci’s summary: This data highlights a generational shift in investing behavior. Younger investors are increasingly incorporating crypto into their portfolios alongside traditional assets. This shows that the market is growing faster than conventional wisdom suggests. Institutional activity adds another layer to the debate. Whale tracker reports indicate that BlackRock recently deposited 4,880 BTC, worth approximately $467 million, and 54,730 ETH valued at nearly $176 million into the Coinbase exchange. BlackRock deposits 4,880 $BTC, worth $467.19 million, and 54,730 $ETH, worth $175.93 million into Coinbase – Arkham. pic.twitter.com/Q7RSl6c6k3 The transaction marks the second move this month. Barely two weeks ago, the asset manager transferred 2,042 BTC, worth $213 million, and 22,681 ETH, valued at $80 million, to the same exchange. Moving tokens to exchanges often suggest possible plans to sell, a move that could be bearish for Bitcoin and Ethereum prices. “Last time they did this, the market dipped soon after. Now with Bitcoin sitting near $104K… is sub-$100K next?” Kyle Doops posed on X after the initial transaction. Nonetheless, large transfers from major fund managers to exchanges could also mean strategic rebalancing. With both possibilities likely to weigh on near-term price sentiment, it is worth noting that concentrated institutional holdings could amplify market swings, particularly in high-volatility environments. Should Bitcoin be treated like digital gold, offering portfolio stability? Or is it a high-risk, high-reward asset akin to equities? Looking ahead, retail and institutional flows, ETF innovation, and macroeconomic conditions will likely define crypto’s trajectory in 2026. As younger investors increasingly allocate to crypto ETFs, the market may see both rapid growth and heightened volatility, reinforcing the need for careful portfolio strategy.

Title: Stocks Go 24-7 in New Crypto Betting Markets With 100x Leverage
URL: https://www.ndtvprofit.com/crypto/stocks-go-24-7-in-new-crypto-betting-markets-with-100x-leverage
Time Published: 2025-11-17T14:08:06Z

A product born in crypto’s most fevered era is being quietly rebuilt for the US stock market — trading 24-7, with no brokers and no closing bell. The perpetual swap, or perp, is a derivative that lets traders take long or short positions on a digital asset’s price, without ever owning it. In crypto, perps have reshaped trading, becoming a multi-trillion-dollar engine of leverage and liquidity, where positions can run as high as 100-to-1 and never expire. Now developers are extending that model to traditional assets and benchmarks, including Nasdaq 100, Tesla Inc., and Coinbase Global Inc., and more. Think of it as fantasy sports for equities: traders bet on where a stock or index will go, using crypto as collateral — bypassing Wall Street’s investment ecosystem altogether. The offerings, which are gaining momentum despite past blowups and regulatory strain, are technically off-limits to US users because no domestic framework currently permits them. On the Hyperliquid blockchain — known for its fast-growing namesake exchange — a Nasdaq-linked contract known as XYZ100 has already drawn as much as more than $60 million in open interest. Wall Street is already paying attention. The likes of Jane Street are backing Vest Labs, which is building a venue for global equity perp trading. Crypto exchanges “are realizing that equities are much better tradable asset at least in the current economy,” said Justin Ma, CEO of Vest Labs. “I really want this to be a venue for 24-7 price discovery for US companies as well as something that’s fully accessible for investors all around the world.” The experiment captures two defining forces in today’s markets: unstoppable retail speculation, and crypto’s drive to rebuild finance in its own image. While big institutions cautiously pilot the likes of tokenized Treasuries, digital-asset developers are reviving the experiments that defined the industry’s early boom — from perpetual swaps to prediction markets — with bets that are fast-moving, lightly regulated, and wired for volatility. Here’s how it works: A trader posts crypto collateral — typically the USDC stablecoin — and opens a long or short position on, say, the Nasdaq 100. They’re not buying actual shares; they’re entering a smart contract that tracks the index’s price using external data feeds. If the trade goes their way, they earn the difference. If it moves against them, their position is typically auto-liquidated once their margin runs out. A dynamic fee — the funding rate — balances demand between longs and shorts, so the price of the perp stays tethered to the real-world asset. Platforms can lean on price oracles and market makers to model stock moves when markets close – a fragile but functional, for now, setup. “Perps were uniquely suited for nascent, speculative crypto markets as the structure allowed for outsized leverage with an objective, fair and self‑regulating funding mechanism in continuous 24-7 markets,” said Darius Sit, founder of crypto investment firm QCP. It echoes a broader race toward 24-7 markets. Traditional markets are inching that way. Cboe has proposed longer option sessions, and brokerages already offer extended access on alternative venues. The crypto version goes further: nonstop stock bets without Wall Street’s machinery. Whether these contracts truly track the stocks is debatable. Whether they grant rights — dividends, votes, ownership — is not. They don’t. Risky Business When markets close, the funding rate becomes the pulse: bullish weekends push it positive and prices drift up; fear flips it. It works, mostly, while markets are open. After-hours is murkier. Ostium, one of the perps platforms for equity and other assets, pauses trading when stocks stop; Others, such as the ones on Hyperliquid, don’t. They model underlying equity prices while exchanges sleep, keeping liquidity alive but risking distortion. “This structure enables perpetual-futures protocols to serve as natural venues for price discovery when primary markets are offline,” said Wyatt Raich, a former BlackRock executive, who is starting a new equity derivatives platform. Kaledora Fontana Kiernan-Linn, co-founder of Ostium, said letting markets run while stocks are closed creates risks that outweigh the benefits, citing examples like sudden tariff announcements or surprise earnings-related announcements. “You can get wicked out on the weekend of someone’s moves of a massive order,” she said. “You might suddenly have all of your position being completely eroded by funding, like unpredictable things can happen when no one else can hedge.” For many traders, though, that volatility is the point. US rules cap equity margin at roughly three-times leverage. Perps offer 10X, 50X, even 100X, with commensurate risk. “One of the biggest trends in retail financial products in the US is the rise of demand for leverage,” said Tom Schmidt, general partner at venture capital firm Dragonfly. “The DTCC effectively limits leverage on US equities through traditional margin lending to 3X, but there’s clearly demand for more than that.” There’s just one problem: they’re not legal in the US. Perps sit in a legal no‑man’s‑land. They behave like futures, mimic securities, and run on crypto infrastructure. Michael Marcantonio, head of decentralized finance at Galaxy Digital, calls it “the holy trinity of regulation.” Such contracts, he noted, would be overseen by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Derivatives Clearing Organizations. And under current US law, approved futures must have a defined expiration date. That’s why these products still block US users — though most run directly on blockchains, meaning anyone determined enough can still find a way in. Precedent is discouraging. In 2021, the SEC subpoenaed Terra’s Do Kwon over Mirror Protocol’s synthetic stocks. Still, there are signs of openness. In September this year, the SEC and CFTC proposed a joint pilot for novel market structures. And under the crypto-friendly Trump administration, hopes have risen that US access to these products may follow. Coinbase has already introduced regulated Bitcoin and Ether perps for US traders. “The SEC continues to be deliberate in their efforts to find a path to the US market for innovative products,” said Ryne Miller, a partner at Lowenstein Sandler and former general counsel at FTX US, who adds that incoming CFTC chair Michael Selig may also look for ways in.

Title: $1.1T gone! Here’s why the crypto market could see another liquidation cascade

Time Published: 2025-11-17T14:00:46Z

Stocks vs. crypto: Where investors are betting as macro pressure returns? With $1.1 trillion erased and macro volatility returning, the crypto market remains vulnerable to cascading losses. Thin bid support and high leverage risk are tilting investor preference toward stocks, while crypto struggles to find a stable footing. Is the crypto market gearing up for another October-style cascade? From a capital-flow standpoint, that setup isn’t unrealistic. Over the past 41 days, the crypto market has erased $1.1 trillion in total market cap. And still, the market cap is 10% below the levels seen during the October crash. In short, a real market recovery hasn’t kicked in yet. As a result, HODLers’ patience is getting seriously stress-tested. And with macro volatility returning, conditions are tightening fast. So is the market gearing up for another major wipeout before a real recovery begins? The market is so fragile that one bearish move could trigger a cascade. To begin with, the TOTAL Crypto Market Cap has printed back-to-back red candles, reflecting nearly a 20% outflow over the last three days alone. As a result, roughly $1.8 billion has been flushed out of the derivatives market. Notably, 73% of these liquidations came from long positions, totaling $1.3 billion. This, in turn, supports Tom Lee’s recent argument that leverage is eroding investor risk appetite, keeping any meaningful recovery on hold. Source: CryptoQuant Building on that, the data is consistent with what’s happening on-chain. Bitcoin [BTC] reserves have started to rise again, with holdings on CEXs climbing 0.63% over the past three days to 2.395 million BTC. In practical terms, that’s 15k BTC flowing back, roughly $1.4 billion at current prices. Put simply, the crypto market doesn’t have a strong enough bid to absorb more volatility. So the real question is, what happens now that the U.S. government’s reopening brings key economic data back into the mix? The week is packed with a heavy lineup of economic data. Both September and October releases (including the jobs report) are finally set to come out after the shutdown pushed them into backlog. But beyond the macro prints, there’s another major catalyst on deck. Nvidia [NVDA] is set to report earnings, with an implied move of +/- 7.5%, signaling a $345 billion swing in market cap. That’s a huge amount of capital with clear potential to influence flows into the crypto market. Source: TradingView (NVDA/USD) Notably, this divergence is translating into price action. On a quarterly basis, NVDA is still up 1.92%, while BTC is down 16.64%, marking its weakest Q4 since 2019. Zooming in, NVDA closed its last trading day on the 14th of November up 1.77% vs. BTC’s 5.2% dip. Overall, with volatility high, bid support thin, and leverage risk elevated, investors are favoring stocks over crypto. Against this backdrop, as macro pressure builds, another crypto market cascade looks increasingly likely.

Title: Peter Thiel slashes Tesla (TSLA) stake as Elon Musk warns shorts
URL: http://electrek.co/2025/11/17/peter-thiel-slashes-tesla-tsla-stake-as-elon-musk-warns-shorts/
Time Published: 2025-11-17T13:34:09Z
Full Content:
Billionaire investor Peter Thiel’s fund, Thiel Macro LLC, has significantly cut its position in Tesla (TSLA), according to a new Q3 2025 13F filing. Thiel, who is close to Musk, is retreating from his Tesla investment at a time when the CEO told shareholders to “hold on” to their stocks and warned TSLA shorts. The filing, which covers the period ending September 30, shows the fund sold 207,613 TSLA shares during the quarter. This reduces its stake by over 76%, from 272,613 shares at the end of Q2 to just 65,000 shares remaining. Thiel famously co-founded PayPal with Elon Musk and is still close to Tesla’s CEO. They have both recently referenced having conversations, and they collaborated in their support of President Trump in last year’s US elections, as well as during the transition. Interestingly, Thiel appears to be ignoring his friend’s advice in divesting from Tesla. As Tesla shareholders voted to give Musk the biggest CEO compensation package ever, Musk told them to “hold on to their stocks.” Just this past weekend, Musk issued a specific warning to those betting against Tesla’s stock, and specifically Bill Gates, via a post on X (formerly Twitter), regarding Gates’ long-held short position against Tesla. Responding to news that the Gates Foundation was selling Microsoft stock, Musk posted: “If Gates hasn’t fully closed out the crazy short position he has held against Tesla for ~8 years, he had better do so soon.” The sale of Tesla stocks wasn’t the most significant move in Thiel’s latest filing. The fund’s most significant move was exiting its entire stake in Nvidia (NVDA), selling over 537,000 shares, a position that had been its largest. Thiel Macro also completely sold off its holdings in Vistra Energy. This appears to be a major consolidation and a pivot away from high-growth momentum stocks. In their place, the fund added new, more traditional “Big Tech” positions, namely in Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT). The aggressive sales shrank the fund’s total reported US equity value from $212 million down to just $74.4 million. To be fair, Thiel’s overall rebalancing appears to stem more from broader market fear than from anything specific about Tesla.

Title: Peter Thiel slashes Tesla (TSLA) stake as Elon Musk warns shorts
URL: http://electrek.co/2025/11/17/peter-thiel-slashes-tesla-tsla-stake-as-elon-musk-warns-shorts/
Time Published: 2025-11-17T13:34:09Z
Full Content:
Billionaire investor Peter Thiel’s fund, Thiel Macro LLC, has significantly cut its position in Tesla (TSLA), according to a new Q3 2025 13F filing. Thiel, who is close to Musk, is retreating from his Tesla investment at a time when the CEO told shareholders to “hold on” to their stocks and warned TSLA shorts. The filing, which covers the period ending September 30, shows the fund sold 207,613 TSLA shares during the quarter. This reduces its stake by over 76%, from 272,613 shares at the end of Q2 to just 65,000 shares remaining. Thiel famously co-founded PayPal with Elon Musk and is still close to Tesla’s CEO. They have both recently referenced having conversations, and they collaborated in their support of President Trump in last year’s US elections, as well as during the transition. Interestingly, Thiel appears to be ignoring his friend’s advice in divesting from Tesla. As Tesla shareholders voted to give Musk the biggest CEO compensation package ever, Musk told them to “hold on to their stocks.” Just this past weekend, Musk issued a specific warning to those betting against Tesla’s stock, and specifically Bill Gates, via a post on X (formerly Twitter), regarding Gates’ long-held short position against Tesla. Responding to news that the Gates Foundation was selling Microsoft stock, Musk posted: “If Gates hasn’t fully closed out the crazy short position he has held against Tesla for ~8 years, he had better do so soon.” The sale of Tesla stocks wasn’t the most significant move in Thiel’s latest filing. The fund’s most significant move was exiting its entire stake in Nvidia (NVDA), selling over 537,000 shares, a position that had been its largest. Thiel Macro also completely sold off its holdings in Vistra Energy. This appears to be a major consolidation and a pivot away from high-growth momentum stocks. In their place, the fund added new, more traditional “Big Tech” positions, namely in Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT). The aggressive sales shrank the fund’s total reported US equity value from $212 million down to just $74.4 million. To be fair, Thiel’s overall rebalancing appears to stem more from broader market fear than from anything specific about Tesla. However, it does highlight that Tesla’s volatile stock is risky amid a potential market pullback. Yup, super Tesla fan Cathy Woods is directing her firm to sell Tesla too. Tesla shares are at least 10x any reasonable valuation. Only gullible retail investors and index funds are propping it up. When it crashes, it will be fast. It currently trades at a 275 price-to-earnings ratio, which is expected to keep rising this quarter, even if the stock continues to drop from its recent high, as earnings are expected to decline further in Q4.

Title: 5 Things to Know Before the Stock Market Opens

Stock futures are little changed to start the week after several days of volatile trading last week; bitcoin is rebounding after hitting a fresh six-month low over the weekend; flights are set to return to their full schedules across the country in the coming days; Nvidia is due to report earnings along with several major retailers this week; and Alphabet shares are rising following news Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has taken a stake in the company. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are hovering near unchanged Monday morning after closing last week on a mixed note. Futures tied to the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which has lost ground for two consecutive weeks amid concerns about the possibility of an AI bubble, were up 0.1% recently, while futures tied to the benchmark S&P 500 rose fractionally. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were down 0.1% following two straight days of declines, after the blue-chip index hit record highs last week. Gold futures were down 0.3% at $4,080 an ounce, losing ground for the third straight day, while crude oil futures also fell slightly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on all sorts of consumer loans, was at 4.12%, down from 4.15% at Friday's close. Bitcoin rose above $95,000 Monday, after slipping below $93,000 on Sunday to its lowest level since early May. The cryptocurrency fell sharply last week as investor appetite for risky assets waned, though Strategy (MSTR), the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, reaffirmed its commitment to the asset. Strategy shares were up slightly in premarket trading, Shares of crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) and bitcoin miner Mara Holdings (MARA) were also higher this morning. The Federal Aviation Administration said Sunday night that it was lifting its order that temporarily limited flights due to the shortage of air traffic controllers caused by the government shutdown. The agency said Sunday that as of 6 a.m. Monday, the order would be lifted and all airports could return to operating at their full schedule. Flight traffic at the 40 busiest U.S. airports was ordered to be reduced by 10% earlier this month in response to the shutdown, cutting the number of air travel-related federal employees available as some opted not to work while not being paid. Airlines have said that it will likely take days for flight crews to be in the right locations to resume their full schedule, per The Wall Street Journal. Shares of American Airlines (AAL), United Airlines (UAL), Southwest (LUV) and Delta Air Lines (DAL) all ticked higher ahead of the opening bell. In a crowded week of earnings reports, artificial intelligence heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) will be the center of investors' focus when it reports after the bell on Wednesday. The chipmaker is expected to once again post strong gains in revenue and profits, and some analysts have lifted their price targets and provide other bullish commentary ahead of the report. Investors will also get a look into the health of the American consumer this week, with earnings reports scheduled from a number of retailers including Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW), Target (TGT), TJX Companies (TJX), Ross Stores (ROST), BJ's Wholesale (BJ), Gap (GAP) and Walmart (WMT), which announced a CEO succession plan last week. Alphabet (GOOGL) shares are surging in premarket trading after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) disclosed in a regulatory filing that it bought more than 17 million shares of the Google parent in the third quarter, a stake valued at $4.3 billion at quarter's end. Buffett has traditionally been cautious about tech stocks, leaving some to speculate whether the "Oracle of Omaha" is responsible for the bet, as Buffett is set to retire as CEO at the end of the year. Also over the weekend, Alphabet's YouTube TV ended a prolonged carriage dispute with Disney (DIS) that had taken the entertainment giant's networks like ESPN and ABC off the streaming service for weeks. Alphabet shares were up 4% in recent trading.

URL: https://fortune.com/2025/11/17/aave-app-stani-kulechov-defi-lending-borrowing-protocol/
Time Published: 2025-11-17T13:00:00Z
Full Content:
The recent crypto boom has been marked by blockchain companies working to expand their appeal to mainstream consumers. That now includes Aave Labs, the developer behind a popular decentralized lending service, which on Monday announced plans to launch an app in Apple’s App Store and opened up a waitlist for interested users. Aave is well-known in crypto as a leading project in DeFi, or decentralized finance. By opening up the waitlist for the app, it seeks to offer a version of its services without the litany of lingo, such as “stablecoins” and “protocol,” that is common in crypto but that may be unfamiliar or offputting to outsiders. Aave’s new product acts like a savings account—but with a higher yield. Users can earn a minimum 5% in interest on their holdings and can deposit money in with a bank account or debit card. The product uses stablecoins, or cryptocurrencies pegged to underlying assets like the U.S. dollar, as well as the Aave protocol. Aave has been one of the longest-standing networks of its kind, boasting over $30 billion in deposits, according to data from the crypto analytics site DefiLlama. Customers typically can get more interest on their assets on DeFi protocols than through conventional banks, but they often come with a greater risk of hacks—and no government backing. Still, Stani Kulechov, founder and CEO of Aave Labs, stressed that the Aave protocol—and therefore the forthcoming Aave app—is safe, especially since Aave has never experienced an exploit in its five-year history. “There is a security on the actual market economics. And then there’s also security on the actual code basis,” he said, pointing to how multiple companies have audited the software. The planned launch of the Aave app comes as the chasm between traditional finance companies and crypto-native startups is growing smaller. The marquee asset manager BlackRock has leaned into Bitcoin, the fintech Stripe has embraced stablecoins, and the banking giant JPMorgan Chase has steadily deployed new blockchain products. Meanwhile, crypto companies have sought to attract more mainstream users. The U.S. crypto exchange Kraken has launched its own payments app and a slew of others are aiming to create their own bank-like products built with stablecoins, or cryptocurrencies pegged to underlying assets like the U.S. dollar. “Typically, DeFi has been accessible to very savvy, professional users,” Kulechov, CEO of Aave Labs, told Fortune. “The next step for DeFi is to bring more direct access for consumers.” Kulechov is one of DeFi’s torchbearers. In 2020, he launched the Aave protocol. Since then, he’s expanded out his DeFi offerings to include a crypto wallet, a decentralized stablecoin, and a decentralized protocol for social media. In October, Aave Labs acquired the stablecoin company Stable Finance for an undisclosed sum. “They had more of a consumer DeFi experience that helped our team to move faster and and improve our offering down the line,” said Kulechov.

Quick Facts: Let’s be honest, the final quarter of 2025 has felt pretty brutal. At some point, we’ve seen Bitcoin ($BTC) prices crash by over 24% in just a few weeks (from around $125K to around $95K), throwing the whole market into a deep state of ‘Extreme Fear.’ While some people are pointing out this is the ‘worst Q4 since 2019,’ it still doesn’t mean you should be losing sleep. Let’s break down exactly why not so you can sleep a little easier. This massive drop isn’t a structural collapse; it’s a giant, necessary flush-out. Some analysts are calling it a ‘massive liquidation’ or a ‘mid-cycle reset.’ Basically, the market got over-leveraged with speculators using borrowed money, and this crash was the system hitting the reset button to clean out all that shaky speculation. Look beneath the hood, and the long-term outlook is stronger than ever. First, institutional money isn’t leaving. Commitment from the big guns is unshakable. US spot Bitcoin ETFs have attracted around $58.85B in cumulative net inflows. We’ve seen BlackRock and Fidelity logging huge buy-ins while the price was falling. This is smart money quietly accumulating from scared retail sellers. Secondly, insane price targets still stand as major financial players aren’t backing off their bullish calls. Institutions like Bitwise and VanEck are still holding firm to aggressive crypto projections, expecting Bitcoin to climb into the $180,000 to $200,000 range next year. So, while the charts look scary right now, the consensus among investors is that this ‘Extreme Fear’ is actually laying the most solid foundation yet for a record-breaking 2026. If this pans out, then it begs the question, which are the best crypto to buy before the next bull run? Our top picks, PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), and Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) all offer something different that could pique interest and see potential big returns.

The presale also offers an impressive 597% APY for those who plan on HODLing. Buy $PEPENODE today for $0.00115. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the ultimate scaling solution, combining the ironclad security of the Bitcoin mainnet with the blazing performance of the Solana ecosystem. As a new Layer-2 network, $HYPER aims to solve Bitcoin’s limitations (namely the slow transaction speeds and high fees) to finally unlock its potential for decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi. The technical innovation lies in its use of a customized Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). It enables parallel processing and sub-second finality, providing thousands of transactions per second (TPS) and low gas fees. You can lock your $BTC on the main chain via a Canonical Bridge, minting a 1:1 wrapped equivalent on the Bitcoin Hyper Layer-2, allowing you to participate in high-volume trading and use onboarded dApps, which could include anything from yield farming protocols to NFT markets. Security is maintained through ZK-Rollup technology, bundling and verifying transactions before settling the cryptographic proofs back onto the Bitcoin main chain. If you want more details, check out our ‘What is Bitcoin Hyper’ guide. This blend of Bitcoin’s trustworthiness and Solana’s efficiency promises to transform $BTC from a mere store of value into a fully programmable asset. With a project raise of nearly $28M and staking rewards of 41%, the presale has attracted a lot of attention from those seeking early-stage opportunities. Get $HYPER today for just $0.013285. Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) is pioneering the bridge between Web3 collectibles and global consumer culture. It achieved critical mass with its expansion into physical toys, stocking the shelves of major retailers like Walgreens. This move brings the brand’s positive ethos and unique characters to millions outside the crypto ecosystem, creating a genuine flywheel effect. The $PENGU token acts as the lifeblood of this expanding universe, providing utility across several dimensions. Holders gain governance rights, allowing them to vote on the brand’s direction and partnerships. Furthermore, the token is integral to in-app purchases, game rewards (especially within the brand’s game, ‘Pudgy Party’), and NFT-linked perks. With ongoing development focused on multi-chain expansion (supporting Solana and Ethereum) and a long-term goal that includes a potential IPO, $PENGU is positioned as a sophisticated token economy backed by a proven cultural IP. Find $PENGU on Binance. Remember, this is not intended as financial advice, and you should always do your own research before making any investments.

Title: Yet More AI Bubble Worries, Now on Debt Side, with Wall Street Journal Featuring AI Datacenter Borrowing “Frenzy”

Full Content:
Yours truly is overdue on an overview how private-debt-backed AI datacenter deals work and why companies like Meta who are perfectly capable of borrowing in their own name paying 200-300 basis points extra not to do so is not a good sign. But the Wall Street Journal just published a very detailed story on the general outlines of this debt binge, which has gotten more attention in the popular press as borrowing levels have skyrocketed this year: Big Tech borrowing for AI data centers: 2015-2024 average: $32B/year Sept-Oct 2025 alone: $75B > Meta borrowed $30B > Oracle borrowed$18B > $META also did $27B off-balance sheet with Blue Owl AI companies now 14% of IG index The “money-printing” tech companies are…… pic.twitter.com/IuhBU0LS4M — junkbondinvestor (@junkbondinvest) November 5, 2025 And from the new Wall Street Journal story: What the Journal calls a “frenzy” in Wall Street Blows Past Bubble Worries to Supercharge AI Spending Frenzy is awfully reminiscent of the toxic phase of the subprime lending binge, when originators were so desperate for product, as the jibe then went, they’d fund borrower who could fog a mirror. It was years later that we were able, with the key elements including some insiders plus a remarkable pre-crisis analysis by (of all things) an equity market analyst, Henry Maxey of Ruffler Investment, to piece together how leverage-on-leverage created an even-then, well-reported “wall of liquidity”. It was also the leverage on leverage (and that systemically important yet fragile financial institutions were heavily exposed) that made the bubble unwind so catastrophic. We have warned that the unwind of an, erm, traditional credit bubble, even if very large (see Japan and for a lesser but still nasty version, the S&L crisis) typically produces at worst very deep and protracted recessions and zombification (the runup to the 1929 US crash also featured CDO-like leverage on leverage, see Frank Partnoy’s The Match King for details), as opposed to banking system near-or-actual failures. So again, we have yet to see evidence of that meteor-hitting-the-financial-system event being in the offing. But absence of evidence does not amount to evidence of absence. And perhaps finance historians can correct me, but I do not recall a historical instance of a massive equity bubble (without 1929-style heavy borrowings directly against those equities) accompanied by so many red flags, particularly operating and financial leverage, in the underlying commercial activity. That included recursive deals among key companies and as we’ll discuss a bit in this and more in posts to come, overly-clever borrowing structures that make sense only to achieve higher levels of leverage than could be achieved by traditional means. The Journal points out in passing that one of the mega-deals will pay more than 2% that a plainer-vanilla offering would. In a fine overview of in June on how these financings work, Paul Kedrosky similarly said the premium was 200 to 300 basis points. That’s an awful lot to pay for opacity and supposed balance sheet remoteness.1 As a brief introduction to causes for concern about the datacenter boom, see the executive summary from Bubble or Nothing from the Center for Public Enterprise (hat tip Matt Stoller): ● Cash flow uncertainty persists as the cost of providing AI inference services continues to rise. Leading AI inference service providers are not particularly differentiated from one another; this competitive market structure suppresses market participants’ pricing power and prevents them from recovering rising costs. ● The collateral value of a graphical processing unit (GPU), the sector’s keystone asset, looks poised to fall in the near-term. The value of chips fluctuates depending on uncertain user demand as well as the supply dynamics and technical specifications of new GPUs, now released yearly. The cash flow that GPU collateral can demand is suppressed due to the sector’s competitive market structure and the uncertain depreciation schedule of existing GPUs. ● Data center tenants will undertake multiple cycles of intense and increasingly expensive capital expenditure within a single lease term, posing considerable tenant churn risks to data center developers. This asset-liability mismatch between data center developers and their tenants will strain developers’ creditworthiness without guarantees from market-leading tech companies. ● Circular financing, or “roundabouting,” among so-called hyperscaler tenants—the leading tech companies and AI service providers—create an interlocking liability structure across the sector. These tenants comprise an incredibly large share of the market and are financing each others’ expansion, creating concentration risks for lenders and shareholders. ● Debt is playing an increasingly large role in the financing of data centers. While debt is a quotidian aspect of project finance, and while it seems like hyperscaler tech companies can self-finance their growth through equity and cash, the lack of transparency in some recent debt-financed transactions and the interlocked liability structure of the sector are cause for concern. The first two points alone, the fact that inference costs are not only not falling but still rising, and near-term downside in GPU prices ought to be fatal, or at least detrimental to debt funding. Yet as you’ll see, even though the Journal raises concerns, and even adds to this list by describing how AI “hyperscalers” are putting out duplicate orders for the datacenter capacity, virtually assuring whipsaw, it’s not as sobering as the list above. But it includes signs that some dogs are turning their noses up at the dogfood: Stock prices normally go up when a company reports record revenue but after Meta did just that on Oct. 29, its shares plummeted 11% instead. The reason: Zuckerberg disclosed he will “aggressively” increase capital spending on AI, drawing questions from analysts about how the company plans to actually make money off the new technology. What the Journal describes parallels the late-stage subprime lending frenzy. In 2007, CEO Chuck Prince of later-big-bailout recipient Citigroup famously remarked: When the music stops, in terms of liquidity, things will be complicated. “But as long as the music is playing, you’ve got to get up and dance. We’re still dancing….The depth of the pools of liquidity is so much larger than it used to be that a disruptive event now needs to be much more disruptive than it used to be. Consider from the Journal the, erm, enthusiasm of lenders and fears of becoming wall flowers in this party: Silicon Valley’s biggest players are flush with cash and were able to fund much of the initial AI build-out from their own coffers. As the dollar figures climb ever higher, they are turning to debt and private equity—spreading the risks and potential rewards more broadly across the economy. Some of the financing is coming from plain-vanilla corporate bond sales, but financiers are making far bigger fees off giant private deals. Virtually every Wall Street player is angling to get a piece of the action, from banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley to traditional asset managers such as BlackRock. Investor appetite for data-center debt is so strong that some money managers have booked billion-dollar gains in a matter of days, even before construction of the facilities they are financing is complete. Still, the longer-term performance is hardly assured. Big tech companies are expected to spend nearly $3 trillion on AI through 2028 but only generate enough cash to cover half that tab, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley. Big names in the financial world, such as Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, are warning about AI-fueled froth in the markets and in capital spending. At the same time, the fear of missing out is real. Days after Solomon voiced his concerns to analysts, Goldman formed a new team in its banking and markets group focused on AI infrastructure financing. Later from the Journal: Funds that invest in AI deals say they carry little risk, because tech companies with deep pockets have ironclad leases that will generate the money to pay investors back. Microsoft has a higher credit rating than the U.S. government, and it told investors on Oct. 29 that it would double its total data-center footprint in the next two years. Perhaps I am too old, but I recall that IBM and GE were once AAA rated too, and that by 2000 (for IBM) and 2010 (for GE) their luster had taken quite a turn. And remember the pre-crisis pattern that housing prices had never fallen nationwide, only regionally? These supposedly blue-chip tech companies are placing monster bets on AI, so their historical solidity isn’t as germane as it might seem, unless they back off if the fundamental performance of large language models continues to fall well short of promises. The reaction of the Meta stockholders to Zuckerberg’s promise of even more big AI spending is confirmation. Back to the Journal: Tech executives see more risk in underbuilding than overbuilding… But some tech companies are weaker financially than others. Oracle…needs to borrow billions more for its spending spree, prompting Moody’s Ratings and S&P Global Ratings to edge closer to reclassifying Oracle’s bonds as junk debt. In recent weeks, the company’s stock price has fallen 32% and its bonds have lost about 7%. There’s also the risk that the chips tech firms are borrowing to buy could be obsolete in a few year… The last time Wall Street went all-in on an industry was the fracking boom—then bust—over a decade ago. This time, financiers are marshaling even larger sums. The article continues with a breathless account of the boomtown effect that these datacenter buildouts are generating. Matt Stoller flagged the concern of growing real-economy dependence on massive spend in what ought to be a niche: A few months ago, I asked why our economy, despite steady growth in official numbers, feels so creepy and unstable. My conclusion was that the U.S. is in a “Chinese finger trap” economy. We are dependent for growth on monopolies and an AI bubble, which juices the all-important stock market. Trying to grow an economy in a more stable way could lower stock prices which would paradoxically lead to a downturn. So we’re stuck, until some outside event occurs…. Data center developers are now approaching multiple utilities with proposals for the same project, leading to “phantom” forecasts of demand that isn’t actually there. Essentially, it’s hoarding. Hoarding is what happen in overheated markets….But this can lead to something called the “bullwhip effect.” Buyers overstate how much they want to buy….all of a sudden the demand evaporates because it was never real in the first place. This dynamic can throw an economy into an overheated state, and then a depression; that’s what happened globally after World War I, leading to, among other things, Mussolini’s takeover of Italy…. At this point, data centers are pretty much what’s growing in America. I recently had a conversation with an elected official who told me that data center construction is a huge construction jobs boost in rust belt areas….He posited a tension between political support for the new temporary jobs and political anger over higher electricity prices. We have a one-legged economy, with the AI build-out serving as a driver of real estate values, the stock market, and GDP growth This is a bet-the-economy scheme on models where China has much better mousetraps. There is no way this will end well. ____ 1 The crisis demonstrated that theory and practice can be two different things. Banks had long offloaded credit card receivables to investors in supposedly off-balance sheet deals. When losses on them rose to previously unthinkable levels, the investors successfully revolted and made the banks eat some of those costs. The reason was the bank credit card businesses depended on being able to keep using other people’s credit. I am not sure whether or not these AI datacenter borrowers won’t wind up in an analogous position, of being so dependent on ongoing lending that lenders won’t let them walk away from outsized credit losses. “companies like Meta who are perfectly capable of borrowing in their own name paying 200-300% basis points extra” Yves, I noticed something that should be fixed: “% basis points”. Incompatible units, right? Aargh, fixing, thanks. “…have ironclad leases that will generate the money to pay investors back.” Bwaahhh!!! That is until those leases hit the smelters of the bankruptcy courts! Ed Dowd on the US economic, the AI bubble, the stock market, and the housing market. utube, ~1 hr. Ed Dowd: We’re Already in a Recession, Oil Going to $30 & The Deflation Scare Coming https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHM-BH-SguE Excellent discussion and economic assessments by Dowd. These are Capitalists to the core. Meta and much of big tech still have corporate stock buyback plans open. Incentives drive outcomes—-companies have move incentive to lever-up and chase the AI headlines than being seen as a 1989-era IBM (a company missing a secular pivot). “…China has much better mousetraps.” Listened recently to an interview with Andrew Ross Sorkin on this topic taking much the same line as the above article, during which he claimed as an example of China’s technical and manufacturing prowess that BYD electric vehicles are the gold standard that are better and cheaper than U.S. cars and that if the U.S. didn’t have tariffs on Chinese cars we would probably not have and an auto industry in the U.S. I’m giving serious consideration to encouraging my USian grandchildren to learn Mandarin, https://www.newyorker.com/video/watch/the-radio-hour-andrew-ross-sorkin-in-conversation-with-andrew-ross-sorkin (Minute 12:33) When you’ve lost Andrew Ross Sorkin… I saw a video on the YouTube’s last night so it must be true… BYD just test drove, (introduced?) an EV that will reach speeds over 200 miles an hour. I think they were at 300+ mph Believe it o not, an electric motor can generate enormous rotational torque. Combustion engines are no match. Getting to 200-300 mph is more a matter of stability and aerodynamics. Too many EV’s on a US freeway will create the same congestion as an ICE vehicle. I’ve driven and owned a number of ICE muscle cars, mostly during my misspent youth, that I found impressively fast off the line. Now I drive a little Toyota hybrid, which frankly feels a bit like riding around in a sardine can, that upon acceleration can give you whiplash. I exaggerate but slightly. Believe it or not, torque can not be anything but rotational. :) “Linear torque” is force. Also, torque can be multiplied via gears, while power can’t. Steam engines and electric motors tend to produce maximum torque close to zero rpm, which is the “believe it or not” part for ICE only drivers (with diesel engines being better at low rpm torque than petrol ones). Limited range of rotational speeds with useful torque is why trasmission is a necessity (and also why big trucks have more gears). Getting to 200-300 mph is a matter of many things, but mostly not crashing. :) Son in law just received his Tesla cyber truck. He loves it, so far. We talked about the almost instant high torque etc. Tech features are great! Run everything from the smart phone. My nephew has had the EV Rivian pick-up for a couple of years he still loves it. I saw it Saturday! I hope my daughter stops calling their cyber truck the “dumpster”. At 75 I’ll stay with the ICE-SUV. My one-owner 1977 Chevrolet Cabriolet, with second 305 V8, 270.000 miles, low rev – high torque, runs like new. A random professional-American’s Mandarin will never be good as their random Chinese equivalent’s English. Particularly as English is the de-facto international working language in Asia, which is much more linguistically diverse than Europe’s Proto-Indo-European-descendant languages. Don’t push Mandarin just because of China in a vacuum (though obviously the thought counts). China isn’t just Mandarin, it’s a civilizational tradition that evolved independently of the west’s Greco-Roman-Enlightenment lineage—-an obvious statement, but something that’s lost on lots of credentialed, supposedly educated, people. And today’s “Communist China” is just one page in its lengthy history. “And today’s “Communist China” is just one page in its lengthy history.” Truly. The pages that have for the most part drawn my interest over the years are those having to do with the development of Buddhism in that country. One thing in particular that strikes me is that the Chinese took the more asocial natural mysticism of India and Southeast Asia and made it more fit for purpose in a materially practical, more socially engaged way of living. Yes, I communicate with Chinese entrepreneurs and their English is as good or better than lifelong Americans. I’m told their linguistic skill is not unusual. I just started listening to an audiobook “Empire of AI”. One line of thinking in the book is that “size/scale/compute power” is not the only infrastructure model one can choose from to chase the elusive AGI unicorn (another topic the book explores). This is the predominant line of thinking running thru SV though. Open AI seized the narrative and strategically decided to achieve AGI thru sheer scale and size of its compute resources. 3 hours into the book so far but its very interesting. Thanks for the book tip. I’m currently reading Adam Becker’s More Everything Forever describing beliefs and intentions prevalent among Silicon Valley elites. “Inmates running the asylum” is a phrase that comes to mind. And not in a good way as in King of Hearts. $133B in questionable debt? Just file it under “other.” Here we have JP Morgan blazing the opacity trail. Thanks for this background, Yves. To me, this finance perspective confirms some things I think about AI and data centers. An example from a portion of the Journal article you quote: But some tech companies are weaker financially than others. Oracle…needs to borrow billions more for its spending spree, prompting Moody’s Ratings and S&P Global Ratings to edge closer to reclassifying Oracle’s bonds as junk debt. In recent weeks, the company’s stock price has fallen 32% and its bonds have lost about 7%. Why risk so much? Hasn’t stock price been sacred in the post-Greenspan era? Doesn’t this seem to be about more than even money? I think I’ve found part of the answer in two interviews Ross Douthat, the Roman Catholic New York Times columnist, has done in the past year. The first, Douthat’s interview of Peter Thiel is second perhaps only to Tucker’s sit-down with Nick Fuentes among widely viewed videos. The second one, done in the past few days, is of Paul Kingsnorth, who’s on a book tour promoting his new book, Against the Machine: The Unmaking of Humanity. I was introduced to Kingsnorth through amfortas’s links to the Dark Mountain Project, which was begun by Kingsnorth and Dougald Hine. I recommend listening to the Thiel interview before the Kingsnorth one because Douthat and Kingsnorth discuss that interview at some length. It’s also interesting contrast the two interviewees’ personalities and characters. (Kingsnorth calls the projects of Thiel and Musk “little boys’ toys,” an example of his barely contained contempt for them.) I have watched about 15min of the first interview and paused at about 15 min of the second and, whatever one thinks about Kingsnorth he can be labelled as freethinker while Thiel not. The later is heavily influenced by his attachments (to his companies, money, whatever he is attached to) no matter how much he would like to appear as a freethinker. I couldn’t stomach Thiel for longer while I will probably end Kingsnorth interview even if i do not agree completely with him in some instances but he is much more interesting than Thiel. One shakes the brain and the other shakes the stomach. Let me recommend the latest interview of Emmanuel Todd by Glenn Diesen which I found interesting. This are people who shake one beliefs and that is good. Agree with Ignacio about Diesen’s interview of Todd. For once, Diesen pretty much shut up & let Todd talk. Todds latest book is about the loss of the West. He gets heavily into the loss of the philosophical “center” of the West- sort of there being no there there. He says that Western society has become a “Zombie” society like the Nazis. Well worth the listen! Like this: from 2024, In view of this, ladies and gentlemen, what we can conclude is that the adoration of transvestites is an inevitable consequence of liberalism, and that the Inquisition burned too few people. I will not venture into the twisted nest of vipers that is Thiel’s brain, but Kingsnorth will be worth a listen, thanks. I’m meeting with my Minnesota AI vs. water people tomorrow. It’ll be interesting to hear their perspective. Data centers might try to propose one project to competing power companies but there’s only one water source (and regulator). If the volume of permit amendment applications from water utilitues/cities has fallen (data centers in MN do not supply their own water), the number of data center projects in MN will have fallen proportionally. I’m trying to think about what’s similar and different with dotcom. 1) Similar to AI, dotcom had a huge infra build-out of core network fiber, switching, and data centers. Not all of that was scrap as some of it has relatively long useful life, especially fiber and switching, unlike AI GPUs. 2) The demand for dotcom infra was real, growing, and continues to grow. The dotcom bubble was supply. The Inernet as such was not vaporware. In AI it’s not clear how much money there really is in psychopathic search engines and generation of videos of dogs with 5 legs. A lot of the ultimate “demand” may be hype. 3) As Yves so well presents above, the financials of the AI bubble may involve a lot more leverage than dotcom. So what are we facing? Something worse than dotcom but not worse than GFC? The public Internet in the 90’s was not vaporware. It was the long developing son of the military/university ARPANET (network) from the 70’s. The early Internet was communication over phone lines. As public access grew cable/fiber optics were seen as necessary to get increased public/business participation. Unfortunately, laying cable was faster than public uptake. Until. of course, Netscape, and other graphical user interface that didn’t require knowledge of computer programming. Then, with exploding popularity (ease of use), the Internet demanded cable and fiber connectivity. Something tells me AGI is not going to follow this breakout scenario. Yea GUI, and they said no one would pay those hundreds of dollars for that heavy CRT. On #2. you are GREATLY confusing dotcom infrastructure with companies selling “eyeballs’. Most of the bubble was in the latter. There’s also the risk that the chips tech firms are borrowing to buy could be obsolete in a few year… Leaving aside for the moment the overall ridiculous nature of the AI technology boom and the fact that it is going to come crashing down of its own accord quite soon since LLVMs are not fit for their advertised purpose, any above quote seems like it highlights another risk-within-a-risk. GPUs are a very high technology product that most people don’t know much about beyond a few acronyms. Using them as debt collateral seems very fraught in its own right since no one knows enough about them to decide what they are worth and in particular how quickly they’re going to depreciate. Nvidia recently announced that they are going to a one-year design cycle, meaning all the chips that were purchased in 2025 will be superseded by newer, more powerful chips in 2026, and so on each year. I imagine this will create a big hit to the older models, and I imagine after this happens a few times the older chips will be essentially worthless. I don’t know what the term of the debt is that is being backed by these chips, but if it’s more than a couple of years this is obviously a shipwreck waiting to happen. There are other changes in the technological landscape that can also render existing GPU hardware worthless in one way or another, including changes in software architecture and new manufacturers coming on the scene with cheaper and more powerful products. These kinds of things are both hard to predict and reasonably likely to happen. Some physical objects, like real estate, vehicles, precious gems, and so on seem to make fairly reasonable collateral (even so, look at the record!), but new and evolving integrated circuits of very high density and complexity don’t fit into that category. 1. I am yet to hear of significant proposals stateside to expand electric generation capacity – plus transmission lines – to support all this projected data center growth. And remember, the US is a fragmented electricity space (10 separate market regions in just the lower 48), with differing regulatory rules (Texas does not equal New York does not equal California), so these need to be done at the local level. The Russians have publically talked about using the new modular type nuclear reactors (including the ones they’d developed for the Burevestnik and the Poseidon weapons), though for now data centers do not seem at the top of their energy or nuke priorities (they’re replacing their aging nukes plus upgrading the infrastructure in historically underserved regions like Yakutia). The Chinese are drastically increasing their nuke capacity, paying the Russians a healthy chunk so to do. The Americans……….eh? Or maybe I’ve just missed it. But all these plans for data center buildouts without the generation and transmission to go with are bound to run into quite the obstacle once they start drawing enough power to drop a given market region below its “reserve margin” level (typically 12% over peak demand is how much you want in generation), or, if god forbid these idiots build them in Texas, which is the only fully deregulated market, cause “ice storm” level price spikes for customers. 2. I am not sure what you would use as collateral if you’re doing any secured or ABS type financing for these data centers. The buildings themselves? Because here’s the thing. If the servers are meant to do AI-LLM type stuff, that means every year, when the new chips/GPUs come out, you have to upgrade them all, at huge cost. But meanwhile, standard data center tasks do not need this extra capacity and do not need this extra bang for the buck. So 1-2-3 years into the deal you’re stuck with a bunch of formerly high-end chips that no-one needs, unless you pile even more money into the place? Or think about it this way. Whenever I build my own PC, instead of buying the latest, most high-end CPU and video card, I buy the ones from ~2 years ago. Because at that point the price comes down 50% or more, while the decline in capability – for home user applications – is fairly negligible. The point is, the depreciation on these assets is insane relative to, say, a commercial building, or a power plant, or a refinery or whatever. Or even a commercial aircraft (assumed 25-year useful life, usually). To do an ABS deal secured by chips, if that is, in fact, what they are doing…that is pure insanity. 3. Does anyone remember IBM’s Watson? Their whole thing in the 2000s and early-mid 2010s was – we have this “artificial intelligence” thing called Watson, and we’ll sell it to hospitals and such, where it will make diagnoses and help (read: replace) the medical staff in this and that capacity. And…the whole thing failed, because they could not fix what we now call AI hallucinations. Or, rather, IBM tinkered around with it for a while, with some sample projects in this or that hospital that never went anywhere much, and eventually sold it to some PE guys for ~$1 billion, which is rather less than they’d invested into it in the first place. Of course, the total cost for Watson, at least its medical unit, including all the R&D and whatnot, had to have been in the several billion range at the most, which is something IBM can easily afford. I look at the charts for projected LLM capex spend, and there is just no way to get there from here, unless there is a technological revolution in LLMs no-one knows about. Re #2, the security is the data center lease agreements. I seldom comment on tech since I stopped working in that field 25 years ago, and I deliberately do not use hardware or software services provided by AI, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, etc. Nevertheless, I am typing this on an ancient computer running Linux, which I deliberately configured to run minimal unbloated software, and I realize I need to build a new computer from parts because using my ancient parts is getting too risky. I remember 30 years ago when I eagerly anticipated the weekend edition of the newspaper with the weekend Fry’s Electronics ad. Holy moley! There’s a CPU and ATX motherboard combo for $120. I’m getting it. Without hesitation, I would drive there (or get my dad to drive) and immediately splurge. Then, I got right to work assembling my new computer. Wow, how times have changed for me. I gave you this background to discuss how I have since fallen on hard times, how frugal I am, and how RAM prices have recently soared. Apparently, this happened because of the AI bubble encouraging RAM manufacturers to divert their resources away from desktop computer memory and components on RAM modules to continue feeding the AI bubble. Because I am not too knowledgeable about this, let me link to the Hardware Unboxed videos “DDR5 Pricing Skyrockets, What’s Going On?” and “VRAM Cost Is About To Make GPUs Way More Expensive“. I have been dreaming about buying new parts for a new computer for 6-12 months now. One year ago a 2×16 GB package of DDR5 RAM was approximately $100 USD. Today, that could be well over $200. That difference is enough to discourage me from buying. Three companies dominate the market for memory: Samsung, Micron, and Hynix. The AI bubble seems to have affected all three companies and respective prices for RAM. Of course, I could try to skimp in other areas. I didn’t pay attention to computers for a decade or more. Thus, I got up to speed recently in anticipation of any supposed Black Friday promotions. Apparently, Intel makes garbage chips now. That leaves one other option, AMD. AMD’s latest and greatest platform is named AM5 (with AM6 forthcoming), but I could deliberately buy an AM4 CPU, AM4 motherboard, and DDR4 RAM. DDR4 RAM did not get excluded from whatever frothiness is going on with AI. It’s all kind of spendy. Argh! Risk to the big 7 paying off these debts: Trump fails to prevent China’s DeepSeek from dominating Sam Altman’s too much computer, too much training overhead. Big 7 intro/monopoly power already gone. Data center build outs delayed by grid connection, if the grid can get debt to build out. Project and supply chain delays. Some number of US/EU sources doing programming like DeepSeek. If big 7 make any profit it will be short lived. HE/SW life cycle very short. Any underwriter not following scientific papers is not doing due diligence. But, the fed balance sheet has over $2.5 trillion in MBS, etc. Most with >10 years left. Might as well tranche the big 7 debts and move on. Buckle up! Reuters just reported CDS’ are being drawn up on big AI risk. Weinstein, Saba…. Is this the report you mean? https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/weinsteins-saba-sells-credit-derivatives-big-tech-as-ai-risks-grow-source-says-2025-11-17/ Boaz Weinstein’s Saba Capital Management has sold credit derivatives in recent months to lenders seeking protection on big tech names like Oracle and Microsoft due to concerns over a debt-financed AI investment frenzy, a source told Reuters. Banks have sought to shield their exposure to potential losses by buying credit default swaps (CDS) from the U.S. hedge fund manager, known for his winning bet against the JPMorgan Chase, opens new tab trader dubbed the “London Whale”, the person said. While the credit insurance rises in value in tandem with the perceived risk of a company’s default, current prices indicate those risks are still low compared to other sectors. Yes, thank you for linking it here…. “current prices indicate those risks are still low compared to other sectors.” is a stretch! Jensen Huang says NVDA will sell $500 to $600 billion in GPU chips next couple of years…. where will the money come from? i dont really believe in the ability of companies to supply data centers with enough electricity in the long run. thus in my mind, the fate of data centers many years down the line is likely some sort of looting for parts – if not electrical components, then the base metals used in the electrical components. additionally, the oversupply of datacenters begs another question: what about the data? how are they getting enough data to compute in these centers? you need either more experimental data being gathered (phones, surveillance, maybe drones) or something from ab initio guys. Jeff Bezos has entered the chat… I think this is becoming as silly as the original Dot Com bubble. According to the Guardian article you linked, so has Michael Burry. Michael Burry, best known for accurately predicting the 2008 housing crisis, recently invested $1bn in bets that Palantir and Nvidia shares will fall just days after he accused some of the big tech firms of using accounting tricks to “artificially boost earnings”. Thanks for posting this article. I’m still trying to digest it all. I think this is related – has anybody noticed what’s happening to RAM? Prices are going nuts: RAM: WTF? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hLiwNViMak A memory upgrade that I was looking at earlier this year for around $120 is now approaching $500. I don’t know if this will bleed into prices for other devices that use RAM and other ICs used in server grade hardware, but if this keeps up, it will. All so we can have things like AI targeted data scrapping and ads, lay off entry level workers of all sorts, and OpenAI’s big deal – AI p0rn. Really? Yeah, really: OpenAI’s ChatGPT will soon allow ‘erotica’ for adults in major policy shift https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/15/erotica-coming-to-chatgpt-this-year-says-openai-ceo-sam-altman.html China is using AI to do things like reduce the cost of healthcare and enhance manufacturing (I think this is a repeat link): China’s AI hospitals will transform medicine across the world. But not in the United States. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDmFB7AQSR0 I’ll have to keep looking around at how AI will be used in America hoping to find where it will be used to assist humans doing jobs – I’m sure it’s out there rather than all the crazy AI stuff that actually pops up unwanted. AI friends for kids? Yikes! NO! I’ve come across a couple of instances where medical researchers in the U.S. are using AI. In one they’re attempting to discover possible cures to various diseases through the off-label use of existing medications. The Medical Matchmaking Machine Radiolab (1 hour, 12 minute audio). This is quite a story as the principal researcher was a doctor who, without AI, discovered an off-label use for an existing medication to save his own life and that of others. Other researchers are using AI to develop new drugs without much success as of yet. AI Was Supposed To Discover New Drugs. Where Are They? Science Friday (18 minute audio with transcript) Thanks! Other researchers are using AI to develop new drugs without much success as of yet. AI Was Supposed To Discover New Drugs. Where Are They? Years of human trials and millions or billions of dollars of investment will happen before the AI- discovered candidate molecules — and I know of plenty — which make it through the process will arrive. That’s how the real world works. New drugs don’t just magically appear. Both these podcast transcripts eventually get to that little fact, so the headline/titles of them are essentially clickbait.

Title: Yet More AI Bubble Worries, Now on Debt Side, with Wall Street Journal Featuring AI Datacenter Borrowing “Frenzy”

Full Content:
Yours truly is overdue on an overview how private-debt-backed AI datacenter deals work and why companies like Meta who are perfectly capable of borrowing in their own name paying 200-300 basis points extra not to do so is not a good sign. But the Wall Street Journal just published a very detailed story on the general outlines of this debt binge, which has gotten more attention in the popular press as borrowing levels have skyrocketed this year: Big Tech borrowing for AI data centers: 2015-2024 average: $32B/year Sept-Oct 2025 alone: $75B > Meta borrowed $30B > Oracle borrowed$18B > $META also did $27B off-balance sheet with Blue Owl AI companies now 14% of IG index The “money-printing” tech companies are…… pic.twitter.com/IuhBU0LS4M — junkbondinvestor (@junkbondinvest) November 5, 2025 And from the new Wall Street Journal story: What the Journal calls a “frenzy” in Wall Street Blows Past Bubble Worries to Supercharge AI Spending Frenzy is awfully reminiscent of the toxic phase of the subprime lending binge, when originators were so desperate for product, as the jibe then went, they’d fund borrower who could fog a mirror. It was years later that we were able, with the key elements including some insiders plus a remarkable pre-crisis analysis by (of all things) an equity market analyst, Henry Maxey of Ruffler Investment, to piece together how leverage-on-leverage created an even-then, well-reported “wall of liquidity”. It was also the leverage on leverage (and that systemically important yet fragile financial institutions were heavily exposed) that made the bubble unwind so catastrophic. We have warned that the unwind of an, erm, traditional credit bubble, even if very large (see Japan and for a lesser but still nasty version, the S&L crisis) typically produces at worst very deep and protracted recessions and zombification (the runup to the 1929 US crash also featured CDO-like leverage on leverage, see Frank Partnoy’s The Match King for details), as opposed to banking system near-or-actual failures. So again, we have yet to see evidence of that meteor-hitting-the-financial-system event being in the offing. But absence of evidence does not amount to evidence of absence. And perhaps finance historians can correct me, but I do not recall a historical instance of a massive equity bubble (without 1929-style heavy borrowings directly against those equities) accompanied by so many red flags, particularly operating and financial leverage, in the underlying commercial activity. That included recursive deals among key companies and as we’ll discuss a bit in this and more in posts to come, overly-clever borrowing structures that make sense only to achieve higher levels of leverage than could be achieved by traditional means. The Journal points out in passing that one of the mega-deals will pay more than 2% that a plainer-vanilla offering would. In a fine overview of in June on how these financings work, Paul Kedrosky similarly said the premium was 200 to 300 basis points. That’s an awful lot to pay for opacity and supposed balance sheet remoteness.1 As a brief introduction to causes for concern about the datacenter boom, see the executive summary from Bubble or Nothing from the Center for Public Enterprise (hat tip Matt Stoller): ● Cash flow uncertainty persists as the cost of providing AI inference services continues to rise. Leading AI inference service providers are not particularly differentiated from one another; this competitive market structure suppresses market participants’ pricing power and prevents them from recovering rising costs. ● The collateral value of a graphical processing unit (GPU), the sector’s keystone asset, looks poised to fall in the near-term. The value of chips fluctuates depending on uncertain user demand as well as the supply dynamics and technical specifications of new GPUs, now released yearly. The cash flow that GPU collateral can demand is suppressed due to the sector’s competitive market structure and the uncertain depreciation schedule of existing GPUs. ● Data center tenants will undertake multiple cycles of intense and increasingly expensive capital expenditure within a single lease term, posing considerable tenant churn risks to data center developers. This asset-liability mismatch between data center developers and their tenants will strain developers’ creditworthiness without guarantees from market-leading tech companies. ● Circular financing, or “roundabouting,” among so-called hyperscaler tenants—the leading tech companies and AI service providers—create an interlocking liability structure across the sector. These tenants comprise an incredibly large share of the market and are financing each others’ expansion, creating concentration risks for lenders and shareholders. ● Debt is playing an increasingly large role in the financing of data centers. While debt is a quotidian aspect of project finance, and while it seems like hyperscaler tech companies can self-finance their growth through equity and cash, the lack of transparency in some recent debt-financed transactions and the interlocked liability structure of the sector are cause for concern. The first two points alone, the fact that inference costs are not only not falling but still rising, and near-term downside in GPU prices ought to be fatal, or at least detrimental to debt funding. Yet as you’ll see, even though the Journal raises concerns, and even adds to this list by describing how AI “hyperscalers” are putting out duplicate orders for the datacenter capacity, virtually assuring whipsaw, it’s not as sobering as the list above. But it includes signs that some dogs are turning their noses up at the dogfood: Stock prices normally go up when a company reports record revenue but after Meta did just that on Oct. 29, its shares plummeted 11% instead. The reason: Zuckerberg disclosed he will “aggressively” increase capital spending on AI, drawing questions from analysts about how the company plans to actually make money off the new technology. What the Journal describes parallels the late-stage subprime lending frenzy. In 2007, CEO Chuck Prince of later-big-bailout recipient Citigroup famously remarked: When the music stops, in terms of liquidity, things will be complicated. “But as long as the music is playing, you’ve got to get up and dance. We’re still dancing….The depth of the pools of liquidity is so much larger than it used to be that a disruptive event now needs to be much more disruptive than it used to be. Consider from the Journal the, erm, enthusiasm of lenders and fears of becoming wall flowers in this party: Silicon Valley’s biggest players are flush with cash and were able to fund much of the initial AI build-out from their own coffers. As the dollar figures climb ever higher, they are turning to debt and private equity—spreading the risks and potential rewards more broadly across the economy. Some of the financing is coming from plain-vanilla corporate bond sales, but financiers are making far bigger fees off giant private deals. Virtually every Wall Street player is angling to get a piece of the action, from banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley to traditional asset managers such as BlackRock. Investor appetite for data-center debt is so strong that some money managers have booked billion-dollar gains in a matter of days, even before construction of the facilities they are financing is complete. Still, the longer-term performance is hardly assured. Big tech companies are expected to spend nearly $3 trillion on AI through 2028 but only generate enough cash to cover half that tab, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley. Big names in the financial world, such as Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, are warning about AI-fueled froth in the markets and in capital spending. At the same time, the fear of missing out is real. Days after Solomon voiced his concerns to analysts, Goldman formed a new team in its banking and markets group focused on AI infrastructure financing. Later from the Journal: Funds that invest in AI deals say they carry little risk, because tech companies with deep pockets have ironclad leases that will generate the money to pay investors back. Microsoft has a higher credit rating than the U.S. government, and it told investors on Oct. 29 that it would double its total data-center footprint in the next two years. Perhaps I am too old, but I recall that IBM and GE were once AAA rated too, and that by 2000 (for IBM) and 2010 (for GE) their luster had taken quite a turn. And remember the pre-crisis pattern that housing prices had never fallen nationwide, only regionally? These supposedly blue-chip tech companies are placing monster bets on AI, so their historical solidity isn’t as germane as it might seem, unless they back off if the fundamental performance of large language models continues to fall well short of promises. The reaction of the Meta stockholders to Zuckerberg’s promise of even more big AI spending is confirmation. Back to the Journal: Tech executives see more risk in underbuilding than overbuilding… But some tech companies are weaker financially than others. Oracle…needs to borrow billions more for its spending spree, prompting Moody’s Ratings and S&P Global Ratings to edge closer to reclassifying Oracle’s bonds as junk debt. In recent weeks, the company’s stock price has fallen 32% and its bonds have lost about 7%. There’s also the risk that the chips tech firms are borrowing to buy could be obsolete in a few year… The last time Wall Street went all-in on an industry was the fracking boom—then bust—over a decade ago. This time, financiers are marshaling even larger sums. The article continues with a breathless account of the boomtown effect that these datacenter buildouts are generating. Matt Stoller flagged the concern of growing real-economy dependence on massive spend in what ought to be a niche: A few months ago, I asked why our economy, despite steady growth in official numbers, feels so creepy and unstable. My conclusion was that the U.S. is in a “Chinese finger trap” economy. We are dependent for growth on monopolies and an AI bubble, which juices the all-important stock market. Trying to grow an economy in a more stable way could lower stock prices which would paradoxically lead to a downturn. So we’re stuck, until some outside event occurs…. Data center developers are now approaching multiple utilities with proposals for the same project, leading to “phantom” forecasts of demand that isn’t actually there. Essentially, it’s hoarding. Hoarding is what happen in overheated markets….But this can lead to something called the “bullwhip effect.” Buyers overstate how much they want to buy….all of a sudden the demand evaporates because it was never real in the first place. This dynamic can throw an economy into an overheated state, and then a depression; that’s what happened globally after World War I, leading to, among other things, Mussolini’s takeover of Italy…. At this point, data centers are pretty much what’s growing in America. I recently had a conversation with an elected official who told me that data center construction is a huge construction jobs boost in rust belt areas….He posited a tension between political support for the new temporary jobs and political anger over higher electricity prices. We have a one-legged economy, with the AI build-out serving as a driver of real estate values, the stock market, and GDP growth This is a bet-the-economy scheme on models where China has much better mousetraps. There is no way this will end well. ____ 1 The crisis demonstrated that theory and practice can be two different things. Banks had long offloaded credit card receivables to investors in supposedly off-balance sheet deals. When losses on them rose to previously unthinkable levels, the investors successfully revolted and made the banks eat some of those costs. The reason was the bank credit card businesses depended on being able to keep using other people’s credit. I am not sure whether or not these AI datacenter borrowers won’t wind up in an analogous position, of being so dependent on ongoing lending that lenders won’t let them walk away from outsized credit losses. “companies like Meta who are perfectly capable of borrowing in their own name paying 200-300% basis points extra” Yves, I noticed something that should be fixed: “% basis points”. Incompatible units, right? Aargh, fixing, thanks. “…have ironclad leases that will generate the money to pay investors back.” Bwaahhh!!! That is until those leases hit the smelters of the bankruptcy courts! Ed Dowd on the US economic, the AI bubble, the stock market, and the housing market. utube, ~1 hr. Ed Dowd: We’re Already in a Recession, Oil Going to $30 & The Deflation Scare Coming https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHM-BH-SguE Excellent discussion and economic assessments by Dowd. These are Capitalists to the core. Meta and much of big tech still have corporate stock buyback plans open. Incentives drive outcomes—-companies have move incentive to lever-up and chase the AI headlines than being seen as a 1989-era IBM (a company missing a secular pivot). “…China has much better mousetraps.” Listened recently to an interview with Andrew Ross Sorkin on this topic taking much the same line as the above article, during which he claimed as an example of China’s technical and manufacturing prowess that BYD electric vehicles are the gold standard that are better and cheaper than U.S. cars and that if the U.S. didn’t have tariffs on Chinese cars we would probably not have and an auto industry in the U.S. I’m giving serious consideration to encouraging my USian grandchildren to learn Mandarin, https://www.newyorker.com/video/watch/the-radio-hour-andrew-ross-sorkin-in-conversation-with-andrew-ross-sorkin (Minute 12:33) When you’ve lost Andrew Ross Sorkin… I saw a video on the YouTube’s last night so it must be true… BYD just test drove, (introduced?) an EV that will reach speeds over 200 miles an hour. I think they were at 300+ mph Believe it o not, an electric motor can generate enormous rotational torque. Combustion engines are no match. Getting to 200-300 mph is more a matter of stability and aerodynamics. Too many EV’s on a US freeway will create the same congestion as an ICE vehicle. I’ve driven and owned a number of ICE muscle cars, mostly during my misspent youth, that I found impressively fast off the line. Now I drive a little Toyota hybrid, which frankly feels a bit like riding around in a sardine can, that upon acceleration can give you whiplash. I exaggerate but slightly. Believe it or not, torque can not be anything but rotational. :) “Linear torque” is force. Also, torque can be multiplied via gears, while power can’t. Steam engines and electric motors tend to produce maximum torque close to zero rpm, which is the “believe it or not” part for ICE only drivers (with diesel engines being better at low rpm torque than petrol ones). Limited range of rotational speeds with useful torque is why trasmission is a necessity (and also why big trucks have more gears). Getting to 200-300 mph is a matter of many things, but mostly not crashing. :) Son in law just received his Tesla cyber truck. He loves it, so far. We talked about the almost instant high torque etc. Tech features are great! Run everything from the smart phone. My nephew has had the EV Rivian pick-up for a couple of years he still loves it. I saw it Saturday! I hope my daughter stops calling their cyber truck the “dumpster”. At 75 I’ll stay with the ICE-SUV. My one-owner 1977 Chevrolet Cabriolet, with second 305 V8, 270.000 miles, low rev – high torque, runs like new. A random professional-American’s Mandarin will never be good as their random Chinese equivalent’s English. Particularly as English is the de-facto international working language in Asia, which is much more linguistically diverse than Europe’s Proto-Indo-European-descendant languages. Don’t push Mandarin just because of China in a vacuum (though obviously the thought counts). China isn’t just Mandarin, it’s a civilizational tradition that evolved independently of the west’s Greco-Roman-Enlightenment lineage—-an obvious statement, but something that’s lost on lots of credentialed, supposedly educated, people. And today’s “Communist China” is just one page in its lengthy history. “And today’s “Communist China” is just one page in its lengthy history.” Truly. The pages that have for the most part drawn my interest over the years are those having to do with the development of Buddhism in that country. One thing in particular that strikes me is that the Chinese took the more asocial natural mysticism of India and Southeast Asia and made it more fit for purpose in a materially practical, more socially engaged way of living. Yes, I communicate with Chinese entrepreneurs and their English is as good or better than lifelong Americans. I’m told their linguistic skill is not unusual. I just started listening to an audiobook “Empire of AI”. One line of thinking in the book is that “size/scale/compute power” is not the only infrastructure model one can choose from to chase the elusive AGI unicorn (another topic the book explores). This is the predominant line of thinking running thru SV though. Open AI seized the narrative and strategically decided to achieve AGI thru sheer scale and size of its compute resources. 3 hours into the book so far but its very interesting. Thanks for the book tip. I’m currently reading Adam Becker’s More Everything Forever describing beliefs and intentions prevalent among Silicon Valley elites. “Inmates running the asylum” is a phrase that comes to mind. And not in a good way as in King of Hearts. $133B in questionable debt? Just file it under “other.” Here we have JP Morgan blazing the opacity trail. Thanks for this background, Yves. To me, this finance perspective confirms some things I think about AI and data centers. An example from a portion of the Journal article you quote: But some tech companies are weaker financially than others. Oracle…needs to borrow billions more for its spending spree, prompting Moody’s Ratings and S&P Global Ratings to edge closer to reclassifying Oracle’s bonds as junk debt. In recent weeks, the company’s stock price has fallen 32% and its bonds have lost about 7%. Why risk so much? Hasn’t stock price been sacred in the post-Greenspan era? Doesn’t this seem to be about more than even money? I think I’ve found part of the answer in two interviews Ross Douthat, the Roman Catholic New York Times columnist, has done in the past year. The first, Douthat’s interview of Peter Thiel is second perhaps only to Tucker’s sit-down with Nick Fuentes among widely viewed videos. The second one, done in the past few days, is of Paul Kingsnorth, who’s on a book tour promoting his new book, Against the Machine: The Unmaking of Humanity. I was introduced to Kingsnorth through amfortas’s links to the Dark Mountain Project, which was begun by Kingsnorth and Dougald Hine. I recommend listening to the Thiel interview before the Kingsnorth one because Douthat and Kingsnorth discuss that interview at some length. It’s also interesting contrast the two interviewees’ personalities and characters. (Kingsnorth calls the projects of Thiel and Musk “little boys’ toys,” an example of his barely contained contempt for them.) I have watched about 15min of the first interview and paused at about 15 min of the second and, whatever one thinks about Kingsnorth he can be labelled as freethinker while Thiel not. The later is heavily influenced by his attachments (to his companies, money, whatever he is attached to) no matter how much he would like to appear as a freethinker. I couldn’t stomach Thiel for longer while I will probably end Kingsnorth interview even if i do not agree completely with him in some instances but he is much more interesting than Thiel. One shakes the brain and the other shakes the stomach. Let me recommend the latest interview of Emmanuel Todd by Glenn Diesen which I found interesting. This are people who shake one beliefs and that is good. Agree with Ignacio about Diesen’s interview of Todd. For once, Diesen pretty much shut up & let Todd talk. Todds latest book is about the loss of the West. He gets heavily into the loss of the philosophical “center” of the West- sort of there being no there there. He says that Western society has become a “Zombie” society like the Nazis. Well worth the listen! Like this: from 2024, In view of this, ladies and gentlemen, what we can conclude is that the adoration of transvestites is an inevitable consequence of liberalism, and that the Inquisition burned too few people. I will not venture into the twisted nest of vipers that is Thiel’s brain, but Kingsnorth will be worth a listen, thanks. I’m meeting with my Minnesota AI vs. water people tomorrow. It’ll be interesting to hear their perspective. Data centers might try to propose one project to competing power companies but there’s only one water source (and regulator). If the volume of permit amendment applications from water utilitues/cities has fallen (data centers in MN do not supply their own water), the number of data center projects in MN will have fallen proportionally. I’m trying to think about what’s similar and different with dotcom. 1) Similar to AI, dotcom had a huge infra build-out of core network fiber, switching, and data centers. Not all of that was scrap as some of it has relatively long useful life, especially fiber and switching, unlike AI GPUs. 2) The demand for dotcom infra was real, growing, and continues to grow. The dotcom bubble was supply. The Inernet as such was not vaporware. In AI it’s not clear how much money there really is in psychopathic search engines and generation of videos of dogs with 5 legs. A lot of the ultimate “demand” may be hype. 3) As Yves so well presents above, the financials of the AI bubble may involve a lot more leverage than dotcom. So what are we facing? Something worse than dotcom but not worse than GFC? The public Internet in the 90’s was not vaporware. It was the long developing son of the military/university ARPANET (network) from the 70’s. The early Internet was communication over phone lines. As public access grew cable/fiber optics were seen as necessary to get increased public/business participation. Unfortunately, laying cable was faster than public uptake. Until. of course, Netscape, and other graphical user interface that didn’t require knowledge of computer programming. Then, with exploding popularity (ease of use), the Internet demanded cable and fiber connectivity. Something tells me AGI is not going to follow this breakout scenario. Yea GUI, and they said no one would pay those hundreds of dollars for that heavy CRT. On #2. you are GREATLY confusing dotcom infrastructure with companies selling “eyeballs’. Most of the bubble was in the latter. There’s also the risk that the chips tech firms are borrowing to buy could be obsolete in a few year… Leaving aside for the moment the overall ridiculous nature of the AI technology boom and the fact that it is going to come crashing down of its own accord quite soon since LLVMs are not fit for their advertised purpose, any above quote seems like it highlights another risk-within-a-risk. GPUs are a very high technology product that most people don’t know much about beyond a few acronyms. Using them as debt collateral seems very fraught in its own right since no one knows enough about them to decide what they are worth and in particular how quickly they’re going to depreciate. Nvidia recently announced that they are going to a one-year design cycle, meaning all the chips that were purchased in 2025 will be superseded by newer, more powerful chips in 2026, and so on each year. I imagine this will create a big hit to the older models, and I imagine after this happens a few times the older chips will be essentially worthless. I don’t know what the term of the debt is that is being backed by these chips, but if it’s more than a couple of years this is obviously a shipwreck waiting to happen. There are other changes in the technological landscape that can also render existing GPU hardware worthless in one way or another, including changes in software architecture and new manufacturers coming on the scene with cheaper and more powerful products. These kinds of things are both hard to predict and reasonably likely to happen. Some physical objects, like real estate, vehicles, precious gems, and so on seem to make fairly reasonable collateral (even so, look at the record!), but new and evolving integrated circuits of very high density and complexity don’t fit into that category. 1. I am yet to hear of significant proposals stateside to expand electric generation capacity – plus transmission lines – to support all this projected data center growth. And remember, the US is a fragmented electricity space (10 separate market regions in just the lower 48), with differing regulatory rules (Texas does not equal New York does not equal California), so these need to be done at the local level. The Russians have publically talked about using the new modular type nuclear reactors (including the ones they’d developed for the Burevestnik and the Poseidon weapons), though for now data centers do not seem at the top of their energy or nuke priorities (they’re replacing their aging nukes plus upgrading the infrastructure in historically underserved regions like Yakutia). The Chinese are drastically increasing their nuke capacity, paying the Russians a healthy chunk so to do. The Americans……….eh? Or maybe I’ve just missed it. But all these plans for data center buildouts without the generation and transmission to go with are bound to run into quite the obstacle once they start drawing enough power to drop a given market region below its “reserve margin” level (typically 12% over peak demand is how much you want in generation), or, if god forbid these idiots build them in Texas, which is the only fully deregulated market, cause “ice storm” level price spikes for customers. 2. I am not sure what you would use as collateral if you’re doing any secured or ABS type financing for these data centers. The buildings themselves? Because here’s the thing. If the servers are meant to do AI-LLM type stuff, that means every year, when the new chips/GPUs come out, you have to upgrade them all, at huge cost. But meanwhile, standard data center tasks do not need this extra capacity and do not need this extra bang for the buck. So 1-2-3 years into the deal you’re stuck with a bunch of formerly high-end chips that no-one needs, unless you pile even more money into the place? Or think about it this way. Whenever I build my own PC, instead of buying the latest, most high-end CPU and video card, I buy the ones from ~2 years ago. Because at that point the price comes down 50% or more, while the decline in capability – for home user applications – is fairly negligible. The point is, the depreciation on these assets is insane relative to, say, a commercial building, or a power plant, or a refinery or whatever. Or even a commercial aircraft (assumed 25-year useful life, usually). To do an ABS deal secured by chips, if that is, in fact, what they are doing…that is pure insanity. 3. Does anyone remember IBM’s Watson? Their whole thing in the 2000s and early-mid 2010s was – we have this “artificial intelligence” thing called Watson, and we’ll sell it to hospitals and such, where it will make diagnoses and help (read: replace) the medical staff in this and that capacity. And…the whole thing failed, because they could not fix what we now call AI hallucinations. Or, rather, IBM tinkered around with it for a while, with some sample projects in this or that hospital that never went anywhere much, and eventually sold it to some PE guys for ~$1 billion, which is rather less than they’d invested into it in the first place. Of course, the total cost for Watson, at least its medical unit, including all the R&D and whatnot, had to have been in the several billion range at the most, which is something IBM can easily afford. I look at the charts for projected LLM capex spend, and there is just no way to get there from here, unless there is a technological revolution in LLMs no-one knows about. Re #2, the security is the data center lease agreements. I seldom comment on tech since I stopped working in that field 25 years ago, and I deliberately do not use hardware or software services provided by AI, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, etc. Nevertheless, I am typing this on an ancient computer running Linux, which I deliberately configured to run minimal unbloated software, and I realize I need to build a new computer from parts because using my ancient parts is getting too risky. I remember 30 years ago when I eagerly anticipated the weekend edition of the newspaper with the weekend Fry’s Electronics ad. Holy moley! There’s a CPU and ATX motherboard combo for $120. I’m getting it. Without hesitation, I would drive there (or get my dad to drive) and immediately splurge. Then, I got right to work assembling my new computer. Wow, how times have changed for me. I gave you this background to discuss how I have since fallen on hard times, how frugal I am, and how RAM prices have recently soared. Apparently, this happened because of the AI bubble encouraging RAM manufacturers to divert their resources away from desktop computer memory and components on RAM modules to continue feeding the AI bubble. Because I am not too knowledgeable about this, let me link to the Hardware Unboxed videos “DDR5 Pricing Skyrockets, What’s Going On?” and “VRAM Cost Is About To Make GPUs Way More Expensive“. I have been dreaming about buying new parts for a new computer for 6-12 months now. One year ago a 2×16 GB package of DDR5 RAM was approximately $100 USD. Today, that could be well over $200. That difference is enough to discourage me from buying. Three companies dominate the market for memory: Samsung, Micron, and Hynix. The AI bubble seems to have affected all three companies and respective prices for RAM. Of course, I could try to skimp in other areas. I didn’t pay attention to computers for a decade or more. Thus, I got up to speed recently in anticipation of any supposed Black Friday promotions. Apparently, Intel makes garbage chips now. That leaves one other option, AMD. AMD’s latest and greatest platform is named AM5 (with AM6 forthcoming), but I could deliberately buy an AM4 CPU, AM4 motherboard, and DDR4 RAM. DDR4 RAM did not get excluded from whatever frothiness is going on with AI. It’s all kind of spendy. Argh! Risk to the big 7 paying off these debts: Trump fails to prevent China’s DeepSeek from dominating Sam Altman’s too much computer, too much training overhead. Big 7 intro/monopoly power already gone. Data center build outs delayed by grid connection, if the grid can get debt to build out. Project and supply chain delays. Some number of US/EU sources doing programming like DeepSeek. If big 7 make any profit it will be short lived. HE/SW life cycle very short. Any underwriter not following scientific papers is not doing due diligence. But, the fed balance sheet has over $2.5 trillion in MBS, etc. Most with >10 years left. Might as well tranche the big 7 debts and move on. Buckle up! Reuters just reported CDS’ are being drawn up on big AI risk. Weinstein, Saba…. Is this the report you mean? https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/weinsteins-saba-sells-credit-derivatives-big-tech-as-ai-risks-grow-source-says-2025-11-17/ Boaz Weinstein’s Saba Capital Management has sold credit derivatives in recent months to lenders seeking protection on big tech names like Oracle and Microsoft due to concerns over a debt-financed AI investment frenzy, a source told Reuters. Banks have sought to shield their exposure to potential losses by buying credit default swaps (CDS) from the U.S. hedge fund manager, known for his winning bet against the JPMorgan Chase, opens new tab trader dubbed the “London Whale”, the person said. While the credit insurance rises in value in tandem with the perceived risk of a company’s default, current prices indicate those risks are still low compared to other sectors. Yes, thank you for linking it here…. “current prices indicate those risks are still low compared to other sectors.” is a stretch! Jensen Huang says NVDA will sell $500 to $600 billion in GPU chips next couple of years…. where will the money come from? i dont really believe in the ability of companies to supply data centers with enough electricity in the long run. thus in my mind, the fate of data centers many years down the line is likely some sort of looting for parts – if not electrical components, then the base metals used in the electrical components. additionally, the oversupply of datacenters begs another question: what about the data? how are they getting enough data to compute in these centers? you need either more experimental data being gathered (phones, surveillance, maybe drones) or something from ab initio guys. Jeff Bezos has entered the chat… I think this is becoming as silly as the original Dot Com bubble. According to the Guardian article you linked, so has Michael Burry. Michael Burry, best known for accurately predicting the 2008 housing crisis, recently invested $1bn in bets that Palantir and Nvidia shares will fall just days after he accused some of the big tech firms of using accounting tricks to “artificially boost earnings”. Thanks for posting this article. I’m still trying to digest it all. I think this is related – has anybody noticed what’s happening to RAM? Prices are going nuts: RAM: WTF? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hLiwNViMak A memory upgrade that I was looking at earlier this year for around $120 is now approaching $500. I don’t know if this will bleed into prices for other devices that use RAM and other ICs used in server grade hardware, but if this keeps up, it will. All so we can have things like AI targeted data scrapping and ads, lay off entry level workers of all sorts, and OpenAI’s big deal – AI p0rn. Really? Yeah, really: OpenAI’s ChatGPT will soon allow ‘erotica’ for adults in major policy shift https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/15/erotica-coming-to-chatgpt-this-year-says-openai-ceo-sam-altman.html China is using AI to do things like reduce the cost of healthcare and enhance manufacturing (I think this is a repeat link): China’s AI hospitals will transform medicine across the world. But not in the United States. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDmFB7AQSR0 I’ll have to keep looking around at how AI will be used in America hoping to find where it will be used to assist humans doing jobs – I’m sure it’s out there rather than all the crazy AI stuff that actually pops up unwanted. AI friends for kids? Yikes! NO! I’ve come across a couple of instances where medical researchers in the U.S. are using AI. In one they’re attempting to discover possible cures to various diseases through the off-label use of existing medications. The Medical Matchmaking Machine Radiolab (1 hour, 12 minute audio). This is quite a story as the principal researcher was a doctor who, without AI, discovered an off-label use for an existing medication to save his own life and that of others. Other researchers are using AI to develop new drugs without much success as of yet. AI Was Supposed To Discover New Drugs. Where Are They? Science Friday (18 minute audio with transcript) Thanks! Other researchers are using AI to develop new drugs without much success as of yet. AI Was Supposed To Discover New Drugs. Where Are They? Years of human trials and millions or billions of dollars of investment will happen before the AI- discovered candidate molecules — and I know of plenty — which make it through the process will arrive. That’s how the real world works. New drugs don’t just magically appear. Both these podcast transcripts eventually get to that little fact, so the headline/titles of them are essentially clickbait.

Title: Investors Now Want Crypto Just as Much as ETFs

More people are planning to buy ETFs, and their biggest demands are exposure to stocks and digital assets, per BlackRock. Emile Hallez emile@thedailyupside.com The people want ETFs. And in those ETFs they want equities … and crypto. Those are the two most important categories to retail investors, according to data from a survey commissioned by BlackRock, which included 5,000 respondents in July and August. The report, published Thursday, shows changing priorities, particularly among young investors. While 66% of US investors said they owned individual stocks, 43% reported holding mutual funds. Bonds (29%), crypto assets (27%) and ETFs (23%) were behind. Still, ETFs are the fastest-growing category, and investors who already own them said they are most likely to buy equity (83%) and crypto (36%) funds during the next year. But among those who don’t yet own ETFs and plan to, there is nearly equal demand for equity (51%) and crypto (47%). “We’re witnessing a pivotal moment as individual investors embrace ETFs for their efficiency and transparency,” BlackRock head of US direct investing Amy Jenkins said in an announcement. “The predicted surge in first time ETF investors reflects a broader shift in investor preferences toward simplicity, accessibility and digital-first experiences.” Next year, of course, they’ll have plenty of options. The Securities and Exchange Commission has all but turned on a fire hose for new products, recently allowing the big exchanges to use generic listing standards for new ETFs. That’s a golden ticket for issuers who have been waiting for months to launch spot-price crypto ETFs, including those focused on a smorgasbord of meme coins. Some products have already started coming to the market, the most recent of which include index funds of spot crypto: the 21Shares FTSE Crypto 10 Index ETF (TTOP) and FTSE Crypto 10 ex-Bitcoin Select Index ETF (TXBC). Those ETFs, which launched Thursday, apply market cap weightings and hold a variety of Swiss-domiciled crypto exchange-traded products to fill in where spot-price products are not yet available domestically. Another Thursday debut was the Canary Capital XRP ETF (XRPC). “It feels just like another S&P 500 ETF,” said Federico Brokate, global head of business development at 21shares, which has a tagline for the products similar to what index fund investors are used to hearing: “Stop chasing coins. Start owning the market.” Unlike most spot crypto products, the two new ones are registered as 1940 Act (rather than 1933 Act) products. As to why investors choose ETFs, per the BlackRock survey: In Bitcoin They Trust: This all bodes well for BlackRock, which conveniently, is the world’s dominant asset manager, biggest ETF issuer and operator of the largest crypto ETP, the iShares Bitcoin Trust, which now represents about $80 billion. Only a few weeks ago, that ETF was poised to hit $100 billion in assets, though falling Bitcoin prices and a few days of net outflows have dragged its AUM down by $17 billion. It’s a reminder, especially for those new to investing, that if they like the idea of crypto, they better like volatility. This week’s SEC decision may be one of the most significant since the ETF Rule in 2019. Janus Henderson and Reckoner Capital Management both filed to launch new collateralized debt obligations strategies this month. Trading fractional shares for whole shares will require some communication and help, according to one firm that offers shareholder services. No state income taxes and pro-business policies have attracted hundreds of companies to the Lone Star State. Some of the biggest companies in the ETF business haven’t been in the game for very long but are quickly gathering assets. About 900 ETFs launched this year, and dozens of highly leveraged and spot crypto products await approval. Not all of them will catch on. Fundstrat is back at the free throw line, this time with a small- and mid-cap ETF and another focused on income. Issuers are betting that advisors could benefit from exposure to a narrow slice of the aerospace defense industry. Roughly the same number of ETFs closed in the first half of 2024 and 2025, even as new product launches pick up speed. The company, which is planning to add mutual fund share classes to some of its ETFs, recently rebranded and put the State Street name on many ETFs while taking SPDR off of some. More than half of millennial ETF investors told Schwab that they can and will outperform boring old index funds. While far from the biggest ETFs on the market, spaced-themed funds are skyrocketing in 2025. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: Capital Group, Goldman, T. Rowe Hit ETF Milestones

Some of the biggest companies in the ETF business haven’t been in the game for very long but are quickly gathering assets. Emile Hallez emile@thedailyupside.com That didn’t take too long. Several major asset managers are crossing asset milestones in their ETF businesses amid a record year for inflows industrywide. Capital Group’s three-year-old line of ETFs just hit a total of $100 billion in assets under management. Of course, no one comes close to BlackRock’s iShares or Vanguard, which at $3.9 trillion and $3.7 trillion are the dominant players in the market. But the rising profile of Capital Group, and other semi-recent entrants like T. Rowe Price, highlights the demand for new exchange-traded funds — and actively managed ones in particular. “We didn’t have them for a long time,” said John Queen, fixed income portfolio manager at Capital Group. “Even when active [ETFs] became available, we wanted to really make sure we understood the details of how they were going to play out and what the transparency meant before we started them up.” About $1.1 trillion poured into US ETFs this year through October, which was more than in all of 2024. Of that, $378 billion went into active ETFs. Total assets are now more than $13 trillion. Some of the other firms that recently surpassed or are about to hit assets-under-management milestones: Model Behavior. As niche ETF issuers have flooded the market with leveraged and thematic new funds, Capital Group and many other big asset managers have kept a focus on core-style products. To help distribute those ETFs, firms have increasingly added model portfolios. The top area where they’re building out models is now in active ETFs, according to a recent report from Morningstar. As of March, when Capital Group launched its first active ETF model portfolios, the firm was the third-largest provider, at $61 billion in assets under management, behind Wilshire ($68 billion) and BlackRock ($168 billion). “It has been an incredibly important connection with our clients and advisors, because it’s what they wanted all the time,” Queen said of Capital Group’s model portfolios and funds of funds. “It’s been a huge and important growth area for us.” This week’s SEC decision may be one of the most significant since the ETF Rule in 2019. Janus Henderson and Reckoner Capital Management both filed to launch new collateralized debt obligations strategies this month. Trading fractional shares for whole shares will require some communication and help, according to one firm that offers shareholder services.

Title: Harvard Pours $443,000,000 Into Bitcoin As SEC Filing Reveals Massive BlackRock IBIT Purchase

Harvard just poured a major amount of cash into the leading crypto asset, Bitcoin. A new 13F filing with the SEC shows the university’s endowment has boosted its stake in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) to 6,813,612 shares, worth about $443 million as of September 30th. This marks a 257% increase from Q2’s 1.91 million shares, worth $116 million. IBIT now tops Harvard’s US equity holdings, surpassing Microsoft at $323 million and Amazon at $235 million. Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas says the move represents a seal of approval for Bitcoin ETFs. “It’s super rare/difficult to get an endowment to bite on an ETF- esp a Harvard or Yale, it’s as good a validation as an ETF can get. That said, half a billion is a mere 1% of total endowment. Big enough to rank 16th among IBIT holders tho.” IBIT now has $81 billion in assets, capturing 35% of all spot Bitcoin ETF inflows.

Title: Bored with index funds? Here are tips for buying individual stocks.

You heard from a friend who bought some stock in Nvidia or Amazon or Apple when it was cheap, and now those shares are worth five or six figures. Those are inspiring stories. But how much can you safely invest in individual stocks? Financial planners advise armchair investors and retirement savers that the smartest move is usually to buy shares of index funds, the kind that track the performance of broad stock indexes or the entire market. Single stocks tend to be much more volatile. But millions of investors buy shares of individual stock, and lots of them have success stories. Is there a place for individual stocks in your retirement portfolio? If so, how much is too much? We asked several investment experts. Ordinary Americans are passionate about investing in individual stocks. A recent survey by the BlackRock Foundation and Commonwealth found that 54% of low- and moderate-income Americans (those earning $30,000-$80,000 a year) invest in capital markets, and that new investors favor single stocks over mutual funds and ETFs. Investors may watch YouTube and TikTok videos from influencers who claim to have can’t-miss stock picks. They troll the internet for recommendations from The Motley Fool and Morningstar. Then, they sit back and wait for a stock to take off. “There’s a certain element of fun to this,” said Zachary Rayfield, head of goals-based investing research at Vanguard. Ready to buy some individual stocks? Here are a few tips. If you invest in index funds or target-date retirement funds, your investment will probably track the market as a whole. Stock indexes do well in some years, poorly in others, but they are far less mercurial than individual stocks. With single stocks, you’re likely to see big swings, and not always up. If you’re just starting out, experts say, it’s wise to invest only a small share of your portfolio in individual stocks. That’s especially true if you’re investing with your retirement savings. “I think everyone’s retirement should be built on a foundation of index funds,” said Robert Brokamp, a senior retirement adviser at The Motley Fool. “And then you can gradually move into individual stocks,” committing “maybe 5%” of your portfolio. “And then you might find that you absolutely love it, and you can gradually increase that percentage.” However much money you invest in single stocks, investment experts say, try to avoid owning too much of one stock. “A simple rule of thumb is, do not let any one position in your portfolio account for more than 5 to 10% of the overall value of your portfolio,” said Caleb Silver, editor-in-chief of the financial journalism site Investopedia. Overconcentration can happen by accident. Let’s say you bought some shares of Nvidia a few years ago, and you watched them multiply tenfold in value. Today, those shares might make up a large share of your holdings. “Many of our members have 30% of their portfolio in Nvidia,” said Brokamp, whose site has recommended the stock for years. The problem with individual stocks is that “you’re vulnerable to steep declines of your portfolio if one of them goes down significantly,” Silver said. That’s less of a problem if the stock represents 5% of your portfolio, more concerning if it’s 30%. “Individual stocks can be a great way to complement a well-diversified portfolio, but it's important to ensure that no single security overshadows your overall mix,” said Ryan Viktorin, vice president and financial consultant at Fidelity Investments. Diversification, in investment parlance, means holding different kinds of assets. You can diversify by holding stocks in different sectors, large and small companies, American and foreign markets, and by holding things that aren’t stocks, like bonds and money market funds. If you’re devoting only 5% or 10% of your portfolio to single stocks, you don’t necessarily have to worry about diversifying those stocks. To Silver of Investopedia, “it’s better to concentrate on 5 to 10 stocks that you believe in, that have a track record,” and build sizeable holdings in those companies. “If you have invested in any of the top 10 companies in the S&P 500 over the past five years and you have built positions in those companies, you have outperformed the stock market,” Silver said. Case in point: Nvidia. Brokamp of Motley Fool suggests a broader approach. “You should own at least 25 stocks, and they should be diversified,” representing different types of companies, he said. Silver’s approach gives you larger stakes in fewer companies. Brokamp’s gives you more diversification, but you get a smaller stake in each stock. One axiom of investing dictates that actively managed funds often underperform the market as a whole. Simply put: It’s hard to beat the market by picking stocks yourself. And that rule surely applies to amateur stock pickers. “If you do this yourself, you’re becoming an active manager,” said Rayfield of Vanguard. “And a lot of active managers don’t outperform the broader market.” Savvy investors sell off diminished stocks at a loss, then use the loss to offset gains on other investments at tax time, a technique called tax-loss harvesting. Paring down underperforming stocks can leave an investor with an overly rosy view of their success. “If we’re selling the losers, sometimes we get a little high on our horse about what our capabilities are,” said Colin Day, a certified financial planner in St. Louis. “We forget the losers. We only remember the winners.” If you invest in a significant number of single stocks, Brokamp said, expect them to drift in different directions, some rising, some falling. The returns won’t resemble the path of a broad index fund, which captures the collective movement of many stocks. “Many of your individual stocks will be duds,” Brokamp said. “It’s the handful of successes that will drive your return.”

On January 23, 1930, there was a heated debate in the parliament of the regional state of Thuringia about the formation of a new right-­wing government including one of Hitler’s most ardent followers and a co-­putschist of 1923, Wilhelm Frick, as minister of the interior and public education. The debate began with the former state premier and SPD parliamentary group leader, August Frölich, criticizing the fact that the president of the parliament had taken down the democratic black, red, and gold flag from the building. Was this intended to demonstrate, he asked, “that the colors of the Third Reich under Hitler and Frick should take the place of the national colors?” In Frick, the speaker continued, “a high traitor”—­who had already broken his oath to the constitution as a Bavarian civil servant and who had never made a secret of his opposition to the parliamentary-­democratic system—­“has been appointed a minister in charge of the [regional] constitution.” The fact that Weimar of all places—­the Thuringian capital, in which Germany had adopted its democratic constitution—served as a springboard to elevate the National Socialists to an important position of power was not a coincidence. Frölich recalled that Frick had pleaded in the Reichstag for amnesty to be given to Ernst Werner Techow, who had been involved in Rathenau’s murder, and had demanded impunity for the Erzberger assassins, Schulz and Tillessen. He reminded the DVP, which wanted to join the right-­wing government, that not long ago, in December 1929, Frick had vilified the late Foreign Minister Gustav Stresemann as a paid foreign agent for accepting the Nobel Peace Prize. Repeatedly interrupted by the National Socialists, Frölich concluded his speech with the words: “The election of Mr. Frick makes today a day of political and cultural shame for Thuringia.” That afternoon DVP parliamentary group leader Georg Witzmann tried to justify his party’s stance. Despite considerable reservations, he said, his party had decided to join the government in the spirit of cooperating with all parties “who have the goodwill to serve our country with their work.” Frick had promised to swear an oath to the constitution and also declared that he would drop his accusations of corruption against Stresemann. A firewall on the political right was out of the question for the Thuringian DVP. On the contrary, Witzmann said, the National Socialists were “ideologically and politically closer” to the DVP than the Social Democrats were. In the end, the government was confirmed by 28 votes to 22 from the SPD, KPD, and DDP. Frick became the first National Socialist minister of a regional German government. The fact that Weimar of all places—­the Thuringian capital, in which Germany had adopted its democratic constitution—­served as a springboard to elevate the National Socialists to an important position of power was not a coincidence. After the interlude of the Thuringian united-­front leftist government of the SPD and KPD in the fall of 1923, which ended with the Reich intervening there and in Saxony, the Right had begun to gain strength. The “Thuringian Order League”—­a conglomeration of the DNVP, DVP, and Thuringian Rural League—­emerged as the strongest force in the state elections on February 10, 1924. However, with thirty-­five of seventy-­two state parliamentary seats, it fell short of a majority and therefore had to rely on being tolerant of the Popular-­Ethnic Social Bloc, a successor organization to the then-­banned Nazi Party, which surprised everyone by winning 9.3 percent of the vote and seven parliamentary seats. In the city of Weimar itself, it had even received almost twice as many votes, with 18.6 percent. One of the new government’s first measures was to cut funding for Walter Gropius’s unpopular Bauhaus in Weimar. In response, the director and the “masters,” as the instructors were known, declared their contracts with the state of Thuringia null and void. The world-­famous architecture and art school found a new home in Dessau, the capital of the regional state of Anhalt. In contrast to previous quarrels within the far-­right ethnic nationalist movement, the Nazi Party presented a new unity, tightly focused on the “Führer” as the undisputed integrating leader. It was the minister of the interior in this conservative–­extreme right government who in February 1925, after the reestablishment of the Nazi Party, lifted a nationwide ban on Hitler speaking publicly. Gradually, Thuringia replaced Bavaria as the primary stomping ground for the Far Right. “Nowhere in Germany did Hitler, the Nazis, the racist antisemites, the military associations, and extreme nationalists find a better place for their activities,” historian Karsten Rudolph has concluded. In March 1925, Hitler gave his first speeches in Weimar at several packed events. Further appearances followed in October 1925. When in the city, the party leader preferred to stay at the Hotel Elephant, the traditional hotel on the market square, which rolled out the red carpet early on. The hospitality he received was one reason that, after the ban on him speaking was rescinded, Hitler decided to convene the NSDAP’s first Reich Party Conference in early July 1926 in Weimar. In contrast to previous quarrels within the far-­right ethnic nationalist movement, the Nazi Party presented a new unity, tightly focused on the “Führer” as the undisputed integrating leader. On the afternoon of July 4, Hitler was allowed to speak at the Deutsches Nationaltheater—­the same venue where Friedrich Ebert had opened the National Assembly on February 6, 1919, and where the National Constituent Assembly had met. “Where Ebert once sat, today Adolf Hitler sits and stands,” boasted the gauleiter, or Nazi regional leader, Arthur Dinter, at a “general roll call” of the SA (Sturmabteilung) and SS. “This is the beginning of a new era.” In September 1927, Hitler dismissed Dinter, who was also the author of the antisemitic bestseller Die Sünde wider das Blut (The sin against blood), from his post because his sectarian idea of restoring the “pure doctrine of salvation” was upsetting people in the party leader’s circles. As his replacement, Hitler appointed the former managing director Fritz Sauckel, an unconditional true believer who would enjoy a long career. It was also in the Weimar Nazi Party administration that an inconspicuous functionary began a career as a cashier and accountant, which would see him become one of the most powerful men in the Third Reich. His name was Martin Bormann. Likewise, the young Baldur von Schirach, a son of the last grand-­ducal theater director, also found his way to Hitler in Weimar. He wrote verses of homage to the Führer, who would later, in October 1931, appoint him Reich Youth Leader of the Nazi Party. Along with the racist literary historian and avowed antisemite Adolf Bartels and his pupil Hans Severus Ziegler, deputy gauleiter since 1925, it was Schirach who gave Hitler access to conservative, upper-­middle-­class circles in the city. “I love Weimar,” Hitler proclaimed in 1928. “I need Weimar like I need Bayreuth. And the day will come when I’ll give this city and its theater a lot more support. I still have big plans for Weimar and Bayreuth.” Although the Nazis won only six seats in the regional parliament, they were still in a key position. The Nazis took 11.3 percent of the vote in the Thuringian state elections on December 8, 1929. This was more than three times as much as in the regional elections in February 1927 (3.5 percent). In Weimar, they got no less than 23.8 percent. Their success wasn’t accidental. Under Sauckel’s leadership, the party had built up a powerful machine and had aggressively campaigned and stirred up unrest in small rural Thuringian communities. Its success came primarily at the expense of the mainstream parties—­a sign of how voter behavior was shifting and a harbinger of the coming landslide in the Reichstag elections of September 14, 1930. The Berliner Tageblatt was thus very wrong when it dismissed the result as “a fad surrounded by carnival hype that has to be tolerated.” Although the Nazis won only six seats in the regional parliament, they were still in a key position. As in 1924, the mainstream parties of the center and right lacked a majority. Their twenty-­three seats (Rural Association: nine; Business Party: six; DVP: five; DNVP: two; DDP: one) were outweighed by the twenty-­four seats for the SPD (eighteen) and the KPD (six). Since they had ruled out a coalition with the Social Democrats, they needed the support of the six National Socialist MPs to form a government. This time around, Hitler did not want merely to tolerate a coalition. On the contrary, from the very outset, he wanted to be part of the government. Hitler was unusually frank about his motives in a letter, dated February 2, 1930, to a supporter of the Nazi movement living overseas, in which he noted a “great turnaround” in the public perception of Nazism. It was “astonishing how the knee-­jerk, arrogant, snobbish, or stupid rejection of the party of just a few years ago has given way to expectations and hope.” However, he added, such hope would be disappointed if they were to remain in the opposition out of principle. But in return for the party’s participating in coalition negotiations, Hitler demanded two key posts, the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of National Education. “The Ministry of the Interior is responsible for the entire administration, the personnel department, that is, the appointment and dismissal of all civil servants and the police. The Ministry of Public Education is responsible for the entire school system, from elementary schools to the University of Jena, as well as the theater system. Whoever is in possession of these two ministries and uses his power ruthlessly and persistently can achieve extraordinary things.” Hitler was thus interested not only in participating in government but in taking over the executive from within. “We will pass the first test of our mettle,” predicted Berlin gauleiter and later Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels on January 8, 1930. Hitler added that “only a National Socialist through and through with both great expertise and unconditional National Socialist convictions” could be considered as a candidate to take over the dual ministry. Fresh elections were the last thing the mainstream parties wanted, since they were sure to further strengthen the Nazi Party. Hitler believed he had found the right person in Frick, an early party supporter, the former head of the political division in the Munich police headquarters, and the acting chairman of the Nazi parliamentary group in the Reichstag, calling him “an energetic, bold, and responsible civil servant of extraordinary ability and a fanatical National Socialist!” Initially, the DVP rejected the ministerial appointment of someone who had taken part in the 1923 putsch and been convicted of high treason. “So I went to Weimar myself,” Hitler reported in the letter on February 2, “and succinctly assured the gentlemen in no uncertain terms that either Dr. Frick would become our minister, or fresh elections would be held.” Fresh elections were the last thing the mainstream parties wanted, since they were sure to further strengthen the Nazi Party. Hitler gave his prospective mainstream parties a deadline of three days, from January 10 to 13. Otherwise, he would have a motion introduced to dissolve the regional parliament. But the DVP still had its scruples. Hitler was in a strong bargaining position, however, and he furthered his cause with a speech to leading representatives of Thuringia’s business and industry associations on January 10, which made a huge impression. “In the evening, Hitler spoke to a closed circle,” a very satisfied Goebbels noted. “In front of 150 bigwigs, reeking of respectability. Hitler spoke fabulously. I’ve rarely heard him that good.” Business circles were also ramping up pressure on the DVP, and when the ultimatum expired, the party caved in. On January 23, 1930, the coalition government was confirmed in office. “Frick is now a minister in Weimar,” Goebbels recorded in his diary. “It was a difficult birth.” Frick’s party comrade Wilhelm Marschler was appointed state councillor, a position that gave him a vote in the cabinet. There was no lack of warning voices in the DVP. “It hurts my soul to see you in such company,” shouted DVP Reichstag deputy Siegfried von Kardorff to the delegates from Thuringia at the party’s conference in Mannheim in March 1930. But the fact that the DVP was doing deals with the Nazis at all showed how far the party had drifted to the right under Stresemann’s successor, Ernst Scholz. Making common cause with the National Socialists at regional level while being part of a grand coalition with the Social Democrats at Reich level was a complete contradiction. In that respect, the Thuringian experiment already foreshadowed the imminent demise of Hermann Müller’s government. Hitler demanded, “In the same vein, we will purge the teaching staff of Marxist-­democratic elements just as we will adapt the curriculum to our National Socialist beliefs and ideas.” Minister Frick did not disappoint expectations. At the third reading of the laws to enact the Young Plan in the Reichstag on March 12, 1930, he took a seat on the benches of the state representatives and made a statement of vigorous protest immediately before the final vote, railing against the “Enslavement Act,” the adoption of which would bring “the greatest national misfortune and end the independence of Germany’s regional states.” The Thuringian Ministry of State had not authorized him to make this statement. Although the DVP parliamentary group leader, Witzmann, disapproved of his unilateral action a few days later, Frick faced no consequences. Hitler had set his party colleague two tasks. As Thuringian minister of the interior, Frick was to “carry out a slow purge of the administrative and civil service from all red revolutionary elements.” There was “a great deal to do,” Hitler said, especially in policing. And as minister of national education, he was to push ahead with the “nationalization of the school system.” Hitler demanded, “In the same vein, we will purge the teaching staff of Marxist-­democratic elements just as we will adapt the curriculum to our National Socialist beliefs and ideas.” Frick set to work with great energy to remake Thuringia in this sense. In his inaugural speech to the civil servants in his two ministries, he made it clear that a “new spirit” now applied in Weimar, and that it would be fundamentally different from the “treacherous November spirit” of the German republic. On March 18, 1930, he introduced to the state parliament the draft of an enabling act intended to largely free the state government from parliamentary control for six months. The law was passed by a simple majority (28 votes to 25) on March 29. Under the guise of reforming and streamlining the administration, civil servants loyal to the republic were dismissed and replaced by followers of the NSDAP. The Reich government, however, did not stand idly by as Frick went about doing what he did. On March 18, 1930, the Social Democratic Minister of the Interior Carl Severing informed the Thuringian government that he had received news “giving rise to justified doubts as to whether the conditions for the granting of a Reich subsidy for police purposes” were still fulfilled. Thuringian State Premier Erwin Baum from the Rural League “solemnly appealed” to the Reich not to block the funds. The Nazi battle cry “Germany awaken” was intended to instill nationalism in schoolchildren. Although the new minister of the interior, Joseph Wirth of the Center Party, who had been in office since March 30, 1930, reached an agreement with the Thuringian state government in April to lift the ban on the Reich subsidy, no agreement was reached on the fundamental question of whether National Socialists should be allowed to join the police force. Frick created a fait accompli by filling the offices of the police directorates of Weimar and Gera with his allies. When Wirth then had police funds blocked again in June 1930, Baum filed a complaint with the State Court in Leipzig. The conflict between Thuringia and the Reich was settled in December 1930, when the former guaranteed the “nonpolitical conduct of individual civil servants without fail while on duty” and the latter agreed to lift the freeze on police subsidies. Frick was unperturbed by all the objections from Berlin and continued his policy of “cleansing” the civil service. Goebbels, who visited him in Weimar at the beginning of June 1930, was impressed: “He is in good spirits, has the courage of his convictions, provokes people, and behaves insolently toward the bigwigs in Berlin. A true German minister indeed.” Civil servants who were members of or close to the SPD were hit particularly hard by the staff cuts the state of Thuringia also had to make due to the precarious financial situation. Frick appointed three of his party comrades to the Ministry of Education, including the deputy gauleiter Hans Severus Ziegler, as “expert advisers.” They acted as a kind of shadow government, with access to personnel files, which they used to tar-­brush undesirables among the teaching ranks. Suspicion and denunciation became pervasive in the Thuringian administration. Parallel to his administrative and personnel purges, Frick set about to radically change the country’s cultural policy. On April 16, 1930, school prayers were reintroduced by a decree in the official gazette of the Ministry of National Education. The reason given was that “forces alien to the species and people” had long been trying to “destroy the spiritual, moral, and religious foundations of our German thinking and feeling in order to uproot the German people and thus make it easier to control us,” the decree stated. The German people could resist these pernicious influences only “if they kept the religious and moral driving forces of their nature pure and passed them on to the next generations of youth.” Three of the suggested prayers were clearly directed against the democratic constitutional order of the Weimar Republic, which was viewed as anathema to the spirit of ethnic jingoism. The second of these rhyming prayers went: Father, in your almighty hand Stand our people and fatherland You were our ancestors’ honor and strength You are our constant weapon and defense Therefore free us from betrayal and deceit Make us strong for the liberating deed Give us the Savior’s heroic bravery Let honor and freedom be our highest commodity! Let our vow and watchword be: Germany, awaken! Lord, make us free! May God make it so! The Nazi battle cry “Germany awaken” was intended to instill nationalism in schoolchildren. Frick left no doubt as to who was meant by the “forces alien to the species and people” in the state parliament in May 1930. The “prayers for freedom,” he explained, were intended to serve as a “defense against the fraud” that had been “committed against the German people by Marxism and the Jews.” The Nazis’ coalition partners offered little opposition to the mandatory bastardized school prayers, and protests from the Thuringian Teachers’ Association and the Protestant regional church were also limited. Conversely, the coalition parties shot down a motion by the SPD parliamentary group to rescind the decree. Frick did, however, lose a lawsuit filed with the Leipzig State Court. In its ruling of July 11, 1930, three particularly offensive prayers were rejected because they impinged on the “sensibilities of dissenters” and thus violated Article 148, paragraph 2, of the Reich Constitution. Before that, in February 1930, Frick had issued an injunction against Erich Maria Remarque’s famous anti-­war novel All Quiet on the Western Front, which had been published in spring 1929 and quickly become a bestseller. School boards in Thuringia were instructed to report which schools had purchased the title and which teachers had used the book in class. Further inclusion of the book in reading lists was prohibited. These regulations were in line with the views of the German Fighting League for German Culture, which had been founded in August 1927 under the leadership of the Nazi Party’s chief ideologue, Alfred Rosenberg. At its Whitsunday conference in Weimar in 1930, held under Frick’s patronage, the league demanded that the “German will to self-­defense must be hardened.” Nazi cultural watchdogs considered Remarque’s bestseller capable of impairing that “will.” The same strictures also applied to the film version of the novel. The Nazi Party, led by Goebbels as the gauleiter of the German capital, railed against the film, which premiered in Berlin in December 1930, and on December 11, the Supreme Film Board gave in to SA intimidation and banned it. “The Nazi street fighter is dictating the government’s actions,” crowed Hitler’s propaganda expert. Frick’s next serious intervention in cultural life came at the beginning of April 1930 with the decree “Against Negro Culture and for German Ethnic Identity.” In its preamble, it claimed that for years, “foreign racial influences,” capable of “undermining the moral fortitude of the German people,” had been “increasingly asserting themselves in almost all cultural areas.” It was therefore “in the interest of the preservation and strengthening of the German ethnic identity” that everything “glorifying Negroism” should be seen as “signs of decay” to be “prevented as much as possible.” The authorities were to apply the “strictest standards” and punish all theater companies that could not be regarded as “morally or artistically reliable.” This decree provided the basis for numerous bans. For example, the performance of Friedrich Wolf’s abortion drama, Cyanide, which Erwin Piscator’s Berliner Ensemble wanted to stage in Gera and Jena, was prohibited. Plays by the expressionists Ernst Toller and Walter Hasenclever also disappeared from the repertoire of state theaters. On May 22, 1930, SPD member of parliament Max Greil, a former minister of popular education, excoriated Frick in front of the Thuringian state parliament, castigating him for trying to politicize all areas of cultural life “along the lines of National Socialist Party beliefs.” Frick’s “proclamation against Negro culture,” Greil argued, was actually directed against Jews, and he demanded that Frick publicly acknowledge this fact. Contrasting Nazi cultural policy with the “classical spirit of cosmopolitanism in the sense of Goethe,” Greil said, “It is the spirit of nationalist narrow-­mindedness; it is the spirit of chauvinist warmongering.” There was hardly any resistance in Weimar to this “storming of paintings,” as it became known. In his infamous decree, Frick had announced that he had appointed the architect Paul Schultze-­Naumburg as the new director of the Vereinigte Kunstlehranstalten (College of Architecture, Fine Arts, and Crafts) in Weimar and that it was to be developed into a “center of German culture.” Schultze-­Naumburg, whom Frick had also hired as an “art consultant,” had made a name for himself as a vehement opponent of the Bauhaus and advocate of a “racially sound” German culture. His house in Saaleck near Bad Kösen, located below the castle ruins, was a popular meeting place for extreme right-­wing nationalist circles. In June 1930, Goebbels was a guest there. He was accompanied by Frick and Walther Darré, later the Nazi food minister. “The Schultze house is beautifully situated above the Saale River, wonderfully blended into the landscape, a true gem,” noted Goebbels in his diary. “I have never seen such a stylish house.” While in the town, the Berlin gauleiter did not neglect to visit the graves of Fischer and Kern, the men who had murdered Walther Rathenau. In his speech inaugurating the newly designed Vereinigte Kunstlehranstalten on November 10, 1930, Schultze-­Naumburg raged against modern art, which, he claimed, consisted “only of obscure, tortured, and distorted images and the visualization of mental and physical inferiority.” He was united with Germany’s youth, he added, in the goal of “chasing all those corrupters of and traitors to the people out of the German house, in which they have no place.” Deeds followed these words. That October, Schultze-­Naumburg had wall frescoes by Bauhaus master Oskar Schlemmer painted over in the Van de Velde building. In early November, at Frick’s behest, seventy works by modern artists, including paintings and drawings by Otto Dix, Lyonel Feininger, Wassily Kandinsky, and Paul Klee, were removed from the exhibition rooms of the Weimar Palace Museum. Frick justified this preview of the Nazis’ infamous 1937 campaign against “degenerate art” by claiming that the ostracized works had “nothing in common with Nordic-­German nature” and only “depicted eastern and other inferior subhumanity.” There was hardly any resistance in Weimar to this “storming of paintings,” as it became known. But the liberal Berlin press, including the Berliner Tageblatt, branded it for what it was: “a scandal in a cultured nation.” But even this scandal was surpassed by Frick’s most audacious coup: the appointment of the racial theorist Hans F. K. Günther as a professor at the University of Jena. In doing so, Frick was acting on Hitler’s expectations in a letter of February 2, 1930, in which the Nazi leader had envisaged the “establishment of a chair for racial issues and racial studies” in Jena as the “first step” in the desired “intellectual upheaval.” Hitler himself had suggested Günther, the author of a “racial primer of the German people,” for the position. When the university rector, church historian Karl Heussi, opposed Frick’s request, the students’ association, already dominated by National Socialist sympathizers, rebelled. Frick praised the Jena student body for having shown “more understanding for the need to create the conditions necessary for Germany’s renewal” than the professors. The only concession made to the university’s teaching staff was that the original title—­Chair of Human Civilization—­was changed to Chair of Social Anthropology. Hitler personally attended Günther’s inaugural lecture, on November 15, 1930, which was entitled “The Causes of the Racial Decline of the German People Since the Migration of Peoples.” On April 1, 1931, Frick’s time in government in Thuringia came to an abrupt end, after the DVP joined a motion of no confidence proposed by the Social Democrats and Communists. Yet it was not Frick’s actions as a minister that caused the coalition to break up, but rather the insulting remarks made by Gauleiter Sauckel in an editorial in the party newspaper Der Nationalsozialist (The National Socialist). After Frick resigned in the run-­up to the Reich presidential election in spring of 1932, it became known that he had secretly attempted to obtain German citizenship for Hitler. In it, Sauckel had belittled representatives of the DVP as “foolish old men, traitors, and swindlers,” who “in their bottomless impudence were playing a sacrilegious game with the fate of our people.” This proved too much even for a party that had endured months of Frick’s provocations. Amid considerable press attention, Hitler had traveled to Weimar the day before the vote to try to change the DVP’s mind, but his trip was in vain. In the parliamentary debate preceding the no-­confidence motion on April 1, Philipp Kallenbach of the DDP described the results of Frick’s fourteen months in government as “downright disastrous.” Kallenbach said: “Peace in our state has been destroyed. The driving force behind these administrative measures is the desire to stir up people and create a spectacle, even to encourage hatred and take one-­sided actions against broad segments of the population. To a great extent in the short time in question, all areas of public life have been politicized in the interests of the Nazi Party. To advance those ends, personnel policy has been ruthless, with allies being permitted to feed at the trough more openly and self-­evidently than ever before.” After Frick resigned in the run-­up to the Reich presidential election in spring of 1932, it became known that he had secretly attempted to obtain German citizenship for Hitler. The affair caused a sensation. A parliamentary inquiry, chaired by SPD politician Hermann Brill, was formed in Weimar to investigate, and Hitler and Frick were summoned as witnesses. The picture that emerged started in the summer of 1930. With State Premier Baum away on vacation, Frick had sought to lay the groundwork for Hitler’s naturalization by appointing him gendarmerie commissioner in the town of Hildburghausen, while at the same time releasing him from all duties as a civil servant. Two ministry officials were ordered to initiate the necessary formalities under “strictest official secrecy.” The grotesque story of Frick’s attempted naturalization of Hitler quickly became the talk of the town. At a regional Nazi meeting in Gera on July 12, 1930, Frick presented Hitler with the certificate of appointment, and he confirmed receipt with his signature. Afterward, however, the Nazi leader apparently had second thoughts, worrying that the title of gendarmerie commissioner might make him look ridiculous. In any case, he tore up the document a few days later in Munich. Before the committee of inquiry, he testified that he had not wanted to accept the appointment in the first place. The grotesque story of Frick’s attempted naturalization of Hitler quickly became the talk of the town. “Lots of hounding in the press,” an annoyed Goebbels noted. “Crazy caricatures.” The affair was mocked as a “presumptuous masquerade” and a “prank.” But an editorial in the liberal Vossische Zeitung drew attention to the deadly serious underlying meaning. With his “unsuccessful push” to make Hitler a German, Frick had once again proved that the National Socialists were unwilling to abide by the law. “It would be good if the true character of this party were finally recognized outside Bavaria, where people have experienced it up close,” the paper wrote. In Thuringia, no one heeded the warning. In the state elections in late July 1932, the NSDAP emerged as the strongest party, with 42.5 percent of the vote, and Sauckel became state premier. Looking back, the Social Democratic politician, journalist, and later member of the anti-­Nazi resistance Hermann Brill described the “Frick era” in Thuringia as “one of the most important vanguard skirmishes in the great battle between democracy and dictatorship.” Indeed, during his time in office, Frick delivered a foretaste of what could be expected if the National Socialists came to power nationally. For fourteen months, Thuringia served as a laboratory in which they could try out measures they were to implement on a larger scale at Reich level three years later. In a personal letter dated April 2, 1931, Hitler thanked Frick for “placing Thuringia at the center of Germany’s national, political, and economic redevelopment.” The Nazi leader added, “We all firmly believe in the hour that will once again, this time forever, call you to serve our people in a responsible position.” And Frick was in fact rewarded with the post of Reich minister of the interior—­one of the most powerful positions in the land—­in the “cabinet of national concentration” formed on January 30, 1933, under Germany’s new chancellor, Hitler. __________________________________ Excerpted from Fateful Hours: The Collapse of the Weimar Republic.

Title: The new business deals, Zelensky, the…sea bass and the Pax Americana, how the M.M. treats Samaras, Metlen’s new acquisition and the sale of Iktinos

Hello, some thoughts on today’s anniversary of the Polytechnic uprising. Usually, all over the world, after a few years have passed from a historic event for a country, the state, the protagonists—if they are still alive—and society honor that very event with ceremonies of remembrance and respect, some tributes, but generally with peaceful demonstrations of collective memory. In Greece, 52 years later, the day of the uprising of students and other citizens against the Junta becomes an occasion to smash and wreck Athens, to destroy with paint the…martyr-like (in every sense) façade of the Polytechnic and, by the end of the day, to burn…a few shops in the center of Athens with Molotov cocktails, right in front of the eyes of thousands of stunned tourists who are still enjoying—mid-November—the blessed Greek weather. If this is what we want half a century later, let us reflect on it. But I think that the overwhelming majority of people do not want this, without it meaning that they do not honor the people who rose up then against the Junta and who either risked or lost their lives. Business and Pax Americana Beyond that, everything we have seen for the past 15 days happening in Athens regarding the geopolitical and business agreements with the USA was completed yesterday with the arrival of Zelensky, who came to sign that Ukraine will procure—via Greece—American LNG. As for the rest of what he is asking, mainly in weapons and such, I don’t think he will get it, and I think the most substantial meeting he had here yesterday was with Ambassador Guilfoyle regarding the agreement, and not only that, since of course he is very interested in the direct and effective access she has to the President of the United States. In any case, let me repeat that for the last three weeks the “American factor” has been steadily here, building deals and business agreements, and is not in Turkey, with whatever that implies. But mainly, what interests everyone is the security of the country against Turkey, which, of course, is primarily ensured by the Americans. That “I am here” which Guilfoyle said recently at the Greece Talks conference last Friday, when she was asked about the Eastern threat, is currently linked with the “Vertical Corridor,” which not only passes through Greece but is the entry gate for American natural gas into Europe. Sea bass and LNG I should tell you that the atmosphere yesterday at the Maximos Mansion was very warm, while K.M. had also planned to host Zelensky and the Ukrainian delegation. After the statements and the signing of the gas agreement, there was a lunch for the two delegations, with a menu of sea bass with greens and bouillabaisse, and I hear that Zelensky didn’t drink wine. Now, I don’t know whether he liked the sea bass, but the agreement for the supply of gas was certainly crucial for him, as winter in Ukraine is baring its teeth. This agreement was essentially the follow-up to the agreement announced at P-TEC for the AKTOR–DEPA partnership for LNG transport, and it will go into operation at the end of December. Immediate profits from LNG for AKTOR Taking the opportunity from what we said earlier, let me add an important business tip. As announced, DEPA Commercial and Naftogaz of Ukraine yesterday signed a Declaration of Intent for the supply of natural gas to the Ukrainian market for the winter period, from December 2025 to March 2026. The agreement stipulates that the transport of LNG from the USA will be carried out via “Route 1,” which has been allocated to the Transmission System Operators (TSOs). If we “translate” the announcement in business terms, it means that the interstate agreement will be executed via Atlantic-See LNG Trade (of Venture Global, AKTOR, and DEPA). Consequently, the trade of American LNG starts immediately, from mid-December, and not in 2030—something that means that AKTOR’s 60% subsidiary will already begin to produce results for its balance sheet from early 2026, since the results of Atlantic-See LNG are consolidated into those of AKTOR. In other words, the AKTOR group begins to record profits from the new activity much earlier. Kimberly and the drones As for energy matters and Greece’s decision to play the card of this agreement, do not overlook the role of Kimberly Guilfoyle, who has come to Greece with a clear agenda, which she described last Friday at Greece Talks. Let me add, parenthetically, that her interview generated a lot of discussion and she herself was satisfied because she conveyed clear messages. Beyond that, this time there was little discussion about weapons in the foreground, but something is moving in the background. For example, I do not consider it coincidental that the Chief of the Hellenic National Defense General Staff, Choupis, was present yesterday at noon at the Maximos Mansion, as he participated in the extended meeting of the delegations. The Ukrainians are definitely asking for weapons that we cannot provide, such as Patriots. But we do have some “decommissioned” Russian weapons that have not been supported for some years now. I hear that the Ukrainians have begun to put on the table the provision of Ukrainian drones to our country in return, but an agreement is still a way off. The interview on ERT Before departing for Singapore on Wednesday (he will return on Saturday), K.M. is expected, as I hear, to give an in-depth, wide-ranging interview. It will be on the morning show of ERTNews (Papachlimintzos–Douka), his first appearance on public television since the launch of the new news channel. Whether it will be Tuesday or Wednesday will likely be “locked in” today. Stamatis and Mitsotakis Yesterday, after a hard battle with cancer, Dimitris Stamatis passed away—a modest, serious, and always conciliatory politician, a close friend of Antonis Samaras. I was struck by the excerpt in Mitsotakis’ condolence statement: “…when we served together in the government under Antonis Samaras.” A similar statement was made by Skertsos, referring to his presence in the 2012–14 government: “…when we kept the country together during the difficult years under the guidance of A. Samaras and E. Venizelos.” I have the impression that the entire New Democracy party, from K.M. down to the rank-and-file members, will view Samaras in a completely opposite way from how he views them—and especially the Prime Minister. Pavlos Marinakis Pavlos Marinakis’ bill regarding ERT, the media it regulates, their long-standing pending issues, and also the rule of law, passed triumphantly through Parliament’s competent committees on Friday, and all the relevant sector bodies spoke highly of it—even those… politically opposed. Tsapanidou from SYRIZA, as well as almost the rest of the opposition, were against it, proving why these people are “elsewhere” and generally unable to understand that blanket refusal leads nowhere. METLEN submits an offer, PPC goes to London for the business plan Moving on to market news—which today I assume will shift into a different pattern after the Fitch upgrade and the news from Euronext. The week begins with significant business developments from major groups and smaller listed companies. First of all, today METLEN submits its financial offer for the acquisition of the aluminum plant in Dunkirk. If the bet pays off, the profile of the metallurgy sector for METLEN will change, with the group adding to the sector (based on last year’s results) an annual EBITDA of about €300 million and net profits of €150 million. The baton is passed on Wednesday to PPC, which is presenting in London the business plan that is said to involve investments of over €10 billion for the period 2026–2028. The focus is on whether PPC’s announcements will confirm the recent market rumors of a roughly €1 billion capital increase at €14 per share, combined with interest from BlackRock in acquiring a significant stake. Preliminary agreement between IKTINOS and a fund Since I mentioned smaller listed companies earlier, let me add that the management of IKTINOS is taking steps to leverage its assets with the goal of freeing the listed company from debt. In this context, according to information, IKTINOS is said to have reached a preliminary agreement with a foreign fund for the 2,500-acre property it owns in the Faneromeni bay in Sitia, Crete. Developments are expected immediately. National Insurance acquisition by December 5 The acquisition of 100% of National Insurance by Piraeus Bank is in its final stretch, as the Bank of Greece has granted approval and next week approval is also expected from the SSM. By December 5, based on the dates given by the authorities, the acquisition will have been completed, and the second essential chapter begins for the insurance company but also for the banks (Piraeus Bank and National Bank) in terms of bancassurance. I’m no prophet, but something tells me that this chapter will not be exhausted “from one moment to the next,” as we say. It will require a lot of groundwork both from Piraeus Bank and from the National Bank. It is a structural change that reshapes long-standing relationships with many technical and legal issues, and some time will be needed before it wraps up. Hellenic Exchanges (ATHEX) in the arms of Euronext Now regarding HELEX, which we mentioned above: last Thursday and especially Friday, individual small shareholders of HELEX showed that they are convinced by the Public Offer of Stéphane Boujnah and handed over their shares to brokerage firms, which in turn mobilized even more because of the special 0.4% commission they had on the transaction. Today at 2 p.m. the process formally closes, with the acceptance rate—according to market information—expected to exceed 55% and move toward 60%. Success is considered a given, but the column reserves judgment on the exact percentage. What is certain is that the strategy paid off: institutional investors—Greek and foreign funds that already held Euronext shares—hurried to exchange. For them, the transition was a simple administrative move without tax implications. Individuals acted on Thursday and Friday. The fact is that after the results are announced the day after tomorrow, November 19, the Athens Stock Exchange enters the pan-European network. On November 24, HELEX shares will be traded simultaneously in Amsterdam, Brussels, Lisbon, and Paris. The next chapter is the squeeze-out: Euronext will seek 90% or more so as to integrate HELEX into the group. Byte: heading for EBITDA over €10 million in the 9-month period Byte, as IDEAL presented last October during Investor Day, is transforming into the parent company for its IT investments, with subsidiaries Adacom and Bluestream. According to information, the picture of the 9-month results follows a trajectory similar to that of the first half. If we compare these figures, then we expect revenue above €75 million and EBITDA above €10 million. I hear that the company’s executives are very pleased because the gross profit margin is increasing by more than 7 points and the EBITDA margin is stabilizing at 15%, over 4% higher than last year. They also say that the contribution of projects carried out by the companies abroad is significant and represents a new pillar for future growth. IDEAL’s results on Thursday, 20/11, will likely confirm management’s expectations as presented in October. The next step is to see whether the strong results will be reflected in the share price and whether IT sector valuations will help IDEAL. Swiss-franc loans: institutionally yes… technically maybe The Ministry of National Economy and Finance is working full-time on the institutional framework for the restructuring of Swiss-franc loans, listening to the banks but clearly keeping its focus on the borrowers. The legislative framework is expected to be ready by the end of the year. However, its implementation may require a longer time. The technical aspect of implementation is not the simplest. It is therefore very likely that the platform of the out-of-court settlement mechanism will be used for the Swiss-franc loan restructurings. The adjustments required to allow both vulnerable and non-vulnerable borrowers to enter are technically complex and may require some time. Even if a new application is developed to serve this purpose, it too will need time. Giannis Mytilineos’ new companies “Sea Front Bliss I” and “Sea Front Bliss II” are the names of the two new companies founded last Friday, November 14, and are owned by businessman Giannis Mytilineos. The purpose of the two companies, headquartered in Varibombi, is—among other things—the buying and selling and management of real estate and, in particular, the construction of buildings either for own use or for exploitation in any way, or for resale, located anywhere in Greece or abroad. Also, the construction, leasing, subleasing, renovation, repair, expansion, maintenance, exploitation, management and general utilization of all kinds of properties, urban or otherwise, owned by the company or third parties; the establishment, construction, operation, management and exploitation of all types of hotels and tourist units, housing complexes, sports facilities, etc. The initial share capital totals €3,300,000, specifically €2,200,000 for “Sea Front Bliss I” and €1,100,000 for “Sea Front Bliss II,” divided into shares with a nominal value of €100 each. The sole shareholder is the Cypriot company Nioval Ltd, whose sole shareholder is Giannis Mytilineos, who, as is well known, in addition to his other activities (shipping, etc.) also owns the emblematic Tatoi Club. The management of the two newly established companies includes Anastasia Mouchlidi as Chairwoman and CEO, Elisavet Paraskeopoulou, and Mytilineos’ two daughters, Amalia and Ioli, as members. They are the same individuals, in the same roles, who staff Tatoi Residences, the company founded last March. The book of Odysseas Athanasiou On November 25, the book “Why They Succeeded – 6 States from the Shadows to the Top,” written by Lamda Development CEO Odysseas Athanasiou, is expected to be released. The head of LAMDA, who has been at the helm of the group since the late 2000s, will speak at the launch event about his book, for which he offers an initial idea of its subject, stating that it is “a personal search regarding how small countries without natural resources or power managed to rise to the top. It is not a book about economics or politics. It is a book about how the right choices and faith in people can change a country’s future.” The presentation will take place on Tuesday, 2/12/25, at the National Gallery, and speaking about Athanasiou’s writing project will be the Governor of the Bank of Greece, Yiannis Stournaras, and EKPA professor Maria Efthymiou. A Thessalonian at the World Bank The information comes from reliable sources, although for now there is no official announcement. Antonis Kamaras, a scholar from Thessaloniki with a rich academic and professional background, will be Greece’s representative at the World Bank. It is a position held from 2013 to 2021 by Christos Papoutsis (former minister and European Commissioner under PASOK), and from early 2021 by a woman for the first time, economist Eleni Panagiotarea (daughter of journalist Anna Panagiotarea). For the past year, the position had remained vacant. Now it is being taken up by Antonis Kamaras, who studied at Connecticut College and the London School of Economics and has worked professionally as a consultant at the National Bank of Greece and the Municipality of Thessaloniki. He is a researcher at ELIAMEP and a founding member of the Greek Diaspora Project at SEESOX (Oxford). The…crazy regulation that favors high-speed ships over conventional ones A puzzle remains regarding how ferry routes are scheduled. Today two different rules apply: conventional ships must operate all year round, while high-speed vessels can operate for at least four months. However, the market picture has changed radically: 12 years ago there were just 13 high-speed vessels; today there are 34. This has two consequences:a) Huge fluctuations in prices. On routes with competition, ticket prices can fall to €0.60/mile, while as soon as competition disappears they rise to €3.25/mile.b) Conventional ships, which are obliged to operate in winter, are financially squeezed in summer by the high-speed vessels and struggle to make the year viable. The Competition Commission notes that if this asymmetry continues, there is a risk that winter routes will be reduced, something that would harm the cohesion of the islands. Silent Chinese wave at the Port of Piraeus The US and China may have temporarily buried the hatchet in their business-trade war, but each continues to keep a close eye on the other. The news that the Americans are planning a strategic investment to create an alternative commercial corridor to counter COSCO and the Port of Piraeus—by promoting Elefsina—did not go unnoticed in Beijing. At Greece’s main port, a plan has long been sitting in the drawers: the construction of a fourth pier, in the space between the car terminal and Pier I. This project is not part of COSCO’s mandatory commitments. Piraeus, due to the large volumes it handles, is running out of vital space, approaching its ceiling of 5.5 million TEUs. A fourth pier would give the Chinese operators the ability to increase container throughput by at least one million TEUs. However, without the authorities’ green light, the Chinese cannot move forward, so they are keeping a wait-and-see stance, monitoring developments. “There’s a certain silence,” people from the port told me. Greek shipping at full throttle Greek shipping groups continue to sweep both the shipyards and the secondhand market. On the newbuilding front, Thenamaris (Nikolas Martinou), StealthGas (Harry Vafias), Venergy (Byron Vasileiadis), and Akrotiri Tankers (Marielena Prokopiou & Konstantinos Lampsias) led the way with fresh tanker orders, investing in modern, scrubber-fitted vessels—an indication that the major players are looking long-term and betting on cleaner, more efficient shipping. Meanwhile, Costamare and Latsco remain active in containerships, strengthening their presence in East Asian shipyards. In the secondhand market, Greek activity was visible on both the buying and selling sides, especially in dry bulk. Aegean Bulk stood out by selling the Supramax Anemos (2011), while another Greek group acquired the Isolda D (Handysize, 2011). Overall, over the last twelve months Greek shipowners have signed 43 new tanker orders, 6 bulk carrier orders, and conducted 41 tanker acquisitions and 98 bulker purchases in the resale market. Greece thus comfortably maintains its global lead in S&P activity. Trek enters the Athens Exchange Alternative Market Today marks the start of trading for Trek Development on the ASE Alternative Market. The Papapolyzos family company is active in infrastructure project development and construction, with a focus on energy, environment, water management, and Smart City applications. After 30 years of operations, the company is moving to its next phase, planning an investment program of €4.6 million, financed by €1.9 million from the listing and €2.7 million from internal funds and projected profits for 2025–2027. About 30% of the plan concerns organic growth—primarily staffing and upgrading the operations of its Munich subsidiary—while 70% will go toward acquiring specialized companies in Greece and the EU. Four stocks looking for new highs The Titan share has been unstoppable for the past five sessions, rallying from €40 to nearly €44 and inching closer to its record of €45.8. The driver is the cement group’s four-year plan, involving investments up to €4 billion and EBITDA of €1 billion by 2029. Also on the table is the acquisition of the French company Vracs De L’Estuaire, with Titan in exclusive talks. Analysts reinforce the positive mood: Citi has set a target price of €56.1, S&P upgraded Titan’s rating to BB+, and Fitch raised its outlook to positive. Motor Oil exceeded €28 intraday over the last two sessions, closing just below that mark. With six consecutive gains, the stock would hit a new all-time high with an additional 2.2% rise. It’s a remarkable comeback for a share that had dropped below €20 seven months ago, with the interim dividend of €0.35 providing momentum. Viohalco remains in the spotlight, hitting a new high and approaching €10. Its subsidiary ElvalHalcor is following suit, extending its multi-year high and aiming to reach €3.5 for the first time since November 2007. A new era for EY Greece, in a historic Thessaloniki landmark The historic Matarasso–Altshech building—one of Thessaloniki’s most iconic Art Deco structures—will now house EY Greece’s administrative base in the city. Designed in the 1930s by architect Moshe Kazis, and once home to the Athens Stock Exchange’s local branch, the building has been transformed into a modern, flexible, and inclusive workspace while preserving its original identity. The renovation respected the building’s historic architecture, retaining signature elements of the era while adapting the space to the needs of a modern international consulting organization. The new facilities will host teams serving clients across sectors from finance to technology. On 22–23 November, the public will be able to take a look inside as part of EY’s Open House. A flood of money in the markets The terms are Money Supply M2 and M3, referring to the total money circulating in an economy at a given moment. Globally, this money stock reached $142 trillion in September 2025—an all-time record that reveals a fundamental shift in the world economy. The +9.1% increase in 2025 alone represents around $12 trillion. Over the past 25 years (since 2000), global money supply has grown at an average 7% CAGR, with only brief pauses during the 2008 crisis and the 2020 pandemic. After each crisis, the rebound was rapid and monetary expansion even stronger. Central banks face a dilemma: interest rate hikes since 2022 should have restricted liquidity, yet money supply continues to expand. The 2025 depreciation of the US dollar is the hidden key: as money loses value, investors are forced to shift into assets that protect against inflation. Capital seeks refuge from devaluation—and investing becomes not a choice, but a survival necessity for capital. Explore related questions

Title: Bitcoin: November 2025 turns historic – For all the wrong reasons

Analyzing why Bitcoin is at risk of the biggest ETF outflows ever. Bitcoin is facing its second-biggest ETF outflows since its launch, and could set a new record. It was unlikely that the price of Bitcoin could reverse the losses incurred in November if it ends in red. Bitcoin [BTC] slipped below the $100,000 mark and continued to trade below it as Bitcoin ETFs and quarterly returns followed the drain. In the meantime, the entire crypto market rose slightly by less than a percent while the Fear & Greed Index hit 17, dipping to extreme fear levels. Currently, the market seems to be heading towards its worst-ever month in terms of BTC ETF outflows and quarterly returns. As per data from SosoValue, Bitcoin ETFs were seeing the second-biggest outflow in 2025, which was at $2.33 billion while the month was still midway. Similar outflows through the remaining weeks would see November hit a new record. This year’s February had the biggest ETF outflows, which almost hit $4 billion. However, given that Bitcoin has now entered a discount zone after falling below $100K, the outflows could potentially reverse. Source: SosoValue The outflows have stemmed from the overall weakness seen in the market, with BTC’s price also facing a similar fate. Particularly, BlackRock, Grayscale, Bitwise, and Fidelity led outflows in the past 24 hours, as per CoinGlass data. BlackRock saw more than 4.65K BTC in outflows, contributing to more than 94% of the total 4.94K BTC on the day. Bitcoin continued to struggle in terms of quarterly returns, as did Ethereum [ETH], which reflected a general market weakness. Since 2018, when BTC lost more than 42% in the last quarter, this year’s quarter has come the closest. However, this quarter’s loss still represents about a third of that of 2018. Other years were 2022 and 2019, which lost about 14.75% and 13.54%, respectively, as per CoinGlass data. Source: CoinGlass Ethereum was also seeing its worst returns since 2019. The returns were a reflection of the lost confidence among traders in the crypto sector. Historical data indicated that every red November was followed by a similar December, making it unlikely for BTC to reverse this sentiment. The pattern was evident in 2018, 2019, 2021, and 2022, which were red in the last two months of the year. On the charts, BTC price slipped below a 15-month trendline support, as per Trader Tardigrade’s analysis on X (formerly Twitter). This further stressed the weakness of Bitcoin and its products, like ETFs. Reclaiming the support level would be very bullish for BTC, while the reverse would extend losses. The next area of interest on the downside is around $80K, while on the upside, it is sitting at $126K. Source: Trader Tardigrade Notably, only a change in crypto market sentiment would change the current downtrend in price action, returns, and BTC ETF flows. November was headed to be the biggest with outflows if the current trend stayed. However, given that prices had been declining for over a month and were at significant discounts, there was still potential for a rebound.

Title: Ireland reminded naysayers they haven’t gone away with dismantling of Australia

Oh ye of little faith. For three weeks, on and off the record, coaches and players alike had been telling us they had a performance like this in the making. And on a squally Saturday night in a packed Aviva, so a record win over Australia came to pass. This was a well-timed reminder to themselves, the world of punditry and the supporters that Ireland remain a very good side. “That’s a given for me,” maintained Andy Farrell, who was critical of the previous two displays but never lost faith in his team’s ability. “We’re a very good side. There’s no doubt about that. You could put in all sorts of reasons of why the first performance or the second performance or whatever, but that’s never been in doubt, in my mind anyway.” Breaking free, in some respects from their own shackles, Ireland shot out of the blocks and then finished with a flourish, the replacements contributing to a true squad effort. They bookended the game with a Mack Hansen hat-trick in the first half-hour and another three tries in an expressive and clinical last 10 minutes. “Sometimes you prepare really well and it doesn’t transfer,” reflected Farrell. “We had an unbelievable warm-up out there today and I was going, ‘wow, if Carlsberg could do warm-ups, that would be it. But that doesn’t transfer either sometimes. I’ve seen unbelievably rubbish warm-ups and seen teams play well. So, it’s nice that we prepare well and we’ve got a performance on the back of it.” There was also the palpable ripple effects of the international football team’s memorable night last Thursday. “Yeah, it was class,” said Jack Conan of Ireland’s 2-0 win over Portugal – and this was before Sunday’s extraordinary events in Budapest. “A few of the lads went who weren’t involved and everyone’s kind of jealous that they went and a lot of us didn’t go, but it was on in the team room and we were loving it. “You looked at Thursday night and the atmosphere here and it was class. You know, Aaron Rowe singing Amhrán na bhFiann, which was brilliant and the lads would know him quite well. We were loving that and even just the performance and the doggedness of how the lads played on Thursday night was unreal,” added Conan. “We loved it and yeah, we talked about riding that wave of momentum.” The same can be said of the coming week and surfing an even bigger wave in the light of the Republic of Ireland’s dramatic 3-2 win in Budapest, as Farrell’s team prepare to welcome the all-conquering, multi-faceted South Africa. After their ominous 14-man win over France in Paris, Rassie Erasmus rested most of his frontliners for Saturday’s imperious 32-14 win over Italy in Turin, again achieved despite playing the majority of the game with 14 men. They arrive as the world’s number one side and back-to-back world champions. “Yeah, it’s great,” said Farrell of a perfectly scripted finale to the Autumn Nations Series and at an ideal kick-off time, 5.40pm, next Saturday. “It’s a fantastic place to be, isn’t it? The best in the world, everyone’s talking about them and the type of rugby that they’re playing. A rich vein of form and rightly so. They’ve played some brilliant stuff. “It’s a fantastic way to finish off our autumn. The last game at the Aviva. We’ll certainly enjoy this win, but the lads will be back on task and they’ll know what it means to everyone in Irish rugby as well, so we’ll look forward to that.” Yet again, all Farrell’s selection hunches were vindicated, not least Hansen at full-back. He completed only the second first-half hat-trick of tries by an Irish player in Test history. The first to do it was Eugene Davy in 1930, in a 14-11 win over Scotland at Murrayfield. [ ‘The worst team in Wallabies history’: Australian media show displeasure at Ireland defeatOpens in new window ] “Well, he gets rugby,” said Farrell of Hansen. “He can make a difference within the game. And also he’s got a good feel in the backfield. He understands the depth perception and all of that. He’s obviously very good in the air and in conditions like that, it’s always going to help any team. “He’s always been very good in the air. His skillset lends it to being that. He’s been brought up playing 10, 15 and wing. That’s why he’s such a nice player to watch.” It helped that the lineout delivered a perfect 10 and the Paddy McCarthy-infused scrum was potent, with Dan Sheehan and Caelan Doris delivering big games in a strong Irish pack. The confidence to stay positive, to keep trying things even after the inevitable mistakes on such a greasy surface and on such a wet and windy night, in many ways emanated from the calmness and inventiveness of Sam Prendergast. Here, in tandem with Jamison Gibson-Park, who seems somehow to be playing at 100 miles an hour while in cruise control, Prendergast was the orchestrator in chief of the Irish game. As well as his easy-on-the-eye control and array of passes, he and Gibson-Park terrorised the Wallabies back three, and particularly Max Jorgensen, with their aerial bombardment and variety of kicks. The reconfigured backrow, with Doris at seven for the first 50 minutes, perhaps had one eye on the Springboks. The same may also be said for playing Gibson-Park at fullback for the last 10 minutes in considering a 6-2 bench split. Gibson-Park applied the coup de grace with a cross-kick for Robbie Henshaw to score Ireland’s sixth try with the last play. “He’s going to start at seven next week,” quipped Farrell. “He was playing touch rugby and just enjoying himself. He’s just enjoying himself. He’s tough, strong as well.

Title: Google union organizer on AI job impact, working conditions

AI advocates typically respond to concerns about job loss with reassurances that AI will ultimately create more jobs. They also assert that if AI displaces jobs, organizations will upskill workers for new, more valuable jobs or train them enough on AI to remain employable in the AI-driven workplace of the future. That case faced setbacks in the past two months as evidence mounted that AI is already destroying jobs. Amazon announced it was laying off 14,000 corporate workers so it can be more nimble. The cuts weren't portrayed as directly resulting from AI, but in June, CEO Andy Jassy said Amazon's workforce would shrink as the company embraces AI. Target and UPS announced similar layoffs. But the reductions most explicitly caused by AI were at software vendors, including Salesforce, which said in September it would cut 4,000 customer support jobs. Earlier in the year, CEO Marc Benioff said AI was already doing nearly half the work in the department. The loudest voices on AI's impact on jobs tend to be executives at vendors that make AI software or their biggest customers. Skeptics are harder to find. In this episode of Enterprise Apps Unpacked, Shannon Wait, a senior organizer at the Alphabet Workers Union (AWU), discusses the issue from the tech worker's point of view. Her job has mostly involved advocating for the rights of the workers who labor behind the scenes to make AI possible, which she details in the podcast. She also explains how those same workers are increasingly worried about losing their jobs to automation through AI. "When people think about AI, they think innovation and curing cancer," Wait said. "We're going to move America into a new age and try to beat China in this race. Those are the talking points, when in reality the talking points should be the layoffs and job losses. We're streamlining shopping through ChatGPT instead of curing cancer." Wait made international news in 2021 when the AWU, part of the Communications Workers of America (CWA), filed an unfair labor practices action on her behalf against Alphabet, Google's parent company, and Modis, the contractor that had employed her since 2019 at a Google data center in South Carolina. Wait noticed the pay and advancement opportunities of contractors weren't comparable to those of Google employees at the same facility. Nor were the working conditions. The contract workers' jobs involved difficult physical labor, such as swapping out server hard drives and heavy batteries in hot data centers that could hit 85 degrees. After a series of unmet promises, minimal responses to complaints about unfit conditions and other disappointments from her employer, Wait accidentally broke her company-issued water bottle and was refused a replacement. It was the last straw. She complained and was escorted out of the building. So she immediately invited coworkers to join the AWU but was suspended with pay. The union action succeeded, Google and Modis settled, and Wait was back at work within two weeks. Her victory garnered widespread press coverage. The BBC posted an article on its website titled "The woman who took on Google and won." Google, which the workers had accused of discouraging unionization, signed a document saying employees had the right to discuss pay and working conditions. Since then, Wait has been a full-time advocate for the union. Much of her work has focused on the plight of raters, whose job is to evaluate the quality as well as the accuracy of webpages and search results to help improve Google's algorithms and AI. In a recent survey, some raters said they know they're training new AI that is meant to replace them. Some have been subjected to automatic suspension by "robo-bosses" for not meeting certain quotas and must go through a long process with a human to get reinstated. "You would think that these companies would want the people working on AI to have feedback on how to do better and be given clear metrics on how to make these tools safer and easier to use," Wait said. "Instead, you're just an outlier -- you're suspended -- hope you get re-onboarded at some point in the future. I just don't think that's a good way to do business in any part of the world." Wait volunteers as policy advisor for the TechEquity collaborative, which partnered this year with the AWU-CWA to publish a report titled "Ghost workers in the AI machine: U.S. data workers speak out about big tech's exploitation," which surveyed raters and other workers in behind-the-scenes roles at AI providers. Other topics discussed in the podcast include the following: David Essex is an industry editor who covers enterprise applications, emerging technology and market trends, and creates in-depth content for several TechTarget websites.

Title: Amazon’s LORD OF THE RING MMORPG Reportedly Cancelled After Massive Layoffs

For fans dreaming of returning to Middle-earth in a new, next-gen adventure, the news isn’t good. Amazon’s ambitious Lord of the Rings MMORPG, which had been in development since early 2023, has reportedly been cancelled. The project was meant to bring players back into Tolkien’s world with a fresh, modern spin, but development apparently stopped in October 2025. The report comes from Bloomberg, which revealed that Amazon began cutting roughly 14,000 jobs across the company in late October. Among those affected were many employees from Amazon Games, the publisher behind the long-awaited Lord of the Rings MMO. The cuts hit multiple divisions, but one key detail came from Ashleigh Amrine, a former Senior Gameplay Engineer, who confirmed on LinkedIn that she was among those laid off—and that the Middle-earth project was shelved. Amrine shared a bittersweet note: “Y’all would have loved it.” Amazon Games has been around since 2012, focusing primarily on publishing original titles. That focus seems to be shifting. In a memo released on October 28, 2025, the company cited “significant role reductions” at Amazon Games and outlined plans to concentrate more on its cloud gaming platform, Luna. The service primarily hosts existing titles, meaning fewer in-house game developments like the cancelled Lord of the Rings MMORPG. Despite the major shakeup, Amazon Games will continue work on March of Giants, a new Tomb Raider title, and other “casual and AI-focused games.” Still, losing such a massive and promising project sucks, not just for Amazon’s team, but for fans of Tolkien’s world who’ve been waiting for a new multiplayer experience since The Lord of the Rings Online launched back in 2007. That game, published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, remains beloved but very dated by today’s standards. The cancelled MMO could have been the perfect way to bring players back to a living, breathing Middle-earth with updated visuals, gameplay, and storytelling inspired by The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings novels. The cancellation is a lost opportunity for synergy. With Amazon already heavily invested in Tolkien’s universe through The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, the MMORPG could have expanded on that world, offering fans a chance to explore events from before the Third Age—when Sauron’s power still loomed large and the One Ring had yet to be destroyed in Mount Doom. Unfortunately, that vision won’t be realized anytime soon. While there are still plenty of older Lord of the Rings games to revisit, it may be a long wait before another studio takes up the challenge of creating a new MMORPG set in Middle-earth. For now, it’s a somber end to what could have been a truly epic return to one of fantasy’s most iconic worlds.

A Wealth of Common Sense Posted November 16, 2025 by Ben Carlson Michael and I were out in Las Vegas last week to put on a live Animal Spirits at the annual FPA conference. It was a fun trip. We ate some good food, had some fancy cocktails, played some blackjack and talked some artificial intelligence with a few hundred financial advisors. On stage we did a deep dive into what’s going on with the biggest companies in the world and their push for AI supremacy. You can listen to the audio from the podcast here: If you weren’t one of the lucky people in the MGM conference center that day I thought it would be useful to provide some of the slides we covered in our presentation. First up we talked about the shift from investing in intangible to tangible assets by the big tech firms using Meta’s new Hyperion data center as an example: These companies believe AI is worth the investment but this is a risk and a change to their business models. Spending from the hyperscalers continues to go up, up and away: How long will stock market investors allow this? The companies spending money are getting the benefit of the doubt that this will all pay off. I do wonder when the market will want to see a big ROI on this spend. The sheer size of these companies is astounding: The Mag 7 stocks are now as big as the bottom 449 stocks in the S&P 500 combined. It seems we’ve entered the new normal of stock market concentration: At least for now. One of the reasons for this is that fundamentals are matching the stock price gains: Nvidia is now the biggest company in the U.S. stock market but the fundamental growth has exceeded the price growth since the release of ChatGPT. Analysts expect the growth to continue: Is it possible for a $5 trillion company to grow at these insane levels for this long? We shall see. Here’s a real face-blower for you: Apple and Nvidia alone are now worth nearly as much as the health care and consumer staples sectors combined. Here’s another one for you — the market cap of the Mag 7 stocks is now the same size as the energy, materials, consumer staples, health care, financials, utilities and real estate sectors combined. There have been instances of stock market concentration in the past. But we’ve never had corporations this efficient before. If you take this efficiency into account by adjusting valuations for the changes in margins, the market doesn’t appear as expensive as you might think: One of the biggest questions of the AI boom is how much the other companies that aren’t making these investments will benefit. Outside of tech, the margins are much smaller: Will AI improve productivity enough for some of these other companies to increase their margins? That would be something. And finally — the question everyone wants to know — will this end badly for these huge companies? The Mag 7 is no stranger to crashes this decade: When the expectations get out of whack will we see some or all of these stocks crash? And what does a crash look like? A 20% decline is nothing. Meta is down more than 20% from the highs right now: Are we looking at a 40% crash? 50% or more? Would an AI bubble popping offer a wonderful buying opportunity because these companies are still better at what they do than everyone else? Or what if these companies see a payoff sooner than we think and the gigantic crash never comes? I have three words to sum up my conclusion on the matter: I. Don’t. Know. If anyone tells you they know how this will play out they have a horrible case of hubris or just want their investment stance to be proven right. I remain open to a wide range of outcomes on the matter.

Title: AI Companies Are Treating Their Workers Like Human Garbage, Which May Be a Sign of Things to Come for the Rest of Us

By Joe Wilkins Published Nov 16, 2025 9:00 AM EST In today’s economy, tech companies are red hot. In fact, the companies burning cash on AI seem to be some of the only ones having a truly great time, as the corporate rate of profit plummets throughout the US and recession fears loom. Though one economist estimates tech companies accounted for 92 percent of US GDP growth in the first half of 2025, you wouldn’t know it by looking at their staff rosters — which seem to be plummeting at an alarming rate. Amazon, for example, recently laid off 14,000 corporate employees, despite posting billions in profits across numerous lines of business. Across the month of October, tech workers made up the highest number of layoffs in any industry, leading the charge in one of the worst single months for furloughs since 2003. That’s bad news, of course, but it also directly contradicts the AI industry’s promises of — in the words of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman — ushering in “a world in which humanity flourishes to a degree that is probably impossible for any of us to fully visualize yet.” Sadly, as Business Insider reports, the bloodbath is far from over. On Tuesday, the AI grading company Mercor — which has massive contracts with corporations like OpenAI and Anthropic — suddenly announced it was shuttering a huge project with Meta, leaving workers scrambling. The Meta Project, called Musen, employed some 5,000 data labelers at its peak, and was previously expected to last until at least 2026, according to BI. “They kept stressing how happy the client was and how it got extended until the end of the year,” one contractor told the publication. “So to then do this major switch up before the holidays took everyone by surprise.” Luckily for those workers, Mercor is offering to hire them back — just not for Musen. Instead, they’ll have the opportunity work on an extremely similar project named “Nova.” The main difference, it seems, is the wage offered: while Musen’s base contract was $21 an hour, Nova’s opens at $16. Two tech workers offered a Nova contract said the offer email explained the difference in pay is due to “steadier task volumes across multimedia content” and “higher hour caps, enabling greater weekly engagement.” In other words, data labelers — who already had a bum deal as stable jobs become temporary contract work — get to work more for less pay. One employee who accepted a contract to work on Nova told BI the work is functionally the same, “but for $5 less an hour.” “It sounds like most of us are in the same boat,” the worker added. “We wanted to boycott this but are not in a financial place to do so. We needed to have the guaranteed income, even if it’s demoralizing.” The whole episode underscores the false promises beneath the AI boom: jobs are being degraded, the number of “freelance workers” is soaring, AI-generated profit is almost nonexistent, and rising tides on Wall Street certainly aren’t raising all boats. If this is how the most powerful companies in the world are treating workers now, why would the AI “utopia,” as Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella calls it, be any different? What’s more, if the companies on the cutting edge of a supposed “technological revolution” can’t be expected to take care of their employees, what hope do the rest of us have?

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It's been a few weeks since Amazon announced plans to cut 14,000 corporate jobs, but many laid-off employees are still coming to terms with it. While the original announcement cited a need to be leaner in the age of AI, CEO Andy Jassy later said, "It's about culture." Business Insider spoke with six former Amazon employees who lost their jobs in the latest round of layoffs. One was an anonymous single parent who said they'd just moved to Seattle in June due to the company's return-to-office mandate — only to be laid off. Another, an anonymous former product manager, said he got wind of the layoff timing and set his alarm for 3 a.m. that day to check his email. The unexpected nature of the layoffs — and the tough job market — are among the factors making it harder for some workers to move on. Here is a selection of their responses, lightly edited for length and clarity. Iren Azra Zou: Software engineer, 27, based in New Jersey. Employed at Amazon for roughly one year. I woke up to a 6 a.m. automated text from Amazon telling me to check my email for a message about my role. When I tried to log in to my work account, I received authorization denied errors. At that moment, I was pretty sure I had been laid off. John Paul Martinez: Technical support engineer, 35, based in Orlando. Employed at Amazon for over three years. I received an email at 5 a.m. EST from HR advising that I'd been laid off. James Hwang: IT support engineer, 27, based in Michigan. Employed at Amazon for roughly four years. I got an automated text message from Amazon telling me to check my personal email before clocking in, and then I saw an email from HR. I was home at the time. Joanelle Cobos: Design manager, 37, based in Las Vegas. Employed at Amazon for roughly four years. I was at home getting ready to head to the office, and I happened to notice two text messages from Amazon that looked like spam, asking me to click a link or check my email. Since I didn't trust the texts, I went to my work laptop and signed in, only to be met with a message saying that my account had been disabled. At this point, I was already guessing that my position had been eliminated. Zou: There were rumors the day before that something big was coming. I had a strange feeling in my gut that I might be one of them, even though I was performing well — I had met my goals earlier than expected. This wasn't the first time budget cuts had affected me in my career, and I know how, in these situations, people can become numbers on a spreadsheet. So I was surprised — but also not surprised. Martinez: Extremely surprised, since we were not given any indication of this massive layoff, and we are heading into the holidays. Hwang: Very surprised. I was a high performer who did a lot for our organization, and IT employees had been safe in the last couple of rounds of layoffs. There's a lot of work to do, and we were already low on team members Cobos: Not terribly. I was hired in December 2021, and my tenure had been plagued by whispers of voluntary resignation programs and RIFs, basically once a year. This is also my third layoff since 2019 and my fourth in my career, so I plan my life around the very real possibility of being laid off. Business Insider has heard from dozens of workers about how corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and hiring slowdowns have affected their careers.

Read more on the topic: Zou: My husband was next to me in bed and awake, so he was the first person I told. After that, I messaged a few close coworkers as we tried to figure out who else had been affected. When I learned that some literal rock stars on my team also got laid off, I was shocked. Martinez: I reached out to my colleague, who worked with me in the same capacity at Amazon, to see if she had also received the email or if this was a joke or a complete misunderstanding. Hwang: My wife and my parents. Cobos: My mother, sisters, and I have a group chat. I sent them a message once I had confirmed everything and read through my announcement letter. They were surprised. Zou: I made it a point to stick to my daily routines: coffee, exercise, my sleep schedule. I didn't want everything to feel chaotic. I think I built some Legos, talked to friends and coworkers, and read a book. I just gave myself space to process. Martinez: I broke down crying, not understanding what had occurred that morning. I started to think about all the expenses — mortgage, car payment, credit cards, and my father's medical bills. Hwang: I just processed what happened and looked over my résumé. Cobos: I spent that evening at home enjoying myself. The idea of having so much free time ahead of me, even with the need to find new employment, is exciting. Zou: I'm already looking for new opportunities. I'm not rushing, though — I want to find a good fit. I'm leaning toward a smaller company where there's less bureaucracy and more space to contribute and see the impact of my work. Martinez: I have been actively searching for employment. However, due to the massive layoffs at Amazon and other corporations, I am extremely fearful of the competition. Hwang: I have been looking for a new role in cloud support or it system engineering. Cobos: I'm looking into starting my own small business that can potentially provide income while I'm unemployed and additional income once I find new full time employment. I'm not in a rush to jump into another corporate job, even though that's where the best income is. Ideally, I'd like to take a lower-stress, lower-paying job with good health benefits and bridge the financial gap with income from my own business. Zou: You can't help but ask yourself, "Why me?" But eventually you come to terms with the reality that you can do everything right and still be included in a layoff simply because you're a number on a budget sheet. I know I worked hard and brought a lot to the table. A layoff doesn't erase that, and I'm not going to let it make me question my value. Now, I see the layoff as a turning point. It helped me clarify what I want in my next role: more ownership, clearer growth, and a healthier environment. It's still a difficult experience, but I'm feeling more grounded and optimistic as time goes on. Martinez: My feelings have not changed. I think Amazon has done a poor job of communicating with everyone regarding our benefits, stock options, severance package, and job placement assistance. Hwang: It's been a shock. The current job market has been crazy hard. I already applied to 100 jobs and haven't gotten any interviews yet, so I'm concerned, but I have to keep going. Cobos: My feelings on the layoff haven't changed. I'm not a fan of how it was handled, but I'm honestly excited for the time and opportunity to reexamine what I want to do and explore my options. This layoff has forced me to take time to reflect. Jump to

Title: Apple is ramping up succession plans for CEO Tim Cook and may tap this hardware exec to take over, report says
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/11/15/apple-succession-plans-ceo-tim-cook-exec-ai-investment-tech/
Time Published: 2025-11-15T20:07:18Z
Full Content:
Apple’s board of directors and senior executives have been accelerating succession plans for Tim Cook, sources told the Financial Times. After serving as CEO for 14 years, Cook may step down as early as next year, the report said. Apple’s senior vice president of hardware engineering, 50-year-old John Ternus, is widely seen as the most likely successor, but no final decisions have been made yet, sources told the FT. The engineer joined Apple’s product design team in 2001 and has overseen hardware engineering for most major products the tech company has launched ever since, according to Ternus’ LinkedIn profile. He has also played a prominent role during Apple’s most recent keynotes, introducing products like the new iPhone Air. Ternus had been rumored to be Cook’s potential successor, according to previous reports. The company is unlikely to name a new CEO before its next earnings report in late January, and an early-year announcement would allow a new leadership team time to settle in before its annual events, the FT said. The succession preparations have been long-planned and are not related to the company’s current performance, which is expecting strong end-of-year sales, people close to Apple told the FT. Apple did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment and declined to provide a comment to the FT. The $4 trillion company is expecting year-on-year revenue growth of 10% to 12% for its holiday quarter ending in December, fueled by the release of the iPhone 17 model in September. Ternus would take the helm of the tech giant at an important time in its evolution. Although Apple has seen sales success with iPhones and new products like Airpods over the past couple of decades, it has struggled to break into AI and keep up with rivals. Instead, Apple has even spending significantly less in AI investments compared to Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft. Apple has been criticized by analysts this year for not having a clear AI strategy. And despite approving a multibillion-dollar budget to run its own models via the cloud in 2026, it was reported in June that Apple is even considering using models from OpenAI and Anthropic to power its updated version of Siri, rather than using technology the company has built in-house. Its AI-enabled Siri, originally slated for 2025, will be delayed until 2026 or later due to a series of technical challenges, the company announced earlier this year. Apple has also lost a number of senior AI team members since January, many of whom have joined Meta’s AI and Superintelligence Labs during talent poaching wars this year. The exodus of Apple’s AI execs included Ruoming Pang, former head of Apple’s foundation models and core generative AI team, who joined Meta with a compensation package reportedly worth $200 million. The company is also dealing with increased competition from one of its most influential former employees. In May, Sam Altman’s OpenAI acquired startup io for about $6.5 billion, bringing in former Apple chief designer Jony Ive to build AI devices. The 58-year-old designer was instrumental in creating the iPhone, iPod, and iPad. Cook, Apple’s former operations chief, turned 65 this month. He has grown the company’s market capitalization to $4 trillion from $350 billion in 2011, when he took over the CEO role from company co-founder Steve Jobs. Under Cook, Apple became the first publicly traded company to reach $1 trillion in market capitalization in 2018—then it became the first company to reach $3 trillion in market cap in 2022. But more recently, its stock price has been lagging behind Big Tech rivals Alphabet, Nvidia, and Microsoft, though Apple is trading close to an all-time high after strong earnings were reported in October. Apple has also dealt with tariff complications as U.S.-China trade tensions have disrupted its supply chain. Cook has previously said he’d prefer an internal candidate to replace him, adding that the company has “very detailed succession plans.” “I really want the person to come from within Apple,” Cook told singer Dua Lipa last year on her podcastAt Your Service.

Title: Former ‘Good Morning America’ Host Joan Lunden on Distrust of the Media and AI Deepfakes: ‘A Really Sad State of Affairs’
URL: https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/joan-lunden-ai-deepfake-news-trust-good-morning-america-1236581678/
Time Published: 2025-11-15T16:30:00Z
Full Content:
By Antonio Ferme Joan Lunden, the veteran journalist who co-anchored “Good Morning America” from 1980 to 1997, doesn’t mince her concerns about the current media landscape. “I think it’s a really sad state of affairs that a very big segment of the American population doesn’t know what to believe anymore,” Lunden told Variety earlier this month at 50th anniversary celebration of “GMA.’ “There’s so much fake news, videos, pictures. They don’t know whether it’s really you. That part of it makes me incredibly sad and upset. I don’t know if we can put the toothpaste back in the tube.” Related Stories 'Adults' Renewed for Season 2 at FX 'Snowfall' Spinoff Ordered to Series at FX While “GMA” remains a reliable ratings performer for ABC, more Americans are now getting their news from social media platforms. About half of Americans say they struggle to tell what’s true or not when they get news, according to a recent report from Pew Research Center. That confusion mirrors a broader collapse in trust in both news organizations and social platforms — a decline seen across political parties and age groups. Popular on Variety “I wish somehow we could right that ship,” Lunden said. “But with AI, I think we’re going to see losses of jobs in media, just like we’re seeing them in Amazon and everywhere else.” [Amazon CEO Andy Jassy attributed this year’s extensive layoffs to the company’s increased rollout of ‘generative AI and agents.’] After pausing for a moment, Lunden added, “But you know what? They can’t replace a host sitting there in that chair, saying good morning to you in the morning. There’s nothing that can be said for the chemistry of two people on the air.”Outside of AI-generated deepfakes, Lunden was also quick to acknowledge how she’s benefited from the new technologies ushered in since leaving “GMA” in 1997. She recalls feeling siloed from the audience she once greeted at every sunrise.“The hardest part of leaving was disconnecting from the American audience,” she said. “Because there was no social media, it was truly a disconnect. It kind of freaked me out.” That void was eventually filled when she first logged onto social media and reconnected with her old fans. When Lunden was on air, she had “reams of people [on staff] that did nothing but answer letters,” but the direct connection on social media was on a different level. “Pretty soon I had fifty thousand, sixty thousand followers, and my husband said, ‘You cannot be talking to all those people every day.’” She chuckled, “But boy, I give it a try.” The lively “GMA” celebration at Disney’s New York headquarters united Robin Roberts, George Stephanopoulos and Michael Strahan with Joan Lunden and fellow veterans Charlie Gibson and Diane Sawyer. The event followed the previous night’s airing of President Trump’s confrontational “60 Minutes” interview, his first since suing CBS over what he described as an altered version of Kamala Harris’ election-season appearance. The timing underscored the increasingly fraught relationship between politics, the press and the billionaire owners now shaping major media companies. “We obviously know that the major networks are little by little all becoming owned by the richest people in the world,” Lunden said. “We don’t want their opinions and their political viewpoints to seep into our business. But I’m a glass half full kind of girl. I really think that the journalism, as an industry, will be able to stand strong. We’ll still be here ten years from now celebrating the 60th anniversary, and you’ll still be able to ask me any question you want.” A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Title: Both Sides Now: On the 2025 World Series
URL: https://avidly.org/2025/11/15/both-sides-now-on-the-2025-world-series/
Time Published: 2025-11-15T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
with intense eagerness since 2012! a channel of the los angeles review of books The 2025 World Series between the Los Angeles Dodgers and Toronto Blue Jays ended in elation or devastation, depending on what side of the ball and the 49th parallel you happened to be on. For us–two friends, former colleagues, and Filipino North Americans–the series’ 146 innings across seven games formed a tether of anxious codependency that could have easily toggled over into toxicity and bad blood. Instead, it deepened our mutual love of baseball, a dastardly game of inches (or as Adrian might say, centimeters), fickle momentum, painstaking rituals, and good old fashioned luck. It also reminded us why we each love Los Angeles and Toronto. One is a city besieged by relentless immigration raids against the Latinx fans who love the Dodgers most, putting the city and many of the team’s members at odds with its owner. The other is a city of immigrants from the Global South and elsewhere across the former British empire, held hostage by kleptocrats and landlords, whose sports teams are owned by the very telecommunication monopolies that make everyday life unaffordable. As a way of making sense of it all–the big feelings, the huge hangovers, the agony and the ecstasy, as Howard Cosell used to say–we’ve written an extended chronicle of our remote intimacies through this epic fall classic. It’s a love letter to our teams and our cities, and a glimpse at everything it takes for us, the fans, to help win a World Series. KT: The origins of my Dodgers fandom emerged, as it did for many Angelnxs my age, during peak Fernandomania in the early 1980s. My family immigrated from Manila to Los Angeles in 1983, just as I was about to turn ten-years-old. We landed at LAX in March amidst a catastrophic El Niño that brought a tornado to South Central Los Angeles. The part of me prone to mythologizing would take all the credit for finding my way to the boys in blue, especially Fernando Valenzuela, whose Brown, stocky frame and shaggy hair offered a heroic mirror for my tomboyishness during that era; a fresh-off-the-boat gender trouble that isolated me from the white suburban girls in my Inland Empire subdivision. Because I’d been on the road with my musician parents for the better part of three years, I took Calvert School correspondence courses. Were it not for the tutor my parents hired named Mike Thurman, who suggested I cultivate an interest in baseball to help juice my math lessons and my English writing skills, who knows what would’ve become of me. (My dad loves the Lakers, and prefers basketball to baseball, though he has since evolved into a bigger baseball fan thanks to his kid). My most treasured Dodger relic came to me as a result of Mike’s assignment to write a fan letter to my favorite player asking for an autograph. I picked the great Dominican 3rd baseman and the first Dodger ever to hit 30 homers and steal 20 bases, Pedro Guerrero. Pedro was the hero of the 1981 World Series clinching game 6 against the Yankees, with 5 RBIs and 8 total bases. Cut to forty-two years later and the only Guerrero on everyone’s minds is Toronto’s’ Vladdy, Jr. (no relation to the Dodgers’ Pedro, though he does have a much younger half-brother with the same name who can also ball, according to viral videos on the internet). Vladimir Guerrero, Jr. and the Blue Jays came off the ropes in the ALCS against the Seattle Mariners in 7 games, having been down 0-2 and 3-2, before clinching their World Series berth at home in front of a euphoric Rogers Centre and all of Canada. After cruising through the Wild Card against the Cincinnati Reds, and a taut but efficient NLDS against the favored Phillies, the Dodgers punched their ticket to the World Series with an NLCS sweep of the Milwaukee Brewers, the team with the most wins in the regular season. Needless to say, I was anxious AF as the World Series was about to begin. The Dodgers had been loafing around with a week off: plenty of time to get into their own heads before facing the Blue Jays, who just completed the kind of mojo making comeback that carries teams all the way to a championship. I knew Adrian was excited for the Jays’ first World Series appearance since 1993 (before he was born?), and we were communicating largely through Instagram stories and messages. I wasn’t sure how it would play out for either of us, our hometowns, or our friendship. ADL: So I was alive during the Jays’ last World Series, but I was still a kid in Manila! It would not be until 1998 when my family decided to leave our barangay (neighborhood) forever and make the journey across the Pacific. There was, I think, a future in which we could have moved to the US, and I could have been raised a Dodgers, Cubs, or Yankees fan. But for many reasons (like healthcare), we landed in Toronto one rainy Spring night, and bounced around the city’s immigrant and working-class east end of Scarborough. Now I confess – and anyone who knows me can attest to this – that, in terms of sports, my first love is basketball. My dad, who idolized Larry Bird, was a – puke – Celtics fan, and only once did we begrudgingly overlap, when Kevin Garnett won his championship. Outside of the Vince Carter-Tracy McGrady Raptors, I followed a hodgepodge of players, mostly power forwards like Garnett and Tim Duncan (my favorite basketball player of all time after Jimmy Butler). On the playground, everyone wanted to be an Allen Iverson or Kobe Bryant, as our frequently-sprained ankles attested. If basketball was the reliable main squeeze, baseball was the secret and passionate affair. And I mean secret, literally. My first baseball game was the first time I ever journeyed to downtown Toronto without my parents (with the blessing of a permission slip, of course). In my second and third (and fourth and fifth, ad nauseam) games, I eschewed bureaucratic approval, and commuted down with friends on the putatively free GO Train, which taught me the exquisite art of fare evasion. What began as the thrill of escaping a Very Catholic Household turned into an odyssey of being chased around the double-decker train by inspectors, sprinting off the train and jetting across Union Station, and snagging the cheap seats paid for by the parents of one of our token white friends, and jeering (and honestly, nervously so) at the Montreal Expos’ all-star designated hitter, Vladimir Guerrero…Senior. But it was the height of the Vince Carter Raptors, and I had no one to talk about how the fear that The Impaler struck into my heart, so MLB became something of an uncool thing to follow in those doldrum years. My fandom would have to be nourished elsewhere. On intramural softball, I was a middling third baseman, tolerated for my decent catch, later prized for my notoriously obstructive wide base (I was and remain a big boy). And, just as a piece of Canadiana for this write-up’s inevitably American audience, as kids, a popular game in gym class (which became intramural and local tournaments) was called Soccer Baseball. It wasn’t until this year that I learned that y’all Americans call it something else: Kickball. Then came 2015. Yes, I’m talking about the greatest and most swaggerific Jays team ever assembled before the 2025 season. Yes, I’m talking about icons Tulo and Pillar, and the imperturbable Donaldson. Yes, I’m talking about the invisible parrot perching on Edwin’s Edwing. Yes, I’m talking about Joey Bats. Yes, I’m talking about The Bat Flip. It is hard to overstate the intra-/inter-/trans-galactic convergences that imbued José Bautista’s iconic moment with the raw energy that exploded throughout the city after the repression of many disappointing years. For this Scarborough kid, that seventh inning was (and to me, remains) the greatest moment in Blue Jays history: tied at two apiece, after a 53-minute inning, Josh Donaldson on first and Kevin Pillar on third, Bautista at bat, one ball and one strike, Sam Dyson threw a fastball, and in the roaring din of the crowd – gone. While the American media was up in arms about the impoliteness (lol) of the gesture, we were passing around screenshots of our Dominican king in the group chats. For the kids from the ends, in other words, Canadian niceness was white people shit. Bautista was who we were, and who we wanted to be, at the same time. To this day, I can still recite the call: Bautista with the drive–Deep left field–NO DOUBT ABOUT IT! A couple of years after the 2015 ALDS, my relationship with my Jays would have to become a long distance one. I was about to move to Honolulu (and then to Seattle) on a Fulbright Scholarship. At my going-away party, one of my best friends surprised me with a Bautista jersey to wear on my sojourns. This is, incidentally, the only photo I have of me in Jays gear before this year. I gave the Bautista jersey to my brother, who still lives in Scarborough, and who wore it for the 2025 season. I know it sounds a little both-sides-ist, but by the time the World Series rolled around, and the Prince That Was Promised, Vladdy Jr. led my hometown team to new heights, I was torn. Half a decade (including the entire pandemic) in Los Angeles, along the esteemed artery of Temple Road that sutures Silver Lake, Echo Park, and Rampart Village into a Filipino enclave, and I had learned to become a Dodgers fan. Or more accurately, it was the deep Echo Park-ness of my former colleagues, especially Karen (superfan of all things Dodgers) and Natalia Molina (neighborhood historian and Los Doyers faithful) and Ana Iwataki (Little Tokyo curatorial nerd and consummate Asian American jock), who situated me in space. Being in that neighborhood, especially during 2020, taught me how to fall in love with Los Angeles. I bought my first car (whom I named Hybrid Jesus), took lockdown joyrides up and down the coast, went on my Stupid Mental Health Walks around the lake, and – most importantly – paraded down Echo Park loaded with cases of beer to hand out on the street. It was the year of the Lakers championship, the Dodgers championship, the presidential elections, and I came to adore the anarchic smell of burning rubber from the pickup trucks doing donuts on Sunset. Once the city “opened back up,” it was Dodgers games over spicy fried chicken at Crawfords, and dancing at Short Stop. Nonetheless. I can’t lie: it felt damn amazing to flaunt my Jays gear in New York, heckled by Public Enemy Number One (Yankees fans) and supported by the Charming Disasters (Mets fans). When Springer hit the homer that clinched our first World Series appearance since my former-non-Canadian ass was eleven months old, it was time to go to war. Even if it was against my other former home city. AdL: Man, I was WORRIED about this one. For a casual fan, it was easy to be optimistic. The Jays were locked in and warmed up, the team Loved Each Other, and they were riding the momentum of an epic ALDS on the back of the heroics of George Springer. But there was so much about the writing on the wall that made me uneasy: it would be Springer’s return to a playoff match against the Dodgers, and I feared (rightly) that the bad karma from the 2017 World Series would be Houston’s chief export to the city of Toronto. Not to mention that at the end of the day, the Jays are still A Toronto Sports Team: infamously unlucky. The perpetual underdog, and deservedly so, because for the most part, our teams tend to suck. I watched the game at the lobby bar of an indie theater in Williamsburg, where my partner was running the Brooklyn Horror Film Festival. With much foresight, she asked the theater to project the game onto the wall above the staircase, and I booked it to Union Square to catch the ironically-named L train, which I had hoped was not premonitory for anything. The theater ebbed and flowed with Brooklyn arts types and queer goths, often both at once, and at the bar, it became clear that I was the outlier sports fan when I was yelling at the wall with a Fernet in hand, long after everyone else had shoved their way into the auditorium. My god, did this game have some great story lines. After his meteoric rise from rookie in the minor leagues to playoff darling, my beautiful Pennsylvanian son (no relation) Trey Yesavage started for the Jays in Game 1. It wasn’t the dominant repeat of his surprise start in G6 of the ALCS, but he managed to hold his own for a respectable four innings. The bartender, who knew nothing about baseball, enthusiastically congratulated me, a Filipino dude in my young thirties, for My White American Son’s (no relation) successes midway through the third. Nights like G1 made me nostalgic for Old Twitter. I’d have been lighting it up across the feed on my old account, Swagapino Studies. Bluesky, the liberal suburb of microblogging platforms would have to do. And pleasantly, it turned out that other Skeeters (yes, that’s the unfortunate and legitimate Bluesky slang) had the same hankering, and on that platform, I found a decent dupe for the dopamine hits of a Night On Twitter. So when, at the bottom of the sixth, with bases loaded, my son (no relation) Addison Barger pinch-hit for Davis Schneider (for whom my partner yells GREAT MOUSTACHE whenever he shows up on screen), I knew what to do. Reader, I skeeted. KT: I didn’t like the vibes heading into game one in Toronto, especially because I had to watch in snippets while I was away at a conference in Houston of all places. Like every true Dodgers fan, I still carry the trauma of the 2017 World Series, in which the Houston Astros cheated the Dodgers out of a ring, adding insult to injury by doing it at Dodger Stadium in game 7. For these reasons, George Springer (the hero of the Jay’s G7 victory against Seattle in the ALCS) was my–nay every–Dodgers fan’s enemy number 1. Despite Blake Snell, aka Snellzilla’s (lol) dominance against the Phillies and the Brewers, I wasn’t sure how he’d fare against the Blue Jays’ relentless offense. With me and the Dodgers both on the road, I couldn’t hunker down for my usual obsessive-compulsive regime of superstitious rituals. The anxiety led me to drink way more beer than I intended (3 tallboys of Lone Star before first pitch) at the West Alabama Ice House known for their “ice cold” brew. Ricardo Montez, a Rice alum and Texas native brought me there because he thought I might “appreciate a place devoted to cold beer.” Reader, I am NOT a beer drinker. Not even at the stadium for home games. I do, however, appreciate the misrecognition, and I do love a “San Mig Ice” from the subzero coolers they use in Balikbayan bars in Manila. I appreciated it a bit too much that evening, despite drinking with a group of gays who also avoid beer (bc carbs), and who didn’t give a shit about baseball. I was already in poor form, matching Snell’s own, by the time we got to a celebratory dinner for a friend’s new book around the middle innings, as I vainly tried to resume my rituals, which involved drinking mezcal and soda ONLY WHEN the Dodgers were at bat. You can imagine how impossible it was to keep eyes on the game seated at a fancy dinner with eight other people. I only go to the bathroom when the Dodgers are at bat: one of many, painstaking game-watching rituals. Don’t ask me why (you don’t want to know). I’ve been doing it since 2020.That night, I couldn’t wait for a break because of the aforementioned tallboys, so I got up and went to the bathroom while the Jays were up in the bottom of the 6th. It was at that moment of sloppy “game management” on my part (or at least that’s what my twisted brain told me) that the Jays’ Addison Barger hit a grand slam off Anthony Banda, the lady Dodger fans’ favorite presumed “fuckboi,” who came in for Snell in relief. Barger made it 9-2 and essentially put G1 out of reach for the Dodgers. Many of you are probably aware of the idiom, “beer before hard, you’re in the yard,” meaning if you drink beer before hard liquor, you will (as the other saying goes) never be sicker. That night, beer before hard led to the Jays going yard multiple times. At least that’s what my twisted, superstitious psyche told me. Not even the lucky Dodgers tee tucked under my conference-appropriate button-down was going to save us. It was time to reset all the rituals and pass out back at the hotel, much to the chagrin of my friends and my spouse who witnessed my full descent into despair as I instructed the Uber driver to play TSwift’s “Father Figure” at full volume, while I sang along. KT: This was the first game that Adrian and I let ourselves chat beforehand. I interpreted it then as a magnanimous gesture from someone who felt really good because their team was up 1-0 in the series after a dominant performance. Other “casuals” who were watching the WS for the first time were not so kind to me on other social media platforms, with the Dodgers being the so-called ruiners of baseball for our Daddy Warbucks payroll. My public posture after G1 was that I was “too blessed to be stressed,” but the truth was I was languishing in the kind of depressive hungover state I’d experienced before in my younger days of conferencing, especially when my panel was scheduled at 9am local time as it was the morning of G2. I threw my now unlucky clothes and totems into a dirty laundry bag in my suitcase, and surrendered to the conference, knowing full well that I had another group dinner scheduled while G2 was scheduled to air. I was much more cautious and undertook a regime of rest and rehydration to prepare. Yoshinobu Yamamoto was on the mound that night, and he’d just thrown a complete 9 innings in his last start for the NLCS. Derek Jeter emphatically stated on the pregame show that Yoshi wouldn’t be able to do it again. Since everyone knew–and witnessed in G1–how the Dodgers’ bullpen was absolute ASS (and had been for most of the season), Yoshi’s unlikely capacity to “do 9 innings again” spelled more trouble for Los Doyers in Toronto. Yamamoto had a shaky start and I was worried he was on the path to Snellsville; but he managed to get out of a jam in the first with some heads-up defensive plays behind him. I exhaled and took up a new viewing ritual in the process: I reasoned that we’d make it through clean innings if I didn’t watch while we pitched. This was a convenient ritual to take up just as we arrived at a group dinner at the classic Houston Tex-Mex joint, Ninfa’s Original. Football was on all of Ninfa’s TVs, so I was in no danger of an errant glance a la Lot’s wife. Turns out the game was a pitchers’ duel between Yamamoto and Toronto’s Kevin Gausman, so I missed a lot. At one point, Gausman retired 17 Dodgers in a row as the game was knotted at 1, and it was looking bleak as our offense seemed flaccid once again. By the top of the 7th inning, I stopped hiding my phone and rudely propped it up against my modified lucky drink: mezcal and soda with THREE ORANGE SLICES (representing three clean outs for Yoshi), which was to be sipped only during Dodgers at-bats. It was at that moment that our fresh prince, Will Smith, the Dodgers’ catcher who opened the scoring earlier in G2 with an RBI single, homered for the go-head run putting the Dodgers up 2-1. Shortly thereafter, Max Muncy, “that funky Muncy” (sung to the tune of the Beastie Boys’ “Brass Monkey”) followed up with another solo homer to put the Dodgers up 3-1. The Dodgers went on to score two more in the top of the 8th after an extended Jonas Brothers’ performance of “I Can’t Lose” as part of the Mastercard-sponsored “Stand Up to Cancer” segment featured every year during the World Series. Some Toronto fans complained about how limber the 7th-inning-stretch was, allowing their pitcher to get cold. Of course, I tucked that song away for future use, turning it into an emergency totem. Yamamoto closed out all 9 innings of G2 for a final score of 5-1. Adrian reached out to me that night to call Yoshi’s performance a “master class,” and we traded photos of the “bad Yama Mamma” (sung to the tune of Carl Carlton’s “She’s a Bad Mama Jama…”) striking his own stretch like a “bad bitch,” as Dodgers fans love to say. AdL: Yeah, we got wrecked by Yoshi, or as Karen called him via text, “My Bad Bitch.” It was one thing to know his worth from that fat contract he signed, and it was another thing to witness why mercenaries (including pitchers) are one of the world’s oldest and best paid professions. And don’t get me wrong, I love Kevin Gausman. He earned his keep by shutting down the Dodgers offense early on. But I fear Yoshinobu Yamamoto more. After my brimming (oozing, overflowing, really) confidence after G1, I had to send Karen a text at the end of that game to congratulate her on behalf of her Bad Bitch, and I was certain that she was curled up and happily scrolling like that meme: The real suffering that night, though, was that one of my reliable neighborhood spots, my go-to hookah lounge, which was usually a font of good juju, was completely off. The live stream didn’t work, and I tried logging into my own accounts to find a decent stream, and ended up settling for a free seven-day trial of (yuck) Fox One. The entire time, a British woman kept yapping in my ear, complaining to me about how slow the food was taking five minutes after she ordered, ridiculing me for not being able to set up the stream (while admitting that she’d never worked a Roku her entire life), ranting about how grimy the East Village is, and groaning about how the establishment – a hookah lounge – smells like smoke. Yes, I blame Good King Charles’s loyal subject for this game’s seventh inning. But what’s baseball if not arbitrarily blaming inconveniences and constellational misalignments for your team’s loss? KT: Both the Dodgers and I were back in L.A. for G3 on Monday the 27th. I was feeling good and loose about the next three games, especially after the Dodgers stole one in Toronto, wrenching back the home-field advantage, and turning the series into a potential “best of 5.” I didn’t reach back out to Adrian that day, probably because I was feeling as smug as he did after G1. Plus, I didn’t want to jinx anything by consorting with a rival, especially because I had my whole set-up ready at home: Madre Mezcal Espadin on hand with limes harvested from my backyard, and a giant bottle of Tajin. Snacks were locked and loaded, and I even had a couple of chops defrosting in the fridge to make a wholesome dinner at home after a long day of teaching on campus. I dared to wear the same non-Dodgers clothes I wore for G2 at the Houston conference, and went to campus knowing the game would start just when my spouse and I had to drive home at 5pm. Our house is only 1.4 miles away from Dodger Stadium (I typically walk to games), and we were ensnared in the World Series traffic compounding an already gnarly rush hour down Alvarado into Echo Park. We listened to the first inning and a half on the car radio, and made it home in time to pour a lucky mezcal drink just before former-Blue Jay, Teoscar Hernandez homered to put the Dodgers up by 1 in the bottom of the 2nd. Shohei Ohtani followed with another towering solo shot at the end of the 3rd. Max Scherzer was on the bump for the Jays, and while I harbor less antipathy for him than for Springer, there is no love lost for “dead arm” Scherzer in Los Angeles. He acquired that reputation during his brief stint with the Dodgers in 2021, after he refused to pitch in the NLCS, citing his supposed “dead arm.” Many speculated he was just preserving himself for a monster free agency because his contract was ending. That evening, our foster cats’ “real parents,” Chelsea and Nick Berkofsky began texting us about the game. We ended up with their litter-mate tabbies, Speedy and Amelia, after the Altadena fires consumed their home in early January. The family had to downsize into a studio apartment in Echo Park with their other cat, their dog and their toddler. As bereaved cat parents who lost both of our beautiful littermates Lily and Corky within a calendar year, we offered to help the Berkofskys out with a long-term foster situation for at least two of their brood. The Blue Jays’ catcher, Alejandro Kirk clocked Tyler Glasnow with a three run homer in the top of the 4th, flipping the game upside down as the sports announcers like to say. It was then that Chelsea, a diehard Latina Dodgers fan, and I fully converted our group chat for Speedy and Amelia into a Dodgers anxiety thread. I changed my clothes back into my recently laundered lucky Dodgers shirt (featuring the 2024 World Series championship trophy), and stuck to my neurotic routine of not watching our pitching halves each inning. I also convinced myself that vigorous texting with the cat thread and other friends like Oliver Wang should be added to my many superstitious rituals. It seemed to work, because we’d tied the score again with “ribeye steaks” (i.e. RBIs) from Shohei in the 4th, and Freddie Freeman in the 5th. The Jays pulled ahead 5-4 again in the top of the 7th, and I knew it was time to experiment with an untapped resource: the Jonas Brothers’ “I Can’t Lose.” It worked. Shohei homered for the 2nd time in the bottom of the 7th to tie the game at 5-5. The score stayed stuck that way for another 11 innings. You can see the line of palm trees ringing Dodger stadium’s western slope from our living and dining room windows. With each passing inning and hour, the beleaguered “awwws” echoing from beyond the palms tipped me off around 30 seconds before each play aired that we hadn’t managed to walk it off yet. I also heard the roars of relief when Clayton Kershaw came in from the bullpen and got out of the jam in the top of the 12th. That single, crucial out would constitute his last appearance on the mound in his baseball home. The rest of the game unfolded as a blur of intentional walks to Shohei, a fruit platter delivered to the Blue Jays’ dugout, and guys whose names we never heard of deep in the roster. (L.A. sports teams’ fruit platter game goes HARD, as I learned from being an Angel City Football Club season ticket holder). Adrian and I had to break the tension, risking whatever bad juju might come for either of us as a result of talking to each other DURING a game instead of before or after. Despite the conciliatory tone of his final message, I knew Freddie’s walk-off homer in the bottom of the 18th, with shades of G1 in 2024, must’ve eviscerated Adrian as much as it elated me. It was time to shut up and go to bed. AdL: Already anxiety-struck with the dread of three games in Los Angeles, I came into the game doubly anxious about not being able to finish preparing for class. To ease the pain, I met my boo in downtown Brooklyn to watch the new Chainsaw Man movie, and indeed, animated gore was the perfect prelude (and unfortunate symbology) for the game after. We found a sports bar nearby, and wanting to live up to my reputation as a Devoted Undergraduate Instructor, I resolved to make the bar my office, and accompanied G2 with a side of light-hearted readings on Japanese imperialism across the Pacific. At the top of the ninth, tied at five apiece, I had finished class prep, and hastily wrote out the lesson plan along the margins of the back page, because I had forgotten my notebooks, and for some reason, it felt like bad juju to dig through my bag when, at any moment, the Jays or the Dodgers could win the game by some complete fluke. But the boo had fallen asleep in the bar booth, and I knew it was time to go, because we had to Go To Work the next day, but not before she snapped this live react, somewhere between the top of the tenth and the bottom of the twelfth: In between stretches of subway tunnel, I refreshed my ESPN app frantically, trying to follow along. (Incidentally, we agree that the MLB interface of the app is the best one, far superior to the cluster—- that is the NBA page’s nonsensical statistical spreadsheet.) Up the steps of all five floors of our walkup, I played the live audio off my phone. By the top step, my New York BBL was fully engaged, but my brain was complete mush. The boo suggested (very strongly) that I not stay up too late, because I had to teach both lectures the next day, with meetings and a dissertation prospectus defense in between. Naturally, I did not listen to her, and I lay in bed watching the game on my phone, and occasionally texting Karen, because in the stupor of the sixteenth inning, somewhere between 2 and 2:30am, who else would understand the maniacal delirium than my dear friend across the continent? Alas, when Freddie, my fellow Canadian, murdered his country with a walk-off, I sent that farewell text, and like Stewie from Family Guy, turned over in my blanket, and there was a non-zero chance that I let out a tiny sob. AdL: At this point, my work wardrobe was designed around all my Jays merch. The boo offered to wash my jersey that night, and I almost accepted because it was getting kinda dank, but we reminded ourselves of the preeminent value of ritual, and left it sufficiently grimy. My senior colleague, who was the chair of the dissertation prospectus defense I attended that afternoon, stared his impenetrable stare at my outfit, and I was concerned that he might have been a hostile die-hard Dodgers fan. Then I remembered that he had just come out with a book about suburbanization in his Pennsylvanian hometown. That relief was confirmed after we wrapped up our student’s defense (which was, unsurprisingly, quite stellar), and he asked how I was feeling about the series, and insisted that the Jays were destined to win, because billion-dollar payrolls were bound to crash and burn. “I can’t stand the Dodgers!” he proclaimed, and I gave him a thumbs-up and a forced smile, because like the former theater kid I was, my superstitious ass couldn’t shake the bad vibes from anything other than a break a leg. “Good luck tonight!” My students, fortunately, were also cheering for my home team, but more out of a commitment to anti-Dodgerism (there were, predictably, many Yankees fans who still couldn’t get over how badly we rocked their shit during the ALDS), and less out of support for Toronto. But one of my students, from the potato-rich province of Prince Edward Island, offered generous solidarity as a fellow Canadian passport-holder. I expected that this would tide over the foreboding misfortune that came with the copious well wishes, and I welcomed his cheers wholeheartedly. For some reason, I can’t remember the game, probably because I spent the entire time ranting to the boo about my evening class, which was, admittedly, not my best work. I was trying to teach a brief history of American colonialism in the Philippines, but couldn’t get my head out of how utterly exhausted I was after eighteen innings of head-on-wall-banging baseball. The photo evidence of that day I do have, though, was that, despite all odds, I somehow managed to produce a banger of a whiteboard: Cue the anime guy looking at a butterfly meme: Is this…professor-ing? KT: I can barely remember G4. I was driving home from campus when the game began, feeling hopeful but depleted, knowing Shohei would take the bump after hitting two homers and four extra base hits, and reaching base a grand total of nine times less than 24 hours earlier. I was gobsmacked that Will Smith was catching again after his thighs of steel held it down behind the dish all 18 innings the night before. Adrian and I exchanged pleasantries throughout the day. I sent a laugh/cry emoji to the meme he posted of a fat Blue Jay bird labeled “Alejandro Kirk.” We talked about what positions we played when we were kids (I was a catcher; Adrian played third). The Dodgers opened the scoring early after Mr. Kiktober, Kiké Hernandez hit a sac fly to make it 1-0 in the first. Then Shohei was bested by Vlad in the top of the 3rd: junior dinged a 2-run, 395 foot homer over the left-centerfield wall. Despite some shakiness, Shohei pitched a decent game that kept us competitive at a score of 2-1 heading into the top of the 7th. My liver couldn’t handle the magic mezcal regimen after G2, so I sipped bitters and soda hoping it might still summon some offensive pop from the boys in (Dodger) blue. I cooked another meal using the same spice blend for the chops in G2. All of this was to no avail. The magic was gone. In a fit of desperation I relented to more alcohol, but with less booze-by-volume: Madre “Desert Water” seltzers. I texted furiously with Chelsea, Nick, Oliver and whoever else would listen to me to no avail. I turned on the Joe Bros “I Can’t Lose.” Turns out we can. Another disastrous torrent of Toronto runs against our frail bullpen made it 6-1 entering the final third of the game. We eked out one more run, making the final score 6-2. All my now unlucky clothes were again tossed into the laundry for another hard reboot. I couldn’t even muster up a congratulatory message to Adrian, before trying to “eternal sunshine” the ick that just happened at Dodger Stadium from my mind. Speedy Berkofsky Glowers at Dodger Stadium AdL: I started the day at the dermatologist’s clinic, after an evening of relief over my team’s victory, followed by an anxiety-laden Google search for the symptoms of skin cancer, and a frantic self-inspection, and I grew concerned over a dark spot on my left leg that, by midnight, I was convinced was melanoma. (WebMD really messes you up.) After the doctor’s good news (that mark on my leg was literally just hardened skin that developed from me picking at a mole), I was on the verge of tears, and walked south to Manhattan’s Koreatown to find something good to eat. On 30th Street, I came across a place called Okdongsik, a hole-in-the-wall with room only for bar seats, and their slim menu drew me in. One of the cooks behind the counter motioned me over to the end of the table, first to serve me a bowl of dweji-gomtang (a clear soup with slices of pork atop a pillow of rice porridge), and then to talk shop about the World Series. Fortunately for me, he was sporting a blue and orange Mets hat. He assured me that the Jays would win tonight, because as good as Shohei was, the Dodgers were built for high-variance home runs, and my own team’s terrifying offense – “The Jays play baseball right, and your guys work the count” – was far more sustainable in the long run. Later that evening, the boo and I went on an IKEA run in Red Hook, and I was on a mission to drive her to madness with my incessant name-brand puns (“If the Jays lose the series, what do you think they…LACK?”), and after a quick dinner of Swedish meatballs and gravlax, we took the bus back to downtown Brooklyn to get on the train home. This was a mistake: our bus got stuck behind some asshole van driver who parked his vehicle in the middle of the street – during rush hour – and I was coming down with a bout of motion sickness, exacerbated by the fear that we’d miss a fat chunk of the game. Thankfully, we got home just in time for the middle of the first. We sat down on the couch, and turned on (puke) Fox One, and were treated to a pair of homers, first from Davis “Beautiful Stache” Schneider, and the second from Vladdy Jr. The candles (and other flammable organics) were lit, the barley tea was poured, and we were locked TF in. Stepping up to the mound was my beautiful White American son (no relation), Trey THEE Savage. And as the sports history books will surely write one day, this was to be the apex of his unlikely rise, but no one could have anticipated exactly how historic it’d be: twelve strikeouts with zero walks, the most in a World Series not only by a rookie pitcher, but by any pitcher ever. No one except for me, his proud Filipino dad (no relation), who spent the entire game blessing him with some sage, knew this would happen, so I’d like to think that I had an important role to play: KT: For the first time since the Dodgers returned to L.A, I was home when the game started at 5pm Pacific. I decided to bust out of my routine a little bit, hoping that the slightest rearrangements to the material world might help jumpstart our anemic offense. I re-established my mise-en-place on the kitchen counter: limes from the backyard, Madre Espladin, Tajin. The Los Angeles Athletic Club cocktail tumbler I used to sip my beverages during the Dodgers’ half of each inning was ready for use. I even purchased some new snacks from the Filipino mega-grocery, Island Pacific Market, including garlic-flavored “cornnick” (basically corn nuts with crispy slivers of garlic mixed in), vinegar-and-garlic-flavored chicharron, and a bunch of other stuff chock-full of palm oil that I have no business eating or drinking because of my chronic health conditions. As I was acquiring my bounty at the market, I was struck with the fear that busting out the Pinoy goods might actually backfire and help out Adrian instead of me… It turns out I was right: the game started with Blake Snell tossing two back-to-back meatballs to Schneider and Vladdy to put us down early 0-2. Snellzilla’s mojo from his earlier playoff run was gone. Our stanky (pejorative) bullpen would have to ride again tonight. Meanwhile, it was Trey Yesevage’s night for Toronto. The Jays’ Cinderella story pitched flawlessly, giving up only one home run to (who else), Kiké Hernandez. Otherwise, we whiffed a total of 12 times, and Yesavage set the World Series rookie record for strikeouts. We went down 6-1 with the great Sandy Koufax watching. He was presumably there to see the GOAT, Clayton Kershaw toss his final innings at Dodger Stadium, a scenario that would’ve only been possible if the score line was reversed. Beneath the shadow of another loss, Kersh lingered on the field with his family soaking it all in before the whole team went back to Toronto down 2-3 with their backs against the wall, fighting to live another day. Another team stalwart loitered after everybody was gone in the dugout: Miguel “Miggy” Rojas stared off into an empty stadium looking forlorn. Maybe it was the competitive anguish in his eyes, but I knew then that Miggy–a clubhouse leader beloved by the Dodger faithful, if relatively unknown amongst casual WS watchers–might just be our only hope. KT: Backs against the wall. Do or die. On Halloween no less. I was up early, because I had to bring my wife Sarah in for a routine medical procedure at 6:30am Pacific. All the nurses, docs, anesthesiologists, and other patients were chattering about what might happen in G6 and a potential G7. One doctor even went so far as to say he was considering canceling his birthday dinner reservation at Hippo in Highland Park the following night if game seven came to fruition. A baseball fan’s superstitions, especially when their team is facing elimination, carry the same potency, and demand the same fastidiousness as a religious zealot’s rites. My spouse understood this and was kind enough to let me drag her around town as “the good drugs” wore off to re-stock my ceremonial essentials: Madre Espladin, a particular brand and flavor of potato chip which we ran out of at the end of G3, and a magic item I hadn’t considered to incorporate since Yamamoto’s last victorious start in G2: oranges. Clearly the backyard limes weren’t doing their thing. I also opted for new vestments, and wore my “L.A. Strong” wildlife relief tee. I’m ashamed to admit that most of L.A. had more confidence in Yoshi’s capacity to redeem us than I. Wasn’t he sick of doing all the work for the group project? How fresh could he be after another complete game within less than a week? I prayed to a god I’d long ago alienated that the oranges would work. He and the Jays’ starter Kevin Gausman carried on much as they did during their first head-to-head battle in G2, keeping it scoreless on both sides through three. I observantly replenished my three orange slices each inning and scurried away every time we pitched, keeping track of the game through its ambient sounds from the other room, while refreshing my MLB app nonstop for live updates that were about 30 seconds ahead of the TV feed in the other room. As my therapist and I have discussed, baseball superstitions provide a convenient screen for a person’s obsessive compulsive tendencies. Mine have worsened through each passing postseason, and I can’t help but wonder if the Catholicism I was conditioned to observe with greater reverence hasn’t somehow been reanimated in all the practices I’ve taken up on behalf of Dodger baseball. The boys finally pushed through in the top of the 3rd with RBIs from Will Smith and the sleeping giant, Mookie Betts, who admitted after G5 that he had been “terrible” all series long. With a small lead, Saint Yoshi went back to work, but it wasn’t long before the devil himself, George Springer brought in the Blue Jays’ first run with a single in the bottom of the 3rd. At this point I had to clean out all the oranges accumulating in my L.A. Athletic Club cocktail tumbler, but wondered desperately if I might be cursing us in the process. After getting out of a jam in the 6th, Yoshi left the game for our bullpen to finish, leaving me scant hope for a game seven. I missed the dawgs of last year’s pen, the true MVPs, when we had no starting pitching to speak of other than a less polished Yoshi, and the hot L.A.-born himbeaux, Jack Flaherty, borrowed for a year from the Detroit Tigers. Throughout G6, Miggy Ro’made a couple of spectacular defensive plays at second base, including a barehander to first in the bottom of the 7th to keep the Jays’ rolling offense at bay. Justin “Wrobo” Wrobleski kept things clean from the bullpen and handed it over to Roki Sasaki, the Japanese wunderkind who the Dodgers signed as a rookie starter, but who ended up flourishing in the postseason as a closer. “Bailalo Roki” (as Miggy Ro’ nicknamed him after DJ Roderick’s “Bailalo Rocky”), worked his way out of a jam in the 8th, only to hit Alejandro Kirk by a pitch to send a runner on base in the bottom of the 9th. Kirk was taken out of the game for a swifter pinch runner, Myles Straw. Addison Barger, the same guy who staked Dodger hearts with a pinch hit grand slam in G1 came to the plate and hit a towering fly into center field over Justin Dean’s head. That hit, likely a double or even a triple, would’ve tied the game with no outs, putting Barger in scoring position to win it all for the Jays. As if commanded by the (Dodger) baseball gods, the ball simply dropped dead into the padding of the Rogers Centre outfield. Dean flung his hands up into the air to signal the umps for a dead ball. The home field advantage that was supposed to bring the Blue Jays their first title in thirty-two years pulled some Freaky Friday, Halloween, “Fall of the House of Usher” type shit with the Rogers Centre’s padding. The wedged ball was an automatic ground-rule double, freezing the runners at 2nd and 3rd with no outs, and keeping the score locked at 3-1 Dodgers. Tyler Glasnow, the presumptive starter for a possible G7, came in for young Roki, as all of Los Angeles collectively girded its loins. The next Jays batter, the red hot Ernie Clement, hit an infield pop up on Glasnow’s first pitch securing at least one measly out. Andres Gimenez took his place in the batters box with the Dodgers’ most loathed, George Springer looming on deck. Gimenez flared what looked to be a bloop single towards shallow left field when Mr. Enrique Hernandez, our October trickster, came charging in from nowhere to make the grab, following-through with a swift, targeted throw to Miguel Rojas for a game-ending double play. I saw none of this and only heard it, of course, since I was hunched over anxiously in the other room observing the sequestration demanded by this year’s liturgy for the World Series. In so doing, we were granted another day. Amen to that. AdL: Drake just had to ruin everything, didn’t he? After my beautiful White American Son (no relation) struck Shohei out in G5, Toronto’s National Disgrace decided to troll the greatest baseball player of all time (and I say that with zero irony) with a couple of dumbass Instagram stories. And this, my friends, is when I first had an inkling that we might lose the World Series: Instead of dwelling on the disastrous double play (and the doubly emphatic primal screams) at the end of the game, and instead of talking about the fact that I spent a good chunk of the game explaining the intricacies of the Jays’ and the Dodgers’ shades of blue to an Australian acquaintance, allow me to talk shit about Drake. I’m the kind of kid from Toronto that has an encyclopedic knowledge of the first half of Drake’s discography, but not the second half, when he decided he’d levitate away from the city’s potholed streets and perch himself atop the former tallest freestanding structure in the world. This included his unreleased tracks on YouTube, those urban anthems with the gritty circulatory undercurrent of a mixtape, as well as the features that he scattered to the winds (his early collabs with now-enemies Kendrick Lamar and Rick Ross were notable masterpieces). To put it in local geography: everything before and up to the album on the left (If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late) is music you can listen to while napping on the late night bus to Scarborough after a line-cook shift downtown, or bump windows-down from a late night drive in your 1997 Honda Civic after a break-up with your situationship. Everything from and after the album on the right (Views), after the first three tracks, is down right unlistenable for anyone not a regular at a bottle-service-only club on King Street West (for my Angelenos, this is a street with the manicured aesthetics of the Arts District but the diversity and energy of the Venice Erewhon). This drop-off was unfortunate, because while Drake’s stocks plateaued (as he shifted towards maximizing Spotify streams instead of crafting albums), Toronto sports skyrocketed to their eminent place today. The spring after Drake released If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late, the Raptors repeated as Atlantic Conference champions for the first time in team history, and later that fall, the Blue Jays flipped bats and took names all the way to the ALCS. It was with some personal trepidation, then, that when the Raptors were to face (and beat) the Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals in 2019, I had to watch Drake take credit (in the Royal We) for momentum that was far greater than he. For a solid year after Mr. Kendrick Lamar vivisected his middle-class Canadian counterpart, I was questioned about my feelings on the Kendrick-Drake “beef” (which was really a slaughter). Toronto’s beloved sports alumni, Angelenos first (like Demar DeRozan, more loved than Drake would ever be in the city) snubbed the metropolis’s most eminent washed rapper. When Drake laid low for a while, and started teasing snippets from his yet-to-be-released album over the summer, the chatter seemed to die down. But by October, when it became clear that the Jays were to go head to head with the Dodgers, I thought: here we go again! All I wanted was for the guy to keep his cursed social media thumbs off the Jays. By G6, it was clear that Aubrey had lost his touch. One might blame it on Kendrick’s clinical dissection of an October Scorpio (I’m a November Scorpio, we don’t claim him), but at the end of the day, like the Rogers Centre’s walls that wedged the ball into themselves, it was Mr. Graham who was his own worst enemy, and the thorn in Toronto’s foot. KT: As I mentioned earlier, part of me (all of me?) never got over G7 in 2017 against the Astros. One of the things I did wrong that day–as if it had anything to do with me–was schedule a huge campus event on the TV show UnReal. That event ended with the saddest stream of texts, and a drive back to Echo Park through an abject eerie silence, when I’d hoped to be dodging fireworks and crowds streaming onto Alvarado Blvd from all corners. Cut to 2025, and my calendar was clear except for a BBQ earlier in the day at my friend and colleague Natalia Molina’s place in South Pasadena. Natalia grew up in Echo Park (her family still lives here), and their Dodgers fandom is beautifully chronicled in several pieces Natalia has written, including one on this year’s series amidst the ICE raids and bifurcated feelings of its fans: a love for the team and the city vs. our vitriol for its primary owner, Mark Walter, who has investments in ICE detention centers. Most of us were wearing Dodgers gear as we supped on the tri-tip Ian, Natlia’s husband, made special for the day. I was made painfully aware of the fact that my wildfire relief “L.A. Strong” tee signified differently in that neighborhood, where so many homes were lost or damaged in January. Los Angeles had been besieged by both fire and ICE in 2025. Would we make it to the other side of all that to experience the balm of a much-needed win? Even though I packed a little tote to bring to Natalia’s in case I wanted to stay and watch the game (with a tub of sliced oranges, Madre Espladin, the lucky potato chips, and a complete outfit change into a Japanese Dodgers tee and Aussie pajama pants that acquired some magic late into G6), I decided I needed to be in the comfort of my own home for whatever chaos might come. I also wasn’t sure I wanted to expose a beloved colleague to the true bonkersness of my game-watching routines. We dashed home and got settled in time to watch “dead arm” Scherzer give up a hit to Shohei which yielded nothing. My G7 traumas were reactivated when Springer clocked a solid single off Shohei, who was starting again on very short rest (just 3 days). Sho somehow got out of the inning not only by striking-out Vlad with a 100 mph fastball across the plate (Vlad clocked a pitch like that for his 2-run homer against Shohei in G3), but by virtue of Will Smith’s head’s up double-play, that took advantage of Springer’s deliciously bad base-running error. Shohei looked sweaty and spent, but he managed mightily through the first two innings without giving up any runs. I was convinced this was contingent on the miracle of Yoshi’s oranges, which I kept in my own G7 lineup. By the bottom of the 3rd, however, he surrendered a three run no-doubter to Bo Bichette, the Blue Jays’ wounded hero (I miss his Jesus hair and beard), whose contract is up at the end of the year. At that point I was still sequestered in the other room, listening to the ambient sounds of Rogers Centre crescendoing with the taste of victory on the tip of their tongues. My body slumped backwards into a “Death of Chatterton” pose. I was studiously avoiding any communication with Adrian or peeping on social media. Instead, I texted anxiously with the Berkfoskys, Rhys Ernst, Oliver Wang and others. I decided a kind of ascetic, sectarian approach to stimulation from the outside world was the only way to approach this most volatile of scenarios. Baseball is a long game, as G3 and this epic tome we’ve written, remind us. By the top of the 4th, the Dodgers managed to take one back. By the bottom of the 4th, the benches and Dodgers’ bullpen cleared as “Wrobo” dinged Gimenez who (I still insist) dangled his hand in the zone on purpose in the previous sequence. After the dust settled with two on and two out in the bottom of the 4th, the Dodgers activated their starting rotation from the bullpen and sent Glasnow in to continue the game, despite having pitched in relief the night before. There was action on the bases every inning. Dead arm Scherer was pulled in the top of the 5th, and by the top of the 6th the Dodgers narrowed it to a 1-run game on a Tommy Edman sac fly. By the bottom of the 6th, the Jays stretched the lead back up to 4-2. Covered in chip crumbs, and reeking of Madre Espladin muddled with freshly squeezed oranges, I realized I hadn’t eaten any dinner. It didn’t matter. I persevered and continued my rituals. At one point I considered busting out the wood rosary I bought at Quiapo cathedral in Manila in 2016. I finally peeked at social media, and I noticed Adrian was also silent. I wondered where he was watching and how he might be doing. I envied the position he and his team were in, with a two run lead and only a handful of outs left to go. For some reason I toggled over into a strange sense of calm. Is this what they mean by “letting go?” Is this the sensation of one’s soul leaving one’s body? Or was it simply my mezcal-ravaged, nutrition-deprived frame, lapsing into a state of homeostatic survival? We reached the top of the 8th with Trey Yesavage in relief for the Jays. The thing I love about game sevens is that teams are forced to empty out their dugouts and bullpens. There’s no hoarding the talent, and the fans are treated to ace starters in relief, and the utility heroes known only to their respective hives coming in to fulfill their specialty roles. Joe Davis and John Smoltz wondered aloud about Yesavage still working when the real Mad Max, aka that Funky Muncy, clobbered a solo home run to bring us within one. I YAWWWWWWPED and sent the foster kitties scurrying into safe spaces under beds and sofas. At this juncture, Sarah was on her way home from a friend’s art opening with a couple of other pals in tow. “Do you need anything?” she asked via text. “We need more oranges,” I replied, forgetting about real food because I was newly feasting on hope. Emmet Sheehan and Blake Snell came through by holding it down on the mound in the bottom half of the 8th, then in the flash of an instant we were down to only two at-bats left in our season at the top of the 9th. Miggy Ro’ was batting in the 9-spot with one out and nobody on. Miggy worked the count to 3-2 against Hoffman. Hoffman threw a hanging slider, and Mr. Miguel Elias Rojas Naidenoff (where did that last name come from anyway?) sent it over the left field wall into the glove of a Jays fan holding a Canadian flag. The most cursed of souvenirs, courtesy of Los Angeles. The game was tied at 4-4. I hate to be THAT guy, but I always knew it would be Miggy Ro’. This was the same Miggy Ro’ who held onto Kiké’s throw at the end of G6 to turn the double play that sent us to G7. This was the same guy whose defensive prowess got us out of multiple jams through G7; the same guy who lingered in the dugout after we pooed the scrooch in G5, contemplating if his career with the Dodgers wouldn’t end with a giant, ignominious “L.” Miguel Rojas is also a Venezuelan player whose family members weren’t granted visas to watch him play, because of the United States’ fucked up immigration policies and travel restrictions. In other words, the man had STAKES, and he did what so many hard-working unsung immigrants do and lifted us off the mat to give us a fighting chance with his most unlikely and unbelievable blast of destiny. With our holy trinity of Shohei, Freddie and Mookie failing to tack on insurance runs, we headed to the bottom of the 9th with Blake Snell still on the mound. Dave Roberts made another key substitution in the home half of the 9th: Our Cuban outfielder, Andy Pages was sent into center field for his rocket arm. Pages also shares Miggy’s predicament insofar as no one from his family other than his wife has been granted a visa to see him play in a Dodgers uniform. The bottom of the 9th felt dangerous AF with the heart of the Blue Jays line-up due: Vladdy, Bo Bichette, and grand slam Addison Barger (the name of Adrian’s future spawn). Vladdy popped out, and Bichette knocked a single to left. With Barger working a walk to put runners on first and second, Snell was pulled from the game. Yoshinobu Yamamoto emerged from the dugout a mere 24 hours or so after he saved our skins with a 96 pitch, 6-inning performance. Yoshi hit Kirk with a pitch to load the bases with only one out. Varsho flared a ball to Miggy Ro’ (of course) who threw a laser to Will Smith at home despite falling backwards. Kiner-Falefa, who represented the World Series winning run, was forced out at home. The call withstood a review showing Will Smith’s foot barely tapping the plate before IKF’s foot crossed the threshold. I was having an out of body experience, and I decided to throw all caution to the wind. I abandoned my sequestration and began to watch in earnest as Sarah returned home with some shrimp fried rice, and our friends Fonz and Sabsi. Yoshi and the Dodgers were not out of the woods yet with two outs and the bases loaded. The Blue Jays’ winning run remained a mere 90 feet away when Ernie Clement came up to bat and hit a soaring fly ball over Kiké’s head. Oh shit. That was it… Then Andy Pages barreled over from out of nowhere. He knocked Kiké out cold and made an unbelievable grab to send game seven to extra innings. It looked like we’d be riding Yoshi’s back the whole way: whether it was into the abyss, or off into the sunset remained to be seen. Miracles kept accruing in extras, not at the hands of our MVP $uper$tars, but through the pluck and hustle of our immigrant utility players like Rojas and Pages. Wobbly and surfeit of shrimp fried rice after 10-innings of lucky mezcal sips, I lit some incensio de Santa Fe I restocked from Stories Bookstore in Echo Park–another ritual I haven’t even bothered to mention–right before Will Smith came up to bat in the top of the 11th against Shane Bieber. With the count at 2-0, Smith (who I’ve affectionately called a “zygote” for his baby-faced, nay, fetal features), went YARD on a two-seam slider from the Biebs. Cue Justin’s “Sorry.” We heard Echo Park roar through our windows. A few fireworks prematurely popped off. We still had to get through the bottom half of the 11th. Vlad, first up, doubled off Yoshi and was sac-bunted over to third, bringing the tying run 90 feet away with only one out. Yoshi walked Barger, leaving runs on the corners with only 1 out. Then Alejandro Kirk came up to bat: the same thiccc Blue Jay Adrian and I spoke sweetly of earlier in the series. I found it hard not to root for him, even as I wanted–needed–our team to cross the threshold into dynastic glory so that Yankees and Giants fans would finally STFU about winning three in a single decade (still not gonna happen, but…) Yoshi’s splitter broke Kirk’s bat. The thiccc Jay grounded into a game and series ending double-play fielded by Mookie Betts. I’m pretty sure my soul fled my body long before that, only called back into this mortal coil when massive fireworks erupted next door and across the city, as car horns announced our back-to-back victory. According to my friends, I made humping gestures at the TV (a la Kiké’s 2024 celebration) and spewed a tirade of joyous profanities into the phone when my World Series text circle FaceTimed to celebrate. Deliriously HYPED w/ my friend Fonz at the end of G7. My hair is long and crazy because I refused to cut it until the end of the series, a la Kiké, Sho and others. Adrian and I didn’t talk until the next day, when I posted a fish-in-a-barrell meme about how Drake’s presence cost the Jays the World Series. I presented my theory about why the Blue Jays couldn’t close it out ,even after coming home with a 3-2 lead. Ironically, the fact that they came from behind to win the ALCS when they were down 3-2 to the Mariners saddled them with a memento mori. They learned teams could come back from the brink of death. Having done it themselves left that kernel of doubt in their minds, that little fracture in their own faith, when faced with the task of closing it out. I’m certain the Blue Jays will be back in the thick of things at the end of next season. I know it’s been said, and most people don’t mean it, but it truly was a heartbreak for anyone to lose this series which unfurled, as the kids say, as CINEMA. Before I, too, ride off into the sunset singing that Yoshinobu Yamamoto “ace anthem,” it bears acknowledgement that this wild up-and-down season was owed to some very bad karma the Dodgers invited by visiting Trump’s White House (against many of the players’ will), and responding terribly to ICE’s siege of Los Angeles before trying to make up for it with an ambiguous million dollar donation to “support immigrant families.” The excessive trust Doc Roberts placed in our raging MAGA reliever, Blake Treinen (who wrote Charlie Kirk’s name on his hat, and who many Twitter/Bluesky Dodgers fans call “BlaQe” for his Q-Anonish proclivities), made the prospect of our repeat victory in 2025 less palatable for everyone but us diehards. Last year, we had several storylines propelling our victory against the Yankees, who may be the only team more loathed than us at this point. In 2024, our wounded warrior Freddie Freeman, whose kid nearly died, sacrificed his ravaged body for our redemption. This year we were the “American” team playing against all of Canada. The fascist USA didn’t deserve a win, even if the brown people of L.A. could surely use one. As it turns out, a dogfluencer named Air Corgi predicted we would win it in 7, and we did. As I said in a sweet exchange of messages with Canadian Jeopardy superchamp, Mattea Roach the morning of November 1: “I’d be sad if my team lost the World Series, but I wouldn’t be mad if the Blue Jays won.” Part of me can’t fathom going through all of this again next year, though I liken our willful forgetting of baseball’s exquisite anguish to what people say about childbirth. Pressure is a privilege, in the immortal words of Billie Jean King, part-owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers. Let’s run it back. Illustration by Yunemo Six (@yunemosix) on Bluesky, inspired by the press pool photo I think of as “Yoshi’s Rebirth” AdL: The first of November began with the following New Yorker interaction: a young cashier and I bickered at the GMC while I was picking up Vitamin B12 and D, and when I dared speculate that the Jays might have a real shot at this (which, let’s be real, they were all around the better team). He bellowed, “BUT HAVE YOU HEARD OF SHOHEI OHTANI?” Yes, kid, I hm and judging from his hat, I realized that he was a salty Yankees fan, still incredulous we’d beaten his team. But he did teach me a valuable lesson. The key to loving a baseball team is to drown oneself in delusions of the future. The Yankee variant of this delulu, though, comes down to some good ol’ Appeal To History, my logical fallacy of choice, and that their team would always have a chance at winning because, well, they have the most World Series wins out of any team in history. To spiritually realign myself before G7, I walked north to a bakery that has, begrudgingly, earned my respect. The day, blustery and sunny in equal measure, seemed to demand the soothing balm of a fifteen-dollar fried chicken sandwich from a Frenchman who decided, in defiance of his stern Taiwanese mother-in-law, to specialize in Asian baked goods. They had just launched their cold-weather replacement for their tomato sando, and I include this work of simple genius below, partly to make you jealous and hungry, my kind reader, but also to index what was probably the best part of an otherwise extremely sad day. I’m not gonna rehash my own play-by-play of G7 because, quite frankly, it still sucks to think about. The boo and I were to head to Park Slope to attend a friend’s birthday, vampire themed (broadly construed, but always already queer), and not realizing that the party had monopolized the patio all the way at the back of the bar, we opted to sit at a booth and stream the game on my phone from the (puke) Fox One app. We kept the stream going even when we discovered that the shindig had been going on for a solid hour, and the celebrant was handing out ‘zines and admiring the Sinners-themed vampire costumes, and we kept the stream going in the short two-minute walk across the street to the sports bar, where we would gather with about a hundred fans to watch the seventh game of one of the greatest World Series in history. Up until the end of Trey Yesavage’s inning, I was an absolute riot. But as the Dodgers crawled back up, I set my phone on Do Not Disturb, and I retreated to the corner with unyielding focus on the screen. And when Yoshi walked up to the mound, my fellow Jays faithful (and many allies) noticed my silence and my praying hands, whispering to some god that I stopped believing in when I was eighteen. Not to get too emo, but I saw in Jeff Hoffmann’s face a look of self-disappointment that I knew too well, and when the Dodgers finally won, I tried not to walk up to the Latino man screaming FUCK CANADA all over the silent bar. Even as we caught the Uber home, which we rode silently back into Manhattan, I still wondered if I should have punched the dude in the face with the force of the 49th parallel. This is the closest I’ve ever felt to anything one might call patriotism. Allegedly, as I was informed the next day, we missed a make-out conga line at the party, but neither of us were in the mood to contract mono regardless of whether or not we were celebrating or grieving. And grieve I did. I was inconsolable that night and all the next day, a modicum of the sorrow of my fellow Torontonians must have felt at home, a mere sliver of a sliver of what must have been running through Vladdy’s mind, as he sat in the bullpen after the game alone. I opened my inbox and noticed that my student from Prince Edward Island wrote to me in support during the game, and on Sunday, I wrote him back: At the time of writing, Shane “The Other” Bieber just exercised his player option. I anticipate that other pieces will fall into place, and that the Jays are going to run it back. I hope that, truly, this is their 2014 San Antonio Spurs moment, and they come back with a surgical vengeance and topple the Heatles Dodgers because, as that GNC cashier taught me, these delusions are the ingredients to the most World Series pennants in history. We’ll catch up one day, Yankees, if the planet doesn’t burn first. My dear Echo Park comrade reminds me that a baseball victory is completely arbitrary, and that is the game’s thrill and tragedy. Decades of growing up with losing sports teams were cured by that 2019 Raptors championship, but in that case, it took the efforts of a disgruntled mercenary who ended up moving to the lesser Los Angeles NBA team (for an allegedly illicit deal) after that championship. I wanted this World Series for the Jays because I wanted it for my city, or what always remains of it, in spite of the influx of monied conservative transplants and the violent xenophobia, in spite of a grifting premier more interested in funneling public funds to his cronies instead of making lives more livable. I wanted the World Series for the Jays because I wanted it for Vladdy, especially his childhood self kicked-out of the diamond by a racist Yankees staffer, and for Yesavage, who hotel-hopped for the opportunity of his lifetime, and for the hilarious possibility of an Addison De Leon, any and all genders, any and all species. And most of all, I wanted this World Series for myself, so that my parents and I could have witnessed a Jays victory together before their bodies gave out. (Incidentally, as someone who rocks with the Dodgers when it’s not in the context of going up against the Jays, I can’t really share the same feelings for Springer, I’m sorry to say.) Baseball, as the literary scholar and former MLB commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti once wrote, breaks your heart; it is designed to break your heart. And if you – the multiple yous, from my friend Karen to our editor Sarah and to our future readers – may permit me a moment, please allow me to riff on the late professor’s words here: The Jays’ season began in spring, at the blossom of Vladdy Jr.’s new 14-year contract, filling the airwaves with our Dominican Canadian’s joy, and then as soon as the frigid Toronto torrents came, they stopped and left me to face the hardest autumn of my life alone. I counted on my team, relied on them to buffer the pain of my ailing parent, to keep the memory of train-hopping hooky and living-room cheers alive, and then, just when the days and elderly lives were at their twilight, when I needed them the most, they lost. Karen Tongson‘s gender is Totino’s Party Pizza. Adrian De Leon is a writer and a shit disturber, which is Canadian for “double Scorpio.” Lead image: Via WikiMedia 2025 World Series Toronto Blue Jays and Los Angeles Dodgers New Era 59Fifty caps NEW ERA SHIBUYA 2025年11月10日の渋谷 202511101805 IMG 2150.jpg Related Posts About Avidly Submissions Avidly Reads Short Book Series Los Angeles Review of Books

PHOTO: AFP Published Nov 15, 2025, 09:45 PM Updated Nov 16, 2025, 08:15 PM NEW YORK - The US shutdown has ended, but the hangover is just beginning for investors, who worry gaps in economic data will delay or even derail Federal Reserve rate cuts just as concerns over lofty AI stock valuations have put fresh pressure on companies’ stocks and bonds. Unease drove the heaviest sell-off for the rate-sensitive Nasdaq in a month on Nov 13. The index, which has soared in 2025 with booming AI shares, is down about 4 per cent from October’s peak. Pressure continued in early trade on Nov 14, with blue chip bourses from Tokyo to Paris and London deep in the red, but eased later in the day with the S&P 500 ending slightly lower and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.13 per cent. Even gold and Bitcoin were not spared, the latter hitting lows last seen in May. Credit spreads – or the premium over US Treasuries paid by companies to issue bonds in the US market – widened earlier in November. “The market certainly has some froth both in terms of valuations and expectations”, said Mr Michael McGowan, managing director of investment strategy at Pathstone. “I think there’s a healthy scepticism coming into the market and you could certainly see that continue to play out a little more,” he said. The problem is being exacerbated by an information vacuum that ranges from futures positioning to crop estimates and in particular job and price figures, some of which were not collected during the 43 days of shutdown. There is doubt about the publication of October’s inflation data and the employment report for that month will not include the jobless rate, White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said, because the household survey from which it is calculated was not conducted. On Nov 14, the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labour Statistics announced they would begin releasing data skipped over during the shutdown starting next week. Employment data for September, which had been scheduled for release on Oct 3, will be published on Nov 20. The gaps in the data matter for markets because Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has likened the situation to “driving in the fog” and flagged that policymakers are likely to “slow down” in response, or in other words hold rather than cut interest rates, after two consecutive cuts in September and October. Mr Tim Horan, chief investment officer of fixed income at Chilton Trust, said: “We were able to see a September cut and an October cut because they felt confident in their direction of travel for inflation... Will they have that confidence at the December meeting with the lack of data points?” Expectations for a 25-basis point rate cut in December, seen as a sure thing a month ago, are down to about 46 per cent, according to CME’s FedWatch tool. “We’ve obviously had a huge rally in the market from the April trough, and it’s pretty much been uninterrupted,” said Mr Matt Sherwood, head of investment strategy at Perpetual in Sydney. “(It) requires Fed rate cuts and sustained easy financial conditions to justify what I think are extreme valuations.” The forward price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P 500, based on earnings estimates for the next 12 months, is currently around 22.8 times, well above its 10-year average of 18.8, according to LSEG Datastream. Together with year-to-date gains above 20 per cent in hard-running sectors such as technology, it also does not take much for investors to want to lock in some gains. Already, the mood has turned fickle and darlings such as Palantir and Oracle have logged losses around 12 per cent and 14 per cent, respectively, in November. Chipmaker Nvidia is down 6 per cent. Nvidia’s results next week are critical, given the stock has been at the fore of the record-breaking stock rally in 2025. “We’re at a time of year here where any kind of downside might ripple a little bit further in certain sectors that have really put up big numbers this year, as you’re going to have some trigger fingers to take some profits off the table,” said Mr Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. Meanwhile, Mr Michael Burry’s decision to close his hedge fund Scion Asset Management on Nov 13 added to jitters over frothy AI valuations. He has argued that tech giants pouring billions into Nvidia chips and servers are quietly stretching out depreciation schedules to make earnings look smoother. Valuation concerns spilled over into corporate debt markets, too. Bonds issued by Oracle Corp have taken a hit in recent days as concerns rise over the cloud and AI giant’s huge debt issuance to further fund its AI infrastructure. Hedge funds disclosed their third-quarter positioning on Nov 14 with some showing possible bearishness on tech. Tiger Global Management, the hedge fund founded and led by Mr Chase Coleman, showed it slashed its stake in Facebook parent Meta Platforms. During the shutdown, the data void shot previously little-followed private surveys to prominence and painted a mixed picture of the economy where spending appears to be holding up but, on some measures, layoffs have surged. Investors have struggled to draw conclusions and have stuck with expectations for at least three cuts by the end of 2026 to take rates to about 3 per cent. Analysts say that view is likely to face pressure, especially as a growing number of policymakers are sounding reticent on rate cuts. “The Fed is flying blind as we are,” said Mr Bob Savage, head of markets macro strategy at BNY in New York.

Title: Job Prospects for 2026 College Grads to Hit 5-Year Low While Employers Eye AI, Foreign Labor
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2025/11/14/job-prospects-2026-college-grads-hit-five-year-low-employers-eye-ai-foreign-labor/
Time Published: 2025-11-15T02:52:25Z
Full Content:
The outlook for the college graduating class of 2026 has dimmed sharply as data shows employer hiring plans have stalled, job market ratings have slipped, and workforce competition has intensified due to automation and visa-based labor programs. According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, based on data from the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE), employers project the job market for 2026 graduates will be the weakest in half a decade. A survey conducted among 183 companies between August 7 and September 22 found that 51 percent of respondents rated the job market for new graduates as “poor” or “fair,” a sentiment not seen at this level since the COVID-19-era downturn in 2020-21. Only two percent of employers rated the market as “excellent.” The hiring slowdown follows a wave of large-scale layoffs from major employers, including Amazon, UPS, and Verizon — the latter reportedly preparing to cut 15,000 jobs, its largest workforce reduction ever. While overall hiring for 2026 graduates is technically expected to increase by 1.6 percent, that marks a steep drop from earlier projections for the Class of 2025. Historical trends show that spring hiring often falls short of earlier fall estimates. The divergence is reflected in NACE’s year-over-year hiring projections: from a near 30 percent jump in 2022 spring plans compared to 2021, projections have since plummeted, including a contraction for the Class of 2024. According to data from job platform Handshake, full-time job postings in August dropped over 16 percent year-over-year, while applications per job rose 26 percent. Over 60 percent of 2026 graduates surveyed reported pessimism about their career outlooks. Former recruiter Giavanna Vega, who was laid off from Automation Anywhere in 2023, said companies “don’t know where to invest” amid AI uncertainty and tariffs. “They don’t have the training,” she remarked about recent graduates, many of whom are being passed over for roles that are increasingly filled by laid-off mid-career professionals. The unemployment rate for recent graduates hit 4.8 percent in June, the highest in four years and above the national average. New college graduates are now not only competing with each other, but also with recently laid-off workers and foreign graduates entering the U.S. workforce through visa programs. Rising scrutiny of visa programs such as H-1B and OPT (Optional Practical Training) has enabled hundreds of thousands of foreign graduates to work in U.S. jobs originally intended for American college students. The Department of Justice (DOJ) under Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon has pledged increased enforcement of longstanding visa-related laws to curb what officials describe as the systemic replacement of domestic talent. Eric Sell, a senior lawyer at the DOJ Civil Rights Division, emphasized that the administration is determined to hold companies accountable for how they treat American workers, especially during periods of economic upheaval and rapid technological change. He stressed that under President Donald Trump’s leadership, technological advancement would “never be used as an excuse to forget the workers that built this country,” and he warned that those attempting to exploit chaotic growth for corporate gain “will be held accountable.” Public frustration has been intensifying. A new Cygnal poll finds that 44 percent of likely voters say companies exploit the H-1B system. Among swing voters, 43 percent agree with that assessment. Notably, the backlash against these visa programs is strongest among working-class Americans and voters without a college degree, key electoral constituencies ahead of the 2026 midterms. In 2024 alone, the Biden administration approved work permits for approximately 400,000 foreign college graduates through the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program — a 45 percent increase from 2020 levels under President Trump. Former U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joe Edlow and other Trump administration officials have warned that programs like OPT are depressing wages and displacing American graduates, particularly in high-demand STEM and business fields. The pipeline from foreign student to U.S. worker also begins at the admissions level. Breitbart News opinion contributor Rich Kaye questioned why taxpayer-funded public universities are increasingly filling seats with international students who later convert F-1 student visas into work permits. “When a public university replaces a Georgia student with an F‑1 student in a high‑demand field,” Kaye wrote, “it increases the pipeline pressure tomorrow for H‑1B allocations in exactly the sectors where Americans could be trained to fill roles.” That pressure is already being felt by recent graduates like Nalin Haley, who told UnHerd that many in his peer group are struggling just to get started. “It’s been a year and a half, and not one of them has a job — not one,” he stated. “I’m angry at that, because I’m having to try and help my friends get jobs when their parents got jobs immediately — not just after graduating college, but out of high school.” Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.

Title: ICE has not yet purchased translation technology promised for new agents

© 2025 NBCNEWS.COM news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Immigration and Customs and Enforcement has yet to purchase new translation technology that it promised would replace a Spanish-language course requirement for officers as part of an effort to speed up the agency’s hiring process, according to two Department of Homeland Security officials. In August, ICE officials told reporters that the agency had purchased new, “robust translation services” for officers to use in the field while pursuing immigration arrests as part of President Donald Trump’s deportation policy. Caleb Vitello, who was the head of training for new ICE recruits at the time, described the new technology as “so much more efficient” than the five-week Spanish course. ICE had considered providing officers with AI-powered translation services that can be used on body-worn cameras but has not purchased any, the two DHS officials said. The lack of Spanish classes or the body-worn translation devices for new ICE officers as they carry out arrests has sparked concern about potential communication misunderstandings that could endanger the agents and people in the communities they are targeting, the officials said. The Trump administration has sought to speed up ICE’s hiring process to meet its goal of hiring 10,000 new officers by the end of the year. An ICE spokesperson said in a statement that ICE has replaced the five-week Spanish course that was until July required for new officers with “a more robust translation service,” but declined to say what type of translation services the agency provides. The agency has relied on a translation service hotline that officers can call when processing immigrants in an office setting, which it continues to use, the DHS officials said. “Language classes, which previously covered only a specific dialect of Spanish, have been replaced with robust translation and interpretation services that apply to multiple languages,” an ICE spokesperson said in a statement. “ICE frequently encounters native speakers of a diverse range of languages, so modern technology-based solutions are more efficient resources in the field.” The U.S. Border Patrol still mandates Spanish training for new agents, according to the Office of Personnel Management. The body-worn translation technology combines body cameras many officers already wear on their vests with AI translation tools and can detect up to 50 languages. To use it, an officer pushes a button on the body camera and directs it to translate whatever language is being spoken. An AI-generated voice then repeats the words in English. While ICE so far has not provided new agents the devices, more than 200 police departments across the country are embracing the new technology. The police department in Joliet, Illinois, a city of 150,000 located about an hour outside of Chicago, in June began using the devices, which are developed by Axon Enterprise. Officials at the department told NBC News that its officers have used the device in more than 1,800 encounters involving 23 different languages. Officer Charles Moore said having them has helped build the community’s trust in local law enforcement. “Seeing people when they know that they’re understood, you see their faces light up,” Moore said in an interview with NBC News. Multiple confrontations involving federal agents and migrants in major U.S. cities have turned violent in recent months, though it’s unclear whether language problems may have contributed to them. In one of the latest cases to garner attention, a Mexican man and a deputy marshal were shot after a federal agent opened fire while attempting to arrest the man in downtown Los Angeles earlier this week, prosecutors said. Both are expected to recover. Jason Houser, who served as ICE chief of staff in the Biden administration, said a lack of basic Spanish-language skills for agents increases the chances of dangerous encounters. “That puts both the migrant at risk and potentially law enforcement as you’re taking away the capability for them to openly communicate with those that they interact with,” Houser said. With 65 million Latinos in the U.S., it’s increasingly common for police departments to mandate Spanish-language training. Most police departments in large cities require it. And in Texas, it’s mandatory for all police officers. In March 2025, under the Biden administration, ICE announced a pilot program to roll out body cameras to 1,600 out of 6,500 ICE officers. The Trump administration has made no publicized efforts to go beyond that initial 1,600. In addition to helping to safeguard law enforcement officers, language translation could reduce confusion for members of the public, immigration advocates and attorneys say. In August, Raquel Sanchez and her husband were driving to work in Washington, D.C., when they say they were stopped by seven unmarked ICE vehicles. An agent at her car door yelled, “What’s your status in the United States?” In the recording of the encounter, she and her husband struggled to respond because they don’t speak English, and the agents didn’t know Spanish. “I would ask them if we could talk in Spanish, but they kept talking in English,” she said in a phone interview with NBC News. Sanchez said she and her husband were handcuffed and driven an hour away to an ICE processing facility. She said she told the officers they had teenage boys at home, and her lawyer successfully pushed for her to be released with an ankle monitor. Her husband was moved to an ICE detention center a few hours away, according to Sanchez and her lawyer. In a statement, an ICE spokesperson said, “ICE makes arrests based on probable cause, and if officers know you are the target, they will make the arrest. If the subject is unknown, there are a number of ways to establish reasonable suspicion and probable cause.” “Additionally, ICE makes custody determination after arrest, which may include referring an illegal alien to ATD, depending on specific circumstances, such as medical needs,” the ICE spokesperson said, referring to alternatives to detention such as an ankle monitor. The police department in Corpus Christi, Texas, where less than half of its 260 officers are native Spanish speakers, uses the Axon AI-generated translation devices. Lt. Jose Gonzalez, who oversees professional standards for the department, said as a native Spanish speaker he was skeptical of the new technology. But after seeing how it’s helped officers in the field over the past few months, he’s now a believer. “It’s very important, because if you can’t communicate with someone during a traffic stop, you can’t figure out if there are weapons in the car,” Gonzalez said. Even so, Gonzalez noted that no technology is foolproof. “What if your camera malfunctions?” he said. “You have to have a foundation to still communicate.” Cristina Lozano Argüelles, an assistant professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, agrees. She called the new AI translation technology “exciting” but does not think it should replace Spanish training. “Spanish-language training for law enforcement isn’t just about learning vocabulary — it’s about building trust,” Argüelles said. “When officers can communicate directly with Spanish-speaking residents, interactions can be calmer, more respectful and more effective.” Laura Strickler is the senior investigative producer on the national security team where she produces television stories and writes for NBCNews.com.

Title: The Bubble Teeters
URL: https://dailyreckoning.com/the-bubble-teeters/
Time Published: 2025-11-14T23:00:52Z
Full Content:
By Adam Sharp PostedNovember 14, 2025 Is the stock market bubble about to burst? It has seemed that way a few times over the past year, but so far each selloff has proved to be a blip on a relentless climb upwards. But now we’re starting to see signs of weakness in the sector that’s driving markets higher: AI/tech. Investors are beginning to digest that there’s simply not enough electricity in America to support endless new data center construction. And all the debt being raised by “hyperscalers” like Oracle and Meta is causing skeptics to question whether ROI will ever materialize. OpenAI’s co-founder/CEO Sam Altman raised eyebrows back on November 2nd when he seemingly had no answer about how he planned to spend $1.4 trillion on infrastructure with around $20 billion in annual revenue (and huge losses). Could this be the beginning stages of a crash? Sure. Alternatively, could it be another bear trap, like we saw in March/April? Also yes. Today we’re going to survey the latest market action, take a worrying look at the health of the American economy, and review ways to hedge for a crash (without necessarily shorting). The Magnificent 7 (Apple, Amazon, NVIDIA, Alphabet/Google, Meta, Tesla, Microsoft) are down around 10% from the highs, on average. A fairly typical correction so far. But second-tier AI/tech plays are taking larger hits. These stocks were red hot just a few months ago: The most speculative sectors of the market have taken a beating over the past few weeks. Whether this drawdown is the start of a crash, or a simple correction remains to be seen. I’m not buying the dip in U.S. tech or broad markets, nor do I plan to anytime soon. But I’m not shorting it in size either. This week I bought a few puts, but they’re very small for now. Just testing the water with some hedges. Eventually the time may come for a more substantial short position, but we’re not there yet. The risk of a “blow-off top” before the bubble pops is still there. My plan hasn’t changed. I’m heavily positioned in precious metals, miners, hard assets, and select emerging markets. With some cash on hand to take advantage of any market dislocations. One of the most concerning signals is seeing the real American economy barely treading water, despite record stock market strength. First up, layoffs are spiking: Source: Charlie Bilello We’re not at 2008 or 2020 levels yet, but the recent pace of layoff announcements is disturbing. And the most recent consumer sentiment survey out of the University of Michigan is hideous. It’s at the second-lowest level in the survey’s history going back to 1952. Source: UMich Consumers are burnt out. Inflation and a weak job market have taken their toll. And if sentiment is this bad during a bubble, what happens if we get a crash and recession? It’s unusual to see sentiment so low with stocks so high. Another sign that all is not well is the fact that the median U.S. homebuyer is now 59 years old. In 1980, that number was 31. Young people are priced out of the housing market. And as the chart below shows, this is having devastating effects on the percentage of 30-year-olds who are both married and homeowners. From 52% in 1950 to 13% today. A shameful indictment of our country’s trajectory. Despite stocks near record highs, all is not well beneath the surface. This is not a market where I want to be in overpriced stocks. I want plenty of exposure to precious metals and miners. And cheap emerging market stocks with fat yields, like Brazil. Of course, I do have some exposure to U.S. markets, mostly through retirement accounts. But during times like these, I want to hedge that exposure with alternative investments. Because when crashes happen, the hottest stocks get hit the hardest. And based on everything I’m seeing, we’re overdue. Remember that in mid-2022, markets were falling sharply. The Nasdaq 100 had dropped about 33% from its highs in late 2021. In November of 2022, OpenAI released ChatGPT, giving birth to the AI bubble. Since then the Nasdaq 100 is up 130%. AI saved the stock market, for a while at least. If investors begin to lose faith in the AI story, it could spell trouble. When we add in the economic signals above, I’m maintaining a bearish outlook.

Title: Why These Wall Street Experts Expect Big Things From Nvidia's Earnings Report Next Week

Nvidia (NVDA) is set to report its latest earnings after the market closes next Wednesday, and analysts are expecting big things. Analysts from Jefferies and Wedbush have each said in recent notes that they expect the artificial intelligence giant to "beat and raise," or report better financial metrics than analysts have projected and lift their future forecasts. "Hyperscale capex spending results for Q3 generally exceeded expectations," Wedbush analysts wrote, maintaining their $210 price target. "More importantly, the large hyperscalers nearly ubiquitously talked to an expectation of increasing spending trends into future periods as they continue to expand investment to support their AI efforts." Nvidia shares closed nearly 2% higher on Friday at around $190. The stock has gained 42% since the start of the year, far outpacing the gains of the benchmark S&P 500 index. Nvidia is the most valuable company on the market today, meaning its stock likely has an outsized impact on your portfolio, and potentially your retirement. The chipmaker's performance in quarterly earnings can affect the stock prices of a range of companies involved in the AI sector. The Wedbush analysts said that much of the growth in spending from "hyperscalers" such as Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) seems to end up being funneled to Nvidia, as the chipmaker "supplies a disproportionate amount of the AI server value." However, some investors and analysts are starting to question how much the biggest tech companies should be willing to spend before they see a clearer path to getting a return on their investment into AI. Meanwhile, many market participants have been looking for signs of a bubble. Bank of America analysts, keeping their price target at $275, said they expect Nvidia executives to reassure investors about their ability to meet demand, and said the company is facing high earnings expectations and growing skepticism around AI spending. Nvidia is expected to report adjusted earnings per share of $1.26 on revenue of $55.28 billion, each up more than 55% from the same time a year ago, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Data center revenue, the chips Nvidia sells that other companies buy to train and run a variety of AI models, is expected to grow 61% and make up $49.53 billion of Nvidia's revenue. Oppenheimer analysts lifted their price target for Nvidia earlier this week, calling the chipmaker the single company that is "best positioned to win" in the AI sector.

Oppenheimer analysts lifted their price target for Nvidia earlier this week, calling the chipmaker the single company that is "best positioned to win" in the AI sector.

Title: Should you worry about an AI bubble? Investment pros weigh in.

Watch CBS News Updated on: November 18, 2025 / 4:13 PM EST / CBS News Artificial intelligence has fired the stock market to record highs this year, with companies eager to tout their AI prowess and investor darlings like AI chipmaker Nvidia soaring on expectations of runaway growth. But a tinge of fear is starting to shadow that exuberance. Stocks have slumped this week as investors fret that the AI boom could go bust, with the S&P 500 on Nov. 18 dipping 0.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 1.1% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite sinking 1.2%. The startling run-up in AI-related stocks is prompting comparisons to the dot-com era of the late 1990s, when many internet companies saw their stock prices skyrocket despite suffering vast financial losses. When that bubble burst in the early 2000s, it took down former high-fliers like Pets.com, torched investor portfolios and triggered a recession. Bubbles occur when stocks surge on inflated growth expectations that ultimately prove to be disconnected from a company's underlying fundamentals, a painful reality check that typically ends with overhyped shares falling back to Earth. Beyond the stock market, economists are also questioning whether AI will turn out to be as transformative for businesses as proponents of the technology insist. Advocates say AI will spur a productivity boom, leading to stronger corporate growth and profitability. "The stock market is a giant bet on AI right now. It's really 10 companies that are driving all of it," Rebecca Homkes, an economist and lecturer at the London Business School, told CBS News. In other words, this year's 15% gain in the S&P 500 is largely due to a handful of tech giants that are heavily investing in AI. The combined market capitalization of the so-called "Magnificent 7" — Google-owner Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla — today represents a record 37% of the S&P 500's total value, according to Morningstar. Analysis and opinion from The Free Press: That may give pause to the millions of Americans who are saving for retirement in 401(k) and other plans. If the market's gains lean so heavily on a few dominant companies, as during the dot-com bubble, the fallout could be severe if investors suddenly sour on AI. "No one wants to be caught dancing after the music has stopped," Aaron Schaechterle, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, said in an email. Still, today's stock valuations aren't nearly as stretched as they were in the late 1990s, Goldman Sachs analysts note. The investment bank's analysis of the Magnificent 7's median price-to-earnings ratio — a measure of a company's share price compared to its profits — found it is "roughly half" that of the largest seven companies in the late 1990s. "So it is true that valuations are high but, in our view, generally not at levels that are as high as are typically seen at the height of a financial bubble," they noted. The question of whether AI is fueling a bubble akin to the late 1990s was even posed to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the central bank's Oct. 29 meeting. "This is different in the sense that these companies — the companies that are so highly valued — actually have earnings and stuff like that," Powell said. "So you go back to the '90s and the dot-com [period]... these were ideas rather than companies." Nvidia, for example, the AI boom's poster child, has seen its revenue more than double to $130 billion in its last fiscal year, while its profit surged 145%. Although the stock market may not be in imminent danger of a bubble-bursting crash, economists are increasingly questioning whether AI companies can live up to the hype, as well as justify the trillions in capital spending on the data centers and other infrastructure required to power the AI revolution. For these bets to pay off, AI will need to transform U.S. businesses by spurring a productivity boom that translates into stronger corporate growth and profitability, experts say. "We want to understand whether this is storytelling or actual tangible gains," Homkes of the London Business School told CBS News. For tech evangelists like Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, the AI boom will lead to a "4th industrial revolution" that could supercharge economic growth. "This is an AI Arms Race, and what is fueling this next chapter of growth is Big Tech spending and that is NOT slowing down into 2026," he wrote this week in a research note. "The doubters need to come on board and recognize this is a transformational technology," Homkes agreed, while noting that such a shift is likely to take much longer than some AI boosters currently envision.

Title: NYC Comptroller Brad Lander Presses Spotify On ICE Recruitment Ads

We'll keep digging -- no matter who wants the truth buried. Become a HuffPost member and fuel reporting they can’t silence. Already a member? Log in to hide these messages. Senior Reporter, HuffPost National Desk New York City’s chief financial officer wrote to Spotify on Thursday to press the company for details about the recruitment ads for Immigration and Customs Enforcement that have been running on the platform in recent weeks. Comptroller Brad Lander, a recent mayoral candidate and notable supporter of Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, wrote to Spotify “about recent developments that may violate Spotify’s advertising policies and impact long-term shareholder value.” Specifically, Lander wants to know about ICE recruitment ads on Spotify, which he wrote have “sparked widespread backlash and at least one major national organization is urging Spotify users to cancel their subscription,” a reference to Indivisible’s “Don’t Stream Fascism: Cancel Spotify” campaign. “In too many cities, dangerous illegals walk free as police are forced to stand down,” says one version of the ad, which was recorded by a TikTok user and archived by fact-checking site Snopes. “Join ICE and help us catch the worst of the worst, with bonuses up to $50,000 and generous benefits. Apply now.” “From a fiduciary perspective,” Lander wrote, he is “concerned about the reputational risks these ads may create for the company, which could hamper long-term growth, and [wants] to better understand how the company assessed these ads against the company’s stated advertising policies.” Lander wrote that the pension funds “hold significant investments in Spotify.” A spokesperson for his office said that, taken together, the funds have 691,681 shares of Spotify, worth $482,793,542 as of Sept. 30. Spotify’s share price has fallen slightly since then. A Spotify spokesperson told HuffPost in a statement: “This ad itself is part of a wider campaign from the U.S. government running across multiple platforms, including television, streaming, and online channels. Users can help control their ad experience by liking or disliking an ad or by logging into their account via web browser and updating their ad preferences.” Lander’s letter asks Spotify how it assessed the ads’ against company policy prohibiting “systemic discrimination and marginalization,” and whether the company has assessed “the impact of this controversy on subscriber retention, artist relationships, or brand perception,” among other inquiries. “Hopefully what we’ll get is good answers to the questions we’re asking,” Lander told HuffPost in an interview Friday morning. He characterized the letter as an initial engagement between a representative of New York City employee pension funds — as comptroller, Lander is a trustee of each of the five funds — and a company in which those funds have an investment stake. If Spotify doesn’t have a satisfactory response to his questions, Lander said, the city’s funds could work with other investors to press Spotify for answers or consider a shareholder resolution to do so. “In some cases [in the past], where we have been unable to get answers we are looking for, or have a satisfactory engagement, we have divested from, or sold the stock of, particular companies or sectors,” he said. “We only do that after a lot of engagement. Our strong preference is to use our position as investors to reach resolution. We do this from a responsible fiduciary perspective, believing that what we’re doing is helping increase the value of the companies we’re invested in … we’re just starting here, this is the first letter we’re writing.” The comptroller said he is concerned with systemic discrimination in the Trump administration’s “mass deportation” agenda — “and that includes any ads,” he said. “The mass deportation effort involves a broadscale hiring effort to make ICE the largest law enforcement agency in American history.” Lander noted a trend of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents being arrested by immigration agents. “Essentially every time, [it is] a person of color, without, so far as we can tell, lawful basis for many of the arrests,” he said. “If you are conducting arrests without lawful basis, and they are consistently of people of one ethnicity, that is a systemic civil rights violation — and I believe these ads are part of it,” he added. The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, doesn’t advertise exclusively with Spotify. Recruitment ads to become an immigration agent have also appeared on platforms including X, YouTube, LinkedIn and Meta, and on cable television, The Independent noted. Separately, DHS has spent millions of dollars on advertising pressuring people to “self-deport.” Lander said Thursday’s letter was specifically regarding Spotify’s “quite strong anti-discrimination policy — and we’re asking for how they assess these ads against that.” Lander’s letter amounts to a shot across the bow for Spotify. As comptroller, he has a legal “fiduciary” obligation to act in the best financial interests of New York City’s pension funds. As well as trustee, the comptroller serves as an investment advisor and custodian for the five funds — one each for police, firefighters, educators, non-pedagogical educational workers, and other city workers. While he does not have unilateral control over the pension funds, he has influence over the funds’ administration. Lander noted that the five funds’ responsible investing program is staffed by the comptroller’s office and that “we do a letter like this in consultation with our boards.” Combined, the funds have over $300 billion in assets under management, making them the fourth largest public pension plan in the country, according to the comptroller’s office. Lander’s office shared the letter, which is addressed to Spotify CEO Daniel Ek, with HuffPost. Lander himself has been arrested by federal agents twice in recent months at the immigration court in lower Manhattan, where agents have been systematically arresting migrants showing up for scheduled court check-ins — and where Lander frequently observes proceedings. “We owe it to the families of those detained — and every New Yorker impacted by Donald Trump’s mass deportation machine — to keep showing up and demanding accountability for the violence, cruelty, and lawless abduction of our neighbors,” he said last month after pressing DHS for answers about the return to duty of one particularly violent officer. Spotify isn’t only facing pressure over the ICE advertisements. Ek’s venture capital firm, Prima Materia, recently led a 600 million euro funding round for Helsing, a European military technology company, which led to an exodus of artists from the platform. Ek is also chairman of Helsing. We believe our mission of independent journalism has never been more important.

Title: Walmart's CEO retires: How Doug McMillion transformed the retail giant

Time Published: 2025-11-14T18:32:35Z
Full Content:
David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images With Walmart CEO Doug McMillon set to retire early next year and be replaced by company veteran John Furner, it’s worth a look at where the company stands after McMillon’s 11-year tenure at the helm. McMillon has left a significant mark on Walmart and on the wider retail sector. David Haigh, CEO at Brand Finance, a London-based brand valuation company, provides some numbers that Walmart racked up under McMillon’s leadership: Walmart’s stock price is also a big piece of McMillon’s legacy. During his tenure, Walmart's shares rose by 310%, beating both the S&P 500 and its retail competitors. “The retirement of Doug McMillon will send a small shock wave through Walmart, simply because he has been an excellent leader and steward of the company,” Neil Saunders, a managing director at retail analytics firm GlobalData, said in a new research note. When McMillon early next year, it will mark the end of a transformational era under his watch. “McMillon took over at a moment when Amazon was rising and consumer expectations were shifting, and he leaves the company significantly more digital, data-driven, and global than when he arrived,” said Kaveh Vahdat, founder and president at RiseOpp, a marketing strategies company. “For Walmart, the change in leadership brings both opportunity and risk: The business is stronger, but the playbook must now evolve under a new era of margin pressure and economic uncertainty.” Business experts say McMillon was particularly innovative and visionary in implementing these strategic windfalls for Walmart. McMillon’s “try often, fail fast” mindset abandoned Walmart’s historically risk-averse management posture. “That strategy wasn’t about slogans but about creating enough internal permission to modernize at scale,” said Louisa Loran, a corporate transformational growth specialist and author of the book Leadership Anatomy in Motion. “It’s why automation could be framed as a partnership rather than a threat, and why the digital build-out didn’t fracture Walmart’s culture.” Now Furner will inherit that environment, with an operational foundation designed for accelerated performance, not a reset. “This succession signals that Walmart has crossed an important threshold: moving from the hard lift of transformation into a phase of confident expansion, driving margin expansion,” Loran said. During his tenure, McMillon leveraged that risk-taking management style to form key partnerships with Google’s Waymo, along with Uber and Lyft for product deliveries, among other deals. One of McMillon’s biggest operational shifts was turning Walmart into a hybrid organization, part retailer and part technology platform. “That change improved speed and visibility across the supply chain, but it also blurred the company’s identity and stretched its management structure,” Vahdat said. “Under his leadership, Walmart became much better at connecting digital and physical retail, yet keeping margins steady became more difficult as logistics and technology spending grew.” Walmart is almost unrecognizable from the company McMillon inherited, and that’s a big advantage for Furner. “A decade ago, Walmart was a legacy brick-and-mortar powerhouse with a bad reputation for underpaying workers and being the ultimate cheap discounter, struggling to define its digital strategy,” said Shawn Cole, co-founder at Cowen Partners Executive Search. “Today, it operates much more like a tech-enabled logistics company, akin to Amazon, that happens to have stores attached.” Culturally, McMillon transformed Walmart from a defensive to an innovative company. “The place was depressed, executives were embarrassed to say they worked there, and competitors didn’t see Walmart as a serious strategic threat,” Cole said. “McMillon brought in tech-heavy, younger leadership and made real investments in frontline employees.” Operationally, McMillon made a significant impact across other key C-suite areas. “He built a real e-commerce business, modernized the supply chain into an advanced logistics network, and drove Walmart into higher-margin digital plays, including marketplace, advertising, and services, all wrapped in a true omnichannel model,” Cole said. Furner, who has been the CEO of Walmart U.S., should be a big beneficiary of McMillon's leadership and his innovative vision for the retail giant — and those advantages should kick in right away. “Stepping aside now with a clear internal successor in John Furner and a multi-year advisory role, is succession planning done right,” Cole said. “It gives the next CEO a runway while the company is strong and locks in McMillon’s legacy as the leader who modernized Walmart instead of the one who stayed too long.” For the retail sector, McMillon’s exit underscores that the job description for a big-box CEO has permanently shifted toward technology, data, and supply-chain sophistication. “Going forward,” Cole said, “corporate boards will use this transition as a template.”

by Jason Lemkin | Blog Posts We’re back! Harry, Rory and Jason! The venture capital playbook is broken. Not bent — broken. In the latest 20VC x SaaStr episode, Harry Stebbings, Jason Lemkin, and Rory O’Driscoll dissect why even Sequoia is making dramatic leadership changes, why seed investing at $50M pre-money might not work anymore, and what it actually takes to build venture returns in the age of AI. This isn’t your typical venture conversation about “exciting trends.” This is three investors with $3+ billion in combined AUM telling you what’s actually working, what’s spectacularly failing, and why the old playbook from 2015-2022 is now a liability. On Venture Capital Evolution: On AI Investment Strategy: On Deal Dynamics: On Portfolio Construction: On Fundraising Process: On Market Dynamics: When Sequoia replaced Roelof Botha as managing partner after just three years with Pat Grady and Alfred Lin in a split leadership structure, the venture world noticed. But the reaction from our panel was telling: this wasn’t about interpersonal drama or normal succession planning. “Whenever you have a CEO change happening in venture, it’s because something isn’t working,” Rory stated bluntly. “This is dissatisfaction about how the firm is doing relative to the competition. They missed some rounds and some deals. They passed on some great companies.” But rather than viewing this as a Sequoia-specific challenge, the panel sees it as symptomatic of a broader industry issue. “More people should be stepping aside today,” Jason argues. “VCs, executives, founders. Most folks from the last decade or 15 years are not the right people for the next decade. I genuinely believe it across my ecosystem. I struggle to even recommend a lot of the CROs and executives I know for roles today.” Rory adds context: “The pace of evolution is so fast. If you decide what I knew 6 months ago is still useful, you’re probably going to be wrong very quickly. That’s what I find the most stressful about right now.” The meta-lesson? Even the best firms are struggling to keep pace with AI, which means everyone else should be asking themselves hard questions about whether they’re still the right people for this moment. And Sequoia gets credit for one thing: ruthless decisiveness. “They did not do that fatal error of saying it’s someone’s turn so we’ll leave him in,” Rory notes. “They ruthlessly said, if we’re going to compete, we need these people, not those people.” Michael Burry made headlines (again) by shorting Nvidia and Palantir to the tune of $1.1 billion. Unlike most pundits who just discussed whether he’d be right, Jason actually did the math on what it takes to make money on these bets. “It brings home how hard a business it is to bet against AI capex,” Jason concludes. “You not just got to be right, but you got to be right on timing.” Rory’s take: “It’s easy to be roughly right. It’s very hard to imagine that the AI capex boom doesn’t have a significant correction. But going from that kind of armchair podcast statement to actually being able to make money on it — that’s damn hard.” The counterpoint to all this short-selling cynicism? The revenue is actually showing up. OpenAI is projected to hit $20B ARR this year, while Anthropic projects $70B ARR by 2028. The growth rates aren’t just holding — they’re accelerating. Harry drives this home: “Are we being overly British? Are we looking for a problem that’s not there? The revenue is showing up in billions.” The lesson: It’s intellectually easy to be a skeptic about AI valuations. It’s financially hard to make money being that skeptic. And meanwhile, the actual revenue keeps proving the bulls right. Few stories capture the AI revenue opportunity better than Gamma’s latest round. The company raised $100M at a $2.1B valuation, having hit $100M in revenue with just 50 people and 2 million users. Harry, Jason, and Rory are such a great combo. One of the top shows every single week. https://t.co/NB29EhA02T — Grant Lee (@thisisgrantlee) November 13, 2025 Jason and Team SaaStr are super-users and he walks through exactly how they use it at SaaStr: “Instead of sending sponsors the same dated prospectus, Gamma automatically pulls all of our data from Salesforce and our marketing automation system. It knows the exact number of leads and ROI. It knows who their competitors are and makes a fully dynamic piece of collateral in about 10 minutes.” Here’s the math that’s important: SaaStr pays $100/month for Gamma — $1,200 per year. That’s stealth TAM expansion. “How much do we spend for Google Slides? Zero. It’s built in. How much do we spend on PowerPoint? I don’t even know where my key is to Microsoft Office. So it is a stealth TAM expansion.” But Jason’s most important insight is about what’s coming next: “The lame thing about co-pilots is they were just tools. When the AI is part of your team for real, not VC talk, the amount of revenue that it’s accessible is so high.” He distinguishes between AI as a tool versus AI as a team member: “It is sufficiently autonomous, knowledgeable and powerful to complete material high-value tasks on its own with some daily discussions just like on our team. The level of autonomy and capability — Gamma, go into my Google Calendar, create prospectuses and sales collateral for all 20 sales calls this week, pull all the data from Salesforce and HubSpot and Marketo, review once, and distribute to the team.” But there’s a warning embedded in Gamma’s story too. Canva now has a Gamma clone that’s “pretty good.” The competitive response time has collapsed from years to months or even weeks. This leads to one of the episode’s most important debates… This might be the single most important strategic question facing every seed and Series A investor right now. And the panel doesn’t fully agree on the answer. Jason frames the problem: “The quality of clones is only going up. I can think of one investment I’ve made that has had five clones in the first 30 days, including one from a cloud leader. The ability of AI to enable us to clone better stuff faster — Canva is borderline competitive with Gamma and wasn’t when Cliff was on the show. What does seed investing mean when you might see 10 better versions in 30 days?” Rory’s response: “I don’t think you can have a major defensibility at the seed or even frankly the stage we’re investing at. The defensibility theorem emerges at scale. Once you become the anointed winner, once a market coalesces and there’s two or three people, you know, it’s yours to lose.” But Rory pushes back on the idea that this makes seed investing impossible: “You just have to internalize the game you’re in. Awesome team, run fast, be superlative on technology, get your distribution early, and then rely on that. You can’t be anointed the winner up front. Get over it everybody.” Jason’s concern is economic: “Is that okay at 50 post for a seed round? Do the outcomes justify it? If I’ve got to spread $5 million checks around at 50 post, it’s tougher.” Harry asks the critical question: “Are we getting paid for the risk?” He notes that even at the Series B stage, it’s unclear who will win in many categories. Looking at customer support AI companies that have raised Series B rounds: “I got no idea who the winner is in that category and I don’t think anyone does to be honest.” The debate crystallizes around whether you can know enough at the B to justify the valuation: Rory’s view: By the Series B, you can see rank order. “Once the horses are running and once they round the first furlong, you can actually see the rank order of where they’re running in a way you can’t at the early A.” Harry’s counter: Looking at codegen — even with clear leaders like Cursor emerging, you have Codex making incredible ground, Claude Code advancing, and Replit and Lovable coming from different angles. “I think that’s still entirely up for grabs.” The practical implication: This uncertainty means one of two things: Jason’s conclusion: “Maybe you need 40 deals at $5M. That’s $200M for first checks. $200M for reserves. That’s $400M. $100M for fees and backup. I need at least $500M for my little seed fund to make the math work.” Amid all the complexity, the panel crystalizes a simple framework for what actually works in AI investing right now. DataDog crushed earnings, with stock up 23% and $15M+ in AI-native customers. Why? They’re selling to the people making AI, and as those companies grow, DataDog sells more too. Jason: “The AI leaders, the hyperscalers — they’re starting to buy like classic B2B companies. They’re recycling the same people in procurement. So if you’re attached to AI budget and you’re a DataDog era, you’re actually going to have a great 2026.” Rory adds: “DataDog is a core piece of compute infrastructure and these hyperscalers are the most compute-intensive companies that have ever been known. If you’re selling compute stuff, you should be having a great quarter. If you’re selling routers, switches, interconnects, whatever it takes to stand up Stargate — you’re going to be golden.” “Where are you replacing humans for real?” Jason asks. “Where are you going to go in and reduce the headcount that vendor needs by half?” This is the Replit story — Jason deployed 20+ AI agents that generate significant revenue while requiring substantial daily management but far less human headcount than traditional approaches. The key distinction: “Most of the time, ‘replacing humans’ is a story. But when it’s real, when the AI agent is sufficiently autonomous to complete material high-value tasks, that’s when you’re actually part of the team, not just a tool.” “You have a third option,” Jason concedes. “Use AI to massively displace an incumbent and steal all the revenue. In fact, that’s the history of B2B software mostly. I just don’t know how many of our public leaders are in a place to steal their own revenue.” But he’s skeptical this is as compelling as the first two: “There’s like 400 AI CRM startups out there all saying they’re going to eat HubSpot’s and Salesforce’s lunch. That’s not exciting to me as an investment. That’s much less exciting than truly replacing 90% of your GTM team.” If you’re not doing one of these three things, you’re probably not going to see explosive growth. Using AI to make your product better? That’s table stakes now, not a competitive advantage. One of the most tactically useful segments came when Harry shared a founder interaction that frustrated him: the company said they wanted to “run a process” despite Harry offering terms they’d stated they wanted. Harry’s reaction: “I said, listen, if you’re running a process, you’re either optimizing for price or partner selection. I’m giving you a great price today that you said you wanted, which means you’re not optimizing for price. Which is just saying you think you can get better than me. In which case, just tell me straight.” Rory sees both sides: “From the founder’s side, they’re correct. I see more failed financings because they didn’t run a process than because they did.” But then he makes a critical distinction: “What typically happens when people ‘don’t run a process’ is someone comes in, says they’re interested, and the founder shares information serially to someone not yet ready to commit. That’s a mistake. That’s running an accidental process.” Jason has the most nuanced take on optimal strategy: “The best founders cultivate enough interest with enough good VCs that if they hit the number, they just send an email. Harry, I’m thinking about raising around before the end of the year. And Harry could say, I’ll give you a term sheet today. And the right answer is: ‘I love you, Harry. I’m not ready today. I will be ready at the end of the year.'” The key insight: “The optimal way to run it is for everyone already to want to invest for real without games before you open your data room. The best run processes don’t require a data room. Not a traditional one. Only one for diligence.” Rory synthesizes: “The best run processes don’t feel like a process, but they are. If a founder is smartly nurturing relationships, keeping people broadly informed, then tries to time the interest such that when they’re ready to put their hand up, there’s three people who are primed and ready to go — that is perfection itself.” But here’s the brutal caveat: Jason points out that this only works if you have stellar numbers. “You’re either YC, Neo, South Park Commons, got something, get funded — or who the hell is going to find you? You better be hot AI-native with top-quartile venture growth or you ain’t getting funded.” Harry shares a data point that proves this: A company that grew from $400K to $3M ARR (classic enterprise SaaS, 10x growth) had 120 meetings and got one term sheet at $10M on $40M post. That’s 12x revenue for a 10x grower — which five years ago would have generated five term sheets from top firms. “It’s the most binary fundraising environment in our lifetimes,” Jason concludes. “You’re either Captain Obvious getting funded, or you’re not seeing it anywhere.” While DataDog surged 23%, Duolingo crashed 25% in the same week. The contrast illustrates everything about what’s working and what’s not in AI. Jason’s diagnosis: “Duolingo has the ‘wrong’ kind of AI. Duolingo is using AI to make its product better. Hooray. Every single portfolio company at scale should be using AI by this point to make your product better. This is not 2023. You don’t get any kudos for sprinkling AI dust on your product.” Rory pushes back slightly on behalf of consumer apps: “If you’re an infrastructure company, you can co-attach to compute. If you’re a new AI apps company, you are using that compute. But if you’re like Duolingo — preexisting — what you can do is co-adopt the technology.” But Jason sees a bigger problem: “Duolingo took money from Berlitz and all these language schools. Hooray, you did that. Now, where are you going to disrupt humans? This is your job. You already disrupted those humans. Unfortunately, they’re gone. Where’s the next level of human disruption?” Rory makes an interesting point about where the AI opportunity in education actually is: LLM learning is equivalent to one-on-one human tutoring. What AI should enable in education is allowing everyone to get one-on-one learning instead of group-based learning. But there’s no budget in K-12 to give every kid a customized tutor. The market is adults wanting to learn a second language for business who would pay for a one-on-one coach — a niche market. Jason’s framework applies here too: “If you’re not removing humans from the equation, you’re going to be heavily discounted. You’re either getting money from compute or you’re getting money because you’re using AI to replace humans. Otherwise, congratulations on your 14% growth.” One exchange revealed how different the panel’s approaches are to portfolio construction — and why both can work. Harry revealed his team’s meeting load: “With my four investing partners, we have 80 net new companies that we meet in person per week.” Jason’s response: “I would resign. I would give you all my carry back. I sold my companies because I didn’t want to spend my life in meetings. I’ll do one a week, two max.” But Jason’s critique cuts deeper than meeting volume: “When you do 200 deals between your team, you got to meet 500, 600, 700 founders a year. I don’t want to meet 500 founders a year. Unless you’re great, you’re going to blow my mind. But if you’re not, I’m gonna start yawning about 15 minutes into this meeting.” Rory defends the high-volume approach: “Even on an okay deal, you learn nuances about a specific market from the one-on-one that you wouldn’t get from the presentation. The person inside living it every day has a crucial kernel of knowledge that you just can’t access any other way.” But the conversation reveals a deeper truth about fund construction: The Small Fund, High Multiple Approach (Hummingbird-style): The Large Fund, Maintained Ownership Approach (Lightspeed-style): Rory’s key insight: “Both are great outcomes. They’re just different ways to play the game. The interesting thing is both outcomes have great outcomes for the GP. But if you only have $1 to play with as an LP, you want the small fund 10x. If you have to deploy $100M, you have to do the big fund. The high small fund accept the follow-on dilution but make a marvelous return is the compelling product for the marginal dollar.” Speaking of Hummingbird, their Billion to One investment deserves its own section because it represents what’s possible when everything goes right. Hummingbird did their first bio deal in Billion to One and now has an $800M position on the IPO — likely representing an 800x+ return on their initial investment from a sub-$100M fund. Harry marvels: “You want freaking great venture returns? Credit due. Amazing.” But Jason asks the tactical question every seed investor should be asking: “How did they collect the capital as a seed manager to deploy enough to maintain the ownership? I don’t see how I’ll ever own 18% of something at IPO ever again.” The answers are telling: Rory makes the crucial point: “You can accept some dilution and optimize for multiple rather than ownership. If you put in $4M and get diluted from 20% to 12% but it’s a $5B exit, you’re a hero.” Jason counters with what’s exciting about capital efficient outcomes: “Navan at $4.5B, Billion to One at $5B — the power of capital efficiency and running lean delivers superior investor returns despite smaller headline valuations.” The lesson: Small funds generating 10x+ returns by accepting dilution but betting on capital-efficient companies may be the optimal strategy for seed investors who don’t have the deployment capacity of mega-funds. Pulling all these threads together reveals several uncomfortable truths: 1. The Middle Class of Fundable Companies is Gone “It’s the most binary fundraising environment in our lifetimes,” Jason states flatly. The classic SaaS triple-triple-double-double company? A company growing from $400K to $3M ARR would have had five term sheets from good firms. Now: 120 meetings, one term sheet. 2. Most People from the Last Decade Should Step Aside This isn’t ageism — it’s pace of change. “The most folks from the last decade or 15 years are not the right people for the next decade,” Jason argues. “I struggle to even recommend a lot of the CROs and executives I know for roles today. We don’t even need half the VCs we have today for the AI world.” 3. Diversification Matters More, Not Less With increased variance in outcomes and compressed time to clone, the math says diversification is critical. But diversification at seed prices requires massive funds or acceptance of lower ownership. 4. There Are Only Three Ways to Win Attach to compute budgets, replace human headcount, or massively displace incumbents. If you’re not doing one of those three things, you’re probably building a slow-growth SaaS company in a world that doesn’t want those anymore. 5. Capital Efficiency Delivers Superior Returns Billion to One at $5B and Navan at $4.5B generated better investor returns than most $20B+ outcomes because they raised less capital. The lesson: optimize for investor returns, not headline valuations. 6. The Best Fundraises Don’t Feel Like Processes Cultivate relationships over months. Have 3-4 investors ready to commit before you formally raise. Send one email and get multiple term sheets. That’s the optimal path. 7. If You’re Not Excited, You Should Retire Jason’s most important point: “If this isn’t the most exciting time of your lifetime, you’re doing it wrong. This is the first time software has gotten better since the three of us met. If you’re not incredibly excited, retire. No shame in that. Put the rest into NASDAQ — you’re going to make more than most VC funds anyway.” The panel is clear about what’s coming: “This year was AI works. Next year is AI is part of your team.” That transition — from AI as a tool making you more efficient to AI as an actual member of your team with autonomy, knowledge, and capability — is where the revenue explosion happens. Jason’s final thought captures the optimism underlying all the tough talk: “If you’re not incredibly excited right now, if this isn’t one of the most exciting and stressful times simultaneously, you’re missing it. This is a great enormous mega trend. It’s the biggest mega trend maybe since the early days of the internet. Leaning into it is the only sensible thing to do, and playing against it is dumb as rocks.” The old playbook is broken. The new playbook is being written in real-time. And the investors who figure it out — whether through small concentrated funds like Hummingbird or large diversified portfolios like Harry’s approach — will capture the extraordinary returns available in this moment. Everyone else? Maybe it’s time to buy that beach house. On Venture Evolution: “The most folks from the last decade or 15 years are not the right people for the next decade. I genuinely believe it across my ecosystem. I struggle to even recommend a lot of the CROs and executives I know for roles today.” — Jason Lemkin “The pace of evolution is so fast. If you decide what I knew 6 months ago is still useful, you’re probably going to be wrong very quickly. That’s what I find the most stressful about right now.” — Rory O’Driscoll On AI Investment Strategy: “Tools are great when the AI is part of your team for real, not VC talk. The amount of revenue that it’s accessible is so high.” — Jason Lemkin “Sell to the people who are making AI and if they grow, you’ll sell more too.” — Jason Lemkin On Defensibility: “You just can’t take that early first month explosion as seriously as you used to. It’s not as defensible.” — Harry Stebbings “I don’t think you can have a major defensibility at the seed or even frankly the stage we’re investing at. The defensibility theorem emerges at scale.” — Rory O’Driscoll On Market Timing: “It’s easy to be roughly right. It’s very hard to imagine that the AI capex boom doesn’t have a significant correction. But going from that kind of armchair podcast statement to actually being able to make money on it — that’s damn hard.” — Rory O’Driscoll On Fundraising: “The best run processes don’t require a data room. Not a traditional one. Only one for diligence.” — Jason Lemkin “The best run processes don’t feel like a process, but they are.” — Rory O’Driscoll On Current Reality: “It’s the most binary fundraising environment in our lifetimes. You’re either getting funded or you ain’t seeing it anywhere.” — Jason Lemkin On Taking Action: “If this isn’t the most exciting time of your lifetime, you’re doing it wrong. If you’re not incredibly excited, retire. No shame in that. You had a great run. Put the rest into NASDAQ — you’re going to make more than most VC funds anyway.” — Jason Lemkin Listen to the full episode of 20VC x SaaStr on YouTube or your favorite podcast platform.

Title: Crystal Dynamics announces new layoffs, and it's worrying for the next Tomb Raider game

Crystal Dynamics doesn’t seem to be in a good shape. Indeed, yesterday, the studio announced the layoff of just under 30 people on LinkedIn, which is worrying for the upcoming Tomb Raider game. While Tomb Raider fans eagerly await new information about the next title in this franchise, Crystal Dynamics unveiled a rather worrying statement yesterday on LinkedIn: "Today we've made the difficult but necessary decision to reorganize Crystal Dynamics' studios and teams. As a result, we've parted ways with just under 30 team members across various departments and projects as we restructure the company and business for our next generation. Crystal deeply thanks all of those impacted for their incredible talent, hard work, and dedication, which helped shape the studio in so many ways. We are committed to offering our fullest resources and support to you during this transition.” And that's not all, because Crystal Dynamics claimed that these layoffs are essential for the future of the studio as well as for optimizing the development of the next Tomb Raider game. However, this situation may seem alarming to some. Indeed, there have already been layoffs in August at the company, and in October, some further dismissals at Amazon. Thus, it is difficult to imagine that this new game will not be affected by these decisions made by Crystal Dynamics. But it is also possible that its production goes well, and that it could be unveiled before the end of 2025. As a reminder, all we know is that it will be a single-player game and that Unreal Engine 5 will be used. Some rumors mention an open world, which could offer many possibilities to the players.

Title: "Our Democracy" (I'm Sure)

By now, whenever you hear anyone invoke the phrase “saving our democracy,” that should be a signal that they are intent on destroying this republic, and with that, your natural rights to free speech, economic liberty, and public order. What began in 2016 as a simple, high-level plot to take out Donald Trump and squash Trumpism — a grassroots revolt against those very high-level DC insiders —turned sharply in 2017 into a long-running cover-up operation that spawned a multiplying cycle of seditions, treasons, and betrayals of the public — as the insiders desperately tried to evade culpability for each previous act — and finally blossomed into a rolling coup with crypto-Jacobin overtones as the insiders’ useful idiots were recruited to run with the ball of color revolution. For those who can’t quite wrap their minds around this game, a color revolution is the surreptitious overthrow of an elected government by concealed parties. Neocons in the US State Department developed the practice of color revolution on many countries over the years. Mr. Obama added a layer of gnostic Marxists to the personnel mix at State, and these wannabe revolutionaries built a fantastic matrix of NGOs outside State to marshal the useful idiots with jobs and salaries. The NGOs, in turn, were connected to international moneybags, with strange agendas of their own such as the megalomanic climate change crusader Bill Gates and George Soros’s Open Society Foundation, which funds anarchist district attorneys, the defense of election fraud, mass illegal migration, internet censorship, and money-flows into Antifa, the Left’s street fighters. Clusterfuck Nation is a reader-supported publication. Subscribe to this blog on Patreon or right here on Substack! This blog is sponsored this week by Vaulted, an online mobile web app for investing in allocated and deliverable physical gold. To learn more visit: Vaulted.com The motives of these players might appear murky, but at this point they can be boiled down to 1) staying out of jail, and 2) retaining control of their empires. Hillary Clinton, for instance, surely wants to stay out of jail for her RussiaGate caper, and retain the ill-gotten lucre of the Clinton Foundation she lives off. At 95, George Soros himself is probably beyond caring about all this, but his son Alex, 38, carries on, and recently cemented his alliance with the Clinton Foundation by marrying the former Mrs. Anthony Wiener, Huma Abedin, Hillary Clinton’s long-time wing-gal. The Democratic Party plays an increasingly curious part in this rolling coup as all its efforts look evermore insane and self-extinguishing — the bootless government shutdown being the latest exercise. The party can no longer meaningfully represent organized labor — since labor moved to faraway lands — so it attempted to replace that earnest bond with fronting for women and minorities. This has resulted in two problems. 1) women taking over the actual machinery of the party has transformed mere politics into never-ending psychodrama and boosted the amplitude of political dirty-fighting to dangerous new levels; and 2) cultivating minority groups has led to an orgy of race-and-gender hustles that amount to gigantic racketeering operations (i.e., making money dishonestly). All of that sound, fury, and roguery is now dedicated only to staving off the party’s collapse and thwarting Mr. Trump’s attempt to restore something like regular order in public affairs, which the Democratic Party calls “authoritarianism.” Regular order is something that healthy male psychology takes an interest in, since it entails defense of the culture, in this case, Western Civ and its heritage. That implies the uses of strength as opposed to the stratagems of weakness. It must acknowledge and rely on classic virtues such as fortitude, prudence, and a preference for what is — as opposed to wishes and fantasies. Psychodrama dispenses with all that for the sake of emotional gratification, often mis-characterized as empathy or caring. It can transform easily into sadism — as you can see now with the calls for violence and murder against Trump-adjacent persons. Meanwhile, be aware that the cries for “saving our democracy” come from the people opposed to regular order in elections, that is, voter ID, voting on election day only, with results reported out at day’s end, paper ballots and no electronic counting machines, and no mail-in ballots (except for people out of the country on election day). All of these stipulations are observed in other nations of Western Civ, and beyond, even in lands where people go about half-clothed. The current psychodrama, of course, is the latest installment of the Jeffrey Epstein scandal. The Democrats are flogging it with Wile E. Coyote zeal. I suspect it is an Acme booby trap for the ages and it is being carefully laid by Mr. Trump, the Roadrunner, to blow up un the Dems’ faces when all the documents are finally sorted out. Anyway, it has nothing to do with the real-world problems that the US faces, such as runaway financialization of the economy, a broken medical system, mass job layoffs, the collapse of education, surging mental illness, the drug plague, and the sinking middle-class. We’re entering a new phase in the ongoing color revolution, the coup against America, and it’s liable to be the final phase in which all the mystery gets wrung out, the motives are revealed, and the players are correctly sorted and labeled according to their deeds. No new psychodrama will avail to stop what’s coming. I’ll be doing two book events Saturday, Nov 15 in New York’s Capital District to talk up my new novel, Look, I’m Gone. The first: 11:00 a.m., Market Block Books at 290 River in Troy, NY. The second 3:00 p.m. at The Book House of Stuyvesant Plaza, 1475 Western Avenue in Albany, NY. Hope to see you there.

It shall be very, uh, er, clarifying. "Regular Order". I like it. We're attempting to move this country back towards its roots in hard work and moral integrity and the left is accusing us of fascism. Also, your first paragraph summary of what happened to bring color revolution to the US was well-stated. No posts Ready for more?

Title: Stock Futures Slide As Tech Selloff Continues—Bitcoin Slips To Six-Month Low
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2025/11/14/stock-futures-slide-as-tech-selloff-continues-bitcoin-slips-to-six-month-low/
Time Published: 2025-11-14T13:02:37Z
Full Content:
BySiladitya Ray, Forbes Staff andTy Roush, Forbes Staff. Nvidia and Tesla headlined broader gains across tech stocks on Friday afternoon, leading a rebound for major indexes a day after markets posted their worst declines in more than a month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped roughly 100 points (0.2%), while the S&P 500 rose 0.4% and the Nasdaq added 0.7% as of Friday afternoon, after each index fell more than 1% earlier in the day and dropped 1.6%, 1.6% and 2.2% on Thursday, respectively, in their largest single-day losses since October. Stocks recovered on Friday following a widespread rout on Thursday, during which investors dumped AI stocks amid general economic uncertainty, after the U.S. ended the longest government shutdown in history, with added concerns the Federal Reserve may not lower interest rates next month. Markets also appeared to react to the White House announcing that employment and inflation data for October and September would be at least partially released, after previously the data would “likely never” be published, as economists projected inflation to remain high while the labor market likely deteriorated further. Nvidia rose 1.5% to around $189, adding to a 1.6% increase for Tesla, after both megacap stocks slumped 0.4% and 2.4% earlier in the day, respectively. Other stocks turned positive by Friday afternoon, including AMD (up 1.5%), Palantir (1.9%), Broadcom (0.9%), Apple (0.8%), Microsoft (1.1%) and Intel (0.1%), among others, while Amazon (down 0.3%) and Alphabet (0.4%) remained in the negative. UnitedHealth Group headlined losses across the Dow as shares traded down 3%, followed by Nike (2.5%), American Express (1.7%) and Walt Disney (1.7%). The cryptocurrency market was also hit by a selloff, with the price of bitcoin dropping below $96,000 for the first time in six months before paring back earlier losses. The world’s most valuable cryptocurrency is down more than 6% over the past 24 hours, falling to around $96,031 after earlier falling to as low as $94,592, the lowest level for the leading cryptocurrency since May. Ether, the token with the second-largest market cap, dropped to $3,130, down more than 10.3% over the past 24 hours. Other major cryptocurrencies, including XRP, Solana’s SOL and Binance’s BNB, are down 8.8%, 10.5% and 6.2% respectively. Crypto-linked stocks similarly declined, including Strategy (down 3.9%) and Coinbase (1.3%). It appears the broader crypto market is reeling from traders lowering odds of an interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve next month, as key economic data remains delayed, leading to investors pressuring riskier assets, according to Bloomberg. Liquidity has also plummeted: Exchange-traded funds investing in bitcoin reported new outflows of about $870 million on Thursday, the second-largest withdrawal since they were introduced in January 2024, according to CoinGlass

Title: Global Biofertilizers Market to Double in Size by 2030 - Asia-Pacific to Register the Fastest Growth at 13.5% CAGR

Time Published: 2025-11-14T12:38:00Z
Full Content:
November 14, 2025 07:38 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Nov. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Biofertilizers Market - Types, Microorganisms and Applications" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The biofertilizers market is experiencing strong growth, expected to reach US$2.6 billion in 2024 and surpass US$5.1 billion by 2030 with a CAGR of 12.3%. This growth is propelled by expanding organic farming, environmental concerns about chemical fertilizers, and increasing demand for pesticide-free produce. Government incentives, national sustainability programs, and technical advancements in microbial formulation and precision agriculture also contribute to this upward trend. The burgeoning organic food sector, coupled with greater awareness of soil regeneration and sustainable practices like micro-irrigation, is accelerating market expansion, notably in Asia Pacific, Europe, and South America. Regional Market Insights North America, the leading region with a 36.8% market share in 2024, benefits from advanced farming practices, regulatory support, and growing consumer demand for organic produce. The U.S. spearheads regional growth due to USDA programs and precision agriculture, encouraging farmers to adopt biofertilizers for enhanced soil fertility and improved crop resilience. Conversely, Asia Pacific is anticipated to exhibit the fastest growth with a CAGR of 13.5% from 2024 to 2030, driven by population growth, increased food demand, and a shift towards organic farming. India and China lead this trend, bolstered by government subsidies and innovative nutrient management systems. Market Segmentation by Type Nitrogen fixation holds the largest share, contributing to 70.3% of the market in 2024, owing to its effectiveness in boosting soil fertility and crop yields. Biofertilizers like Rhizobium and Azotobacter enhance nutrient absorption, making them preferred solutions for nitrogen-deficient soils. Meanwhile, the phosphate-solubilizing segment is set for rapid growth at a 13.3% CAGR from 2024 to 2030, addressing phosphorus lock-up issues in soils and improving crop quality. Microorganism Type Analysis The Rhizobium segment dominates with a 26.2% share in 2024, owing to its symbiotic nitrogen-fixing capabilities with leguminous crops, reducing synthetic fertilizer reliance and improving yields. In contrast, the Mycorrhiza segment is likely to experience the fastest growth at 13.3% CAGR from 2024 to 2030, due to its role in nutrient absorption and plant resistance enhancement. Application Insights In 2024, seed treatment emerges as the top application, accounting for 61.2% of the market due to its efficacy in boosting seed germination and nutrient uptake. Meanwhile, soil treatment is projected to witness the fastest growth at a 12.8% CAGR from 2024 to 2030, driven by the need to improve soil fertility and agricultural productivity. Market by Crop Type In 2024, cereals and grains command the largest segment with a 46.2% share, driven by high global demand for organic staples and extensive cultivation areas. Alternatively, the oilseeds and pulses segment is expected to grow the fastest at 12.9% CAGR, spurred by rising organic oil demand and government biofertilizer promotion. Report Scope This report provides comprehensive analysis across global and regional markets from 2021-2030, with forecasts from 2024 to 2030.

Title: Tomb Raider developer Crystal Dynamics announces yet another round of layoffs

Time Published: 2025-11-14T10:23:15Z
Full Content:
A "difficult but necessary decision". Tomb Raider developer Crystal Dynamics has announced yet more layoffs at the studio, calling it a "difficult but necessary decision". In a post on LinkedIn, the studio said it has "parted ways" with just under 30 employees. These employees came from a variety of projects and departments within the company, with Crystal Dynamics calling it part of a restructuring "for our next generation". The developer additionally cited the next entry in the Tomb Raider series, which the studio is working on with Amazon, as part of the reason for its decision. "To our players - as the realities of the industry continue to evolve, we've made these painful choices as a way to optimise the continued development of our flagship Tomb Raider game, as well as shaping the rest of the studio to make new games for the future," it wrote. The post thanked those impacted by the layoffs for "their incredible talent, hard work, and dedication, which helped shape the studio in so many ways", adding: "We are committed to offering our fullest resources and support to you during this transition." Closing, Crystal Dynamics said it appreciated support during these changes at the studio, and that it "[looks] forward to sharing the team's amazing new work with the world in the future". This most recent wave of layoffs at the studio is at least the fourth in the last two years. In March, Crystal Dynamics laid off 17 "talented" staff members, again calling it a "difficult decision". In August last year, Amazon Games boss Christoph Hartmann said development on the upcoming Tomb Raider game from Crystal Dynamics and Amazon was "going well".

Good morning. The wave of layoff announcements over the past few weeks is telling us something, most importantly, something that isn’t as easily measured as the number of jobs eliminated. It’s a change in the business environment. We can see this especially in big-company culture, a shift in what is OK and even virtuous to say out loud. Just maybe it’s signaling a new norm for employment and leadership. At its foundation, of course, is AI, regardless of whether companies say so directly. Over the past two weeks. we’ve learned that Amazon will eliminate 14,000 jobs with plans to eliminate more. Target will cut 1,800 corporate jobs, the company’s biggest layoff in a decade. United Parcel Service reported it had eliminated a staggering 48,000 jobs so far this year. Verizon will lay off 15,000. Nestlé said it will cut 16,000 jobs, mostly white-collar, in the next two years. Why all those mega-layoff announcements in just a few weeks? The usual reasons don’t explain it. The economy hasn’t suddenly changed significantly. Companies could conceivably be bracing for a recession, though it’s far from clear when or if that might arrive; the Wall Street Journal’s October survey of economists shows growth increasing next year. The traditional season for general “slimming-down” layoffs is December and January. The obvious explanation is AI. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy had already warned employees what was coming: “In the next few years,” he announced in June, Amazon “will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” The recent announcement emphasized “removing layers.” Target COO Michael Fiddelke (becoming CEO in February) didn’t say “AI,” but he said the company had “too many layers and overlapping work” and would “accelerate technology.” JPMorgan Chase isn’t announcing layoffs but is taking a stance to avoid hiring even as the company expects to grow. The company has “a very strong bias against having the reflexive response to any given need to hire more people,” CFO Jeremy Barnum told analysts recently. “There are definitely productivity tailwinds from AI.” Note the language. It isn’t defensive or apologetic. Just the opposite—it’s direct and confident. Among Fortune 500 CEOs, having fewer employees is becoming a badge of honor. Call the new model Human Capital Lite, or from employees’ perspective, Right Sizing, Left Standing. In January 2024, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, “In my little group chat with my tech CEO friends, there’s this betting pool for the first year when there’s a one-person billion-dollar company—which would have been unimaginable without AI and now will happen.”We’re not there yet, and we may never go there. But we’re getting closer.—Geoff Colvin Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com White House considers reducing tariffs on food imports Following a series of losses to Democrats in midterm elections—whose candidates often highlighted cost-of-living issues—the White House is considering reducing tariffs on various food imports, including beef, bananas, coffee, and fruit. Trump receives BBC apology over January 6 speech The BBC has formally apologized for editing footage of President Trump’s speech on January 6 to make it look like he had urged his supporters to immediately invade the Capitol building. In fact, the edit spliced together remarks from the president’s speech that were far apart from each other and out of context. The BBC is hoping that Trump won’t now sue the corporation for defamation. No silver bullet for New York In the latest Fortune Leadership Next podcast, JLL CEO Christian Ulbrich tells Diane Brady and Kristin Stoller that most global cities are grappling with affordability issues. "New York is a global capital, but it comes at a price,” he said, citing Vienna as a city that’s doing well but weaponizing affordability as a political tool while London is “dark and it’s not lively anymore” because too many wealthy buyers have bought second, third and fourth homes in the city center. AI bubble fear hurts stock markets Stocks markets fell dramatically yesterday—and the selling looks set to continue today, according to the futures markets—led by investors expressing their disapproval over spending on AI. Oracle shares are down almost 30% over the last month as investors flee Larry Ellison’s debt-fuelled pivot to AI. “The Big Short” investor closes investment firm, maintains AI bubble stance Investor Michael Burry, famous for predicting the 2008 housing bubble and dramatized in the film “The Big Short,” closed his investment firm on Wednesday and quickly took to X to continue his warnings about an AI bubble. Burry, who has already bet $1 billion against an AI bubble, explained how companies like Meta and Oracle are understating the depreciation of their AI investments to inflate profits and play down their massive capital expenditure programs. Microsoft and Amazon want restrictions on Nvidia sales to China The two AI hyperscalers have been lobbying for a change in the law that would keep Nvidia’s best chips in the U.S. market and curb its access to Chinese customers. Delta CEO criticizes government shutdown Delta CEO Ed Bastian blasted the U.S. government for expecting employees to work without pay during the government shutdown, which he described as “disruptive both for his business and its customers. “It was completely unnecessary,” Bastian said in conversation with YahooFinance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi, and customers had to “bear the brunt of the dysfunction.” OnlyFans CEO has no middle management at her company OnlyFans CEO Keily Blair decried “that squidgy layer of middle management in the middle” during an appearance at Web Summit in Lisbon on Thursday, arguing that “nobody’s ever had a really good middle manager in my experience.” Instead, at her company, they hire only “incredibly senior talent” and “incredibly hungry junior talent.” S&P 500 futures are down 0.21% this morning. The last session closed down 1.66%. STOXX Europe 600 was down 0.79% in early trading. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 was down 1.18% in early trading. Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 1.77%. China’s CSI 300 was down 1.57%. The South Korea KOSPI was down 3.81%. India’s NIFTY 50 is down 0.45%. Bitcoin was down to $97K.

Our team tests, rates, and reviews more than 1,500 products each year to help you make better buying decisions and get more from technology. Verizon could soon be the latest tech company to announce a mass layoff. The carrier will cut around 15,000 jobs next week, The Wall Street Journal reports. The news arrives amid stiff competition for Verizon; it lost 7,000 postpaid customers in the last quarter, while T-Mobile added 1 million and AT&T gained 405,000. The report also arrives just over a month after Dan Schulman was appointed as the new CEO. The former PayPal CEO had served on Verizon's board for seven years before taking over as the chief executive in early October. "Verizon is at a critical juncture," Schulman said at the time. "We are going to maximize our value propositions, reduce our cost to serve, and optimize our capital allocation to delight our customers, and deliver sustainable long-term growth for our shareholders." Verizon had about 100,000 employees in February, and cutting 15,000 would mark the largest job reduction in the company's history, according to WSJ. While most of the job cuts will come through layoffs, others will result from franchising stores. Around 180–200 stores will be franchised, meaning people working there will no longer be on Verizon's payroll. With the move, Verizon joins the long list of tech companies trimming their workforces significantly this year. Intel announced a reduction of 15% of its workforce in July, and Amazon just cut 14,000 jobs last month. While expense management and restructuring have been cited as reasons by Verizon and Intel, Amazon has pinned the blame on employee culture. Jibin is a tech news writer based out of Ahmedabad, India.

Title: Crystal Dynamics announces third round of layoffs this year, 30 workers affected

Full Content:
Decision made to "optimise the continued development" of Tomb Raider and future projects "as the realities of the industry continue to evolve" Crystal Dynamics has announced a third round of layoffs this year, affecting 30 employees "across various departments and projects." In a post shared on LinkedIn, the developer said it needed to "optimise the continued development of [its] flagship Tomb Raider game" and future projects "as the realities of the industry continue to evolve." Crystal Dynamics' Tomb Raider game was announced in 2022, when it signed a partnership with Amazon Games to publish the title. "Crystal deeply thanks all of those impacted for their incredible talent, hard work, and dedication, which helped shape the studio in so many ways," the studio wrote. "We are committed to offering our fullest resources and support during this transition." It added: "We appreciate the continued support of our players, our colleagues, and our partners during this transition and look forward to sharing the team's amazing new work with the world in the future." In August, Crystal Dynamics announced an unspecified amount of workers were made redundant. It cited "evolving business conditions" for the decision, which was made to ensure the "long-term health of [its] studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market." This came after the first round of layoffs this year in March, which affected 17 employees. At the time, the developer said the reason was to "better align [its] current business and the studio's future success." Crystal Dynamics was also the co-developer of the Perfect Dark reboot with The Initiative. The latter was closed and the game was cancelled as part of larger layoffs at Microsoft. These redundancies affected several divisions at Microsoft Gaming, including King, ZeniMax, Raven Software, Turn 10, and Blizzard. Rare's Everwild was also cancelled. In September 2023, 10 people were laid off at Crystal Dynamics following restructuring at its parent company Embracer.

November 13, 2025 23:57 ET | Source: Rocket Lab Corporation Rocket Lab Corporation Long Beach, CA Long Beach, CA LONG BEACH, Calif., Nov. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a leading launch and space systems company, today announced its two Explorer-class spacecraft for NASA and the University of California Berkeley’s Space Sciences Laboratory have been successfully launched, beginning their journey to Mars to study the Red Planet’s magnetosphere. NASA’s Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers (ESCAPADE) mission was launched by Blue Origin on November 13, from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station at 03:55 p.m. EST. Rocket Lab has successfully established contact with the spacecraft and they are generating power. Now in orbit, the spacecraft will undergo commissioning by Rocket Lab’s spacecraft operations team in the coming days, beginning with early checkouts including orientation stabilization and solar array deployment, followed by commissioning of flight computers, multiple antenna, guidance and navigation sensors and actuators, and the propulsion system leading up to the mission’s first maneuvers. Rocket Lab’s Explorer-class spacecraft platform is a high delta-V, interplanetary member of its advanced satellite family. From contract award to launch, ESCAPADE moved from design to spacecraft completion in just three and a half years – an aggressive timeline for a Mars mission. This was made possible by the Company’s vertically integrated supply chain, which brings the production of solar arrays, reaction wheels, propellant tanks, star trackers, radios, avionics, flight software, and more entirely in-house. “Mars missions have historically been measured in decades and come with price tags in the billions or hundreds of millions. With this mission we’re bringing Mars closer, proving real interplanetary science can be done faster and more cost-effectively to unlock the solar system,” said Sir Peter Beck, Founder and CEO of Rocket Lab. “ESCAPADE is a major first, not just for Rocket Lab, but for commercial interplanetary science. It’s the result of bold goals from NASA and UC Berkeley, enabled by our end-to-end spacecraft capabilities. We’re proud to play a part in this mission and even prouder to know they’re continuing our legacy at the Red Planet.” Rob Lillis, ESCAPADE Principal Investigator and Associate Director for Planetary Science at the UC Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory, says: "As PI, I'm very grateful to have a top-notch joint ops team at UC Berkeley and Rocket Lab taking care of the twin spacecraft out there in space. I'm both elated and relieved to see NASA’s ESCAPADE spacecraft healthy post-launch and looking forward to the next chapter of their journey to help us understand Mars' dynamic space weather environment." Now in orbit, a complex and extended journey begins for Blue and Gold, with trajectory design led by Advanced Space LLC. The alignment between Earth and Mars does not currently allow ESCAPADE to use a traditional direct-to-Mars transfer. Instead, ESCAPADE will launch into a “loiter” (or “Earth-proximity”) orbit that loops around Earth’s Lagrange point 2 (about a million miles from Earth, opposite the Sun) until the next planetary alignment window. Once the planets have reached the ideal alignment in fall 2026, the ESCAPADE spacecraft will use an Earth gravity assist to begin the journey to Mars. Throughout the mission, Rocket Lab and UC Berkeley spacecraft operators will command the spacecraft to conduct deep-space maneuvers, known as trajectory correction maneuvers (TCMs). The TCMs will boost the spacecraft’s energy to reach Mars and provide navigation control to target their unique orbit insertion corridors. The spacecraft are scheduled to arrive at Mars in September 2027. The spacecraft will begin to transition to their first science formation in 2028. ESCAPADE will allow scientists to understand how the solar wind strips ions from Mars’ atmosphere, offering insight into the planet’s atmospheric escape history and space weather environment, and informing future human exploration strategies.

The findings, based on responses from 1,396 professionals, highlight widespread abuse of legal loopholes by global tech firms operating in the country. For most affected employees, the layoff process lacked both legal compliance and humane communication. 72 per cent were informed within two days of their last working day. The rate was especially high at Amazon, Target and Freshworks, exceeding 90 per cent. Only 18 per cent said they received any advance notice of one to three months as mandated by law. According to Blind, many MNCs operating in India’s tech and service sectors have long taken advantage of a gap in the country’s labor framework that excludes IT and managerial staff from the “workmen” category. This allows them to legally bypass mandatory notice periods and government approval under the Industrial Disputes Act (IDA), leaving tens of millions of white-collar professionals outside the scope of labor protections. 37 per cent were informed via Zoom or Teams calls, 23 per cent received impersonal email notifications, and 13 per cent discovered they had been terminated only after their system access was suddenly cut off. Even when sudden layoffs technically breach the spirit of the law, companies frequently use “in lieu of notice” payments to avoid penalties — paying a short-term severance instead of giving advance warning. This loophole enables overnight, American-style layoffs that would otherwise be illegal under Indian labor standards. On Blind, several affected professionals shared how these practices are eroding trust and mental security within India’s tech scene. “It’s a cruel psychological game: keep people anxious, hoping some will quit voluntarily, saving the company money on severance,” wrote an employee from Amazon India. Another user from Samsung pointed to shared resilience, saying, “All I can think of is to become proficient to do something on our own. It could be small, but that ability gives some sense of security.” Published on November 14, 2025 Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies. All rights reserved.

E-commerce giant Amazon cut 660 jobs in Manhattan in October, according to a report by the New York Post citing New York State government records. Amazon confirmed that nine office locations were affected, impacting only corporate employees. The most affected sites were two locations. The 450 W 33rd St offices near Hudson Yards experienced 233 layoffs, and the 424 Fifth Ave. offices at the former Lord & Taylor flagship, acquired by Amazon in 2020 for $1 billion, had 182 layoffs, the report said, citing Monday filings from the state Department of Labour. “I believe the vast majority of these cuts are tech layoffs for Amazon, and NYC was not spared,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives told The Post. “The size of the Amazon cuts remains a head scratcher given the battle for talent and the AI revolution in motion.” The latest development after Amazon confirmed plans to cut nearly 14,000 corporate jobs, just months after Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy highlighted growing use of AI. During Amazon's earnings call on Thursday, Andy Jassy clarified that the layoffs were not due to cost-cutting measures or the adoption of AI. Instead, he said that the employees affected did not align with Amazon's culture. “The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it's not even really AI-driven, not right now at least,” Andy Jassy said, adding that “it really — it's culture.” The layoffs are impacting various departments, including logistics, payments, video games, and cloud computing, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. “The reductions we’re sharing today are a continuation of this work to get even stronger by further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we’re investing in our biggest bets,” Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, said in a blog post last month. Galetti hinted at further job cuts, mentioning Amazon's plan to hire in key areas in 2026. The company reportedly plans to cut approximately 30,000 corporate jobs in the latest round of layoffs, which will constitute about 9% of its global office-based workforce, Reuters reported, citing people familiar with the development. Indicating the reason for job cuts, she said, “Some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well. What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before.” Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.
